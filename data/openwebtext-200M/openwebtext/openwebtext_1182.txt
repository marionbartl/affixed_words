A plethora of data will hit the wires today and no matter what we get , there is month end selling of the USD .
All week CBankers have been trying to verbally influence their own currency and that of the greenback .
Trichet on his pulpit yesterday , preaching that the dollars strength is Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœimportantÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
It will be , but , not this soon !
Policy makers are also sign posting their exit strategy thoughts .
The FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Fischer said yesterday Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œwhen it comes time to tighten monetary policy , my colleagues and I will move with an alacrity that , if needed , will be equal in speed and intensity to that which we pursued monetary accommodationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
His thoughts are backed up by Plosser , who indicated yesterday Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthey recognize the costs that significantly higher inflation and the ensuing loss of credibility will impose on the economy if we fail to act promptly , and perhaps aggressively , when the time comes to do so .
This is verbal confirmation of an exit strategy and a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœbigÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ warning for everyone that has underweight positions in the dollar .
You have been told !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US data was disappointing on all fronts .
Dealers had been expecting a tad more bullish US consumer confidence number , close to a 70 print by some Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœeternalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ optimists .
However , the market was dealt a winded blow with a 53.1 reading , below the high spirits that was seen last month ( 54.1 ) .
The reading was also below market consensus of 57 .
Digging deeper , the sub - category Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fared no better .
The present situation index ( a gauge of consumerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s assessment of current economic conditions ) also retreated to 22.7 vs. 25.4 .
Consumer expectation for economic activity over the next 6 - months managed to slip to 73.3 vs. 73.8 .
And the nail in the coffin was provided by consumers being less optimistic about the current employment situation .
The number who think jobs are Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœhard to getÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ rose to 47 % vs. 44.3 % and those on something and believe jobs are Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœplentifulÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ fell to 3.4 % from 4.3 % .
To most itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a pessimistic report , clearly the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœgo - to variableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ for the Fed , the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœconsumerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , is apprehensive about the medium term outlook and their disposable incomes , if any !
This may not be a strong Q for the holiday retailer if we continue to hoard and live in fear of lack of jobs .
Basically this report collaborates the Fed belief that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlittle income growth and tight credit is curtailing household spending and will slow the pace of the economic recoveryÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
Other data yesterday showed that US house prices continued to improve in July ( - 13.3 % vs. - 15.5 % ) , rising for the 2nd - consecutive month ( seasonally adjusted ) while the y/y decline continued to decelerate ( less bad is good ! ) .
We are currently straddling levels last seen 19 - months ago .
Fundamentally we could be treated to some further improvements over the next few months , but , beware , downside risks are present .
Firstly , are the prices sustainable ?
Analysts will tell you that mortgage re-sets hit a temporary low last month , and we have entered the next wave which is not suppose to peak until mid-2011 .
Secondly , US government incentives for 1st - time buyers are expected to end in Dec !
Finally , the so called shadow inventories ( stock that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s currently not on the market for various reasons ) continue to mount , this piece of data never appears in month supply figures and may lead to further foreclosures .
The basic concept of supply and demand can only pressurize prices even further !
It also worth noting that July house prices rose + 1.2 % , m/ m ( the strongest gain in 2 - months ) .
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.23 % , GBP +0.76 % , CHF +0.30 % and JPY + 0.52 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.51 % and AUD +0.99 % .
The loonie pared some of its initial gains yesterday on the back of commodities struggling and with the Russian Central Bank cutting interest rates .
The perception that the global economy is once again faltering had investors shying away from riskier currencies .
It was believed that the Russian were considering of diversifying their reserves into both AUD and CAD .
However , because of liquidity constraints provided by each currency , Russian governors have denied that they would consider undertaking this procedure .
If they had intended to do this , BOC Governor Carney would have been slightly peeved especially after his speech earlier this week on the strength of the currency .
He continues to Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœtryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and talk down the CADÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s strength .
He said that the Canadian economy is recovering from its 1st recession in 17 - years and warns that the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœpersistent strengthÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in the currency could offset the improvement in growth and keep inflation below its target ( 2 % ) .
Again he reiterated that he would keep O/N rates at historical lows ( +0.25 % ) until June of next year unless Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthe inflation out look changes dramatically Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
After last weeks abysmal retail sales number ( - 0.6 % vs. +0.8 % ) , that will not to be an issue in the medium term !
He remains optimistic and even commented that the economy may grow faster in the 2nd - half of this year than their Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœtwiceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ revised predictions .
Year - to - date the currency has appreciated + 12 % vs. the - 18 % decline that was recorded last year .
The consistently weaker USD has made Canadian products uncompetitive .
This is a global story , not an isolated case .
On the flip side Canada has Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœstuffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ that the rest of the world requires and that commodities .
Carney said that the Cbank is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œnot out of bullets in terms of implementing policyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , but , they are not also Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœtrigger - happyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
For the time being the loonie remains consistently range bound influenced by commodity and global equities .
On USD rallies , investors will want to covet some CAD .
The AUD dollar rose to its highest level in 13 - months on the back of Government reports showing that retail sales advanced for the 1st - time in 3 - months ( +0.9 % vs. - 0.9 % ) .
Fundamental reports continue to convince traders to add to their bets that the RBA will need to raise rates by year end .
With global bourses advancing , investors risk appetite desires higher - yielding asset classes ( 0.8820 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 67.16 up +45 c ) .
Oil remained under pressure yesterday ahead of todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s weekly inventory report .
The data is expected to show that inventories grew by +1 m barrels , w/w , along with gas and distillate fuel inventories .
For now with energy fundamentals remaining unconvincing , it would be a safe bet that the black stuff will remain confined to its $ 10 range of $ 65 - $ 75 .
Already this week there has been a number of factors that aided crude .
Firstly , after last weeks aggressive retreat ( - 8 % ) the market was in need of some sort of correction .
Secondly , crude managed to follow stocks higher on the back of proposed mergers in the tech and health industry .
Finally , the threat of imposing greater sanction on Iran because of its nuclear program has heightened geo-political issues .
Technically oil prices are inflated , they are not supported by market fundamentals , but geo-politics will always keep the black - stuffs prices artificially high .
Do not expect the situation to change anytime soon .
Last week , the surprise jump in US crude and product stocks had raised doubts that prices may have run ahead of demand fundamentals .
But because of Iran , the landscape has changed again .
So we may have to forget fundamentals in the short term again and see politically what develops for guidance .
Gold prices have stayed close to home after the initial surge in the value of the greenback .
However , speculators see an opportunity for the yellow metal to gain with the dollarÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s renewed pressure and heightened geo-political tension in the Middle East boosting the demand for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative investment ( $ 1,001 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,133 up +33 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,736 up + 23 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,183 up + 23 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds eased 2 bp yesterday ( 3.29 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasury prices continue to maintain their bid on pullbacks as investors speculate that the Fed will signal that interest rates will stay at record - low levels for the ‘ foreseeable future ’ as inflation remains subdued .
This has even Bill Gross from PIMCO , the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s largest Bond fund favoring government debt amid deflation concerns .
With US consumer confidence also unexpectedly falling this month , has risk aversion investors seeking yield .
The remainder of the week will be data laden , ending with Sept. Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US job numbers .

ARCHIVES | SEARCH Swayze Spam Posted by WebSecurity @ 08:39 GMT
Within hours of the reported death of movie star Patrick Swayze , our Web Analysts saw the first wave of spam related to the event .
When people search for news of the star 's passing in Google , randomly checking the search results leads them to a " news report " such as this :
Which suddenly displays this :
Oh oh .
Looks like SEO poisoning is being used to hit the user with a rogue AV's " invitation " .
The user then gets shown an image ( not the user 's actual folder , just an image ) like this :
Any mouse action on the image ends with the installer being downloaded .
One interesting detail is the rogue AV website includes a " geoip.php " that seems to be recording the city and country origin of each incoming connection .
Could be for statistics tracking ; it also seems to redirect anyone going back to the website for a second look , so you can't return to the exact same page .
This probably wo n't be the only rogue AV website to take advantage of Swayze 's death to trap users .

More people than you realize have some condition that makes their physical bodies different from the majority .
Many try to hide those differences out of self - consciousness , even though the anomaly might be something you ’d never notice anyway .
Then there are some who celebrate their differences with a clever tattoo that provokes smiles and puts people at ease .
This guy turned his amputated hand into a finger with a giant tattoo of a fingernail !
Hopefully , now no one will ask what happened to him .
Was it the * F* word or the * L* word ?
If it was the second option , take it as a warning against trusting in luck .
What is available to cut below the line ?

After mastectomies due to breast cancer , some women opt not to undergo reconstruction surgery .
Instead of hiding their experience , a few decide to celebrate it by tattooing a beautiful and / or significant design on their chests .

Now he has another — after losing three limbs in Iraq .
He shows off thetattoo that survived , saying , “ This is what they did n’t get . ”

Such a remarkable story could only happen in the midst of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
A young gay Palestinian man , who is in grave , life - threatening danger and cannot return to his home with his Israeli partner , was saved by a stranger who came to his aid – a religious West Bank settler .
The Palestinian , T. , and the Israeli , Doron , became a couple 10 years ago .
Eight years ago , they drafted a marriage agreement between them , but this did not help on the bureaucratic side .
T. is tormented : The State has yet to authorize family unification with Doron .
As a result , he has yet to receive permanent authorization to live in Israel .
He does not have health insurance , a bank account , or a drivers ' license .
Nor can he take out a mortgage .
" We live in a difficult reality , " said Doron on Tuesday .
" It 's been many years that they are checking him out , but he has n't done anything wrong .
T. is a goody - two - shoes . "
Recently , T.'s father , who lives in a West Bank village , fell ill , and his son wanted to go visit him .
Because going to the village is life - threatening for him because residents there are not willing to accept his sexual orientation , a father - son meeting was held outside of the village .
About ten days ago , T. entered the West Bank via one of the checkpoints .
His sick father , accompanied by his mother , waited for him a short distance from the checkpoint .
It was an emotional meeting .
The family members finally got to see one another and T. gave them a sum of money that he had been saving for them .
However , following the brief meeting , all started to go wrong .
T. started making his way back to Israel , but was surprised to discover at the checkpoint that he was not allowed re-entry .
Even though he is currently under consideration for family unification and despite the fact that a yearly temporary residence permit was authorized for him , it was decided not to allow him back into Israel for security considerations .
T. found himself in an impossible situation : he was not allowed to return to his home in Israel , but returning to his parents ' home in the village would put his life in danger .
Left with no other choice , he turned to the only person he knew in the area who could help him – a religious settler who has known him for some years .
The man decided to give asylum to T. even though he knew it would not be looked upon favorably in the settlement .
So , this is how it came to be that T. , a gay Palestinian , has been hiding out in the home of a religious Jewish family in a settlement .
Looking for a reason
" I can't go back to my home in Israel ; I can't enter the village .
The only option left for me is to hide out in a settlement , in a home that accepts me in a humane way , " said T. on Tuesday .
T. has been trying to get back home for the past 10 days : " They took my residence permit .
At first they told me , ' It got lost .
Come back tomorrow and we 'll find it . '
Later they said to me : ' You need to submit a new application for a permit . '
On Tuesday they said : ' Go to the Palestinian District Coordinating Office and ask them for a permit . '
" On Wednesday , they asked me to show up in Palestinian court and to bring a declaration that the permit was lost .
I brought them all the documentation , but every day they say , ' Come back tomorrow . '
I already do n't know where to put myself .
Every day I arrive at the checkpoint , wait many long hours , and when my turn finally comes up , they tell me , ' Go home . '
I 'm lucky that they have agreed to host me in the settlement . "
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has already contacted the defense establishment and other government officials on the issue , but has failed to receive a clear explanation on the reason for T.'s detainment .
Following questions submitted to the defense establishment , T. was summoned for a hearing to establish whether he can be allowed to return to Israel .
" They are intentionally endangering his life , " said Doron on Tuesday .
" A few years ago , he was arrested by the Palestinian Shin Bet , tortured for two weeks , and now my country is causing me terrible anxiety .
He has been in Israel since the age of 13 .
He grew up within the Israeli reality .
Anyone who brings a foreign woman is sorted out with family unification .
But we – who live a normative life and do n't impose any burden on the State , work , pay taxes – experience this suffering all the time .
Ultimately , I ask for a little understanding , a little humanity , a little emotion . "
T. also asked for help : " My situation is unusual .
I can't return to my village .
All I want is to return home . "
The Defense Ministry reported that the reason for barring T.'s entry into Israel is security - based .
World Wrestling Entertainment was saddened to learn of the passing of one of the company 's most popular and charismatic legends , " Captain Lou Albano . "
WWE extends its deepest condolences to the Albano family .
" Captain Lou " was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996 .
He performed for WWE from 1983 to 1996 .
Albano began his storied career with Vincent J. McMahon in the 1960's as one half of " The Sicilians " tag team with his partner , Tony Altimore .
He will be greatly missed by the WWE and his fans .

Second Amendment Sisters , Washington DC Police and the Fear of Empty Holsters
Washington , DC –-( AmmoLand.com ) - What a perfect day for a protest !
The weather was not too cold , not too hot and overcast most of the day but it did not rain on our parade .
I heard estimates throughout the day of numbers in attendance ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 million .
Our local news reported thousands on one channel and tens of thousands on another .
I was told that MSNBC reported 2 million !
We filled up 3 busses leaving from Beaverdam , VA with a total of 146 passengers .
The trip up was uneventful , with only minor traffic delays beginning at Springfield and continuing for the rest of the way into DC .
We disembarked at 6th and Constitution at about 10:30 and the march was already well under way with massive amounts of people filling Pennsylvania Avenue for as far as the eye could see .
We fell in with the marchers and headed for the Capital .
My first encounter with law enforcement was when I left my family sitting on a wall and went around a corner to get a better vantage point for my pictures .
I entered a cordoned off area thru a gate and was taking pictures when a Capital Police Officer approached me and said that he noticed the empty holster I was wearing and asked if I had a weapon to go with it .
I responded that I did n't , since guns were not allowed in DC and he thanked me and left me alone .
My next exchange with LE was at the National Museum of Art ; we had gone inside to use the restrooms and were told that our flags and signs were not allowed in the building and our bags must be inspected .
It was obvious that this was a temporary checkpoint , as the “ guard station ” consisted of two folding tables and no permanent structures .
We carried our things outside and some of us waited there with the bags , signs and flags while the rest of the group went in to the restrooms .
When the others returned , my husband and I went back in and questioned the guard about the policy on the signs .
We were told that the flags were not allowed because they had points on them .
these are the small 4 x 6 inch flags on a stick maybe 12 inches long with a little wooden or plastic tip at the top .
The guard informed us that non-folding umbrellas were not allowed either and that the points could damage the artwork !
Then I asked about the reason for not allowing signs and the response was that they did not want to support any one opinion , so they ban all signs .
We asked about the buttons and stickers on our shirts and were told that they were permissible !
Later on , I walked away from the demonstration to meet a friend and fellow Second Amendment Sister a few blocks away .
While we were standing on the sidewalk taking , two LEOs approached me , one of them , I think a DHS officer , was bending over sideways to look at my holster .
He asked me to come over to where he was so he could “ talk to me ” so our whole group moved closer to him .
He did n't like that much , but he asked me if I had a weapon and I responded that I was aware of the prohibition on guns in DC .
I explained that the holster was a “ silent protest ” to the gun ban in DC .
He then said that he would have to ask me to remove my holster and I got the distinct feeling that he intended to confiscate it .
When my husband pulled the video camera out of the bag , he changed his tone only slightly and asked me again to remove the holster , this time saying that I needed to “ put it away ” .
I asked him why and he told me that it was illegal to have “ gun paraphernalia ” .
I told him that I had no guns , no ammunition and no magazines and that the holster was only a piece of leather and not against the law .
He again insisted that I take the holster off , this time stating that it made it look like I had a gun .
He said that he was pro-gun but still insisted that I need to take the holster off .
I asked him why , since it was not against the law and he said that someone might see it and , thinking I had a gun , shoot me !
One of my companions asked him how that could happen , since guns were not allowed in DC !
As the situation progressed , the other LEO , either DC or Capital police , pulled out his cell phone and took my picture or videotaped portions of the incident .
By then , we were drawing a small crowd of people wondering why these two cops were having this exchange with us .
The crowd was telling the DC cop that they should quit harassing us and he told them that I was a “ threat ” !
In the mean time , my friend from SAS had pulled out her camera and was blatant about recording the encounter .
The DHS officer asked her to [ sic ] get that camera out of his face , which of course she did not comply with .
As time progressed , the officer gradually backed down from demanding to requesting that I remove my holster until he was “ advising ” me that it was in my best interest to comply .
Finally he conceded that he could not make me remove my holster but warned me that if I persisted that I * would * be detained and possibly arrested or shot , that not every LEO was “ pro-gun ” like he was !
I will upload the video when I get it from my friend in SAS .
Until then , stay safe !
Please let us know if you were there and what the experience was like for you !

In the past we have published OpenSolaris vs. Linux Kernel benchmarks and similar articles looking at the performance of Sun's OpenSolaris up against popular Linux distributions .
We have looked at the performance on high - end AMD workstations , but we have never compared the OpenSolaris and Linux performance on netbooks .
Well , not until today .
In this article we have results comparing OpenSolaris 2009.06 and Ubuntu 9.04 on the Dell Inspiron Mini 9 netbook .
The Dell Mini 9 was equipped with an Intel Atom N270 processor running at 1.60 GHz , 1GB of DDR2 - 533MHz system memory , an 8 GB SSD , and Intel 945GME integrated graphics .
Ubuntu 9.04 x86 was running with the Linux 2.6.28 kernel , GNOME 2.26.1 , X Server 1.6.0 , xf86 - video- intel 2.6.3 , Mesa 7.4 , GCC 4.3.3 , and an EXT3 file - system .
OpenSolaris 2009.06 , which was released in June , was based upon Solaris Nevada Build 111b .
The packages included X Server 1.5.3 , Mesa 7.2 , GCC 4.3.2 , xf86 - video - intel 2.4 , and the ZFS file - system .
On the OpenSolaris side it had Java SE 1.6.0_13-b03 as its default OS Java environment and with Ubuntu there was OpenJDK IcedTea6 1.4.1 .
Using the Phoronix Test Suite on both Linux and OpenSolaris we ran a number of different tests .
These tests included Sun's Java 2D Microbenchmark , LAME MP3 encoding , Ogg encoding , LZMA compression , GnuPG , dcraw , Threaded I/ O Tester , GraphicsMagick , BYTE Unix Benchmark , Sudokut , Sunflow Rendering System , and Java SciMark .
During testing both operating systems were left at their defaults as our intentions are to provide an " out of the box " comparison of both Ubuntu 9.04 and OpenSolaris 2009.06 .

We have already covered lists of historic recordings and incredible recordings , so now we are presenting you with a list of eerie recordings .
These all feature themes or sounds that are spooky in one way or another .
If you think we have left something off , be sure to tell us in the comments .
10 Cold Song
Some time ago we featured Klaus Nomi on a bizarre video list .
It seems appropriate that he be included on this list for one particular performance .
Nomi was known for his bizarrely theatrical live performances , heavy make - up , unusual costumes , and a highly stylized signature hairdo which flaunted a receding hairline .
At the age of 39 ( in 1983 ) he became one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS .
As he was slowly dying from the disease he ditched his bizarre plastic tuxedo in favor of baroque clothing and focused on performing opera .
This video is a live recording of Nomi singing “ Cold ” by Purcell .
You can see the toll the disease had taken in his demeanor .
Within a few months of this performance , Nomi was dead .
9 Santa Claus
This is a 1922 recording made by Thomas Edison of Harry E. Humphrey .
It was intended to be sold to owners of Edison ’s phonograph so that their children could have some Christmas joy .
In fact , on the contrary it is rather awful .
If I were a kid , this would put me off Christmas forever .
That laugh !
Ugh !
8 First Recording
On previous lists we had a copy of the “ first recording ” – since then a new earlier recording has come to light .
It has only just been able to be played back because no one realized that it was a recording at all .
In 1860 Frenchman Édouard - Léon Scott de Martinville invented the phonautograph .
It could transcribe sound to a visible medium , but had no means to play back the sound after it was recorded .
The transcriptions , known as phonautograms , were first successfully played back using computer technology in 2008 and you can hear it above – this is the voice of a woman singing “ Au clair de la lune ” and it was recorded 149 years ago .
The recording was initially believed to be a woman but it is now thought that it should be played at a lower speed – in which case it sounds like a man who is suspected to be the inventor himself .
The thing that makes this recording eerie to me is the historicity of it .
At the time , James Buchanan was the US President though later in the year Lincoln won the elections for the Republicans ) , France was governed by Emperor Napoleon III , Italy had become a Kingdom , and Charles Dickens published the first part of Great Expectations .
Regardless of whether the recording is of a woman or a man , they saw things in history that we can on imagine now .
7 Alien Speech
Speaking of the planets , do you believe in Aliens ?
If you do , you will probably find this video fascinating .
The audio comes from the cassini recordings of radio and plasma waves when it made its flyby of Saturn ( more on that shortly ) .
Watch the whole thing through in order to hear the alien speech .
6 Jupiter Sounds
This is not a scene from 2001 – it is a real recording ( well – digital rendition ) of the radiowaves emitted by the planet Jupiter .
From the video :
“ The complex interactions of charged electromagnetic particles from the solar wind , planetary magnetosphere etc. create vibration ‘ soundscapes ’ .
The winds of Jupiter are a thousand metres per second relative to the rotating interior .
Jupiter ’s magnetic field is four thousand times stronger than Earth ’s , and is tipped by 11° degrees of axis spin .
This causes the magnetic field to wobble , which has a profound effect on trapped electronically charged particles .
This plasma of charged particles is accelerated beyond the magnetosphere of Jupiter to speeds of tens of thousands of kilometres per second .
It is these magnetic particle vibrations which generate some of the sound you hear on this recording . ”
This is undoubtedly an eerie sound .
If you find this interesting , you can also listen to the sounds of Earth , Saturn , Neptune , and Uranus , and even a black hole .
5 Pistol Poem
Brion Gysin was a great friend of the beat generation author William Burroughs .
He was also involved in much experimentation with audio , the written word , and visual poetry .
In 1960 he recorded his “ Pistol Poem ” at the BBC studios in London as the BBC had comissioned him to produce some work for broadcast .
The recording engineer almost left the recording session because he said he could feel evil coming from the “ poem ” .
It was certainly unlike anything heard up to that time .
The clip here is the entire “ poem ” and it involves inter - spliced audio samples with gunshots .
You have to agree – this is a scary sounding poem .
4 The Great Beast
Aleister Crowley was an English occultist , writer , mountaineer , poet , yogi , and possible spy .
He was an influential member of occult organizations , including the Golden Dawn , the A?A? , and Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , and is known today for his magical writings , especially The Book of the Law , the central sacred text of Thelema .
He gained notoriety during his lifetime , and was denounced in the popular press of the day as “ The wickedest man in the world . ”
The recording above is an incredibly rare one – the speaker is Crowley and he is reading from some of his magickal [ sic ] writings .
3 December 26th Earthquake
When the sea floor off the coast of Sumatra split on the morning of December 26 , 2004 , it took days to measure the full extent of the rupture .
Recently , researchers at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory analyzed recordings of the underwater sound produced by the magnitude 9.3 earthquake .
This recording is the sound of the earthquake as it happened .

During the late 1950 ’s and early 1960 ’s , the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union was hot .
People around the world watched and listened .
Some , most notably amateur radio operators , listened more closely than others .
And of these , a pair of young brothers from Italy , Achille and Giovanni Judica - Cordiglia , reigned supreme .
The brothers used home - made equipment to listen in on the Soviet launches .
They recorded the heartbeat of the dog Laika who was launched in the one way Sputnik 2 voyage .
But then , in 1961 , they recorded something eerie .
It was the sound of a woman who appeared to be a woman who may have been involved in testing of the ability for humans to cope with space .
The audio ( in Russian ) says : “ Is n’t this dangerous ?
Talk to me !
Our transmission begins now .
I feel hot .
I can see a flame .
Am I going to crash ?
Yes .
I feel hot , I will re-enter … ” The audio stopped at that point .
1 911 Call on 9/11
This is a phone call to 911 from the 105th floor of the World Trade Center building 2 .
I will let the audio clip speak for itself .
The last few seconds of the call are extremely disturbing .

The field of Human Resources ( HR ) is all about people .
HR workers are responsible for the well - being of a company ’s employees as well as the growth of the company itself .
Finding a balance between employee satisfaction and meeting corporate goals can be difficult , but if that sounds like rewarding work to you then you may have just ...
Much time has passed since we started to work on the custom allocation framework with Paul Pedriana .
The core of the solution ( FastAllocBase class , bug # 20422 ) was landed into the trunk half year ago .
After that check in we started to work on JavaScriptCore class inheritances , because every class which is instantiated by operator new needs to be inherited from FastAllocBase .
Now , after that half year , almost every necessary class in JavaScriptCore is inherited from FastAllocBase .
These changes made the enabling of TCmalloc on Qt- related WebKit ports possible .

I 'll talk about the memory costs in another post . :-)
With bungling financiers and a brooding and bewildered prime minister , the British do not have much to feel superior about .
Yet in these dark days when all sources of consolation seem gone , at least the Polanski affair allows us to enjoy our traditional pleasure of patronising the French .
Poor France .
What is there left to say about that unfortunate country ?
It destroys the feudal order in the Revolution only to replace an aristocracy of nobles with an aristocracy of celebrities .
The notion that Polanski – an artist !
– could be arrested for molesting 13 - year old Samantha Gailey turned the brain of its foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , as soft as Camembert .
" It 's a bit sinister , this business , " he said , as he contemplated the lese - majesty .
" A man of such talent recognised throughout the world …
All this is not nice . "
A host of auteurs , led by Constantin Costa - Gavras , director of the Cinémathèque Française , implied that the Zurich Film Festival was the equivalent of a medieval cathedral or United Nations General Assembly , a privileged space where the law 's writ did not run .
" It seems inadmissible that an international cultural evening , paying homage to one of the greatest contemporary film - makers , is used by police to apprehend him , " the directors said as they decried the sacrilege .
Kouchner was right on one point : the scandal from 1977 is " not nice " .
Gailey told a grand jury how Polanksi groomed her by saying he could get her into Vogue .
He offered her champagne and Quaalude , a sedative which induces trances , raped and sodomised her .
She kept saying she wanted to go home , and at one point feigned an asthma attack to get away from him .
Asked why she did not struggle further , she replied : " Because I was afraid of him . "
Polanski's parting words were : " Do n't tell your mother about this and do n't tell your boyfriend either .
This is our secret . "
He cut a deal , and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful sex with a child .
Then he fled to Europe to escape sentence , where he promptly began walking out with Nastassja Kinski , then aged 15 .
In an interview with Martin Amis , he said if he was a murderer the press and police would n't be so obsessed by him .
" But … fucking , you see , and the young girls .
Judges want to fuck young girls .
Juries want to fuck young girls – everyone wants to fuck young girls ! "
I think it is fair to say that Mr Polanksi did not go for the older woman .
Liberal Hollywood did not mind , and watching it abandon feminism last week , as Whoopi Goldberg declared that Polanski was not guilty of " rape - rape " , was a further joy , for it allowed us to patronise Americans as well .
Before we get too smug , however , consider that only one jurisdiction threw money at a man who had pleaded guilty to abusing a girl , and it was not the French or American legal system or even the Iranian or Saudi legal system .
Inevitably , the task of rewarding Polanski fell to London judges , who have made the slogan " English justice " an oxymoron the world over .
In 2002 , Vanity Fair ran a long piece on the many writers and artists who have graced the tables of Elaine 's restaurant on New York 's Upper East Side .
Lewis Lapham , an American author , recalled that , although Elaine 's regulars were hard to impress , there had been a sharp intake of breath when Polanski stopped by shortly after the death of his wife , the actress Sharon Tate , a victim of Charles Manson 's death cult .
He passed the time , they claimed , by trying to grope a beautiful Scandinavian woman in Lapham 's company .
Polanski denied the accusation .
Like Russian oligarchs and Saudi Arabian petro-billionaires , Polanski wanted to sue in plaintiff - friendly England , rather than in France , where his citizenship protected him from extradition .
Yet how could he ?
As soon as he came to the high court to reject the allegation , the police would have arrested and deported him .
More to the point , libel is meant to protect men and women of good character from having their reputations besmirched .
As a fugitive paedophile , Polanski had no good name to besmirch , particularly when the alleged besmirching consisted of the accusation that he was a groper .
But London is not known as " a town called Sue " for nothing , and in a ruling which is still shocking to read , the Law Lords protected Polanski from arrest by allowing him to testify via a video link from France as they upheld the reputations of sexual predators .
Samantha Gailey was now a middle - aged , married woman and wanted the matter forgotten .
But instead , the law lords held that to deny a fugitive the right to sue for libel was the equivalent of saying that he was an outlaw and it was legitimate to torture him .
It was nothing of the sort .
To allow a fugitive from a child abuse conviction the right to sue for libel is the equivalent of saying that molesting children is a trivial offence that does not blacken a man 's character .
When the case came to court , Mr Justice Eady refused to allow Vanity Fair to give the jury the full details of the 1977 attack .
It could not therefore draw parallels between Polanski's offer to Samantha Gailey to get her into Vogue and Lapham 's allegation that he had told the beautiful Scandinavian that he could make " a new Sharon Tate of her " .
The magazine 's dazed New York lawyers then heard Eady instruct the jurors that they were not there " to judge Mr Polanski 's personal lifestyle " because the libel court was not " a court of morals " .
Of all the asinine interventions made by the English establishment in the Polanski affair , this was the worst .
For when you are considering whether a man would make a pass at a woman shortly after his wife 's funeral , his morals and lifestyle are precisely what you must examine .
Forbidden from doing so , the jury found for Polanski , and Eady sent him a cheque for £ 50,000 .
Tories claim that Britain has a " liberal judiciary " but in two respects our judges are reactionaries .
They will not stand up for freedom of expression , and they will not defend the rights of women or , as the Polanski case shows , the rights of girls either .
Danny O'Brien sez ,
In the US , the movie and TV industry tried to get mandatory DRM into digital TV receivers by pressuring regulators and standards groups to enforce a " broadcast flag " , a nonsensical " anti-copying " bit that would never have stopped piracy , but would have given the copyright industry a veto over new digital video technology .
Now they 're trying the same tactic in the UK .
The BBC has written to Ofcom telling them rightsholders want DRM , and asking them if they can implement a crazy scheme to require it .
Ofcom is taking responses to this plan UNTIL TOMORROW — if you do n't want a broadcast flag in your country , read the proposal , and write to Ofcom !
The details include :
1 ) Taking the TV metadata in digital TV signals ( which include TV listings ) , lightly scrambling it — and then demanding that any tech manufacturer who wants to unscramble it sign a contract with the BBC .
[ Ed : it 's worse than this — it 's not just TV listings , it 's the instructions for decoding the video streams , without which they can't be viewed .
In other words , the BBC , which is prohibited from encrypting its TV signal , wants to encrypt its TV signal ]
2 ) The contract itself requires the manufacturers to implement DRM .
3 ) Profit .
The only people will be affected will be companies and individuals who want to sell consumers settop boxes that do what * they * want , not rightsholders .
That includes open source developers like the MythTV project , who 'll never be able to get a license , because there 's no -one to sign , and DRM demands that software and hardware be locked down and unalterable by end -users .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The battle over health care reform reached another milestone Thursday as top House Democrats unveiled sweeping legislation that includes a highly controversial public health insurance option .
The nearly 2,000 - page bill -- a combination of three versions passed by House committees -- would cost $ 894 billion over 10 years to extend insurance coverage to 36 million uncovered Americans , according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
However , the bill 's total cost , including Medicare changes , is expected to be higher and could push the price tag over $ 1 trillion , according to an initial CNN analysis .
The bill guarantees that 96 percent of Americans have coverage , Pelosi stated .
The claim is based on an analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office .
Among other things , the bill would subsidize insurance for poorer Americans and create health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to purchase coverage .
It would also cap annual out - of - pocket expenses and prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions .
Pelosi's office said the bill would cut the federal deficit by roughly $ 30 billion over the next decade .
The measure is financed through a combination of a tax surcharge on wealthy Americans and spending constraints in Medicare and Medicaid .
Specifically , individuals with annual incomes over $ 500,000 , as well as families earning more than $ 1 million , would face a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge .
Medicare expenditures would be cut by 1.3 percent annually .
" Today , we are ... laying the foundation for a brighter future for generations to come , " Pelosi said on Capitol Hill .
" For Americans struggling with the cost of health care , this is an urgently needed bill , " said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Maryland .
" This is an idea whose time has come . "
President Obama praised House Democrats for forging " a strong consensus that represents a historic step forward . "
Republicans tore into the bill , characterizing it as a series of tax increases and new regulations that would destroy jobs while doing little to stop spiraling health care costs .
" This really is a government takeover of health care in America , " said Rep. Mike Pence , R - Indiana .
" It appears for all of the world like a massive government - run insurance plan paid for with a freight train of mandates and taxes and bureaucracy . "
Critics argue that the Democrats ' $ 894 billion price tag excludes the cost associated with closing the Medicare " donut hole " prescription drug coverage gap .
The donut hole refers to some drug costs left uncovered by Medicare before catastrophic coverage kicks in .
Pelosi highlighted plans to close the gap while discussing the bill Thursday .
Under the public option in the House plan , health care providers would be allowed to negotiate reimbursement rates with the federal government , according to Democratic leadership aides .
Pelosi and other liberal Democrats had argued for a more " robust " public option that ties reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals to Medicare rates plus a 5 percent increase .
Several Democrats representing rural areas , however , complained that doctors and hospitals in their districts would be shortchanged under such a formula .
The Democratic leadership " pushed as hard as they could " for the robust option but could n't win majority support for it , said liberal New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler .
" There is no point crying over spilt milk . "
The House bill differs from legislation now being considered by the Senate in a number of critical ways .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , also favors a public option but would allow individual states to opt out of the plan .
Reid would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives ; the House bill does not include such a measure .
A bill recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee does not include a tax surcharge on the wealthy but would instead impose a new tax on high - end health care policies , dubbed " Cadillac plans " by critics .
A large number of House Democrats are adamantly opposed to taxing such policies , arguing that such a move would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous benefits .
Individuals under the $ 829 billion Senate Finance Committee plan would be required to purchase health insurance coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 .
The House bill imposes a more stringent fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income .
Both versions include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans .
The Senate Finance Committee bill would require large companies to contribute to the health care costs of lower income workers if those workers receive a government subsidy for insurance .
The House legislation would require larger companies to provide employee insurance for everyone or pay a penalty of up to 8 percent of total revenue .
Democratic leaders in both chambers agree on establishing nonprofit health care cooperatives and stripping insurance companies of an antitrust exemption that has been in place since the end of World War II .
Moderate House Democrats , whose votes are needed to pass the bill , appeared to be cautiously optimistic .
They did n't , however , offer any definitive judgments .
" I 'm not leaning one way or the other right now , but I just have to get into the bill and read it for myself , " said Rep. Baron Hill , D - Indiana .
" I 'm hoping to be able to vote for it . "
The House Democratic leadership posted the bill online Thursday and agreed to give members at least 72 hours to read it before a vote .
Under that timetable , the full House could begin debating the bill next week .
Any bill passed by the House of Representatives will eventually have to be merged with legislation passed by the Senate .
Both chambers would then have to pass a revised measure before sending it to Obama to be signed into law .
One thorny issue remaining to be resolved among House Democrats is the final abortion language in the bill .
Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Michigan , has been pushing leaders to add stronger language prohibiting the use of federal money to pay for abortions under new health care reforms .
Stupak has vowed that if he is n't allowed a vote on the issue , a group of 40 anti-abortion Democrats will work to block the bill from getting to the House floor .
Leadership aides admit that they need to find compromise wording on abortion but say they are confident the issue will be resolved by the time the bill gets to the floor .

As far as I ’m concerned , Joe Lieberman became a waste of breath the day he stood against the very same party that nominated and paid for him to run for Vice President and endorsed John McCain over Barack Obama .
Not just endorsed , actually … he even advised him .
I ’m certain he knows this .
I ’m even more certain he does n’t care , because he knows just like we do that his keepers in the securities and health insurance industries are patting him on the head and saying “ Good Joe ” for selling out his constituents in the state he claims to represent .
The fact that people are dying in Neocon Joe ’s state does n’t really bother him so much , nor does the fact of people going bankrupt or without basic medicine or doctor visits , because you know , he has the money , honey .
While 68 % of the voters in his state support inclusion of a public option in the health care reform bill , that fact carries no weight with him , because hey — he ’s got Dr. Donald Palmisano , former AMA head and chief killer opponent of the Clinton health care bill thanking him for his service to the industry tonight .
Palmisano is the same guy who heads up the Coalition to Protect Patients ’
Rights , the astroturf firm managed by the PR firm who handled the tobacco industry ’s needs a few years back when health care reform was killed in committee .
In other words , and listen to me carefully here because I am not going to be polite , or politically correct about it —
Joe Lieberman is a murdering whore who takes lobbyists ’ money to watch people die .
Here ’s the deal .
We can let him sell our health for 30 pieces of silver , or we can fight back .
I vote for fighting , and so does J , whose mother suffers from lupus and has to fight every single day for the most basic healthcare .
J is angry .
So am I .
He proposes a filibuster of Lieberman .
Here ’s how it goes :
Upon completion of this letter , on the evening of October 27 , 2009 , I will begin my own filibuster of Senator Lieberman .
I will continue to send emails and call his office in DC relentlessly .
I encourage you to do the same .
Now , on his website Mr. Lieberman reminds us that he can only respond to citizens of Connecticut , due to the volume of message he receives .
That ’s okay , because I ’m not looking for a response .
That is n’t what a filibuster is about , is it ?
You clearly do n’t want to hear us .
Well , we do n’t want to hear you .
Despite the suggestion of Senator Lieberman , I will not take this up with my own Senators , because they are n’t the ones threatening to screw this up .
Got that ?
We email , fax , call , email , fax , call , email , fax , call and call and fax and email .
Here ’s what J is sending :
“ FILIBUSTER
YOU ARE LETTING MY MOTHER DIE
YOU ARE LETTING MY MOTHER DIE
[ snip ]
YOU ARE LETTING MY MOTHER DIE
YOU ARE LETTING MY MOTHER DIE
YOU ARE LETTING MY MOTHER DIE ”
Enough is enough .
It is one thing entirely to allow an up or down vote and vote against the bill .
That , I expect .
What I DO NOT expect is that Joe Lieberman , traitor to his own party who was allowed to come back AND maintain his chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee should be allowed to stab me in the back without a price attached .
I will not send J ’s message .
Mine will be this one , written in my own handwriting , which I will fax to him over , and over , and over , and which I will send via snailmail to him over and over and over and over until he gets a CLUE about who he really represents .
Got it Joe ?
Good .
Now every one of you , consider doing the same thing .
Here ’s the addresses and phone numbers you need .
( 202 ) 224-4041 – Remember , we , the taxpayers pay his damn bill .
Here ’s the snail mail address .
He does n’t want us to send snail mail .

Some random anonymous person got posted over at Daily Dish who critiqued my column on the top things you think about Iran that are not true .
This person pretended to refute my column , but as is typical in propaganda , he really only harped on a few minor details and said nothing about the column ’s larger point .
The source of some of my statistics was Globalfirepower.com .
The poster at DD maintains that the estimate for Iran of the annual military budget is out of date and that it should be “ a little over $ 7 bn. per annum ” instead of “ a little over $ 6 bn . ”
But my point was comparative , to countries like Norway and Singapore , who also likely increased expenditures over time .
Given that the true US expenditure on things military is about $ 1,000,000,000,000 ( one trillion ) a year , I think we may conclude that a difference of a billion is n’t fatal to my argument .
Besides which , these comparative estimates are always slightly out of date and potentially misleading .
Was the poster ’s estimate of $ 7.4 bn. calculated in terms of purchasing power parity ?
What was it in riyals ?
Given that Iran had 30 % inflation last year , anything calculated in riyals would be worth substantially less this year in real terms than last .
The individual argues that military expenditure as a percentage of GDP is more telling than a per capita figure .
But actually both ways of figuring have drawbacks .
Figuring expenditures per GDP means that poor countries look more militaristic than they really are and rich countries look pacifist when they are anything but .
The CIA listing of countries by military expenditure as a percentage of GDP puts powerhouses like Oman , Eritrea , Burundi , and the Maldives at the top of the world list .
The US , which spends more on the military than the next 40 countries combined , comes in 27th on this list behind the countries just mentioned .
Of what use is that ?
Does n’t it just tell us that many of the countries at the top of this list are poor and if they buy so much as a rusty artillery piece , it is a big part of their income ?
And by the way , if we figure it this way , Iran is 67 in the world .
While the poster puts that between India and Vietnam , it is also between the Congo and Portugal .
My original point , is that a country that spends $ 6 or $ 7 bn a year on military affairs does n’t amount to much of a military threat to the US , is not damaged by this rather silly argument .
The poster also points to the sheer size of Iran ’s army and reserves , which globalfirepower.com puts at 875,000 .
But it estimates Israel ’s active military and reserves at about 600,000 , and if we wanted to pull a Jonah Golberg and make a bet on which of the two would win if they went to war in 2009 I ’d put my whole life savings on Israel ’s 600,000 versus Iran ’s mangy 875,000 .
Iraq was also puffed up by American hawks as having had a “ million - man army , ” but I think we all saw in 1991 and 2003 what that really amounted to .
Demonizing and building up as threats to the US small third world countries like Cuba , Grenada , Libya , Iraq , Venezuela , and Iran has been a cottage industry since the fall of the Soviet Union and the adoption by the Chinese of the Capitalist Road deprived hawks of any credible great - power rivalry with which to scare Americans into allowing themselves to be fleeced by the military - industrial complex .
It is natural that I should be attacked for puncturing the illusion of menace that the American Spartans ( slogan : live poverty - stricken in barracks but own Big Spears ) want to project about Iran .
When Andrew Sullivan first linked to my post , he asked what the comparison would be to Israel .
First of all , Iran ranks much higher on the Global Peace Index than does Israel .
Then , here are some comparative statistics as between Iran and Israel , in answer to the question .
But note that the comparisons are misleading .
Israel has 1220 aircraft and Iran has 84 .
But Iran ’s include a lot of things like old F - 4 Phantoms from Nixon in the 1970s whereas Israel ’s are state of the art .
And , while Israel ’s military budget is now estimated at a little over $ 13 bn.
annually , it should be noted that over $ 2 bn .
of that is extracted from us Americans and handed over directly with no oversight to Tel Aviv every year , so it is n’t exactly all Israel ’s money ( and of course these are only the official figures , ignoring a lot of informal tariff and other tax breaks and transfers of resources ) .
Israel ’s massive nuclear weapons industry is not counted in the $ 13 bn .
Again , the figures for what they are worth are from Globalfirepower.com .
You ’ll have to scroll down because somehow my table formatting is making an unsightly gap between this text and the table , below .
Population Israel : 7.2 mn. Iran : 70 mn .
Wars launched on neighbors : Israel : 1956 , 1967 , 1982 , 2006 , 2008 - 9 Iran : 0 Nuclear Warheads Israel : ~200 Iran : 0 Military Budgets : Israel : $ 13.4 bn. Iran : $ 7.4 bn .

Vicarious participation in a contest had a measurable effect on the physiology of men in a study conducted at Duke and the University of Michigan .
Credit : Duke University
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Young men who voted for Republican John McCain or Libertarian candidate Robert Barr in the 2008 presidential election suffered an immediate drop in testosterone when the election results were announced , according to a study by researchers at Duke University and the University of Michigan .
In contrast , men who voted for the winner , Democrat Barack Obama , had stable testosterone levels immediately after the outcome .
Female study participants showed no significant change in their testosterone levels before and after the returns came in .
The men who participated in the study would normally show a slight night - time drop in testosterone levels anyway .
But on this night , they showed a dramatic divergence : The Obama voters ' levels did n't fall as they should , and the McCain and Barr voters lost more than would have been expected .
" This is a pretty powerful result , " said Duke neuroscientist Kevin LaBar .
" Voters are physiologically affected by having their candidate win or lose an election . "
In a post-election questionnaire , the McCain and Barr backers were feeling significantly more unhappy , submissive , unpleasant and controlled than the Obama voters .
The findings mirror what other studies have found in men who participate directly in an interpersonal contest -- the winner gets a boost of testosterone , while the loser 's testosterone drops .
Testosterone is a steroid hormone manufactured by the testes that is linked to aggression , risk - taking and responses to threats .
Women have it too but in much lesser amounts and originating from different sources ( their ovaries and adrenal glands ) , which makes them less likely to experience rapid testosterone changes following victory or defeat .
Researchers in Durham and Ann Arbor had 183 men and women chew a piece of gum and then spit into a sample tube at 8 p.m. as the polls closed on Nov. 4 , 2008 .
When the election results were announced at about 11:30 p.m. , the subjects provided a second sample , and then two more at 20 - minute intervals .
Those spit samples were then analyzed for concentrations of testosterone and some related stress hormones .
It would appear that even vicarious participation in such a " macro- scale dominance competition " is enough to change hormone levels , said Duke post - doctoral researcher Steven Stanton , who is the first author on a paper appearing in PLOS One on Wednesday .
" Voters participate in elections both directly by casting their ballots , and vicariously because they do n't personally win or lose the election , " Stanton said .
" This makes democratic political elections highly unique dominance contests . "
Stanton said the scientific consensus suggests the testosterone response to fighting and competition in males affects their future behavior in a beneficial way .
The loser chills out a bit so he does n't continue to press his case and perhaps become injured .
In contrast , the winner may be motivated to pursue further gains in social status .
" The research on this extends beyond humans and other primates , " Stanton said .
The study also looked at levels of cortisol in the spit samples , a stress hormone behind the " fight or flight " response , and will discuss those findings in a forthcoming paper .
The college - aged men involved in this study would generally have more testosterone than older men , so perhaps the study provided a better opportunity to see the dominance response at work , LaBar said .
" It would be interesting to see how this shakes out in older men . "
Hormonal shifts from vicarious competition are also likely to occur around hotly contested collegiate football and basketball contests , the researchers note .
To find out , they 're going to be repeating this kind of study on Duke and University of North Carolina basketball fans during one of their games this winter .
" They 'll spit before the game and spit after the game , and we 'll just see , " LaBar said .
" What a perfect place to study this , " said Stanton .

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2009 September 18
Explanation :
Get out your red / blue glasses and check out this close - up of spacesuited NASA astronaut John Olivas outside the International Space Station .
Carefully constructed from two photographs ( ISS020 - E- 038481 , ISS02-0E - 038482 ) taken during space shuttle orbiter Discovery 's latest visit to the orbiting outpost , the 3D anaglyph creates the compelling illusion that you can actually reach out and take his gloved hand .
The photographer , fellow spacewalker ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang , along with ISS structures and planet Earth 's horizon , are reflected in Olivas ' helmet visor .
Last Friday , the two returned to Earth along with the rest of Discovery 's crew , landing at Edwards Air Force base in California .
So the All - Star game has come and gone , which had its moments and its letdowns .
I will be posting some pictures up of the game in a while .
With the All - Star game in St. Louis , we really start to hear more of the national media acknowledging that The Machine is the best player in the world right now .
As he goes into his 9th season , we are hearing less and less comparisons with current players , and more and more comparisons with the best in the Hall of Fame .
This year he ’s helped his cause , posting some fantastic numbers in just the first half .
On pace for 57 HRs and 155 RBIs , he ’s reaching base an astonishing 45.6 % of the time , and he ’s slugging .723 .
To put that in perspective , Alex Rodriguez has never had a season close to these numbers , his best effort getting him .422/.645 in 2007 .
In fact , when you see the treatment that Pujols has been receiving , it ’s reminiscent of the true villain of baseball , B*rry B*nds .
So , I broke down the numbers in two categories to gage where Pujols may end up in the history books .
HRs
To really get a true idea on how many HRs these guys are hitting , I ’ve decided to add the ABs and walks together and subtract the intentional walks .
I subtracted intentional walks because a player has no chance to put the ball in play .
For simplicity , I will still refer to this stat as ABs .
Albert Pujols hits a HR every 16.1 ABs compared to B*nds ’ 16.27 .
Mark McGwire was the best I ’ve found , getting a HR in every 12.87 ABs .
As far as current players with over 5 seasons , Alex Rodriguez is the only one better than Pujols in this regard with a HR every 15.94 ABs ( Thome was 16.51 , Manny was 16.74 ) .
The implications ?
Well , considering that Pujols hits a HR as much as the current H*me Run King , and hits four more HRs than the Hank Aaron per every 162 games , it really just depends on his longevity .
Even if he produces just 32 HRs each year ( his lowest total to date and coincidentally the amount he has this year at the All - Star Break ) , he will break the HR record at age 41 .
B*rry broke the record ( and hit his 762nd ) at age 42 .
Hank hit his 755th at age 42 also .
However , Pujols has emerged this year as a guy who can virtually be penned in for 45 dingers .
He averaged this pace from 2003 - 2007 before he was bogged down by a few injuries that took some of his time and his power .
If he were to achieve this lofty 45 HR estimate , he would break the current rec*rd at 38 .
So where do you draw the line ?
Let ’s just say if he is lucky enough to have Bill James ’ “ perfect career ” without interruption , he could hit 1,000 home runs at age 43 at a hypothetical pace of 45 home runs per year ( needless to say that is a very large request ) .
IBBs
Pujols has almost matched his season high in IBB this year with 34 ( he had 32 last year ) .
If managers were allowed a mulligan , he ’d have well over 40 .
Albert has 4 more IBBs at the break than McGw *re had in the entire 1998 season when he hit 70 HRs .
Since an Intentional Walk is typically decided at the beginning of an at - bat and is executed properly virtually 100 % of the time , I ’m including all plate appearances when I calculate the IBBs / PA .
Albert gets passed every 32.88 PAs in his career ( every 12 PAs this year ) , compared to B*nds 18.32 career ( and 5.14 PAs in 2004 ) , and McGwire every 51 PAs .
How could intentional passes affect Pujols ’ potential for the HR chase ?
In 2004 , B*nds had 116 fewer ABs than his average due to intentional walks .
However , he still hit 45 HRs that year .
On the other hand , if Pujols ’ treatment ever reached the absurdity of B*nds in 2004 , and he starts getting passed 100 times a year , that could shave off nearly 7 HRs a year at the 16.1 AB / HR rate .
That can add up over 10 or 12 seasons .
Albert is definitely primed to sail by everyone in the record books .
And it ca n’t be said enough that El Hombre is an all - around hitter too , not just a masher , which makes it all the more impressive .
If Albert has just another 8 ½ seasons like the first 8 1/2 , he ’s undoubtedly a first ballot hall of famer and his name will become eponymous with baseball .
And the funny thing is this guy may not have hit his ceiling , as we ’ve seen this season .
After 17 seasons , if he replicates his first 8.5 seasons :
3,266 Hits , 702 HRs , 2128 RBIs , 2040 Runs , 110 SBs

Last night 's show on waiting took place in a pancake restaurant waiting room of the mind .
A sort of psychological Huddle House where we gather with the other aspects of our personalities , like " the busboy " aspect , which keeps us cleaning the tables of inner experience and personal relationships and filling water glasses too sometimes .
Depends .
What I was trying to get at is that sometimes it really is enough to just be present .
It does n't require that you be a brain surgeon , although if you were a brain surgeon , you would be more useful , frankly .
But you are just fine now too !
We need doctors and busboys and old fellows who just wait in line and tell us how good the pancakes are .
In real life , pancakes are inconsequential , but the pancakes of the future , the pancakes of potential , the pancakes that represent the culmination of your purpose , they are sweet like ... blintzes .

Is Scala really more complicated than Java ?
by Dick Wall
September 18 , 2009
Summary
After a conversation with a guy at work , I was inspired to take a look at whether Scala is inherently more complex than Java , and decided it was n't .
Advertisement
Today , I was asked by a friend to provide an alternative to the following Java one - liner :
for ( int i=0 ; i< 4 ; i++) { System.out.println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( i==2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ) ; }
This is a one - liner that unsurprisingly prints out the happy birthday song .
Easy enough .
So , I set about doing something in scala .
While at it , I had a little fun and made a few " improvements " .
The result was this :
( 1 to 4 ) .map { i =>
" Happy Birthday %s " . format ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) }.foreach { println ( _ ) }
When another friend saw this , he immediately opined that the Scala version was too complicated and would be hard to maintain .
An examination , I feel , is clearly called for here .
Why does it look so wierd ?
Well , there are a number of reasons for why this looks hard to understand .
The most obvious one is unfamiliarity .
We have had Java around for 15 + years now , and we all know the syntax really well here .
I would dissect a couple of parts and examine them in isolation to illustrate .
for ( int i=0 ; i < 4 ; i++ ) {}
It 's familiar to all of us , but really would we hold it up as a perfect example of readability .
Someone with no C or Java experience might wonder what the statement actually does .
We all know the first part is the initialization , the second is the termination test , and the third is the increment , but compare this with something like :
for i in 1 to 4 begin ... end
Which is what you would see in BASIC .
Java has more than it 's fair share of " lore " , it 's just we seem to forget about that .
Now Scala actually has several options for this kind of loop , perhaps a more fair comparison in my example would have been :
for ( i <- 1 to 4 ) { }
( I tend to read <- as " from " ) so : for i from 1 to 4 - pretty readable and understandable , I would say moreso than the Java one , if you were cold on both languages .
However , that 's not the form I used , I instead used the more universal .
( 1 to 4 ) .map { }
I could have , more fairly , used
( 1 to 4 ) . foreach { }
Which I think is very readable - the reason for using map instead will be explored below , but if I was to write it using foreach directly , we could end up with :
( 1 to 4 ) . foreach {i => println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) ) }
Alternatively , I could have used :
for ( i <- 1 to 4 ) println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) )
Now , that 's pretty reasonable , so why not stick with that version ?
Before we go on , I would like to point out that I also consider the ternary operator in Scala superior in readability to Java .
Just compare :
i == 3 ? " A " : " B "
Kind of looks like line noise until you are used to it , now how about
if ( i == 3 ) " A " else " B "
now that 's more like it .
Again , if you are n't familiar with either language , which is the easier to read ?
As an added bonus , there is no difference between the syntax of a typical if else statement and the ternary operator , I mean , they do the same thing , so why make them different ?
So , given that , why did n't I stick with the simple , readable version .
I could have easily done so , functionally it is directly equivalent to the Java version , and therein lies the ( maybe a little belabored ) point .
Most programs do n't print stuff out to Standard
Out these days , they might log it , but mostly what they do is prepare data to go into user interfaces .
As such , the Java for loop is a bit useless .
Let 's see how we would actually go about making the sentences that make up the song in Java .
I think the following would be the most compact and best signal to noise ratio :
String [ ] birthdayArray = new String [ 4 ] ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++) { birthdayArray [ i ] = " Happy Birthday " + ( i==2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ; }
List < String > birthdaySong = Arrays.asList( birthdayArray ) ;
( Most of the time you want something more durable like a list rather than an array for all sorts of good reasons , but you could just stop at an array if you wanted one ) .
We could put all of these statements onto one line of course , but I think readability would suffer more .
The good news is , we could now use the list of strings to populate something in a GUI or web page with nice markup .
This is more representative of what we do as developers every day .
What would this look like in Scala ?
val birthdaySong = ( 1 to 4 ) .map { i =>
" Happy Birthday " + ( if ( i==3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) }
Now we are starting to see the worm turn !
The above is completely type - safe ( do n't be fooled , the compiler knows that birthdaySong contains a list of strings at the end of this ) , however we do n't have to initialize a structure to hold the results , nor supply any type information since the compiler can infer it .
Look at the example again , and maybe you will start to see that the syntax looks less alien to you after a while .
Certainly I think that the signal to noise ratio is higher than with the Java equivalent .
I also do n't like that addition of strings .
It works if you are adding something to the end of the string , but what if you want a bunch of fields in the middle .
Here are the Java / Scala equivalents there .
Java :
MessageFormat.format( " Happy Birthday {0} " , i == 2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ;
Scala :
" Happy Birthday %s " . format ( if ( i==3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " )
not that different , but the importing of MessageFormat and the use of a static method is orthogonal to the functionality we actually want .
It adds nothing to the readability of the code , it 's just more noise .
So , let 's see where we are now .
From the original Java we have :
for ( int i=0 ; i < 4 ; i++) { System.out.println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( i==2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ) ; }
And while we know a direct scala equivalent can be written as :
for ( i <- 1 to 4 ) println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) )
We have actually ended up with :
( 1 to 4 ) .map { i =>
" Happy Birthday %s " . format ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) ) }
Suddenly that 's starting to look cleaner , and it is probably more useful code for the world of web applications or rich GUIs , but the original aim was to print something else , so now we have the birthday song verse as a list of strings , let 's just print them out :
birthdaySong.foreach { println ( _ ) }
The _ is just shorthand for " the thing " ( the only value available when iterating over the list ) .
We could also have done :
birthdaySong.foreach { line => println ( line ) }
Perhaps the second is a little more readable , perhaps not after you get just a little more comfortable with the syntax .
So where does that leave things ?
Well , for the original scala answer , the one that prompted the complexity comment , we have :
( 1 to 4 ) .map { i =>
" Happy Birthday %s " . format ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) }.foreach { println ( _ ) }
Abandoning the need to keep it all on one line , we get :
val birthdaySong = ( 1 to 4 ) .map { i =>
" Happy Birthday %s " . format ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) }
birthdaySong.foreach { println ( _ ) }
In Java , even using String array as an intermediate , we get :
String [ ] birthdayArray = new String [ 4 ] ;
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++) { birthdayArray [ i ] = MessageFormat.format( " Happy Birthday { 0} " , i= =2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ; }
for ( String line : birthdayArray ) { System.out.println( line ) ; }
And for the regular old just print it out , we have ( Scala first ) :
for ( i <- 1 to 4 ) println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( if ( i == 3 ) " Dear XXX " else " To You " ) )
and Java :
for ( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++) { System.out.println ( " Happy Birthday " + ( i == 2 ? " Dear XXX " : " To You " ) ) ; }
Can you still say Scala is more complex based on these examples ?
Is it not possible that it is just different ?

Sautéed Squid Concassé
If there is one advantage to living on an island , it has to be the endless supply of seafood harvested off our coastlines .
Do n’t get me wrong , there are plenty of pitfalls as well :
Wind , rain , having to pay exorbitant fees to leave said island on a ferry , etc .
But , being the optimist that I am , I always come back to the positive side of things .
Having just moved from the biggest city on the island , to possibly one of the smallest , I now have to dig a little deeper to find all those culinary treasures .
I ’ve recently found that , nearby , there are quite a few foodie havens .
We have a wonderful slow food restaurant , Amusé Bistro , North America ’s first Cittaslow town ( Cowichan Bay ) , old world style meat markets , cheese makers , bread bakers and farm stands .
We also have Canada ’s # 1 hotel , one of Vancouver Island ’s best coffee roasters and café , Drumroaster and some fantastic wineries , cideries and meaderies .
Really , I live in a corridor of home grown food , fantastic farm markets , ridiculously fresh seafood and awesome wine .
What more could a food obsessed chef really want ?
There ’s even a women up the ( unpaved , gravel ) road from me who sells fresh Omega - 3 eggs .
She raises rabbits too , but sadly , all of them are raised for a French restaurant in town .
What I would n’t give to try fresh , local rabbit .
What I ’m getting at is that I think I ’ve finally found a place to call home .
I ’m hoping that I can raise my little man ( 19 months today ! ) to love this style of food production just as much as me .
Who knows , maybe he ’ll be the next Jamie Oliver .
Anyway , today ’s recipe features a seafood that I could not find fresh .
I had to buy frozen .
It is fished in local waters , but so far I have not seen it for sale anywhere .
If you know otherwise , let me know !
Oct. 24 , 2009  -- Celebrities and the Church of Scientology seem to go hand - in - hand .
And actor Tom Cruise is arguably the world 's best - known celebrity Scientologist .
" She goes , ' I do n't really understand who you are , ' " Cruise says in a video made for a Scientology event that was leaked onto the Internet last year .
" And I said , ' OK , I 'm a Scientologist . '
" There 's nothing part of the way for me , " Cruise says on the video , laughing .
" It 's just [ makes voom sound ] . "
Tom Cruise first burst onto the scene in a pair of white socks , and not much else , in " Risky Business . "
Then he was fighter pilot , a bartender , and by the time he appeared in " Jerry Maguire , " he'd become the most successful movie star on the planet -- and deeply involved in Scientology .
Amy Scobee was a member of Scientology for 27 years .
She was a Church executive who helped expand Scientology 's outreach to celebrities .
She spoke with " Nightline . "
Nightline : ... Presbyterian Church does n't have a wing that emphasizes reaching celebrities ... Why do you think there was this emphasis on celebrity ?
Scobee : ... One of the purposes of Celebrity Centre is to make celebrities walking success stories of Scientology .
Tommy Davis is the director of public affairs for the Church of Scientology .
His mother is the actress Anne Archer , who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as a betrayed housewife in the movie " Fatal Attraction . "
Nightline : ... Why was there this exceptional approach to celebrities ?
Davis : Well ...
Nightline :
What 's the purpose of that ?
Davis :
What you have in Scientology is you have a lot of artists who are Scientologists .
Some of them are well known .
... the Celebrity Centre , which is that arts and culture branch of the Church first began , it was actually started and founded by and gotten going by Scientologists who are artists .
Scientology was founded by science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s .
One of the key practices is " auditing , " which is a kind of counseling session in which a person 's unconscious thoughts from painful experiences are purged , often with the help of a trained auditor and a device known as an " e- meter . "
Bruce Hines left the Church in 2003 after 24 years .
Hines :
This e-meter , this electrometer , which works on the same principle as a lie detector , even though they say , " No , this is n't a lie detector . "
But it 's the exact same principle .
Nightline :
But it indicates some kind of electrical pulse ?
Hines :
It sends a current through your body .
...
And the theory is is that when you have emotional charge ... it changes the resistance of the body .
So that changes the current .
And that ... and it makes this needle move .
" Nightline " spoke with Tommy Davis .
Nightline :
Has the e-meter ever been subjected to randomized clinical trials to assess its efficacy ?
Davis : I have no idea .
I do n't know why it would be .
It works in Scientology and that 's what people use it .
I do n't know why it would be subjected to random clinical trials .
Nightline : Because it 's a ... a mechanism for therapeutic care you just said ...
Davis :
In a religion .
Nightline :
But has it ever been tested objectively is what I 'm asking ?
Davis : I mean it gets used every day by Scientology counselors .
Nightline : I 'm not asking that .
I 'm asking ...
Davis :
To my knowledge , no .
... And as far as evidence of the e-meter and its efficacy , the evidence of that is in those Scientologists who have used it to great benefit .
And as far as the Church of Scientology is concerned , it 's the only evidence that matters , is the people and the results .
From the start , L. Ron Hubbard set out to attract celebrities , believing high profile public figures would be its most effective evangelists .
Nightline : Can you recall any celebrities who came into the Centre when you were there ?
Scobee : I met John Travolta , Kelly Preston , Priscilla Presley , Lisa Marie , Edgar Winter , Isaac Hayes , uh , Tom Cruise .
After Hubbard died in 1986 , David Miscavige became the Church 's leader -- and soon embraced Tom Cruise with great fervor .
Tom Cruise : Church 's Most Celebrated New Member
Nightline : But I guess it ... it 's helpful , is n't it , if ... uh , you 're an organization with an individual as well known , as ... famous , as successful as Tom Cruise .
Davis : Sure .
Nightline : He 's a ...
Davis :
Of course .
Nightline : He 's a good advocate ?
Davis :
Oh , look ...
I think anybody who would complain about having successful , well known , happy ... uh , people ...
Nightline : John Travolta , Kristie Ally .
Davis : ...of...of... their group , I 'd think you'd be crazy to ( laughs ) complain about that .
Bruce Hines says he helped prepare for the arrival of the Church 's most celebrated new member , who had decided to fully commit to Scientology by staying at the International Base in California for a few months of services .
" I was part of the preparations where David Miscavige brought Tom Cruise to the International Headquarters , " Hines said .
And Hines says nothing was to be spared .
" ... And he had the very best auditors and the very best people looking after him , " said Hines . " ... Just the ... the best treatment that anyone could possibly get , so that he got a favorable impression of Scientology . "
Church 's Treatment of Celebrities
Marty Rathbun left the Church in 2004 after 27 years .
He was a top lieutenant to David Miscavige .
Nightline : Did you audit Tom Cruise ?
Rathbun : Yeah , extensively ...
Nightline :
They were given what , a celebrity environment ?
Rathbun : A cel --
Nightline : Pampering ?
Rathbun :
You got it .
You got it .
Nightline :
And who was doing that ?
Rathbun : Miscavige , man .
I mean , that was his thing .
It 's all about image .
... He 's flying across the country in Tom Cruise 's jet .
... It 's all about living the high life and being a powerful guy who is looked up to by the rich and famous .
Tommy Davis said the Church does not indulge or pamper celebrities .
In recent years , Tom Cruise has been more confident about publicly asserting Scientology principles -- particularly its rejection of psychiatric medicine .
" Here 's the problem , " Cruise told host Matt Lauer in a " Today " show appearance .
" You do n't know the history of psychiatry .
I do .
" Matt .
Matt , Matt , you do n't even -- you 're glib .
You do n't even know what Ritalin is . "
Rathbun says the Tom Cruise he now sees on TV is not the Tom Cruise he once knew .
Rathbun : I watch him on Matt Lauer .
And I go , " That ai n't Tom Cruise .
That 's David Miscavige .
That 's not the Tom Cruise I knew two years ago . "
Nightline :
You 're referring to the moment when he attacked Brooke Shields for suffering post-natal depression and --
Rathbun : Attacked Matt Lauer , I mean , he 's talking --
Nightline : For not understanding --
Rathbun : -- he is talking to Matt Lauer like David Miscavige talks to his staff .
" You 're glib , man , you do n't get it .
You do n't understa --" you know .
When asked by " Nightline " if he supported Cruise 's comments on the Today Show , Tommy Davis said : " I support anybody who is going to be out there talking about the dangerous effects of drugs ... "
Nightline : But with the greatest respect , Mr. Davis , Tom Cruise is an actor .
He 's not a medical academic .
He 's not a clinician .
... Do you really think he 's qualified to denounce an entire field of medicine ?
Davis :
Well , I think your comments right there are actually quite degrading of actors and artists ...
Nightline : ... What right do they have ?
Davis :
They have every right ...
Cruise was one of many celebrities to join the Church .
In 1998 , actors John Travolta and Kirstie Alley told ABC News how much Scientology has helped them .
" The basic thing that I think Scientology helps people with is to rehabilitate their own spirit , their own nature , their own personality that was sort of buried or lost somewhere along the way , " said Alley .
" It 's given me all aspects of life back to me where I can move through life confidently , I can move through life feeling fulfilled , I look forward to life every day , " said Travolta .
Recently , speculation has swirled about Travolta , who famously produced and starred in the film , " Battlefield Earth , " based on a book by L. Ron Hubbard .
" Nightline " spoke with Marty Rathbun , who says he audited Travolta .
Nightline :
What sort of a man was he ?
Rathbun :
He 's a wonderful man .
He 's a great guy .
He 's very love -- one of the more loving persons you ever want to meet , sensitive , caring .
It was at the family 's island retreat that Travolta 's 16 - year - old son , Jett , who had autism , died from a seizure , in January .
" Nightline " asked Davis if the Church had ever advised Travolta not to allow his son take certain medications .
" Absolutely not .
It never happened .
The Church never advised them on ... in ... in any way , shape or form , whatsoever , on any aspect of , uh ... of their son's treatment .
Never have .
And never will , " Davis said .
Nightline :
As you know , Mr. Travolta and his wife suffered a very great tragedy recently .
...
Do you know if the Church ever advised them not to allow their son to receive certain medications for conditions ?
Davis : Absolutely not .
It never happened .
The Church never advised them on ... in ... in any way , shape or form , whatsoever , on any aspect of , uh ... of their son's treatment .
Never have .
And never will .
The tragic death has lead to tabloid speculation that John Travolta might leave the Church of Scientology , something the Church and Travolta 's publicist fiercely denied -- and last week , Travolta , his wife , Kelly Preston , and Tom Cruise were at major Scientology celebration in England .
Secrets of Scientology
The Church says there is no aspect of life that cannot be improved through the application of Scientology principles , some of which are treatments conceived by L. Ron Hubbard .
One such procedure , popular with celebrities , is called the " purification rundown . "
" It 's a sauna and vitamin program , some exercise to get your heartrate going and ... you would take high doses of ... dosages of Niacin , " said Amy Scobee .
Scientologists believe it can dislodge toxins and poisons from the body .
Tom Cruise is a strong advocate of this treatment -- co-founding the New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project , which uses L. Ron Hubbard 's " purification rundown " principals for those exposed to toxic chemicals after the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
" When I started this project , it was because I was in a position where I knew that I could help , " Cruise said at a project event .
Scobee had the treatment .
" When I did it the first time ... it was one week ... , and I felt , brighter and more alert , " she said .
" My skin was , you know , vibrant and stuff like that . "
But far away from the limelight of celebrities , Scobee says the program can also be used to discipline Church staff members .
She says she was once told to take part in a purification rundown that ended up lasting eight months .
Scobee : I was at 5,000 milligrams of Niacin for months and months .
I do n't know what that did to my body !
( Laughs ) .
I have no idea .
Nightline : How did you feel ?
Scobee : I felt really , there was like gray stuff coming out of my skin , and I did n't know if it was like my insides coming out ( laughs ) or whatever that long of being in the sauna five hours a day every day .
Nightline : Five hours ?
Scobee : Yeah .
Nightline :
And you kept going ?
Scobee : Yeah .
Nightline :
What happened when you did it for eight months ?
Scobee :
That was when I , uh , decided I did n't want to be there anymore ... to satisfy somebody else 's demands on ... on me , to fix me , because of their preconceived ways .
The Church denies Scobee 's characterization and says the program is a " religious service , " and to claim it as a " kind of perverse punishment " is " gross in the extreme . "
Perhaps the most sensitive aspect of the Church 's theology concerns confidential scriptures meant only for higher level Scientologists .
According to former Church insiders , these documents describe L. Ron Hubbard 's belief in an intergalactic emperor called Xenu who brought the spirits of his people to earth 75 million years ago , burying them in volcanoes .
These spirits , the story goes , have stuck to the bodies of people living today in the form of " body thetans . "
" They have had some really bad experience millions , billions , trillions , actually quadrillions of years ago , which is way older than the Big Bang basically ... , " said Bruce Hines .
" You 're supposed to , isolate ... and communicate with them telepathetically , so that they go away . "
Tommy Davis spoke with " Nightline . "
Nightline :
Do you believe that ... a galactic emperor called Xenu ... brought his people to earth 75 million years ago and buried them in volcanoes ?
Davis : OK .
Nightline : Do you believe that ?
Davis : Martin , I am not going to discuss the disgusting perversion of Scientology beliefs that can be found out commonly on the Internet and be put in the position of talking about things for ... that ... talking about things that are so fundamentally offensive to Scientologists to discuss ...
Nightline : Well , I ... I have the burden of my own journalistic responsibility ...
Davis : Uh-huh .
Nightline : ... that I bring to this meeting and I hope that , I 've been appropriately respectful of you in my asking of the questions ...
Davis :
Well , you have n't to the degree that the question that you asked me you know , by virtue of the fact that it 's been made very clear in other media entities that it 's something that we consider offensive ...
It is in violation of my religious beliefs to talk about them .
Nightline : So , just for clarification ... just for clarification , do you personally believe ...
Davis :
I 'm going to stop you , if you 're going to ask me that question again and you 're going to repeat things about volcanoes and this kind of thing and so on and so forth , I will stand up and walk out , Martin .
Because ... because what you 're doing by doing that is you are intentionally asking me things which you know I find offensive , and you 're insisting on asking me .
So I 'm asking you one more time ...
Nightline : Mr. Davis ... So , for a moment , if you would n't mind , I 'm not trying to offend anybody .
I 'm just trying to ask you a series of questions about the public face that you have .
I 'm not trying to mock you , I 'm trying to understand what your beliefs are .
Davis : Sure .
Nightline :
You 've explained what auditing is .... you 've explained the growth of the Church , you 've done all of those things .
Davis : Uh -huh .
Uh -huh .
Sure .
Nightline : I am asking you in the context of those questions , in the context of those questions , is it true that L. Ron Hubbard said that understanding the origins of the human race and described through Xenu --
At this point Davis stood up and left the room .
' We 're Counting on You '
Tom Cruise is a close friend of the ecclesiastical leader of the Church of Scientology , David Miscavige .
Cruise recently received the organization 's " Freedom Medal of Valor " at a prestigious ceremony .
" I want to tell you something .
I have never met a more competent , a more intelligent a more tolerant , a more compassionate being , " Cruise says in a video of the ceremony .
" .... To LRH ! [ salutes photo of L. Ron Hubbard ] . "
In a report on Oct. 22 , 2009 , " Nightline " focused on allegations made by former high ranking Scientologists who claim leader David Miscavige repeatedly struck subordinates .
" He just walked up and he hit me on the side of the head .
It was a ... he did n't have a closed fist .
But it was an open hand , " Hines said .
" But it was ... it definitely hurt and it definitely knocked me back . "
" I saw him ... attack [ Mike Rinder ] while he was sitting in a chair and hitting him upside the head , " said former Church executive Marty Rathbun .
" And then -- in -- and then wrestling him around the neck and ... throwing him to the ground ...
I saw at least a dozen times , this happen . "
The church denies David Miscavige ever hit anyone .
Sworn affidavits given to ABC News from over a dozen current Scientologists describe the allegations of abuse as " vile falsehoods " and say it was actually Marty Rathbun who was abusive .
Rathbun concedes he was violent , but says he was encouraged to be physical by Miscavige .
He and the other accusers believe Tom Cruise is too supportive of the Church 's leader .
" Tom Cruise , I do n't appreciate the fact that he 's supporting David Miscavige , " said Scobee , " because either he 's supporting him and ... and dumb to the fact that he is a total tyrant , or he's in agreement with it ... and either way that is really not OK . "
And Rathbun hopes that the other most famous Scientologist , John Travolta , will re-consider his relationship with Scientology in light of the allegations of violence .
Nightline :
What do you think of his position at the moment ?
Do you think that he 's likely to leave ?
Rathbun : I think if [ Travolta ] were exposed to the truth , the truths that are being spoken ... about what really is going on behind the façade , I do n't think he would continue to support that organization .
... I think he'd check out in a heartbeat .
In a letter sent to Nightline yon October 22 , Tom Cruise 's attorney called the actor " a man of spirit , intelligence , and independence . "
He said , " Mr. Cruise is aware of the claims made against Mr. Miscavige by former members of the Church of Scientology .
He does not believe them . "
How does General Motors , Sam L. Savage wonders , explain the pathetic performance of its crystal ball ?
When Americans started driving hybrids , GM was still pushing Hummers .
Executives at the giant carmaker — fully aware of union contracts , presumably prepared for rising gasoline prices and economic uncertainty — drove straight into the ditch of bankruptcy .
“ Probability management ” is often mismanaged by business leaders , says Savage , a consulting professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University and a fellow at the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge .
Savage , who has performed probability studies for Royal Dutch Shell , set out to right statistical wrongs in his book “ The Flaw of Averages . ”
The Information Age has transformed statistics into a vital field of study , yet Savage says many habits and practices have been slow to change from the “ steam era statistics ” of the Industrial Age .
Written for a business audience , “ The Flaw of Averages ” leavens the math with levity , even the occasional cartoon .
Recently , Savage elaborated on his message in an exchange of e-mails with the Mercury News .
Q You take 391 pages to explain , as your subtitle puts it , “ Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty . ”
What ’s the short answer ?
A When you plug the average of some uncertainty ( future sales , prices , interest rates , etc. ) into a spreadsheet you will generally NOT get the average value of the output ( profit , cost , return on investment etc . ) .
This has been known by mathematicians for a century as Jensen ’s Inequality , and with a name like that , no wonder no one has heard of it .
In 1999 I came up with a better name , the Flaw of Averages , and figured it would be a great book title .
But as I began to write , I realized that the Flaw of Averages ensures that everything is behind schedule , beyond budget and below projection .
Who wants to read a “ feel bad ” book without a happy ending ?
Then , starting in 2005 , working with colleagues at Cambridge University and Royal Dutch Shell , a cure for the Flaw of Averages began to emerge .
With a happy ending in hand , I had the motivation to finish the book .
Q The Information Age has created a blizzard of data , but search technologies help people navigate the information .
What is your impression of society ’s adaptation to the Information Age ?
A A blizzard is a good analogy .
If you focus on the individual snowflakes , you ’ll go nuts .
It takes statistical thinking to make out what the storm is doing as a whole .
For example , although you will never know what all zillion snowflakes in the blizzard are doing , you can learn a lot by sampling 1,000 of them .
Some people are very sophisticated about statistics .
Netflix predicts what kinds of movies you like , Google guides you to the Web site you wanted and researchers design vaccines to save us from the next big epidemic — all with statistics .
But most people are still plugging single average numbers into their spreadsheets and are stuck in the 20th century .
A central facet of our cure for the Flaw of Averages is a new computer data type that squeezes thousands of numbers instead of just one number into the single cell of a spreadsheet , like a genie into a bottle .
It is called the Distribution String , or DIST , and was developed in collaboration with Oracle , SAS Institute and Frontline Systems .
It helps you think about your thousand sample snowflakes in terms of a single super snowflake .
Q What are the most common ways people foolishly apply the law of averages ?
Is it the faith placed in “ average returns ” on retirement portfolio ?
A Plenty of people have been caught off base by the Flaw of Averages in investing , but here is an example that is closer to home .
Imagine that both you and your wife are right on time for appointments , on average .
When you go somewhere together , however , you will be late , on average .
Why ?
If we model being early or late for each of you by flipping a coin ( heads is early , tails is late ) , then the only way you will not be late as a couple , is if neither of you is late .
This is like flipping two heads in a row , or one chance in four .
Now expand this to a big industrial project with thousands of tasks , and you can imagine the implications .
Q Have you ever caught yourself making such errors ?
A Many times .
The first was in 1989 , when I was planning a lecture on combined uncertainties and had a clear idea of the result .
I then created a very simple simulation in Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 with random numbers , which gave the opposite of the answer I expected .
I thought to myself : “ Whoa !
If a management science professor does n’t get this stuff , how about the rest of the world ? ”
It was like a light bulb going on , which has motivated me ever since .
Q Statistics used to seem like a grim pursuit for creating actuarial tables .
Now the Information Age has made it a hot , lucrative field — even “ dead sexy , ” as one blogger put it .
What ’s your opinion ?
A The theory of probability and statistics is powerful and elegant .
But then again , so is the steam locomotive , and they were developed around the same time .
Although we no longer teach steam locomotion , most college courses , including many at Stanford , still teach steam - era statistics .
Instead of “ dead sexy , ” I would call it “ just plain dead . ”
Stanford , however , is also a prominent center for computational statistics , which uses the brute force of computers to solve problems , rather than arcane formulas .
This leads to a much more visual and interactive approach to statistics that I do find sexy .
Q So do statisticians have surefire pickup lines ?
A Although I do n’t have a surefire pickup line for a statistician , I can provide a long list of things they could say that would have the opposite effect .
Contact Scott Duke Harris at 408-920-2704 .
There are numerous rumors circulating in the Internet which suggest that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is in a coma .
Others say that he is already dead .
These rumors were started by an article in Pajamas Media .
Entitled “ Khamenei Said to be in Coma ” ; the article written by Michael Ledeen cites sources in Tehran .
According to his sources :
“ Yesterday afternoon ( Wednesday ) at 2.15 PM local time , Khamenei collapsed and was taken to his special clinic .
Nobody – except his son and the doctors – has since been allowed to get near him . ”
Since then a number of Persian language blogs have also talked about Khamenei 's death .
For now , this report should be treated as a rumor and nothing else .
Mr. Ledeen already pronounced Ayatollah Khamenei dead three years ago in another one of his articles .
His sources proved unreliable , something which can happen to anyone .
Perhaps his new sources are more reliable .
All we can do is wait and see .
We have nothing to corroborate it with .
Furthermore , the Iranian blogsphere is a great source for those seeking opinion .
But when it comes to news , it 's extremely unreliable .
Anyone can write a blog in Persian , and he / she could write it from anywhere .
A good example is the source used for the story earlier this year by western press that during a visit to the city of Uumiyeh , shoes were thrown at President Ahmadinejad .
The source used by the international press was a site in Iran called “ Urumiyeh News . "
At first glance , the name sounds very credible .
Many cities in Iran have their own news sites and they are run under a management which adheres to censorship laws .
But in this case , when we look closer , we see that “ Urumiyeh News ” is nothing more than a blog - meaning the story could have been written by anyone .
Should Mr. Ledeen 's story turn out to be true , the CIA should seriously consider giving him a senior post .
Anyone who has access to sources in Iran who know Khamenei 's exact whereabouts and the timing of his movement is to be taken very seriously .
They should also ask Mr. Ledeen if his sources have any friends / relatives who work near or at a giant construction site in Qom , which glows at night .
And while they are at it , if they manage to find Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's secret Bar Mitzvah pictures at The Western Wall , then they would make a lot of people at The Daily Telegraph very happy .

The theory of evolution really does explain everything in biology .
The phenomena that Darwin understood in broad brush strokes can now be accounted for in the precise language of DNA .
And though biological systems have attained extraordinary levels of complexity over the passage of time , no serious biologist doubts that evolutionary explanations exist or will be found for every jot and tittle in the grand script .
To biologists and others , it is a source of amazement and embarrassment that many Americans repudiate Darwin ’s theory and that some even espouse counter­theories like creationism or intelligent design .
How can such willful ignorance thrive in today ’s seas of knowledge ?
In the hope of diminishing such obscurantism , the prolific English biology writer Richard Dawkins has devoted his latest book to demonstrating the explanatory power of evolutionary ideas while hammering the creationists at every turn .
Dawkins invites the reader to share the frustration of an imaginary history teacher , some of whose students refuse to accept that the Roman Empire ever existed , or that Latin is the mother tongue from which the Romance languages evolved .
Instead of concentrating on how Western culture emerged from the institutions of the Roman state , the teacher must spend time combating a school board that insists he give equal time to their alternative view that French has been spoken from time immemorial and that Caesar never came or saw or conquered .
This is exactly analogous to the plight of the biology teacher trying to acquaint students with the richness of modern biology in states where fundamentalist opponents of evolution hold sway .
Dawkins has a nice sense of irony , deployed without mercy on the opponents of evolution .
If the creationists think the earth is less than 10,000 years old , rather than 4.6 billion , he asks , should n’t they assume , by the same measure , that North America is less than 10 yards wide ?
The book is even more enjoyable when Dawkins forgets the creationists and launches into evolutionary explanations , whether of the hippopotamus ’s long - lost cousin the whale , or of the long - tongued moth that Darwin predicted must exist to pollinate a Madagascan orchid with a nectary 11 inches in length .
He gives striking examples of “ unintelligent design , ” forced on evolution because it cannot ever start from scratch but must develop new structures from older ones .
Hi , Ellis —

Let me introduce myself .
My name is Gineen Klein , and I ’ve been brought on as an intern to replace the promotion department here at Propensity Books .
First , let me say that I absolutely love “ Clancy the Doofus Beagle : A Love Story ” and have some excellent ideas for promotion .
To start :
Do you blog ?
If not , get in touch with Kris and Christopher from our online department , although at this point I think only Christopher is left .
I ’ll be out of the office from tomorrow until Monday , but when I get back I ’ll ask him if he spoke to you .
We use CopyBuoy via Hoster Broaster , because it streams really easily into a Plaxo / Linked In yak - fest meld .
When you register , click “ Endless , ” and under “ Contacts ” just list everyone you ’ve ever met .
It would be great if you could post at least six hundred words every day until further notice .
If you already have a blog , make sure you spray - feed your URL in niblets open - face to the skein .
We like Reddit bites ( they ’re better than Delicious ) , because they max out the wiki snarls of RSS feeds , which means less jamming at the Google scaffold .
Then just Digg your uploads in a viral spiral to your social networks via an FB / MS interlink torrent .
You may have gotten the blast e-mail from Jason Zepp , your acquiring editor , saying that people who do this sort of thing will go to Hell , but just ignore it .
The vi-spi is cross-platform , but do n’t worry if you think you ’re not on Facebook , because you actually are .
Jason enrolled you when you signed the contract last year , or at least he was supposed to , and he told Sarah Williams he did before he had to retire and Sarah left for nursing school .
You currently have 421 Friends , 17 Pending Requests , 8 Pokes , 5 Winks , and 3 Proposals of “ Marriage . ”
I ’ve attached a list of celebrities we think would be great to blurb your book , so find out their numbers and call them up .
Be sure to do all this by Monday , because Sales Conference starts Tuesday .
We come back Friday and then immediately on Saturday (! ) all of editorial ( Janet , plus probably Michelle , her assistant ) and I go to the Frankfurt Book Fair for a week .
During that time the office will be closed , although to help cover the costs of the Germany trip it will actually be sublet to the John Lindsay Elementary School P.T.A. as a rehearsal space for this year ’s fund - raiser production of “ The Music Man . ”
I ’m told that this was one of the things that Jason did n’t understand and which contributed to his “ condition . ”
Once we get back from Frankfurt , we ’d like to see you on morning talk shows like the “ Today ” show and “ The View , ” so please get yourself booked on them and keep us “ in the loop . ”
If I ’m not here — which I wo n’t be , since after the book fair I go on vacation for two weeks — just tell Jenni , my assistant , when she gets back from jury duty .
Remember in your blog to tabskim your readers ’ comments .
You can use Twitter , Chitt - chaTT , or Nit-Pickr .
When you reply to comments , try to post at least one photo per hour of you doing everyday tasks around the house , such as answering comments and posting photos .
Please make sure they ’re pre-scorched .
Let me know , when I get back from Retreat a week after my vacation , if self - surging is a problem .
As re : personal appearances , to cut down on travel expenses we ’re trying something new this season called RAP , or Readings by Author by Proxy .
We ’re asking authors in certain key areas of the country to stay “ close to home ” and give readings at local bookstores of both their own books and a few of our other new releases .
We can send you a list of bookstores in your area once you fill out the My Local Bookstores list on your Author ’s Questionnaire .
You ’ll be reading not only from your book but from “ Code Blue Stat , ” a new medical thriller we ’re really excited about , and “ Fifty Great Pan Sauces , ” a cool new cookbook .
Their authors , Dr. Steven Rosenthal and Gail Freenye , will stay in Chicago and Boston , respectively , and read from each other ’s book and yours .
This idea , apparently , is what made Jason take his clothes off and lock himself in a supply closet .
F.Y.I. , we ’ve migrated all the photos out of your book and onto the Web page .
It makes the hard - copy version cheaper to produce ( fewer pages ; no photos ) and the e-text more “ Kindle - friendly . ”
Sometime next week , call Christopher over an ISDN line and say your name , as distinctly as possible , at least two hundred times , so we can dub it as an AudioAutograph onto the podcast edition .
( You may already have done this for a previous book , but somehow Jason managed to delete all the audio files before Security escorted him from the building . )
Do n’t hesitate to try to contact me if you have any questions .
I sort of have my hands full , promoting twenty - three new releases this fall , but I ’m really excited about working on your book , and I look forward to collaborating with you to make “ A History of Moorish Architecture , 1200 - 1492 ” the biggest success it can be .
Best regards ,

HERE comes the no-fuss bride : more Victorian couples are ditching the church and opting for cheaper and easier registry weddings .
Civil ceremonies and town hall weddings have jumped in the past five years as couples marry without the fanfare or religious rituals .
Of Victorian weddings last year , 63 per cent were performed by civil celebrants .
Just 36 per cent of couples preferred the church .
Figures from the Victorian Registry of Births , Deaths and Marriages show more than 17,500 people married at a civil ceremony last year compared with 14,173 in 2004 .
Just 9476 people married at a church last year down from 11,117 in 2004 .
The number of church weddings dropped from 11,117 in 2004 to just 9476 last year .
The number of people marrying at the Victorian Marriage Registry has also jumped to a record 3399 in 2008 .
On Tuesday , 10 couples tied the knot at the Old Treasury Building with marriages scheduled in half - hour slots from 10 am to 5.30 pm .
Ceremonies range in price from $ 250 to $ 320 depending on the size of the room , and it usually takes at least six weeks from the booking to get hitched .
Janine Kupfer , 38 , married her second husband Marcus at the Spring St landmark on Valentine 's Day , with 29 other couples .
" I did n't want all the fuss , that 's why I did n't want the church to do it , " she said .
" I am not religious and it would be hypocritical to get married in a church when I have never been . "
Ms Kupfer paid $ 330 and said her mother was concerned a registry wedding was cheap and nasty .
" It is different to how it was in the old days , there are a lot of misconceptions with the older generations .
It is classy and ladies do get dressed up , " she said .
Relationships Australia ( Victoria ) spokeswoman Ingrid Sturmey said the trend away from church weddings was in line with many young people ditching religion .
" The idea of a god blessing their relationship is n't relevant to them , " she said .
" People are saying ' it is up to us , we are committing to each other and not to God ' . "
She said attitudes to marriage had become more relaxed with the commitment ceremonies becoming simpler , cheaper and often after a couple have had children .
The registry ceremony was no longer the poor man 's wedding , but the merely the " formal stuff " followed by a huge party afterwards .

Revolt and “ dialogue ” in Honduras
26 September 2009
With this week ’s return of ousted President Manuel Zelaya to Honduras , pressure is mounting on the coup regime headed by fellow Liberal Party leader Roberto Micheletti to bring an end to the country ’s three - month - old crisis .
The Organization of American States and the European Union have announced that their ambassadors are returning to Tegucigalpa along with some foreign ministers to promote a settlement , former US President Jimmy Carter called the coup leader to urge him to negotiate , the International Monetary Fund announced that it has “ paused ” its relations with the country , and Standard & Poor ’s has downgraded its credit rating .
The aim of this pressure campaign was spelled out most bluntly in a Washington Post editorial Thursday entitled “ Honduras Gets Messier . ”
The editorial denounced Zelaya for seeking “ to foment … populist revolution ” from the confines of the Brazilian Embassy , where he has been given refuge .
“ Such behavior ought to deter any responsible member of the Organization of American States — starting with Brazil — from supporting anything more than a token return by Mr. Zelaya to office , ” the Post ’s editors insisted .
“ The Obama administration has backed such a restoration ( as have we ) so as to void Mr. Zelaya ’s illegal removal from the country by the army in June and thus uphold the larger principle of respect for democratic order in the region . ”
The editorial continued : “ Now the United States ought to make clear that any further attempt by Mr. Zelaya or his supporters to cause public disorder or violence will mean the reversal of the US position — leaving him as a permanent ward of those in the Brazilian government who cooperated with his caper . ”
This is the authentic voice of Yankee imperialism , dripping with contempt for the lands to its south and seething with anger at any sign of popular revolt against the conditions of oppression and poverty to which hundreds of millions are condemned .
Restoring order is the sole concern of the Post and the US ruling establishment for which it speaks .
It fears a continuation of the crisis will make Honduras ungovernable and raise the specter of a genuine revolution .
The charge that Zelaya is fomenting revolution is a false one .
The upheavals that have erupted in Honduras following his clandestine return on Monday have been provoked by the coup regime and its security forces in their attempt to enforce a series of curfews that effectively condemned a population of 7 million to house arrest .
Workers and youth in the poorer suburbs of Tegucigalpa as well as in other parts of the country defied the curfews , spontaneously erecting street barricades and battling soldiers and police .
In a country where people are compelled by poverty to buy food on a daily basis , those who have left their homes in search of something to eat have faced the prospect of beatings and worse .
Whatever Zelaya ’s populist rhetoric , he has not led a revolt , nor does he share the social and class interests of those who have taken to the streets .
He has not sought the popular overthrow of the dictatorship , but rather has relied on pressure from Washington , in the first instance , and that of the OAS , Brazil and others to put him back in office .
Zelaya returned to Honduras appealing for “ dialogue ” with those who overthrew him and with the ruling oligarchy of which he himself is a product .
He has accepted as the basis of this discussion the so - called San José accord drafted by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias , Washington ’s hand - picked mediator .
This proposal calls for the formation of a government of “ national unity ” between Zelaya and the coup leaders , the renunciation of any proposal to amend the country ’s reactionary constitution , and a blanket amnesty for the political and military leaders who have unleashed a wave of killings , disappearances , torture , beatings and arbitrary detentions in the 90 days since Zelaya was bundled onto an airplane and forced out of the country .
The Obama administration ’s aim in promoting this plan is to solidify the goals of the coup while maintaining the appearance of a commitment to “ democracy . ”
Washington ’s halfhearted criticisms of Zelaya ’s ouster are belied by the failure to this day of the US State Department to formally declare it a coup .
Meanwhile , the US military base at Palmerola , Honduras continues operations as normal , and Washington has taken no steps to impose trade sanctions .
The Arias plan would relegate Zelaya to the status of a figurehead for the little more than three months remaining before a successor takes office .
His acceptance of this miserable accord appeared to bear fruit on Thursday , as first a representative of the Catholic Church hierarchy , which enthusiastically supported the coup , and then the four candidates for president in the elections scheduled for November 29 came to the embassy to greet him .
As the Spanish daily El Pais put it , “ The images of shootings and beatings were replaced by those of smiles and embraces . ”
For many of the Honduran workers and youth on the receiving end of the shootings and beatings , the image of the smiling Zelaya embracing the four candidates — all supporters of the coup — in an election that masses of people have vowed to boycott provoked disgust .
Whatever Zelaya ’s intentions , or for that matter those of his visitors , a peaceful resolution of the crisis on the terms proposed by Washington , Arias and the OAS is far from assured .
On Friday — just hours after the UN Security Council condemned the harassment of the Brazilian embassy by Honduran security forces — it was reported that troops laying siege to the embassy had fired gas grenades into the compound , causing those holed up there together with Zelaya to bleed from the nose and vomit blood .
Zelaya ’s life is clearly in danger , and the prospect that the killing and repression of the past 90 days will be massively expanded is a real one .
This is , after all , a regime that rests upon a military trained by Washington in the use of death squads and brutality to defend the interests of the US multinationals and the local oligarchy .
The events of the past three months have exposed the bankruptcy of bourgeois nationalist politics .
The attacks on the basic democratic rights and social conditions of the masses of Honduran working people will continue , even if Zelaya is briefly restored to the presidential palace .
The strivings of workers , peasants and youth expressed in their sustained resistance to the June 28 coup can be fulfilled only through a revolutionary struggle , independent of all sections of the ruling elite , aimed at taking power and establishing a socialist Honduras as part of the struggle of working people throughout Central America , the entire hemisphere and internationally .

Opposition treasury spokesman Joe Hockey has revealed he has been sounded out by colleagues to take over the Liberal leadership from Malcolm Turnbull .
But he has insisted Mr Turnbull has his full backing .
Speaking on Fairfax Radio today , Mr Hockey confirmed he has been approached about taking up the top job as Mr Turnbull continues to battle poor polls and internal division .
" People talk to me about all sorts of things , " Mr Hockey said .
" I 'm not going to lie and pretend something has n't happened .
" I do n't want to disclose what I speak to my colleagues about , but I am very focused on beating Labor at the next election . "
Mr Hockey says Mr Turnbull has his complete loyalty .
" He 's giving it his best shot and I 'm totally supporting him in that , " he said .
Mr Turnbull 's leadership has been destabilised in recent weeks as the internal stoush continues over how the Opposition should handle emissions trading .
Last week Mr Turnbull declared he could not lead a party that did not act on climate change and lashed out at " anonymous smart - arses " who were publicly criticising him .
Asked today by reporters if he is " looking over his shoulder " in the wake of Mr Hockey 's comments , Mr Turnbull replied : " Not at all . "
" I 'm always looking straight ahead and I 'm focused on our opponents . "
Shadow cabinet is meeting this afternoon to decide on emissions trading amendments to take to the party room for approval on Sunday ahead of the resumption of Parliament .
Going into the meeting Mr Hockey was tightlipped in the wake of his earlier comments as were several of his other colleagues .
Mr Turnbull dissmissed the speculation and says he has the full support of the party .
" Yes absolutely and I have the support of the whole part yroom so we 're in very good shape , do n't worry about it , " he said .
Mr Turnbull has maintained he is confident of getting party room backing for changes he will take to the Government despite vocal criticism from some who do not want a scheme passed this year .
Yesterday 's Newspoll also saw support for the Liberal party fall to 31 per cent .
Coins buried by anxious Italians in the first century B.C. can be used to track the ups and downs of the Roman population during periods of civil war and violence .
In times of instability in the ancient world , people stashed their cash and if they got killed or displaced , they did n't come back for their Geld .
Thus , large numbers of coin hoards are a good quantitative indicator of population decline , two researchers argue in in the * Proceedings of the National Academy of Science * Monday .
And it turns out that during the periods we know to have been violent — the Second Punic War , the Social War and various civil wars — hoarding behavior soars , providing a statistical peek into the life of your average Italian 2,000 years ago .
" During that period , we have a good literary record .
Caesar died because he was killed by assassins , " said Peter Turchin , a population ecologist at the University of Connecticut .
" We do n't know what happened to common people .
[ Coin hoards ] tell us what happened to common people . "
The new work could help settle a long - standing historical debate about the Roman population .
Census figures from the end of the second century B.C. show a population of adult males of around 400,000 .
Then , the record goes blank , and census figures from around a hundred years later show a population of 4 to 5 million .
Some of the population explosion is explained by the extension of Roman citizenship to various groups , but far from all of it .
From this evidence , a group of historians known as the " high - count " hypothesizers have argued there was excellent population growth during that period .
Another group of historians had an alternate explanation for the appearance of population growth .
They figured that the later census takers had started to count women and children , rather than just adult males , as part of the official population stats .
Without more information about the ancient world , it was difficult to settle the argument one way or another .
Turchin , though , knew from previous work that warfare and instability do n't tend to deliver robust population growth in societies .
" Population growth and instability are negatively correlated , " Turchin said .
He teamed up with Walter Scheidel , a Stanford classicist and historian , to create a model of population growth and decline based on coin - hoard data gathered over the years .
Their model 's predictions match well with the early census data .
The population projections they derive make the " high - count " hypothesis " highly implausible , " they argue .
That has important implications for Roman history , but not too much history will actually be rewritten .
It was the high - counters who were hoping to revise the Italian population up from what earlier historians had assumed .

It is a joy to see the Liberals descending into complete rabbledom .
But remember ; Labor a few years ago was the same .
Politics without power for capitalist parties is frustrating .
This is especially so for the conservatives – the first eleven of capital .
When the second eleven are winning all the games it is not unreasonable for those who perceive themselves to be better getting a little frustrated .
Th problem they have is that with the Global Financial Crisis came the collapse of neoliberalism as an open ideology .
The Liberals , unlike Labor , have been unable to give their neoliberalism a new name and dress it up as something else .
As well , the divisions in the preferred profit party reflect the divisions within the ruling class itself over climate change , and to a lesser extent the economy .
Capitalism is about short term profit .
But even to make profit in the short term you have to plan ahead .
Hence the capitalist state tries to rule for all of capital ( with its accompanying plethora of economic , environmental and other experts and apologists ready to advise them on how best to extract extra profit from workers ) .
And big business has its own planning processes to organise how they can better expropriate the wealth we produce over the next five to ten years .
Climate change threatens the very existence of the capitalist system .
But the focus on short - term profit makes this a difficult message to get across – unless there is a buck in it now , or in a few years time .
So addressing climate change is the venture capital of the future – risky , unpredictable and maybe without any monetary rewards .
The Liberals do n’t want to invest .
It is too risky evidently .
Labor wants to invest but by both propping up the present bunch of capitalists ( at the expense of environmental risk capital ) and by giving a few tidbits to the future .
Labor has momentarily managed to transcend the bourgeoisie ’s divisions over climate change with a less incoherent response ( do little and do it very very slowly while giving the impression of implementing meaningful change ) .
The debates on the environment and the economy are all about profit , and how to extract surplus value from workers .
There is not even the ameliorating influence from the working class via the ALP in this .
In terms of policy the Labor Party may now be a completely bourgeois party .
The same process is playing out through the debates over the economy .
The Australian economy ( contrary to my and others earlier apocalyptic visions ) has so far avoided any major catastrophe , at least from the point of view of the ruling class .
This has little to do with who is in power and more to do with riding the tiger successfully .
The problem is no one knows or understands what the tiger will do next or why .
But the underlying problems of the economy – in essence the low profit rate – have n’t been addressed .
There has been no massive assault on living standards ; no clearing out of ‘ inefficient ’ blocs of capital ; no massive re-orienting towards a green economy .
As its habitat disappears the tiger will kill again .
FBI raids home over use of Twitter at G20 summit
By Ali Ismail
16 October 2009
On October 1 , FBI anti-terrorism agents backed by police helicopters raided the Queens , New York , home of Elliot Madison , a self - described anarchist .
Madison had been arrested in Pittsburgh a week earlier for using Twitter to pass information between protesters at the G20 summit .
The federal agents in New York confiscated items from Madison ’s home that included political literature , a picture of Lenin and items of clothing .
Madison works as a social worker , and the FBI also seized his clients ’ case files .
An article in the New York Times stated , “ A search warrant executed by the FBI at Mr. Madison ’s house authorized agents and officers looking for violations of federal rioting laws to seize computers and phones , black masks and clothes and financial records and address books . ”
Madison ’s attorney has since obtained a court injunction against the FBI examining the seized items .
Rupert Murdoch ’s New York
Post reported the FBI action under the headline “ Queens ‘ terror ’ raid hits G - 20 anarchist . ”
The raid came a week after Madison and another individual were arrested in Pittsburgh during the G20 summit and charged with “ hindering apprehension or prosecution ” and “ possession of instruments of crime ” — a reference to police scanners .
According to the Pennsylvania State Police , Madison was found in his hotel room using the social - networking site Twitter to provide information on police movements to protesters during the G20 summit .
Police scanners and several computers were also found in his hotel room .
Madison , 41 and a resident of the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens in New York , has denied any wrongdoing .
While in Pittsburgh , he participated in the Tin Can Communications Collective , a group formed to use social - networking sites to send mass text messages concerning protest - related events .
Madison is believed to be one of the first people in the US to face criminal charges for using a social - networking site to inform protesters about police movements .
Madison ’s lawyer , Martin Stolar , stated , “ He and a friend were part of a communications network among people protesting the G20 . ”
“ It ’s an outrageous use of criminal law to punish dissent , to punish speech , which tends to support dissent , and it is the most unique application of the criminal law to the use of Twitter that I have ever seen , ” said Stolar .
“ Essentially we have Elliot accused of taking publicly available information and giving it to another person in the public and then being charged with a crime for doing so , ” he said .
“ I ’m missing something here . ”
The raid on Madison ’s home lasted for 16 hours , with helicopters circling the neighborhood .
His lawyer described the raid in an interview with Democracy Now : “ And so , they ( FBI and the New York Police Department ) rambled around and searched and pulled things .
They ’re not only from Elliot and his wife Elena ’s property , but also there were other residents of the house who are living there who had their private property taken and swept up in this , including computers and discs of somebody who ’s making a film , computers and discs of somebody who produced a weekly radio show , a computer that actually belonged to the United States Government .
One of the residents of the house was a contract employee for one of the federal agencies , and that computer was also taken . ”
Apparently , agents even seized stuffed animals belonging to Madison .
“ Yes , yes , and they took Curious George stuffed animals , ” said Madison .
“ They took magnets from the refrigerator .
They took a needlepoint of Lenin that my wife ’s grandmother had made , a whole variety of bizarre things that they ’ve taken . ”
Of the books that were seized , Madison said , “ I ’m an author .
I ’ve written fiction .
I ’ve written lots of nonfiction .
I ’m an anarchist , so I ’ve written lots of political works .
So they not only grabbed all of my works , they grabbed anything that they felt like grabbing from our pretty large library . ”
No additional federal charges have been filed against Madison since the raid .
What was seized from his home had nothing to do with the laws he was alleged to have violated in Pittsburgh .
On October 2 , Madison ’s attorney argued in a federal court in Brooklyn that the charges were too vague and overly broad .
Judge Dora L. Irizarry ordered authorities to desist from examining the seized material until October 16 , pending further orders .
Legal experts have warned that the prosecution of Madison has far - reaching implications for the freedom of speech and basic democratic rights .
Vic Walczak , the legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania , stated , “ In this age of instant media coverage it has the potential to chill live reporting .
This is just the rebroadcasting of information that ’s otherwise publicly available , not too different from what the media were doing . ”
Protesters around the world have utilized social - networking sites to inform people about planned rallies and to spread word on arrests and police movements .
According to the Times , “ American protesters first made widespread use of mass text messages in New York , during the 2004 Republican National Convention , when hundreds of people used a system called TXT mob to share information .
Messages , sent as events unfolded , allowed demonstrators and others to react quickly to word of arrests , police mobilizations and roving rallies .
Mass texting has since become a valued tool among protesters . ”
In reporting the arrests and FBI raid , the US mass media has exhibited none of the concern for democratic rights that it has proclaimed in relation to similar acts of repression in other countries .
US officials and media commentators heaped praise on the so - called “ Twitter Revolution ” in Iran during the protests staged following the victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over his challenger , Mir Hossein Mousavi , this past summer .
“ Has Twitter become the CNN of the masses ? ” asked Howard Kurtz on CNN .
“ This revolution will not be televised , but it is definitely being tweeted , ” said Rachel Maddow of MSNBC .
Such praise for the use of the social - networking service reflected Washington ’s backing for the Mousavi camp , which it sees as more amendable to US strategic interests in the region and more likely to open up the Iranian market to US capital .
It was for this reason that the Obama administration supported the pro-Mousavi protests .
The White House ’s own Twitter feed read , “ We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . ”
When Iranian officials blocked protesters ’ access to Twitter , US officials expressed outrage over the action .
Senators Charles Schumer ( Democrat - New York ) and Lindsey Graham ( Republican - South Carolina ) wrote : “ Following recent elections , the Iranian government has used a new communications monitoring center to interfere with and suppress Internet and cell phone communications as part of efforts to crack down on Iranian citizens peacefully demonstrating … including voice calls , e-mail , text messaging , instant messages , and web traffic as well as posts to social - networking sites such as Twitter , MySpace and Facebook . ”
The US State Department even pressured Twitter to delay a previously planned upgrade that would have temporarily cut service to Iran .
On October 11 , just weeks after Madison ’s arrest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted to CNN ’s Christiane Amanpour that the State Department contacted Twitter to convince them not to shut their site down for 48 hours as they had planned .
Human rights activists and the American Civil Liberties Union have pointed to the hypocrisy of the US government in its dealings with protests within the country , as opposed to its support in other countries for protests that serve US state interests .
The Pennsylvania ACLU ’s Vic Walczak told Reuters , “ The same conduct ( of authorities ) in Iran or China during recent demonstrations would be called human rights violations whereas here it ’s called necessary crime control .
It ’s a real double standard . ”
The US actually was largely silent when China recently blocked access to Twitter before the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and last July in response to ethnic unrest in northwestern Xinjiang .
The American silence on China ’s Twitter crackdown can be explained by the fact that any sort of social uprising in China would negatively affect US interests in that country .
The arrest and criminal charging of Elliot Madison was explicitly political .
Commenting on the real police motive in arresting him , Madison said , “ I think what ’s very interesting in all these stories about me is that the Tin Can Communications Collective was one Twitter feed .
I have found that there were at least 24 Twitter feeds going on , everywhere from the police to the G20 to Ron Paul supporters .
Everybody had their own Twitter feeds going on .
They decided to criminalize me I think , because of the fact that we were in solidarity with the protesters . ”
The protesters in Pittsburgh were kept far away from the actual summit meeting .
The number of protesters was relatively small , and their actions were overwhelmingly peaceful .
Nevertheless , Pittsburgh police , backed by riot squads brought in from other parts of the country , brutally suppressed the protests using batons , rubber bullets , and OC gas .
Sound cannons that had previously been used by the US military in suppressing opposition to the occupation in Iraq were turned against protesters in the US for the first time .
The arrests for the use of Twitter in Pittsburgh and the subsequent police - state raid on the home of Elliot Madison set a dangerous precedent and are an ominous sign of things to come .
The only logic behind the criminal prosecution of Madison is that in informing protesters about police movements , his communications interfered with their being beaten and arrested — that is , with the unconstitutional suppression of their right to assemble and express their views .
The use of the FBI in pursuing this prosecution makes it clear that under the Obama administration the introduction of police - state methods is not only continuing but accelerating .
I have exciting news for you .
Red
Hat has just filed its brief [ PDF ] in Bilski , and it 's saying things you certainly have been hoping someone would express to the Supreme Court .
For one thing , they explain the tech , how programs are algorithms , and thus they should not be patentable .
The brief asks the Supreme Court to adopt the lower court 's machine - or - transformation test , but also -- yay ! -- to exclude software from patentability !
They also lay out clearly the damage that has been done by broadening patents to include abstract ideas , how risky it has become to even try to write software .
Here 's the press release , subtitled Files Amicus Brief Giving Open Source Perspective in Bilski Case and Supporting the Exclusion on Patenting Algorithms .
Also Red Hat 's President and CEO , Jim Whitehurst , has a blog on Bilski .
I love Red Hat .
They stand alone alone so far among vendors , willing to stand up and express what the FOSS community would really say if it could speak with one voice to the Supreme Court .
This is certainly what * I * would say if I had that chance .
And so I am satisfied .
I was going down the depressing list of briefs filed for Petitioner on the ABA 's list of filed amicus briefs , and it was so frustrating to see no one saying anything like what I believe to be technically true about software patents or addressing the specific needs of Free and Open Source software .
At last someone has told them what we wanted to say .
I just hope the Supreme Court has some techies in the clerk pool !
If anyone could do a quick OCR for me , I 'd appreciate it a lot .
- Done .
Here 's the meat of the press release , followed by the brief , minus the header and index , which I 'll add asap : ***************************
Red Hat Urges Supreme Court to Address Difficulties Posed By Patents to Software Files Amicus Brief Giving Open Source Perspective in Bilski Case and Supporting the Exclusion on Patenting Algorithms RALEIGH , N.C. --( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Red Hat , Inc. ( NYSE : RHT ) , the world 's leading provider of open source solutions , today announced it has filed an amicus brief with the United States Supreme Court .
In the brief , Red Hat explains the practical problems of software patents to software developers .
The brief , filed in the Bilski case , asks the Supreme Court to adopt the lower court 's machine - or - transformation test and to make clear that it excludes software from patentability .
The Bilski case involves the standard for patenting a process .
The case concerns a business method patent , but involves many of the same issues as software patents .
 Red Hat continues its commitment to the free and open source software community by taking a strong position against bad software patents ,  said Rob Tiller , vice president and assistant general counsel , IP for Red Hat .
 Our patent system is supposed to foster innovation , but for open source and software in general , it does the opposite .
Software patents form a minefield that slows and discourages software innovation .
The Bilski case presents a great opportunity for the Supreme Court to rectify this problem . 
Patenting of software exploded in the 1990s based on judicial decisions changing the test for patentable subject matter .
Software patents now number in the hundreds of thousands , and they cover abstract technology in vague and difficult - to - interpret terms .
Because software products may involve thousands of patentable components , developers face the risk of having to defend weak - but - costly patent infringement lawsuits .
A new class of business enterprise  patent trolls  has developed to file lawsuits to exploit this system .
The Federal Circuit set forth a clear test to determine if a process is patentable in stating that it must be either tied to a particular machine or apparatus or must transform a particular article into a different state or thing . 
Red
Hat argues that this standard is consistent with Supreme Court case law , and that it should be applied to exclude algorithms , including computer software , from patenting .
The scope of patentable subject matter is an issue of critical importance to the future development of all software , including open source .
The Supreme Court 's Bilski decision could clarify the law and lessen the risks that innovation will be hindered by patents .
Oral argument is scheduled for November 9 , 2009 .
Red Hat has consistently supported patent reform to address problems posed to open source and other software developers .
It previously filed an amicus brief in the Bilski case with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals .

--------
STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF
AMICUS CURIAE RED HAT , INC .
Red Hat , Inc. is the world 's leading provider of open source software and related services to enterprise customers .
1
Its software products are used by Wall Street investment firms , hundreds of Fortune 500 companies , and the United States government .
Headquartered in Raleigh , North Carolina , Red Hat has offices in 28 countries .
Red
Hat 's interest in this proceeding is based on its experience in the software industry and its commitment to the free and open source software community .
Open source software is growing at an exponential rate , 2 and is already of strategic economic importance .
It provides the technological backbone of many large corporations and supports essential functions of many national and regional governments .
It is used daily by millions of individuals for such activities as web searching , email , on - line shopping , and banking .
It is found in devices as varied as mainframe computers , desktop computers , cellular phones , camcorders , medical devices , automobiles , and warships .
The open source model produces software innovation through a mechanism of collaborative development that relies on free communication of ideas among large numbers of independent individuals and companies .
To understand open source , it is helpful to understand generally how software is made .
Software begins as plain text " source code . "
Programmers write and edit source code in human - readable programming languages that allow specification of software features and behavior at a high level of abstraction .
Source code is typically translated by a 2 program called a compiler into " object code " form , which basically consists of a series of instructions to be executed on a computer .
Since object code consists of unintelligible strings of 1s and 0s , software is effectively unmodifiable without access to its source code .
Open source software permits such modification by making the source code available to the user .
Open source software is the product of collaborative development that uses a combination of technological and legal means .
Typically , an open source program originates as a community - based project whose members work together using Internet tools such as email , mailing lists , Internet relay chat , bug reporting systems , wikis , and source code version control systems .
These tools enable rapid communication among geographically dispersed software developers , and make it possible for large numbers of developers from many different backgrounds and organizations to work collaboratively .
A community project makes its software publicly available in source code form , under licensing terms that grant very broad , royalty - free copyright permissions allowing further use , copying , modification and distribution .
In making source code available and conferring broad copyright permissions , open source differs significantly from traditional proprietary software .
A vendor of proprietary software generally develops the software in - house and provides only object code to the user subject to restrictive licenses that allow no rights to copy , modify , or redistribute that code .
Such vendors retain the source code as a trade secret .
The open source development model has proven to be highly effective in producing software of superior 3 quality .
3
Because there are many developers working as collaborators in a distributed fashion , innovation happens rapidly .
4
Because of the many who volunteer their time , and the availability of the source code under royalty - free licenses granting generous modification and distribution rights , the cost of producing and improving software is low .
Software bugs and security problems are quickly identified and remedied .
Moreover , because users have access to the source code , those users can diagnose problems and customize the software to suit their particular needs .
The scope of patentable subject matter is an issue of critical importance to the future development of all software , including open source .
Because open source innovation depends on sharing source code and free collaboration , open source community members do not generally seek to prohibit or control use of open source software through patents , and most open source software developers view software patents as hindering innovation .
Red
Hat respectfully submits that this Court should evaluate the issues at bar with a view to the importance of open source software and the bright promise of future open source innovation .
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
In the decision below , the Federal Circuit issued a course correction .
Beginning in the mid-1990's , that court disregarded the guideposts established by this 4 Court on the limits of patentable subject matter and issued a series of decisions that opened the floodgates for patents on certain kinds of abstract ideas .
As a result , there are now hundreds of thousands of patents on abstract subject matter , and tens of thousands of new patents are now granted each year for software and business methods that were previously excluded from patentable subject matter .
Far from encouraging innovation , this proliferation of patents has seriously encumbered innovation in the software industry .
Software is an abstract technology , and translating software functions into patent language generally results in patents with vague and uncertain boundaries .
Software products are often highly complex , created by combining hundreds or thousands of discrete ( and potentially novel ) elements in a cumulative process .
Because the boundaries of software patents are exceedingly vague and the numbers of issued software patents is now enormous , it is virtually impossible to rule out the possibility that a new software product may arguably infringe some patent .
Thus , under the Federal Circuit 's previous erroneous approach , the risk of going forward with a new software product now always entails an unavoidable risk of a lawsuit that may cost many millions of dollars in legal fees , as well as actual damages , treble damages , and an injunction that terminates a business .
Only those with an unusually high tolerance for risk will participate in such a market .
The more risk averse , no matter how great their business or technical gifts and innovative potential , are likely to avoid such a market and seek their fortunes elsewhere .
5
This case offers an opportunity to restore the historical and well - founded boundaries for patentable subject matter that exclude abstract ideas from patent eligibility .
It also offers an opportunity to reaffirm the rule , supported both by case law and by sound policy , that computer software is among the types of abstract subject matter that are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101 .
The machine - or - transformation test set forth in the decision below is fully consistent with this Court 's prior case law regarding the patenting of abstract ideas .
The Court should adopt this test and make clear that it excludes software from patenting .
ARGUMENT I. THE COURT BELOW CORRECTLY APPLIED THIS COURT'S PRIOR DECISIONS ESTABLISHING THAT ABSTRACT IDEAS ARE NOT PATENTABLE , AND ITS MACHINE-OR -TRANSFORMATION TEST IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE DECISIONS
This Court has long recognized that patents have costs as well as benefits .
See Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 , 68 ( 1972 ) ( explaining Oreilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. 62 ( 1853 ) ) .
Patents do not always promote innovation , and they may substantially hinder it .
See id .
A patent on a process excludes others from using that process .
If the patent is too broad or vague , it may block or discourage technological progress .
Therefore defining the proper subject matter limits of process patents under 35 U.S.C. § 101 is of critical importance .
This requires distinguishing between a patentable " process " within the meaning of Section 101 , and abstract intellectual concepts .
6
Thus this Court has determined that " [ p ] henomena of nature , though just discovered , mental processes , and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable , as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work . "
Benson , 409 U.S. at 67 .
It runs directly counter to the objective of fostering innovation to allow patents that impede scientific and technological progress .
A patent on an algorithm or other abstract idea , as opposed to a specific tangible process , blocks innovation .
Id. at 68 .
To be sure , " [t ] he line between a patentable ' process ' and an unpatentable ' principle ' is not always clear . "
Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584 , 589 ( 1978 ) .
This Court has repeatedly faced this line - drawing problem in the context of computer - related patents , and has consistently articulated the guideposts to be used .
It has affirmed and reaffirmed that " [ t ] ransformation and reduction of an article ' to a different state or thing ' is the clue to patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines . "

Accord Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 , 192 ( 1981 ) ; Flook , 437 U.S. at 589 .
In the mid-1990s , however , the Federal Circuit took an approach at odds with this Court 's teachings in Flook , Benson , and Diehr .
In the leading cases of In re Allapat , 33 F.3d 1526 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) , and State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin. Group Inc. , 149 F.3d 1368 ( Fed. Cir. 1998 ) , cert .
denied , 525 U.S. 1093 ( 1999 ) , the Federal Circuit significantly broadened the standards for patentable subject matter .
These and subsequent Federal Circuit cases ignored the risks of granting patents on abstract ideas , and instead held that usefulness ( " a useful , concrete and tangible result " ) was sufficient to satisfy Section 101 .
7 State Street , 149 F.3d at 1373 ; Allapat , 33 F.3d at 1544 .
As explained in the next section , this departure from this Court 's teachings caused enormous damage to the patent system in general and the software industry in particular .
In the decision below , the en banc court of appeals acknowledged that its " useful , concrete and tangible result " test was problematic .
In re Bilski , 545 F.3d 943 , 959-60 ( Fed. Cir. 2008 ) .
It carefully reexamined this Court 's decisions in Flook , Benson , and Diehr , acknowledged the importance of not extending patentable subject matter so far as to impede technological innovation , and articulated a test that is entirely consistent with those decisions .
Using language from Flook , Benson , and Diehr , the Federal Circuit 's test distinguishes a patentable process from an abstract idea by considering whether " ( 1 ) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus , or ( 2 ) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing . "
Id. at 954 .
The appeals court explained that " the use of a specific machine or transformation of an article must impose meaningful limits on the claim 's scope to impart patent - eligibility . "
Id. at 961 .
In addition , the court explained that " the involvement of the machine or transformation in the claimed process must not merely be insignificant extra-solution activity . "
Id. at 962 ( citing Flook , 437 U.S. at 590 ) .
The decision below thereby corrected the erroneous approach that the Federal Circuit took to Section 101 in the mid-1990s .
The Federal Circuit 's machine - or - transformation test is in full accord with this Court 's prior decisions in Flook , Benson , and Diehr .
8 II .
THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT CORRECTLY ABANDONED A MISINTERPRETATION OF STATUTORY SCOPE THAT HAS CAUSED DRAMATIC HARM TO THE INNOVATION PROCESS IN SOFTWARE
The decision below did not purport to address in categorical terms the patenting of either business methods or software .
It is obvious , however , that the machine - or - transformation test ( or any other replacement test considered by this Court ) will govern attempts to patent these and other abstract ideas .
Patenting of software has been particularly controversial , and presents in a clear form the challenge of separating abstract ideas from patentable processes .
The creation and expansion of the field of software patents therefore is worth considering both as an example of the larger problem posed by abstract patents and a problem in its own right .
A. Software Innovation Long Predated Software Patents
The importance of the software industry to the United States economy is well recognized .
What is less well recognized is that major innovations and economic successes in the software industry occurred prior to the Federal Circuit 's decisions in the mid-1990s encouraging software patents .
Such enormously successful software products as Microsoft Word , Oracle Database , Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , the Unix operating system , and the GNU C compiler all date from the 1980s or earlier -- well before the proliferation of software patents .
Market forces , rather than patents , spurred development of these products .
See To Promote Innovation : The Proper Balance of Competition and Patent Law and Policy , Report of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission , ch. 3 § V , at 46 ( 2003 ) , 9 available at http://www2.ftc.gov/os/
2003/10/innovationrpt.pdf ( hereinafter " FTC Innovation Report " ) .
5 Indeed , in the 1972 Benson decision , this Court took note of the exclusion of software from patenting , of problems caused by attempts to patent software , and of the industry 's impressive growth without patents .
" Direct attempts to patent [ software ] programs have been rejected on the ground of non-statutory subject matter . "
409 U.S. at 72 ( quoting ' To Promote the Progress of . . . Useful Arts , ' The President 's Commission on the Patent System 13 ( 1966 ) ) .
" Indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection , by drafting claims as a process , or a machine or components thereof programmed in a given manner , rather than as a program itself , have confused the issue further and should not be permitted . "
Id .
The Benson Court , quoting the President 's Commission , also noted the inability of the Patent Office to examine adequately software patent applications .
409 U.S. at 72 .
At the same time , the Court noted " that the creation of programs has undergone substantial and satisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and that copyright protection for programs is presently available . "
Id. 10 Thus the software industry began and reached maturity without the benefit of extensive patent monopolies .
This is not to say there was no legal protection for software products .
As the Benson Court noted , copyright law provided ( and it still provides ) substantial protection for software products .
6
This recent history , by itself , calls into serious question whether software patents serve the primary purpose of the patent system of encouraging innovation .
See U.S. Const. art .
I , § 8 .
Many of the world 's most successful software companies and soft - ware products originated and grew strong without incentives from patents .
Instead , these successes arose from the dynamics of the competitive market place .
FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 , § V at 46 .
That is , prior to the expansion of patentability for software in the mid-1990s , survival in the market place for software depended primarily on the ability to innovate better and more quickly than competitors .
Competition , without patent monopolies , resulted in a remarkably dynamic software industry with an impressive record of innovation .
7 11 B. The Proliferation of Software Patents Has Resulted in New Risks that Discourage Innovation Since the mid-1990s , there is one respect in which software patents have been successful as a species : they have proliferated .
At present in the United States there are at least 200,000 issued software patents .
See JAMES BESSEN & MICHAEL J. MEURER , PATENT FAILURE : HOW JUDGES , BUREAUCRATS , AND LAWYERS PUT INNOVATORS AT RISK 22 ( 2008 ) ( hereinafter " PATENT FAILURE " ) , available in part at http://researchoninnovation.org/dopatentswork/.
They continue to increase at the rate of approximately 20,000 per year .
See James Bessen & Robert Hunt , An Empirical Look at Software Patents , 16 J. ECON .
& MGMT .
STRATEGY 157 , 158 ( 2007 ) .
This proliferation has raised significant risks for software developers .
For years , far - sighted industry leaders , scholars , and software developers have warned of these risks and opposed software patents .
See PATENT FAILURE at 189 .
These include Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft .
In 1991 , Mr. Gates stated , " If people had understood how patents would be granted when most 12 of today 's ideas were invented and had taken out patents , the industry would be at a complete standstill today . "

Similar , Donald E. Knuth , Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and one of the world 's most respected computer scientists , wrote in 1994 , " When I think of the computer programs I require daily to get my own work done , I cannot help but realize that none of them would exist today if software patents had been prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s . "

Dr. Knuth also stated , " I strongly believe that the recent trend to patenting algorithms is of benefit only to a very small number of attorneys and inventors , while it is seriously harmful to the vast majority of people who want to do useful things with computers . "
Id .
The views of Mr. Gates and Dr. Knuth were shared by many firms and developers in the 1990s .
PATENT FAILURE at 189 .
The risk that they articulated -- that patents tend to hinder software innovation -- relates to at least two different aspects of software : the incremental nature of software development and the near impossibility of establishing clear boundaries for software patents .
In general , software innovation is cumulative in nature -- that is , new products typically build on products built previously .
See FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 , § V at 44 - 45 ; THE PATENT CRISIS at 47 .
Innovation 13 is rapid and product cycles are short .
8
Major software products are complex , involving many thousands or even millions of lines of code and many different components .
Components are normally developed using many earlier - developed sub-components .
Some software products contain thousands of distinguishable components , any number of which could ( in view of erroneous patenting practices ) already be patented .
See FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 § V at 52 ; THE PATENT CRISIS at 53 - 54 .
It is , however , practically impossible to know with reasonable certainty whether a new software product could be said to infringe some prior software patent .
Patents are conventionally referred to as intellectual property .
However , as James Bessen and Michael Meurer have explained in detail , patents differ substantially from tangible property in that their boundaries are often fuzzy and unpredictable .
PATENT FAILURE at 46 - 72 .
If patents do not give clear notice of their limits , they create a risk of inadvertent infringement .
Vague patents also enable opportunistic behavior .
For example , a patentee may , based on vague language , claim ownership of a technology unknown to the inventor , but instead first conceived by someone else .
Id. at 199 . 9 14 This problem of uncertain patent boundaries is particularly acute with software patents .
Software is an abstract technology .
10 Software algorithms can be represented in numerous different ways , and even computer scientists sometimes disagree over whether two software technologies are equivalent .
See PATENT FAILURE at 22 , 203 .
Thus it is not surprising that software patents are typically framed in abstract language with uncertain boundaries .
See PATENT FAILURE at 23 , 203 ; THE PATENT CRISIS at 27 , 58 .
As a result , a software developer , when shown a software patent , often cannot be sure whether the patent reads on newly developed code .
This difficulty is multiplied hundreds or thousands of times with regard to a complex software product combining hundreds or thousands of discrete components .
A separate but related problem faces all software developers -- that of the impossibility of patent clearance , or determining whether there are existing patents that may be said to read on a new product .
There is no reliable , economical method for 15 searching the hundreds of thousands of existing software patents .
11 PATENT FAILURE at 50 , 69 - 70 .
See also MATH YOU CAN'T USE at 79 - 80 .
The clearance problem is made even worse by the existence of tens of thousands of applications that for eighteen months after filing are unpublished .
Thus , simply by virtue of producing and marketing an innovative software product , a software developer assumes the risk of a costly patent infringement lawsuit .
12 See FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 . § V at 53 - 54 , 56 .
In the U.S. , software patents are more than twice as likely to be the subject of a lawsuit than other patents and account for one quarter of all patent lawsuits .
PATENT FAILURE at 22 , 192 .
The cost of defending a patent lawsuit frequently amounts to several million dollars .
AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW ASSOCIATION , REPORT OF THE ECO - NOMIC SURVEY I - 128-29 ( 2009 ) .
Such lawsuits involve technical issues that are difficult for judges and juries to understand , and so even with a strong defense the outcome is usually far from certain .
If 16 there is a judgment of infringement , the penalty may be an injunction ending further production and enormous monetary damages .
Defense costs and litigation risks are so large that in most cases defendants agree to some payment to settle such cases .
Even when claims appear to have no valid basis , targets frequently agree to pay for licenses based on the mere threat of litigation .
Michael J. Meurer , Controlling Opportunistic and Anticompetitive Intellectual Property Litigation , 44 B.C. L. REV . at 542 .
Some large technology companies have addressed the risk of inadvertent infringement of patents by seeking as many patents as possible , on the theory that a large patent portfolio signals the possibility of a countersuit and thus will deter other companies from bringing a patent lawsuit .
13 See FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 § V at 56 ; THE PATENT CRISIS at 55 .
Companies with such portfolios often enter into cross-licensing agreements with other large companies that have their own patent portfolios in an attempt to obtain a modicum of patent peace .
Id. at 52 .
See RICHARD M. STALLMAN , FREE SOFTWARE , FREE SOCIETY : SELECTED ESSAYS OF RICHARD M. STALLMAN 101-103 ( Joshua Gay , ed. , 2002 ) ; MATH YOU CAN'T USE at 83 - 85 .
While such defensive measures are understandable from an individual enterprise 's perspective , they are 17 far from optimal .
They create a vicious cycle : to defend against a multitude of vague patents , companies obtain still more vague patents .
Resources expended on this strategy are , of course , unavailable for research and development or for other more productive purposes .
FTC Innovation Report , ch. 3 § V at 52 .
Moreover , although established companies may be able to bear the cost of this deterrence strategy , small companies and potential new competitors generally lack the resources to do so .
Thus the system discourages new entry into the market , and thereby hinders innovation .
See id. at 51 - 52 .
See also CLAYTON M. CHRISTENSEN , THE INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA 26 , 52 ( 2006 ) ( showing that small firms generally lead in new technologies ) .
Moreover , even for companies with the financial resources to build patent portfolios , the deterrence approach is not always effective .
With the proliferation of software patents has come the expansion of a class of businesses created expressly for the purpose of exploiting vague patents .
See Ben Klemens , The Rise of the Information Processing Patent , 14 B.U. J. SCI .
& TECH .
L. at 27 -31 ; Meurer , supra .
These are sometimes referred to as non-practicing entities or , less politely , as patent trolls .
These entities acquire vague patents at low cost with a view to threatening or bringing lawsuits against operating businesses .
They frequently conceal their identities and holdings until the companies that are their targets , which have no knowledge of the relevant patents , are locked in to a product and business strategy .
Then they demand ransom .
Because such entities produce no products , they are not deterred by the possibility of a countersuit .
18 In sum , all software companies , developers , and users face substantial risks from software patents .
These risks include whether an unknown patent may cover newly written code or some other preexisting code in a complex product , whether such a patent could be the basis of a lawsuit , whether a relevant patent is in the hands of an aggressive party dedicated to bringing patent lawsuits , and whether a trial may result in an injunction or damages award .
These risks have obviously not brought the software industry to a standstill .
Established companies are protected to some extent by their patent portfolios and war chests .
But for them and even more for new players , software innovation , like sky diving , requires a high tolerance for risk .
See MATH YOU CAN'T USE at 91 .
Developers without a high risk tolerance are likely to find the threat of ruinous lawsuits to be discouraging , and to use their talents and energy in less hazardous endeavors .
Thus software patents discourage new entries into the marketplace and new software innovation .
III .
AN ABSTRACT IDEA DOES NOT BECOME PATENTABLE MERELY BY IMPLEMENTING IT IN COMPUTER SOFTWARE
In connection with addressing the test for excluding abstract ideas from patenting , this Court it should also clarify the application of that test in the context of computer programs that run on general purpose computers .
Lower court case law and commentary since the Federal Circuit 's en banc decision shows that this issue is an important one on which this Court 's guidance is needed .
19
The basic question is whether an otherwise unpatentable idea becomes " tied to a particular machine " when it is implemented in software for execution on a general purpose computer .
Prior to the decision below , the Federal Circuit gave credence to the idea that a general purpose computer could be transformed into a particular machine by executing software .
WMS Gaming Inc. v. Int'l Game Tech. , 184 F.3d 1339 , 1348 ( Fed. Cir. 1999 ) .
On the other hand , this view was recently rejected in Dealertrack , Inc. v. Huber , No. 06-2335 , 2009 WL 2020761 , at * 4 ( C.D. Cal. Jul. 7 , 2009 ) .
Moreover , it has been recently repeatedly rejected by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences .
See , e.g. Ex parte Myr , No. 2009 - 005949 ( BPAI Sept. 16 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Forman , No. 2008 -005348 ( BPAI Aug. 17 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Goud , No. 2008 -003121 ( BPAI July 20 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Daughtrey , No. 2008 - 0202 ( April 8 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Halligan , No. 2008 - 2823 ( BPAI April 8 , 2008 ) ; Ex parte Enenkel , No. 2008 - 2239 ( April 6 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Nawathe , No. 2007 - 3360 ( BPAI Feb. 9 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Gutta , No. 2008-3000 ( BPAI Jan. 15 , 2009 ) ; Ex parte Cornea - Hasegan , No. 2008 - 4742 ( BPAI Jan. 13 , 2009 ) .
This Court 's decisions in Benson and Diehr signal that the mere fact that otherwise unpatentable software is executable on a general purpose computer should not convert such software into a patentable invention .
This is not to say that software may not be part of a patentable process or machine .
As Diehr recognized , an algorithm that is plainly unpatentable by itself may be a part of a process that is patentable when it involves a physical transformation of the sort that has traditionally been considered patentable , such as an industrial process for curing rubber .
450 U.S. at 184-88 .
See also Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. at 20 589-94 .
The Court has also recognized that an otherwise abstract idea may be patentable when " tied to a particular apparatus . "
Flook , 437 U.S. at 588 , n.9 .
In Benson , the patent application covered " a method of programming a general - purpose digital computer to convert signals from binary - coded decimal to pure binary form . "
409 U.S. at 65 .
The Court found that the procedure at issue was a mathematical algorithm , and amounted to an unpatentable abstract idea .
Id. at 65 - 66 .
It is important to note , however , that the algorithm had " no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer . "
Id. at 71 .
The claims were intended to " cover any use of the claimed method in a general - purpose digital computer of any type . "
Id. at 64 .
Thus the algorithm claimed in Benson could have been viewed as " tied to a machine , " inasmuch as it was functionally tied to a digital computer .
Nevertheless , this Court held that the claims were abstract ideas outside the scope of Section 101 .
Thus Benson precludes an interpretation of Section 101 that views abstract ideas as patentable based on their implementation in software running on a general purpose computer .
The more recent decision in Diehr is consistent with this understanding .
The rubber curing process in Diehr involved an algorithm and a computer , but this Court 's analysis of subject matter turned on the claim as a whole , which concerned the physical transformation of the rubber -- not the implementation of the algorithm in a computer program .
450 U.S. at 184-85 .
Diehr explained that use of the computer did not render the process unpatentable , 21 but the decision makes clear , by its focus on the transformation of rubber , that use of the computer alone does not suffice to make the process patentable .
See id. at 187 .
The Diehr Court cautioned against allowing the prohibition on patenting of abstract formulas to " be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment . "
450 U.S. at 191 .
" To hold otherwise would allow a competent draftsman to evade the recognized limitations on the type of subject matter eligible for patent protection . "
Id. at 192 .
In view of this caution , this Court should make clear that the test for patentable subject matter cannot be satisfied by the mere drafting device of adding a general purpose computer as an element in a claim that is otherwise directed to an unpatentable algorithm .
CONCLUSION
The judgment of the Federal Circuit should be affirmed .

Copyright protects authors against the copying of their software .
Patents , of course , block independent invention of patented technology .
Although some patent advocates use the rhetoric of " theft " of ideas to support their arguments , there is evidence that the great majority of patent lawsuits are not against defendants who copied inventions but rather against independent inventors .
DAN L. BURK & MARK A. LEMLEY , THE PATENT CRISIS AND HOW THE COURTS CAN SOLVE IT 28 ( 2009 ) ( hereinafter " THE PATENT CRISIS " ) .
Although it is frequently assumed that patents encourage technological innovation , there is little empirical evidence supporting this view .
In a 2003 report " Patents in the Knowledge - Based Economy , " the National Academies undertook a comprehensive review of the United States patent system , and concluded that " [t ] here are theoretical as well as empirical reasons to question whether patent rights advance innovation in a substantial way in most industries .

Computer software is abstract because it is , in essence , nothing more than a set of mathematical algorithms , expressed in a particular programming or machine language .
An algorithm is a mathematical construct , consisting of a series of steps for solving a problem .
See BEN KLEMENS , MATH YOU CAN'T USE PATENTS , COPYRIGHT , AND SOFTWARE 48 -51 ( 2006 ) ( hereinafter " MATH YOU CAN'T USE " ) .

As Donald Knuth has explained , " [ It is not ] possible to distinguish between ' numerical ' and ' nonnumerical ' algorithms , as if numbers were somehow different from other kinds of precise information . "
See Letter to Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks at 1 .
This Court has held that algorithms are not patentable .
Benson , 409 U.S. at 72 .
The unreliability of indexing for software patents also means that software patents are of little use in advancing innovation by disclosing new technology .
From a software developer 's point of view , it is completely impractical to seek new ideas in patents , and few if any do so .
Most avoid reading patents , for fear that a chance encounter may increase the risk that they will one day be accused of willful infringement .

A further indication of the ineffectiveness of the patent system for software is that there is little patent licensing prior to development and distribution of products .
See THE PATENT CRISIS at 59 .
Because of vague patent boundaries and unreliable search methods , it is not possible to determine all possible rights at issue and strike bargains as to those rights .
Red Hat , like some of its competitors , has built a patent portfolio .
This portfolio is designed to be used only for the purpose of defending against patent aggression .
Red Hat has extended a public Patent Promise under which it pledges not to enforce its patents against parties that infringe those patents through their use of software covered by designated open source licenses .

Other states can treat retirement income taxes very differently .
For example , Tennessee will stop taxing all forms of retirement income entirely in 2021 .
The Hall tax on bond and note interest and stock dividends will be wholly repealed at that time .
Oregon taxes most retirement income at the top rate while allowing a credit of up to $ 6,250 for retirement distributions .
Some states exempt all pension income and most exempt Social Security benefits .
Other states provide only partial exemption or credits , and some tax all retirement income .
Fourteen states currently exempt pension income entirely for qualified individuals .

Retirement - related Tax Reforms
Retirees were affected to some degree on the federal level by the SECURE Act .
This legislation changed the age for taking required minimum distributions ( RMD ) from 70 ½ to 72 for many who recently retired .
The SECURE Act also allows for contributing to a traditional IRA as long as you have earned income .
Four states recently made changes affecting seniors with taxable income :
Connecticut : Increased the exemption on income from the state teachers ’ retirement system from 25 % to 50 % .
The exemption increase will take place starting in January 2021 .
: Increased the exemption on income from the state teachers ’ retirement system from 25 % to 50 % .
The exemption increase will take place starting in January 2021 .
Indiana :
The state is phasing in a military retirement income deduction over four years .
This change started rolling out in 2019 .

West Virginia : Restored a deduction for income received from a defined retirement plan .
Only 13 states impose a tax on Social Security income .
Colorado , Connecticut , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , New Mexico , North Dakota , Rhode Island , Utah and Vermont tax Social Security income .
West Virginia taxes Social Security to some extent but is phasing that tax out entirely by 2022 .
These states either tax Social Security income at the federal level or provide limited breaks for Social Security income .
The breaks are often for lower - income individuals .
How State Income , Property and Sales Taxes Impact Retirement
In addition to state taxes on retirement benefits , consider others when evaluating tax - friendly states for retirees :
State Income Tax
Seven states have no income tax and two only tax interest and dividends .
Several other states have a relatively low tax rate across all income levels .
Arizona , Colorado , Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , New Mexico , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Utah levy tax on income under 5 % .
State and Local Sales Taxes
Forty - five states and the District of Columbia impose a state sales and use tax .
Alaska , Delaware , Montana , New Hampshire and Oregon are free of sales tax , but some Alaska cities charge local sales tax .
States with the highest sales tax rates are California , Indiana , Mississippi , Rhode Island and Tennessee .
Local sales taxes can add significantly to the combined rate , and we ’ve provided that information in our state profiles .
State and Local Property Taxes
Many states and some local jurisdictions offer senior homeowners some form of property tax relief .
Exemptions , credits , abatements , tax deferrals and refunds are among these benefits .
Renters also get tax breaks in some jurisdictions .
Age and income are typical qualifiers for the programs .
State Estate Taxes
Estate taxes can also influence where seniors want to retire .
Many states no longer have an estate tax , and those that do have rules and rates that vary significantly .
While some states exclude the federal amount of $ 11.58 million from estates for taxation purposes , others do not .
Illinois only excludes $ 4 million , and Massachusetts excludes $ 1 million .
Estate tax laws have been in a state of flux in recent years and will probably continue to be so in the foreseeable future .

What the hell is a revange ?
The girl is sexy and pretty wild but that 's about it .
It is realistic that the guy would keep the bag on if he 's got a girlfriend .
Personally judging from his porky arms and body I have no desire to see this guys head .
What 's with the fucking clicking all the way through !
I thought it was the cameraman popping bubblewrap .
Here 's a thought , do n't fuck on a chair that 's older than your granny in a hallway next to two fucking doors and use oh I do n't know , the bed or the floor .
Anything to get away from that fucking creeky chair !
What I 'd actually like to see is that chubby fucker 's chair slide from under him , and watch as I see him crack his head on the door handle on the way down and then watch him struggle and cry on the floor trying to keep the paper bag on on his fat head .
Other than that , nice idea !
I ’ve posted many iPhone game development resources on this website , and I can see that many of the searches on this website are iPhone game development related so I have decided to create this post which is basically a table of contents containing my other iPhone game development posts , along with some new iPhone game development resources that I have not mentioned before .
i Phone Game Engines
When most look to develop a game on the iPhone typically alot of time can be saved by using an already existing game engine .
Some of these engines use Wysiwig editors and their own scripting languages while others provide a collection of functions to us in your code .
Commercial iPhone Game Engine List
Open Source iPhone Game Engine List
Game Engine Resources
Unity 3D and Cocos2D are two widely used game engines , I highly suggest looking into these two engines if you are getting started with iPhone game development .
Unity 3D Game Engine Resources
Cocos2D Resources
Open Source Cocos2D Games
Graphics Programming
You may want to use Core Animation to program your game , often this is the easiest way to program simple 2D games with low performance requirements as you can lay out elements in interface builder and the functions are very easy to understand if you ’ve done other iPhone Objective - C Programming .
Core Animation Resources
OpenGL ES is the rendering API used on the iPhone .
If you are looking for maximum performance and do n’t want to purchase or use an already existing iPhone game engine you will need to use OpenGL ES .
OpenGL ES Resource Sites
OpenGL ES Tutorials
Free Game Graphics
Something I see commonly asked is where to get graphics , well the fact of the matter is you will typically have to pay an artist to create them , or create them yourself , but there are some free graphics available .
The games you can make with these are somewhat limited , but they can be good for prototyping before finding an artist to assist you with iPhone game development .
Massively Large Collection Of Free Graphics Links
Audio Programming
The iPhone uses OpenGL AL , as mentioned above Cocos2D now includes a sound engine , but if you ’re programming from scratch here ’s a basic engine for you to learn from .
Finch Simple OpenAL Sound Engine
Free Game Audio
Here ’s some links to some free audio as with graphics you ’ll typically have to find someone to custom create the sound you want or create it yourself to get things right .

i Phone Game Development Community
You may want to check out iDevGames if you ’re looking for a forum for iPhone game development .
It is fairly active .
i Phone Game Development Tutorials
The guys at 71 squared have put in a tremendous amount of work into creating some iPhone game development tutorials with video , be sure to check them out .

The Eternal Outsider Guido Westerwelle 's Struggle for Popularity
Guido Westerwelle , the leader of the business - friendly Free Democratic Party , is set to become Germany 's new foreign minister after his party scored its best - ever result in national elections .
But does a politician best - known for his ever - changing roles and campaign stunts have the gravitas to be the country 's top diplomat ?
Von SPIEGEL

Both of these are fixable -- the first problem can be fixed by intercepting NM_CUSTOMDRAW and forcing it to return 0 , thus restoring the built - in redraw code , and the second one by sending another LVM_SETTEXTBKCOLOR message to restore an opaque background color .
With these two fixes , the C# app runs as smoothly as the C++ app .
I do n't know why the WinForms team chose such poor defaults .
The way I ended up debugging this involved parallel C++ and C# apps .
Both were fairly vanilla apps made using the built - in app wizards , the C++ one containing a dialog with a list view , and the C# one being the same but with a WinForm .
Okay , I 'll admit that the C++ one was more annoying to write , because programming a Win32 list view directly is a lot of gruntwork .
However , out of the box , the C++ app updated much more smoothly and did n't flicker madly .
I 'll spare you the debugging details -- which include ILDASM , WinDbg , Spy ++ , two instances of Visual Studio , and tracepoints in x86 assembly while debugging in mixed mode -- but I managed to figure out what was going on .
The WinForms ListView is indeed a Win32 ListView with heavy subclassing , but it turns out the poor performance is caused by two bad design decisions on the part of the WinForms team :
Therefore , I had to sit down tonight and figure out how you could make a standard Win32 ListView update so slowly that a 1541 drive could almost keep up with it .
It seems that a perpetual affliction of .
NET WinForms - based applications is slow and flickery repainting .
Part of the problem is .
NET 's insistence on using GDI + , which is not hardware accelerated to any useful extent .
That still does n't explain why so many controls flicker all of the time , even though they 're based on Win32 controls that do n't have the same problem .
Today I hit this problem yet again in a tool , this time with ListView .
It drives me absolutely nuts to see a system with a 3GHz Core 2 and a GeForce 8800 take four seconds to redraw a list view that has three columns and a hundred entries when I drag a column , and even worse , flicker the entire time .

Use a DataGridView instead , it sucks much less .
leppie - 16 09 09 - 00:41
AFAIK there 's no GDI + used within Windows .
Forms at all .
Certainly all of the standard control classes are simply wrappers around underlying windows API controls .
But yes , GDI + is very slow and thus effectively useless for use in professional interative controls or animation .
Not that it is n't used in expensive software suites , Infragistics being a notable example I 'm aware of ( redraw speed is appalling ) .
It can be used but it 's a poor solution IMHO .
locster - 16 09 09 - 02:19
fortunately wpf finally becomes usable in .net 4 thanks to proper text rendering .
tobi - 16 09 09 - 02:36
You can also get relatively good performance out of a .
NET ListView if you set these styles : this .
SetStyle(ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint | ControlStyles .
Opaque , true )
; And then do your own painting using your own backbuffer .
A backbuffer the size of the entire list is expensive and sluggish on resize , so I use a buffer that 's the size of a single list item , and render items to it one at a time so that they do n't flicker on repaint .
Probably not nearly as fast as a fully native ListView but it at least lets you keep owner - draw and get rid of flicker .
Kevin Gadd ( link ) - 16 09 09 - 05:15
I too hate the flicker .
Best and easiest way to really fix this issue is to create a buffered listview like so .
You will be amazed at the perf increasepublic class BufferedListView : ListViewpublic BufferedListView ( ) : base ( ) SetStyle(ControlStyles.OptimizedDoubleBuffer , true ) ;
Scott ( link ) - 16 09 09 - 06:33
DataGridView is more powerful than ListView , but in my experience its performance is awful due to similar painting problems .
The ListView is OK enough that you could still use it , but I do n't consider the DataGridView to be usable in shipping code .
It 's simply unacceptable IMO to have a window take more than four seconds to repaint .
Windows .
Forms does use GDI +.
In fact , it 's the library behind the Graphics class .
It 's true that the system controls do n't use GDI + , but the WinForms wrappers that are based on them do heavy amounts of subclassing and at times substitute System .
Drawing .
Graphics based rendering for the normal GDI - based system rendering .
That 's the main cause of the problem here and why you see rendering bugs in the WinForms controls that do n't manifest in the system controls .
The situation changed somewhat in .NET 2.0 when WinForms started using GDI via TextRenderer to bypass text rendering problems in GDI + , but unfortunately that causes problems where alternating between GDI and GDI + for rendering produces poor performance .
As for double buffering , that 's the lazy way .
It works somewhat and is sometimes easy to do , but in my experience the refresh rate is still poor and CPU usage is high if the update code is still non-incremental .
When writing a control from scratch , I always put in incremental update code first before resorting to double buffering of any kind .
It 's the only way you can hit interactive scrolling speeds and it's also much better over a remote link .
Phaeron - 16 09 09 - 15:44
Hey Phaeron , does the Mono implementation of System .
Windows .
Forms .
ListView have the same issue as the Microsoft .NET Framework implementation ?
King InuYasha ( link ) - 16 09 09 - 17:51
Wow ... what a / mess / the Mono repository is !
The Mono implementation of ListView has very different performance characteristics because it is implemented as custom UI elements on top of a cross - platform drawing / theming layer .
That 's kind of cool in that you can retarget it much more easily and you are n't limited by crappy platform UI libraries .
The downside is the risk that your UI does n't match the native look and feel and lacks platform specific features ( see also : Swing ) .
As such , it definitely is n't affected by the peculiarities of the Win32 control like the .NET version .
In terms of column scrolling , I 'm afraid that the Mono implementation of ListView does n't attempt to do anything special and simply invalidates the whole control ( Redraw ( true ) ) .
Whether or not it flickers , I could n't say without actually running it ; simply drawing a row at a time would largely avoid the problem even without double - buffering , as the flicker window is then limited to a single cell .
In fact , it appears to just redraw itself any time any change to the item collection occurs , which is a bit disappointing .
However , it does at least use graphics layer scrolling commands when scrolled .
Phaeron - 16 09 09 - 18:36
That 's pretty slick except MS is all into WPF .
Too bad because WinForms could have been a decent API to visually design form apps using Win32 controls .
I think WinForms was mainly produced to counter Borland 's Delphi / Builder RAD products ( they hired the same guy too ) .
Oh well .
Rich - 17 09 09 - 16:00
WPF does fix a number of problems with WinForms , but has a couple of issues on its own :1 ) The acronym only has a Hamming distance of 1 from WTF .
Newbie mistake .2 ) Too much of an emphasis on device independent rendering .
Device independent rendering is good when you 're drawing a map , not so much when you want a high - quality desktop UI .
As far as I 'm concerned , Visual Studio 2010 is kind of the make - or - break for WPF -- they 've been forced to fix long standing problems like the text rendering quality , and if Microsoft can't make it work well , it 'll cast some doubt on WPF 's usability for production applications .
Phaeron - 17 09 09 - 17:19
WPF was supposed to be the next great thing in the Windows API world , finally MS gets to ditch Win32 .
It came to being for both web app and desktop app development , complete with fancy graphics to compete even with Flash .
Well , did n't happen , everyone still used Flash and there were plenty of holdouts in the desktop ( XP and below ) .
Heck , even I agree that Win32 still works .
In any case , WinForms and Win32 are n't going away just yet , three cheers for legacy apps , LOL .
Rich - 18 09 09 - 05:03
Dig thru the listview code sometime with reflector and you 'll see some amazing things relating to icon lists .
You 'll see how adding one icon can create 4 or 5 allocations and copies .
How loading an ICO file gets converted to a bitmap , and then BACK to an icon .
There is a line that essentially says " if large icon view , reload the entire icon list every time one is added " .
Greg - 21 09 09 - 00:21
@ Phaeron :
Thanks for some really useful information on building high performance custom controls .
I 'm building my own special purpose listview and your tips helped a lot .
I particularly like your point about adding double buffering only after everything else has been done to ensure high performance .
Avery ( link ) - 17 06 10 - 19:12
@ Phaeron :
Yes , great stuff , and I share your philosophy on how to get drawing fast and flicker - free .
I recently spent two days trying to get fast , clean , flicker - free screen updates as I resized a window that had a several child windows .
The best step I took was to start by * removing * all of the " helpful stuff " I had added to try to reduce flicker .
I could then see what the original problems were , and when I started adding helpers back in , I got to flicker - free with almost none of them .
I did add the offscreen bitmap ( double buffering ) for a graph I was drawing , but only after I had cleaned up everything else .
On another page of the property sheet , I 'm going to have to replace the Win32 edit control , because it flickers an amazing amount .
With 10 lines of text , it will repaint 28 times on one resize .
Ouch !

Here is the mp3 of the 2nd appearance on Kevin Barret ’s show where I explained in detail the rest of the story of the art students .
Kevin Barret ’s Show ( MP3 ) – Jonathan Elinof on the Israeli Art Student Mossad Connection
WATCH : Video of “ ; B - Thing ” ; Art Book
TruthAlliance Archived Link
To hear the details of the WTC Art Student story , listen to the following post from when I was on the Kevin Barret Show for the 2nd appearance .
Although it was made clear that the story was to be released on Kevin Barret ’s show , many missed the broadcast .
This article will contain the information for part 2 of a story I began to break a few weeks ago .
Many misconceptions were and still are spreading about what exactly the implications of the story I broke are .
The truth is , there has to be some background for people to understand the full scope of the investigation .
The Original Art Student Connection to 9/11
In January , 2001 , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , Office of Security Programs ( IS ) , began to receive reports of Israeli art students attempting to penetrate several DEA Field Offices in the continental United States .
Additionally , there have been reports of Israeli art students visiting the homes of numerous DEA employees .
These incidents have occurred since at least the beginning of 2000 , and have continued to the present .
The number of reported incidents increased in November / December 2000 , and has continued to date .
These incidents have involved several other law enforcement and Department of Defense agencies , with contacts made at other agencies ’ facilities and the residences of their employees .
Geographically , these incidents are very widespread , ranging from California to Florida .
The majority of the incidents have occurred in the southern half of the continental U.S. with the most activity reported in the state of Florida .
Since April 2001 , the number of reported incidents has declined , however , the geographic spread of the incidents has increased to Wisconsin , Oklahoma , and Los Angeles .
The activities of these Israeli art students raised the suspicion of IS and other field offices when attempts were made to circumvent the access control systems at DEA offices , and when these individuals began to solicit their paintings at the homes of DEA employees .
The nature of the individuals ’ conduct , combined with intelligence information and historical information regarding past incidents involving Israeli Organized Crime , leads IS to believe the incidents may well be an organized intelligence gathering activity .
It is believed by IS that these incidents should not be the basis for any immediate concern for the safety and security of DEA personnel , however , employees should continue to exercise due caution in safeguarding information relating to DEA investigations , or activities .
DEA Orlando developed the first drug nexus to this group .
Telephone numbers obtained from an Israel Art Student encountered at the Orlando D.O. have been linked to several ongoing DEA MDMA ( Ecstasy ) investigations in Florida , California , Texas , and New York .
The Orlando D.O. has opened an investigation that is being coordinated with DEA HQs .
In general , these individuals appear to be organized in teams of 8 to 10 people , with one person described as the “ ; Team Leader ” ; .
They are usually encountered in pairs or individually carrying a makeshift art portfolio .
Several times , they have , been seen or admitted to being dropped off in an area by the Team Leader , who returns later to pick them up .
The females are usually described as very attractive , and all are generally in their early to mid-20s .
Most admit to having served in the Israeli Military .
This is not surprising given the mandatory military service require in Israel , however , a majority of those questioned have stated they served in military intelligence , electronic signal intercept , or explosive ordinance units .
Some have been linked to high - ranking officials in the Israeli military .
One was the son of a two - star general , one served as the bodyguard to the head of the Israeli Army , one served in a Patriot missile unit .
That these people are now traveling in the U.S. selling art seems not to fit their background .
Their stories are remarkable only in their consistency .
At first , they will state that they are art students , either from the University of Jerusalem , or the Bezalel Academy of Arts in Jerusalem .
Other times they will purport to be promoting a new art studio in the area .
When pressed for details as to the location of the art studio or why they are selling the paintings , they become evasive .
Some claim to be the artist who painted the artwork , others claim they are promoting the work of others or of Israel .
Information has been received which indicates the art is actually produced in China .
When told that they cannot solicit on federal facilities , they will claim that the paintings are not for sale , but that they are soliciting interest in the paintings , either for an art studio or for a future art sale .
An incident report by DEA Tampa has revealed much information relating to these individuals .
DEA Agents at the Tampa District Office questioned the Team Leader of a group of 9 individuals at length , The Team Leader stated he purchases the paintings for $ 8 to $ 10 dollars from an individual in the Hollywood / Ft. Lauderdale , Florida area .
The paintings are then sold for $ 50 to $ 80 dollars .
( Other offices have reported the paintings selling for $ 150 - $ 200 dollars . )
The individuals come to the U. S. on tourist visas , and finance their stay here by selling the paintings .
The Hollywood , Florida area seems to be a central point for these individuals with several having addresses in this area .
There have been incidents where criminal and / or suspicious activity has been associated with these individuals .
Two were arrested by FPS in Plantation , FL with counterfeit Social Security Cards .
Baton Rouge , LA discovered a small amount ( personal use amount ) of marijuana in the residence of one group , and some of the individuals interviewed by DEA / Tampa admitted to smoking marijuana .
Criminal records checks have revealed some arrest history on persons associated with these groups .
Passport irregularities have been reported .
A review of their passports shows travel to several other countries , to include Thailand , Laos , India , Kenya , Central and South America , Australia , Germany , Amsterdam , and Canada .
One individual presented a Canadian citizenship card along with his Israeli passport .
A report from EPA / Denver involved a female art student going to the house of an EPA Special Agent to sell art , and returning later to photograph the house .
There is a report of one of these individuals being seen diagramming the layout of a federal facility .
This information has not been directly reported to DEA , and has not been confirmed by first - hand observation .
When encountered at residences , some of these individuals are persistent in trying to get inside the home .
Some have asked to use the telephone when leaving .
Some employees have reported that they came only to their house , while others have reported that the students approached the entire neighborhood .
The B - Thing Connection
The members of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council were invited to use the 91 and 92 floor in WTC Tower 1 , as part of a residency program ( World Views program ) from 1997 to 2001 .
In this program , the Gelitin crew , according to the New York Times article and the insert in the book I obtained from Gelitin , there were 14 art students who specifically shared the 91st floor together that knew and / or where involved in “ The B Thing . ”
According to the photos , those in the helicopter , across the street , and in the tower on the morning of the stunt number to around 6 , although 4 are listed as having been involved in the stunt .
There was a photographer on the ground taking photos of the helicopter and there were 2 other females with the 3 pictured men in the tower performing the stunt , so that added with the helicopter makes a minimum of 6 involved .
Then there was the dealer of the art group who allegedly watched from a hotel .
The New York Times article states , “ Their dealer , who witnesses say watched the event from a hotel suite , now claims it never happened . ”

The night before the B - Thing , Mr. Harris said , he rented a top - floor suite at the Millennium Hilton , across the street from the Gelatin studio , and invited people to what guests described as a night of decadence .
Near dawn , he and several others took cameras and boarded a helicopter , communicating with Gelatin via cell phone .
” If you write about the balcony , maybe you can just not write about it too much , ” Ari Janka said to the New York Times to say after the initial interview he did with them , the first of several calls that allegedly took place protesting the appearance of the article released by the New York Times , despite the fact that the artists had published the book .
Josh Harris , the Internet entrepreneur once known for holding extravagant art parties , explained that Leo Koenig , the 24 - year - old art dealer who represents Gelatin , got him involved .
Mr. Koenig now says the balcony stunt never happened and , at any rate , he did n’t see it .
The book is meant to provoke questions about its veracity , he said .
At the suggestion that the project might have been faked , Mr. Harris seemed almost offended .
He produced March 2000 credit card bills bearing charges of $ 2,167.44 from the Millennium Hilton and $ 1,625 from Helicopter Flight Service .
Moukhtar Kocache , the director of the studio program , insisted that the photos of the balcony were obviously faked .
But digital manipulation experts disagreed .
George Dash , the co-owner of Nucleus Imaging on East 30th Street , and a colleague , John Grasso , used magnifying loupes to examine a copy of ” The B - Thing . ”
Neither could detect inconsistencies .
” The angles are all too perfect , ” Mr. Grasso said .
” It looks real to me .
Absolutely .
I ’ve been doing this for 22 years . ”
Let me make clear that this stunt specifically was performing a construction operation in the WTC that was illegal according to WTC Security and the New York Times Article which states that certain people would have needed to of been contacted to remove a window from a building in New York as to not violate building codes and such .
No one was contacted to be there outside the members involved in the stunt itself .
It was initially denied that the stunt even took place , according to the New York Times , “ Cherrie Nanninga , the director of real estate for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which until recently ran the World Trade Center .
Port Authority officials , shown a copy of ” The B - Thing ” by a reporter , reacted with disbelief , then outrage .
Although their own investigation turned up no evidence , Ms. Nanninga said , ‘ we have no reason to believe it did n’t happen . ’
Window removal is considered so dangerous that when it is done the streets below are cordoned off , she said .
” It was really a stupid and irrational act that in my view borders on the criminal , ” she said , adding that the stunt had jeopardized the studio program , whose space is donated by the Trade Center . ”
Well it was criminal , because according to the New York skyscraper codes , she was right .
The street would of needed to have been cordoned off and permits issued for the removal of a window , which is why in the insert of the book released by the art students , “ Everything top secret and illegal of course .
In days of conspiratorial work …
They kept very mum about it all , because if word had crept out about their coup they could have been fined very heavily for sabotaging a national treasure …
Incidentally , as proof that they were there , there is now a piece of old chewing gum stuck to the outside of the building at a dizzy height , ” writes Tex Rubinowitz , in “ The B - Thing . ”
The art book shown in the video above shows the photos and drawings available to the public , however , after contacting some individuals involved with the stunt and a source who now lives in San Francisco who worked at the WTC on 9/11 , I have obtained some other documents that never made it to the book , including a WTC construction pass .
Willie Rodriguez , one of the janitors who worked at the WTC and helped save lives that day , was the last person pulled from the rubble and was even recognized by the president for his actions .
Aside from experiencing basement and sub - level explosions on 9/11 before the 1st plane hit , he also stated that he did see the art students in the WTC in an email exchange I had with him .
So why is all this information about an innocent art stunt so important , aside from the fact that these individuals had WTC construction passes in 2000 before releasing their book in August of 2001 ?
Because according to the DEA report on the investigation into a separate story of art students in the country penetrating military bases , government agencies and so fourth as a part of a spy ring , 2 names show up in the arrests of over 140 spies that sparked interest for me .
Hanan Serfaty was arrested by DEA agents in connection to the Israeli spy ring .
What makes him stand out , is that he was listed as being an art student who was apart of the World Views program , which was in the World Trade Center on floors 90 and 91 in the Lower Manhatten Cultural Council .
Although he is not listed by Gelitin as a member of “ The B - Thing , ” the listing of the identities of the other 14 students who were on floor 91 at the time was never released to the public , neither was the total list of those involved in the stunt which numbers at a minimum of 6 .
It should be noted that 1 member of the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council died on 9/11 while working in his studio on the 91st floor .
His name appears on the list of those who were in the building when it came down .
Hanan was an “ ; art student ” ; who was a former Israeli military intelligence officer who rented two Hollywood apartments close to the mail drop and apartment of Mohammed Atta and four other hijackers .
Serfaty was moving large amounts of cash : he carried bank slips showing more than $ 100,000 deposited from December 2000 through the first quarter of 2001 ; other bank slips showed withdrawals for about $ 80,000 during the same period .
Serfaty ’s apartments , serving as crash pads for at least two other “ ; art students ” ; , were located at 4220 Sheridan Street and 701 South 21st Avenue .
Lead hijacker Mohammed Atta ’s mail drop was at 3389 Sheridan Street–approximately 2,700 feet from Serfaty ’s Sheridan Street apartment .
Both Atta and Marwan al - Shehhi , the suicide pilot on United Airlines Flight 175 , which smashed into World Trade Center 2 , lived in a rented apartment at 1818 Jackson Street , some 1,800 feet from Serfaty ’s South 21st Avenue apartment .
In fact , an improbable series of coincidences emerges from a close reading of the 2001 DEA memo , the 9/11 Commission ’s staff statements and final report , FBI and Justice Department watch lists , hijacker timelines compiled by major media and statements by local , state and federal law enforcement personnel .
In at least six urban centers , suspected Israeli spies and 9/11 hijackers and / or al - Qaeda¬ connected suspects lived and operated near one another , in some cases less than half a mile apart , for various periods during 2001 in the run-up to the attacks .
In addition to northern New Jersey and Hollywood , Florida , these centers included Arlington and Fredericksburg , Virginia ; Atlanta ; Oklahoma City ; Los Angeles ; and San Diego .
Israeli “ ; art students ” ; also lived close to terror suspects in and around Dallas , Texas .
A 25 - year - old “ ; art student ” ; named Michael Calmanovic , arrested and questioned by Texas - based DEA officers in April 2001 , maintained a mail drop at 3575 North Beltline Road , less than a thousand feet from the 4045 North Beltline Road apartment of Ahmed Khalefa , an FBI terror suspect .
Dallas and its environs , especially the town of Richardson , Texas , throbbed with “ ; art student ” ; activity .
Richardson is notable as the home of the Holy Land Foundation , an Islamic charity designated as a terrorist funder by the European Union and U.S. government in December 2001 .
Sources in 2002 told The Forward , in a report unrelated to the question of the “ ; art students ” ; , that “ ; Israeli intelligence played a key role in helping the Bush administration to crack down on Islamic charities suspected of funneling money to terrorist groups , most notably the Richardson , Texas - based Holy Land Foundation , last December [ 2001 ] ” ; .
It ’s plausible that the intelligence prompting the shutdown of the Holy Land Foundation came from “ ; art student ” ; spies in the Richardson area .

Il y a moins de deux mois était annoncé l'intégration dans la branche - staging du noyau Linux d'un pilote GPL v2 écrit par Microsoft .
Ce pilote , destiné à faire fonctionner un système Linux en tant qu'invité ( guest ) de son système de virtualisation Hyper - V , était la première contribution de Microsoft au noyau libre et elle avait été célébrée comme il se doit par les partisans de Linux .
L'entreprise Microsoft avait également généré une très bonne presse ( plusieurs centaines d'articles ) grâce à cette contribution même si , il ne faut pas se voiler la face , l'écriture de ce patch était effectué de renforcer l'attractivité de Windows en tant que plate - forme de virtualisation .
Tout va donc pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes ?
Hélas depuis Candide nous savons que le monde est un peu plus compliqué que ça .
Greg Kroah - Hartman vient d'envoyer un mail récapitulatif sur l'état des divers pilotes se trouvant dans la branche - staging .
Si on regarde la partie consacrée aux pilotes qui vont entrer dans le noyau 2.6.32 on trouve ceci :" .
Un peu plus haut dans son mail Greg avait expliqué clairement ce qui était tolérable et ce qui ne l'était pas :" .
Conclusion : Chez Microsoft il va falloir apprendre à travailler à la façon Linux .
On ne balance pas un gros tas de code ( ne suivant même pas les conventions de style ) en se disant que ça ira bien comme ça .
Il faut maintenir le code .
Il faut l'adapter , il faut le corriger , il faut l'améliorer et le peaufiner en permanence .
C'est bien de faire un coup médiatique , de recevoir des louanges et de passer pour des preux chevaliers qui travaillent en suivant les règles ( GPL et tout ça ) .
Mais quand ensuite on disparait de la circulation et on ne daigne même pas répondre au mails du mainteneur de la branche staging ... ben faut pas s'étonner si on reçoit moins de louanges et si on se fait éjecter du noyau .
Le monde du libre est une méritocratie et si Microsoft veut une compatibilité de Linux avec son hyperviseur il va falloir bosser .
In the past we ’ve talked about how to scan your signature to help go paperless .
In this post , we are going to look at the fundamentals behind sending truly encrypted emails and documents that can be verified with a digital signature .
The idea is to show you the concepts so you understand what is going on behind the scenes to make a secure communication channel over email .
So why spend the time on this ?
As we switch to doing more business over the internet , secure communications are going to become much more important .
Even if you do n’t have a use for encryption right now , you probably will over the next 3 to 5 years ( if not before ) .
There is a lot of value in understanding why email encryption is secure–even if you do n’t understand all the complicated math behind it .
I find it frustrating that so few people and businesses use email encryption and a digital signature on their emails .
If businesses would use encrypted emails , they could just send me a PDF of my bill instead of requiring me to login and download my bill from their website .
Many of the processes that currently require printing on dead trees and then using dead dinosaurs to transport sheets of paper through the mail could be done electronically if more people would use encryption .
This article is me doing my little part to help raise awareness of how encryption works .
If you want to help save paper and think this article is useful , please pass it on to someone else .
Encrypting a Document
To use a digital signature or encryption you must have a digital id also known as a digital certificate .
A digital id / digital certificate used to do two things .
First , it can be used to do email encryption or encrypt files so that they can only be read by the person they are intended for .
Second , it can be used to “ sign ” or place a digital signature on a document to guarantee that it arrives in the same state it was originally sent and no one has added or changed things .
A digital id or digital certificate consists of a public and private key .
Your public key is shared with everyone .
Your private key is kept private .
These keys are text documents full of what appears to be random numbers and letters , but with the proper algorithm , these numbers and letters have a very unique property .
If you take a document and run it through an algorithm with your public key , you get back an encrypted document or an encrypted email .
Once it is encrypted , the public key ca n’t be used to decrypt the document .
The process is one way so it does n’t matter if other people have the public key , they ca n’t read the document .
To decrypt the document you must have the private key .
If you give the encrypted document to an algorithm with the private key , you will get back the original document .
An Email Encryption Example
Lets start with Tom and Suzie .
They want to communicate securely to keep Hitler from reading their messages .
They are going to use email encryption to communicate .
First Tom , sends Suzie his public key .
This usually happens automatically when Tom sends Suzie a normal email message .
Their email programs handle sending Tom ’s key and recording it on Suzie ’s side of things .
When Suzie sends
Tom a regular message , Tom gets her key as well .
Suzie takes
Tom ’s public key and uses it to encrypt an important message .
Then she emails the encrypted message to Tom .
But wait !
Hitler intercepts the message by infiltrating Suzie ’s ISP and breaking into her email .
He now has the encrypted email message that Suzie sent to Tom .
Hitler also has Tom ’s public key that Tom sent to Suzie .
However , no matter what Hitler does with the public key , he ca n’t decrypt the message .
The only thing that can decrypt the message is the private key that Tom keeps safe .
Email encryption prevents
Hitler from reading the message–even though he has a copy of the email that was transmitted over the internet .
When Tom gets the message from Suzy , he takes his private key and uses that to decrypt the message .
He can now read Suzie ’s email .
It does n’t matter who else gets a copy of the email that Suzie sent .
Email encryption insures that Tom is the only one who can unlock it as long has he does n’t share his private key .
If he wants to reply to Suzie , he simply uses her public key to encrypt his reply and sends it back to her .
Signing a Document with a Digital Signature
With an understanding of how documents can be encrypted , we can look at how to “ sign ” a document using a digital signature .
This is very different than a scanned signature that merely attaches an image of your written signature to a document or email .
An encrypted document does two things .
It guarantees that the document was n’t modified in route .
It guarantees that no one else can read the document .
For a lot of communication , item two is n’t necessary or even desired .
For example , if I want to send a message out to 25 people , chances are pretty high that it is n’t extremely confidential .
In fact , sending a separate message to each person encrypted with their public key might be quite a burden .
However , I still may want each recipient to be guaranteed that the document came from me and that it was n’t modified in transit–we want to put a digital signature on it that says guarantees who sent it and that it was n’t modified .
Outside of signed email , I may want to post a message on a website that can be read by the world where anyone can check to make sure that the message has n’t been changed from when I wrote it and confirm that it was truly written by me .
A slightly different example of this is when a company posts a piece of software or a patch for existing software .
The people who will download it want some way to know that they are getting a legitimate file and not a virus that was posted by hackers to trick people .
This is where signing a document ( or file ) comes into play .
Signing a document ( applying your digital signature to it ) guarantees the first two items on the list , but does it in a way that allows anyone to read it .
People can verify your digital signature without getting a digital id or digital certificate for themselves .
This can be difficult to explain , so I am going to simplify the math a bit .
My version wo n’t be nearly as secure as what is actually used , but it will give you a good general idea of how it operates .
Checksums
First , let ’s talk about checksums .
A checksum is a simple way to send an extra piece of information along with some data that can be used to make sure that the data is the same on both sides .
In human terms , this is kind of like asking someone to repeat a number back to you over the phone .
While repeating information back works fine for short numbers , it could be a bit troubling if you have large amounts of data .
So we create a short cut .
Let ’s say that , for some reason , I ’m trying to give you the values of 100 checks over the phone .
I ’m reading them from Excel and you are typing them into Excel .
In the end , we want to make sure that we did n’t miss anything .
I could have you repeat all the numbers back to me , but that would take a long time .
Instead , I might ask you to give me the total .
If your total matches my total , then one of two things happened :
We successfully transferred the numbers verbally .
We made some mistakes that perfectly canceled each other out .
Since option two is pretty unlikely when dealing with a large list of numbers , we can assume ( with a reasonable degree of certainty ) that we did n’t make a mistake .
Computers use checksums in a similar way .
Back in the days of modems , computers would send an 8 bit byte where the last bit was a checksum .
So , the computer might send a binary message that looked like this :
01101010
The first 7 bits contained the data : 0110101 .
The last bit is the checksum was used to tell if there were an even or odd numbers of ones present in the data .
In this case we are using a 0 to say that there are an even number of ones .
If the receiving computer got a byte where the number of even bits and the checksum bit disagreed , it would ask for that data to be sent again .
This type of approach reduces accidental errors .
However , it does nothing toward preventing someone from intentionally changing the data .
If you wanted to change the data en route , it would be simple to flip the checksum bits to match whatever you wanted to send in the data .
We need a way of generating a checksum type value that is hard to fake .
Hashes for Digital Signatures
In simple form , a hash is an algorithm ( or set of steps ) that you can run a piece of data through ( text , a file , etc. ) and get out a number that represents the original .
You ca n’t recreate the original from the number , but for most practical purposes you can use that number to represent the input .
In other words , it will be very difficult to find another input file ( or text ) that will produce the same output .
Let ’s construct a simple hash of the following text :
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy hound .
Our hash is going to be created by multiplying the number of letters by the number of words .
38 letters
9 words
38 x 9 = 342
So now if I send you this message , I can include the number 342 .
You can do the math on the message you receive and it will give you a pretty good idea if the message is the same as what was sent .
Obviously , this type of solution will only protect against unintentional changes in the data .
If someone changes the email in route , they could just as easily change the number “ 342 ” to match whatever the hash is for their modified message .
If we want to protect against this , I can send the hash value through a different channel .
For example , I could send you the message via email and then call you on a secure phone line and say , “ the hash value is 342 ” .
That way if someone wanted to modify the message , they could only change it to something that produced a hash value of 342 .
( In our very simple hash algorithm , this would be hard , but doable .
With the complex hash algorithms that are actually used , it would be impossible , for all practical purposes . )
Obviously , it is inefficient if I have to call you up on the phone .
We need some way to put a secure channel in the email .
If I try to encrypt the hash number with your public key , the message is only readable by you –I might as well just encrypt the whole message .
If I encrypt it with my public key , then I ’m the only one who can read it –not particularly useful either .
But look what happens when I encrypt it with my private key .
We now have the value 342 encrypted in a way that can be opened by anyone with my public key .
Since my public key is the only thing that can decrypt that value , it guarantees them that I was the one who originally encrypted the number 342 .
If someone wants to change the message and change the hash value , they would have to be able to encrypt it with my private key .
So , when you send messages signed with a digital signature , the hash value guarantees that the message has n’t been changed .
Encrypting the hash value with your private key allows anyone to verify that the hash value , itself , has n’t been changed using your public key .
This is normally handled automatically by your software , and it will give you a warning if you get a message where decrypting the hash value produces a different number .
The encrypted hash value is added as a small attachment or added to the bottom of the email .
Conclusion
And there you have it .
You now understand encryption and digital signatures better than 99 % of the population .
If you are interested in starting to use email encryption , I recommend getting a free set of certificates from Thawte or Comodo .
( Thawte may be canceling their free program , so Comodo may be the better choice . )
The setup process is fairly simple and they have instructions on how to get various email clients configured .
As I said before , this article is me trying to do my part to help society move from paper to digital .
If you want to help , please take a few minutes to share this with someone else .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Foreign aid may provide the best value for money spent by the U.S. government , Bill and Melinda Gates said Tuesday , but few seem to know it .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates delivers a speech during a dedication ceremony for the Gates Center for Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania September 22 , 2009 .

They launched a new project to try to publicize some public health successes in foreign aid , to encourage the U.S. and other governments to keep giving money .
“ Dollar for dollar , global health is America ’s best investment for saving lives , ” Gates told reporters .
“ U.S. - supported global health programs are saving and improving the lives of millions of people . ”
Gates , the billionaire Microsoft founder who retired in 2008 , has given millions of his own money to programs such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization or GAVI and the Global Fund for AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
But he said government money is vital , too , and a new website , www.livingproofproject.org, shows it is working , he said .
Gates ’s wife Melinda , who with Gates heads the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , said she helps check up on money that has gone toward helping causes -- and been pleasantly surprised .
“ When we make an investment we are going to go back and make sure did it work .
We see that these things are working , ” she said .
“ We realize that we are seeing a lot of hope on the ground .
The hope is really palpable . ”
Gates said he wanted to thank taxpayers and to ask the administration of President Barack Obama , along with Congress , to do more .
“ U.S. support has already helped to reduce deaths of young children by more than 50 percent in the past 50 years .
If we keep up our commitment , it ’s possible to cut child mortality in half again , ” Gates said .
“ What ’s more , we can do it with proven interventions that already exist . ”
This includes the distribution of AIDS drugs by the President ’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or PEPFAR , launched in 2003 , a Global Fund project to distribute mosquito nets and insecticides to fight malaria , and the distribution of vaccines to prevent diarrhea and pneumonia by the GAVI Alliance .
“ I think a little does go a long way .
But a lot more is needed , ” Gates said .
“ We still have 4 million children who die in the first week of life , ” Melinda Gates added .
Simple education programs can prevent many of these deaths , she said .
The efforts are bipartisan and not political , they said .
“ There have been people in both parties who have been willing to take the risk .
So far it has n’t been that one party is for saving babies ’ lives and another party has taken a position against that , ” Bill Gates said .
“ We want to make sure these things do n’t get cut just because people do n’t understand the effect they are having , ” Melinda Gates said .
The money does not always disappear to “ dictator ’s mansions , ” Bill Gates added .
THE Nobel prizes are probably the best - known of the many annual awards for excellence in a particular field .
They offer great prestige and a sizeable cash reward , paying around $ 1.4 m to the winner .
Other awards deliver more money , however .
The Ibrahim prize rewards African leaders for governing well with $ 5 m over ten years , and another $ 200,000 each year thereafter .
The X Prize , offered in a number of categories , is even more valuable but is handed out for one - off achievements .
Writers and thinkers wanting to supplement their bank accounts handsomely may wish to turn to spirituality or a Spanish - language novel rather than journalism .

Canonical is working hard these days to redesign the Ubuntu installer ( also known as Ubiquity ) into something a little more in tune with our times .
We 've already told you in our latest report on Ubuntu 9.10 ( Karmic Koala ) Alpha 4 that Ubiquity has now a " Quit " button during all the installation steps , so you can quit the installer at any time .
Moreover , the time zone selection items have been changed a little to reflect the region / zone only , and not the city .
Today we will present , exclusively for our readers here at Softpedia , what the Ubuntu developers intend to add next in the Ubiquity installer .
The package is called " ubiquity - slideshow - ubuntu " and it is designed to offer an Ubuntu - flavored slideshow for the Ubiquity installer .
What this means ?
Those of you who installed Microsoft Windows XP or Mandriva Linux , or OpenSuSE already know what this slideshow is supposed to do .
Long story short , it will display some content , every 20 seconds or so , especially created to introduce new users to the Ubuntu operating system , while installing it .
Please take a look at the video clips below to see a mockup content for the Ubiquity slideshow .
The second video was provided to us by Mads Rosendahl ( MadsRH ) .
" The technology and design for our slideshow is now reasonably established , so it 's time to polish up the content and get things rolling towards a release .
There have been many good ideas about how to treat the content for the slideshow .
Some different opinions on the writing style , the topics covered and the types of users who will be viewing this .
So far , there is a lot of room for interpretation .
It seems that the best way to get things rolling will be to lay out all the guidelines , thoughts and content in a reasonably equal fashion , all at once , and then DECIDE ( preferably on something that is already done , since time is fairly critical here ) . " - said the developers .
The content that will be featured in the Ubiquity slideshow is still to be determined .
For now , they divided it into two main categories :
1 . Some simple text about various applications and what you can do with them ; 2 . Original content , with normal paragraphs , about the Ubuntu operating system and some included applications .
Both categories will include the following slides :
· Welcome message · Browse the web with Firefox · Relive Memories with F - Spot Photo Manager · Accessibility in Ubuntu · Ubuntu speaks fluently · Control your digital life with Evolution · Keep in contact with Pidgin IM · OpenOffice - Office tools at your fingertips · Watch and listen on Ubuntu · Installing additional software · Getting Help with Ubuntu
For more information about the content / paragraphs that will be displayed during a normal Ubuntu installation , please check here and here .
We will keep you updated with any other upcoming changes for the next release of the Ubuntu operating system , Karmic Koala , due for release in late October .

Shadow Chancellor George Osborne has outlined plans to raise the state pension age for men to 66 from 2016 , up to 10 years earlier than planned .
He said the move was needed to help reduce the UK 's debts , saying " hard choices could not be avoided " because of the dire state of public finances .
The pension age for women will rise to 65 by 2020 under Tory proposals .
Mr Osborne unveiled a package of money - saving measures , including a one - year public sector pay freeze .
' Sea of debt '
He told the party 's conference that tough measures were needed after 12 years of " feckless irresponsibility " under Labour which had left Britain " sinking in a sea of debt " .
Raising the state pension age for men , currently 65 , from 2016 would enable the UK to afford an across - the - board increase in the basic state pension for everyone , he said , by restoring the link between pensions and earnings .
Under the government 's existing plans , the state pension age for men will rise gradually from 65 to 68 between 2024 to 2046 .
For women it will gradually rise from 60 to 65 over ten years from 2010 .
But the Conservatives say this is not " ambitious enough " given rising life expectancy and the scale of the UK 's debts .
No -one who 's a pensioner today , or approaching retirement soon , will be affected
George Osborne
Flanders :
An embarrassment of cuts
Anger at public pay freeze plan Mr Osborne told the Conservative Party conference both men and women 's state pension ages were due to rise over the next decade but " most experts " - including the author of the recommendation Lord Turner - believed now that was " too far off " .
" We will hold the review which the Turner Report itself proposed and which the government has never held , " he said .
" Our aim will be to bring forward the date when the pension age rises .
This is already happening in Germany , in Holland and in Australia .
We will ensure that no increase will happen until the second half of the next decade , in the parliament after next . "
' Big issues '
He said men's state pension age would not start to rise to 66 until at the earliest 2016 while women would not see their state retirement age rise from 65 to 66 until " at least " 2020 .
" No - one who 's a pensioner today , or approaching retirement soon , will be affected .
But this is how we can afford increasing the basic state pension for all , " he said .
Bringing the move forward would mean many more people than previously expected , particularly those aged between 49 and 59 , having to work a year longer before qualifying for a state pension .
The Conservatives say the rise in the pension age will save £ 13bn a year but ministers have criticised the move as " deeply unfair " .
Earlier , Tory leader David Cameron said the pension plans were underpinned by " a genuine desire " to ensure pensioners were not " left behind " and were able to retire with " security and dignity " .
He acknowledged that the decision could prove unpopular with some but said he wanted his party to " face up to the big issues " and be upfront about dealing with the public finances .
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson said the Tories had clarified that the earliest date at which all women would have to work until the age of 66 before receiving their state pension was 2022 .
' Massive uncertainty '
Mr Cameron told the BBC it was " out of the question " that women would suddenly see their state pension age rise from 63 to 66 in 2016 .
But Labour said that the plans were " deeply unfair " and would create huge uncertainty , particularly for women .
" This is an appalling way to treat older people , " said Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper .
" You can't just tell people in their late fifties to rip up their retirement plans because they have to work up to three years longer .
She added : " They want to hit low paid workers in their late fifties , but they 're still backing tax cuts on millionaires ' estates .
This shows how out of touch David Cameron and George Osborne are . "
For the Liberal Democrats , Steve Webb said the plans would create " massive uncertainty for millions of people " .
He said : " Women have been a total afterthought to this announcement .
It is simply impossible for the Tories to save £ 13bn a year by raising the state pension age for men alone .
" George Osborne 's plans would require the pension age for women to increase each year until 2016 .
The Tories must come clean or risk leaving every woman in the country in a pensions limbo . "

I 've used Mozilla 's flagship browser since before Phoenix , the first version of Firefox , existed .
Been using Chrome on Linux for a few months now , and I 've mostly moved my day to day habitual browsing to it .
Although there are some " Linux just seems to suck at doing this still " issues , like having audio always just work , they are n't unique to Chrome .
Still , I 've found a few things that I miss from Firefox , or I wish chrome would do given its additional features .
For general purpose browsing :
" / " quick search a - la VIM or Firefox
URL autocompletion more like Firefox's " awesome " bar
middle - click on page body goes - to URL in X clipboard
ability to save textarea resize as a preference on a per domain basis
some kind of UI to ad - hoc add sites to " ignore this bad SSL cert " white list
when I click a dropdown , I want to be able to type the selection right away , not have to click away and leave the dropdown selected
Developmenty things :
view selection source
slightly less buggy DOM inspector
selection based DOM inspector w/ highlighting , like firebug's
do n't view XML documents by simply stripping all tags and showing a space separated list of text nodes
The top item from each category are the main barriers to me adopting Chrome for most of the duties that I still use Firefox for .
In general though , there are a lot of things I like about Chrome .
V8 has been an improvement on most websites , anecdotally .
WebKit does a few things far better than the versions of Gecko that I have been using , chief among them is scaling the text size up and down , which is something I tend to do quite often for some reason .
I like that resources are hyperlinked when I am viewing source .
I 'm not sure the actual " weight " of actions , but everything that is there feels snappier .
This could all do with Firefox 's record keeping ; some of my sqlite files for URL history , etc , exceed 100MB in Firefox , and I find myself often seeing IO wait spike for seemingly no reason when using Firefox , whereas I do n't normally experience this in Chrome .
The decision to use processes for each tab masks to some extent the true memory footprint of Chrome ( whereas Firefox is always easy to see ) , but it also means that I tend to reclaim memory when I close tabs , rather than growing indefinitely to whatever the maximum capacity is .
I can generally run Chrome alongside Firefox , whereas if I was running two distinct Firefoxes I 'd probably get myself into some trouble .
In the long run , subsequent revisions of Firefox might surpass Chrome in being slim , but that 's not the trajectory that software usually takes .
I 'm not sure what Chrome 's security record is like on Windows , but I 'd recommend checking it out for most users .
For developers , you 'll probably still need a copy of Firefox nearby , but for Linux users who never liked Konqueror , it 's great to regularly experience sites in WebKit and Gecko .
Tahoe is a secure distributed filesystem that is designed to conform with the principle of least authority .
The developers behind the project announced this month the release of version 1.5 , which includes bugfixes and improvements to portability and performance , including a 10 percent boost to file upload speed over high - latency connections .
Tahoe 's underlying architecture is similar to that of a peer - to - peer network .
Files are distributed across multiple nodes in a manner that allows data integrity to be maintained in the event that individual nodes are compromised or fail .
It uses AES encryption to protect file contents from tampering and scrutiny .
Tahoe can be used to establish a relatively fault - tolerant storage pool that spans a number of conventional computers over a local network or the Internet .
This approach to cloud storage might be more appropriately described as " crowd " storage .
Tahoe was originally developed with funding from Allmydata , a company that provides Web backup services .
When Allmydata was originally founded , the company had some highly ambitious plans for distributed storage .
It initially offered a service through which individual consumers could get cheap storage capacity on the distributed grid in exchange for volunteering to let the grid use some of their own local storage .
The idea was that every user would be able to get the benefits of distributed off - site backups by sharing a portion of their local drive space with the rest of the network .
The company eventually dropped that strategy and now self - hosts all of their backup storage .
The Tahoe source code , which is made available under the terms of GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) , can be used to build distributed storage grids that function in much the same manner as Allmydata 's original concept .
When a file is deployed to Tahoe , it is encrypted and split into pieces that are spread out across ten separate nodes .
Using a variation of Reed - Solomon error correction , it can reconstruct a file using only three of the original ten nodes .
This helps to ensure data integrity when some nodes are unavailable .
This is a bit similar to how RAID storage works .
Tahoe uses a library called zfec that provides an efficient implementation of the error correction code and exposes it through a Python API .
For those of you who are finding this all a bit hard to follow , there is a simple interactive mockup that illustrates visually how Tahoe 's distributed storage works .
Although Tahoe is a distributed filesystem , it is not entirely decentralized .
It needs a central node , called an Introducer , which is responsible for getting new nodes connected to existing nodes on the grid .
Tahoe is designed to minimize its dependency on the Introducer , but it 's still basically a central point of failure .
If the Introducer goes down , existing nodes will still be able to communicate with each other and propagate data but the grid wo n't be able to connect new nodes .
The developers hope to address this limitation in a future version .
Tahoe is being used in a number of different ways .
A common configuration that is documented at the project 's wiki is described as a " friendnet " , a group of roughly ten nodes that are connected over the Internet and provide shared secure storage capacity with optional filesharing .
Another potential usage scenario is installing
Tahoe on individual workstations on an office network and using their excess disk capacity as a storage pool .
The Tahoe wiki describes that kind of setup as a " hivecache " .
The Tahoe source code is primarily written in Python with the Twisted framework .
The code base is highly portable and can run on Windows , Mac OS X , Linux , Solaris , and several flavors of BSD .
It runs entirely in userspace and does n't require any kernel modules or other low - level components .
It works fine on regular commodity hardware and does n't have any particularly special requirements .
Installation instructions are available at the project 's web site .

Kissing the App Store Goodbye August 01 , 2009
I give up , there is no way for a small developer to make it in the App Store anymore .
Unless you are associated with a big publisher who can attract reviews and spend money on marketing , or win the lottery , the App Store is too big , too poorly organized , too low priced and run by some kind of Mafia - like organization .
Despite having a long list of products I 'd like to make for the iPhone , it 's not worth spending time ( and what little money I have these days ) only to disappear either into the Rejection black hole , or into the 200 + daily pile .
From a customer standpoint , the App Store is awesome , so much goodness you could download or buy apps every hour and never get bored .
Most apps are either free or cost a buck .
It 's a real massive platform with great hardware , a mostly great SDK , and nearly 40 million strong market eager to get more apps .
From a developer standpoint it 's a nightmare .
An Orwellian review team which does not communicate to anyone ( even inside Apple ) , uneven policies which change at random times leading to horror stories form Shaken Babies to Google Voices , and an apparent " so we treat you like crap , there are hundreds more suckers eager to try " attitude .
Then there is the mouthpiece " Richard " whom I have been rejected by already ( and appears in the Google Voice story ) with a solid future in government stonewalling ( at least the Iraqi Information Minister was entertaining ) .
Add to the App Store Review Team problem the inability for anyone to find your applications ( I always tell people that 2 % of the applications sell 98 % of the copies ) in the app store .
Unless you make it into a top 25 list somewhere , you may as well be selling out of your trunk at a flea market in Alaska in January .
I think the store surprised Apple in how big it grew , and from their standpoint the success came without having to do anything to promote the platform , so it makes sense ( of a sort ) to not care if most of the developers get disillusioned .
In the mid 80's Apple was desperate to get developers on the Mac , and we were treated likely royalty in many ways , since the platform would die without applications .
I still remember the 1986 WWDC , where the entire Mac developer community got to ride a boat in the harbor , talk , gamble for free hardware , and joke that IBM could kill the entire Mac market with a well - placed torpedo .
Today Apple rules the world and thus the little guys no longer matter .
I 'm not giving up on the iPhone , just developing apps for the store on my own .
I would be happy to build apps for others , I like the SDK and the opportunities for amazing apps are still there .
It 's just the irritation of dealing with the App Store team , the poorly organized marketplace , and the sheer volume is too much .
My next app will be for OSX .
Sure , the apparently market is less exciting but there are actually a similar number of devices running OSX and iPhone OS .
Being able to update apps whenever I need to , not have to wait for anyone 's approval , be able to directly communicate with customers , and also get to collect any revenue in something under 3 months time is much more appealing .
Sure , my apps are n't anything exciting .
Quantum Pool has been doing well but with an eCPM of about 17 cents it 's not even beer money .
The more complicated interesting apps I would have done would take too long , and the risk is simply too great on my own thin dime .
The other phone markets do n't interest me either , the devices and the SDKs do n't really provide what the iPhone does .
I 've worked at Apple , used Apple computers since 1980 , and really do n't care to switch .
It 's just dealing with the App Store bunch is too much even for me ( note the DTS folks are still great and do a wonderful job in support ) .
Apple as a big entity wo n't care what I think , and the other 14,000 iPhone developers either have given up , keep trying , made a million ( very few ) or gotten a job at Ngmoco .
But there are another 14,000 out there hoping to hit the big time .
Good luck with that , hope you never hear from Richard .
John Caddell , and it shows the cost of attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a percentage of US median income .
Scary stuff .
But not as scary as David Leonhardt 's column today , which demonstrates a nasty ghettoization effect at state colleges , many of which are turning into failure factories : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
This chart comes from John Caddell , and it shows the cost of attending Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as a percentage of US median income .
Scary stuff .
But not as scary as David Leonhardt ’s column today , which demonstrates a nasty ghettoization effect at state colleges , many of which are turning into failure factories :
Only 33 percent of the freshmen who enter the University of Massachusetts , Boston , graduate within six years .
Less than 41 percent graduate from the University of Montana , and 44 percent from the University of New Mexico .
There are serious problems with incentives , here : colleges get paid according to their enrollment , not according to the number of students they graduate .
And with freshmen cheaper to teach than seniors , it actually benefits a college to have more of the former than the latter .
The first order of business here is to level the playing field : at the moment , poor kids have an alarming tendency to attend colleges with low graduation rates , even when they ’re more than capable of getting into colleges with higher graduation rates .
They thereby essentially give their rightful place at the better schools to richer kids , who are much more likely to graduate in the first place .
That ’s why Joe Weisenthal is wrong here :
The authors cite students who go to Eastern Michigan University ( 39 % graduation rate ) , but who could have gone to University of Michigan ( 88 % graduation rate ) .
But UMich is already at maximum capacity — as are other elite schools — so for one thing , an influx of new applicants , would just displace students , and we ’d be back to ground zero .
But beyond that , how do we know that the the UMich graduation rate would stay constant given an influx of students who used to go to Eastern Michigan ?
That ’s a gigantic variable .
The point is that the displaced students would be richer students who would be much more likely to graduate in any case , even if they went to Eastern Michigan University .
And even if the UMich graduation rate fell from 88 % , it would still be much higher than 39 % .
This , from Weisenthal , is also silly :
While the educators complain that high schools are n’t doing enough to prepare students for college , the goal of “ improved matriculation ” sounds just as silly .
Just as graduating from high school does n’t automatically make you prepared for college , graduating from college does n’t automatically make you ready for the real world .
No , but it makes you much more employable , and it does wonders for your lifetime earnings .
Lots of companies simply wo n’t employ a college drop - out , no matter how qualified they are , and will employ a less - able college graduate instead .
It ’s often the first filter applied : companies wo n’t even look at people without a degree .
Improving the matriculation rate therefore improves the range of choice presented to employers , and improves the overall quality of the white - collar workforce .
It benefits everyone , except for maybe dubiously - competent graduates who right now do n’t really need to compete , in the job market , against smarter applicants who unfortunately dropped out of college .
If those smarter applicants get themselves degrees , the less - competent will find it harder to get jobs .
Update : Ryan
Avent seems to think that dropouts are dropouts , wherever they attend university .
I do n’t think that ’s true .
For one thing , the presence or absence of a campus makes a big difference : students are much more likely to drop out if there is n’t one .
And for another thing , there are all manner of peer effects : if most of your peers are dropping out , you ’re more likely to follow suit than if nearly all of them are graduating .
Update 2 : Oops , Charles Kenny just pointed out that Caddell was using the wrong numerators in his chart , he was using the top line when he should have been using the second line .
So I ’ve deleted the chart , as it stood it was very misleading .
Update 3 : Caddell has fixed the chart , so it ’s back .
What exactly is a quaternion Julia set ?
Well , it ’s beautiful .
These shapes are animated projections of three dimensional slices of four dimensional objects known as quaternion Julia sets .
The definition of a Julia set can get a bit complicated , but it can be thought of as an object that carves up four - dimensional space into two categories – belonging to the set , and not belonging to the set .
How exactly the shape is carved depends on some very deep mathematics .
Now the big question – how do we look at a four dimensional object if we ’re just mere three dimensional humans ?
Well , first let ’s try to describe how we can look at a three dimensional object using only two dimensions .
When I think of two dimensions , I think of a flat sheet like a piece of cardboard .
How could we use this flat sheet , or a lot of flat sheets , to make up a three dimensional object ?
Well , if we were very clever like Yuk King Tan , we could cut a huge number of cardboard sheets carefully and stack them up on top of each other .
From far away it would look like a three dimensional object .
But if we look closely .
Very closely .
We can see that this is made up entirely of two dimensional objects cut into specific shapes , each shape cut perfectly to reflect the three dimensional object at a certain height .
This is just like how an MRI machine takes “ slices ” of a three dimensional object ( a human ! ) as it slowly moves upwards .
The image below shows the 2D slices of the 3D skull starting just below the eyes .
If we could only see two dimensions , we could flip through each one of these images in turn to get an idea of just what a three dimensional brain looks like .
This is what doctors do – all of our current display technology , fancy HDTVs included , currently only display two dimensions .
So they take many two dimensional slices and then compare and visualize them in relation to each other , in order to get some idea of what our three dimensional body is actually like .
So we can do the same thing with these four dimensional Julia sets .
We can take many three dimensional slices , animate them , and then compare and relate these slices to each other in order to create some idea in our brain of just what this four dimensional structure is .

HE WEARS
A black hoodie to protect himself from the cold rain .
The baby - faced guy is Dominican , probably in his early twenties .
He rushes by me at the Graham Avenue L train entrance , pauses and asks , “ Matt ? ” I nod .
He leads me down the stairs , examines me silently .
Once he ’s satisfied that I ’m not a threat , he takes $ 30 from my left hand and pushes a sealed bag of Cheez Doodles into my right jacket pocket .
Without another word , he splits for the opposite staircase and races back above ground .
I check my watch .
It ’s 6:30 on a Saturday night under a busy Williamsburg intersection , and I ’ve just scored three bags of “ Nike ” heroin , all hidden inside a re-sealed bag of chips .
Nike is the highest quality brand of heroin going around Williamsburg , according to Rob ( not his real name ) , a scruffy 27 - year - old I know from my junkie past .
Rob admits to sometimes using as much as 16 bags a day .
He lives in an apartment near the Graham L stop filled with piles of empty glassine bags and orange syringe caps .
The handoff , which Rob set up after a few minutes and a couple of texts while at his parents ’ house in Connecticut , was the culmination of months of research that was spurred on by a spate of recent media reports claiming that America — and especially the New York metro area — is suffering from a terrifying new heroin epidemic .
Curious , I decided to revisit a world that had once held me in its clutches for so long .
This time around , I brought along a notebook and a clear head .
The Sunday , Oct. 3 cover of Newsday read “ Heroin Hits Main Street . ”
Under slightly less - lurid headlines , several recent New York Times features have promoted similar concerns .
A Sept. 27 Sunday Metro cover story , “ Young and Suburban , and Falling for Heroin , ” chronicled the rise of a new kind of young , middleclass addict , a development “ especially worrisome ” to Suffolk County authorities .
Reporter Cara Buckley used the example of a 17 - year - old girl from Suffolk County whose low self - esteem catapulted her from pot to skag to rehab .
Heroin , Buckley quoted a rehab doctor as saying , “ is becoming cooler . ”
In a long sidebar the same writer reported that the heroin available in urban centers today is much purer , and therefore much more potent , than the street skag of 10 or even 20 years ago .
Buckley quotes a prosecutor who claims that the purity level has increased from “ less than 5 percent ” in the heroin - blighted 1970s to “ as high as 20 percent ” now .
In case readers do n’t get the hint in the main article , the sidebar explicitly states that “ younger , more educated people are getting hooked . ”
Taken together , the two pieces — reporting an uptick in middle - class demand and better quality supply — warn the typical Times reader :
Hide your kids !
Not so fast .
Have n’t we read this all before ?
Yes .
In fact , 13 years ago , a Sept. 8 , 1996 , Times article outlined the same dual trend in a remarkably similar story headlined , “ Heroin Moves In On a New Generation . ”
Back in the glory days of heroin chic , it was an anonymous girl from Connecticut who conveniently fleshed out the epidemic , which began : “ She started taking drugs when she was 15 . ”
The author of the 1996 piece cites a source to maintain , “ While the supply is on the rise , so too is the purity of the heroin . ”
It ’s as if the past 13 years never happened .
Actually , the Times ’ latest wave of reporting on the rise of heroin use among young people began again back in a Jan. 13 , 2008 article that asserted the phenomenon was nationwide but focused on the New York City metro area : “ Experts say that more high - quality heroin is being put on the streets of the New York City suburbs than ever before , and at what are considered historically lower prices . ”
According to this story , suburban teens can now purchase heroin in amounts of “ a 10 - gram ‘ deck , ’ which can cost as little as $ 7 on the street . ”
As anyone with experience with the drug will tell you , this is a laughably low figure .
While it has fluctuated in quality , heroin in New York has fetched roughly the same price since the early 1980s : $ 10 for a bag containing 1/10 of a gram of powder , about the size of a line of coke .
( Typically one bag will get someone without a habit stoned for a few hours . )
In other words , the Times was off by a factor of 10 .
More recently , on May 29 of this year , the Gray Lady warned readers of “ a powerful form of heroin ” called “ black tar ” moving through the Mideastern hinterlands .
Even straights in good standing , if they ’ve read the Times long enough , can tell you that there is nothing new about black tar .
On Sept. 13,1986 , the paper ’s Peter Kerr reported , “ A powerful new type of heroin , black tar , has appeared ” in Chicago and points west .
Black tar is not pure ; it is highly cut with sticky chemical additives — as legions of West Coast junkies can attest .
A 36 - year - old former addict who spent many years in San Francisco explained to me , “ that shit is so nasty , it ’s like syrup . ”
Revealing several scars from healed abscesses on his arm , he adds , “ It just destroyed my veins . ”
But should we be surprised ?
This sort of media - inflated dope hysteria dates back to the early 1950s when pulps with titles like The Pusher and Dope Doll included illustrations of cartoonish , middle - class fiends strung out by hustlers .
The politically moderate urban sociologist Eric Schneider , in his comprehensive history of domestic heroin use , Smack : Heroin and the American City , argues forcefully that a fear of the suburbanization of an opiate epidemic , although dating back to Eisenhower - era anxieties , reached a fevered pitch in the post - hippie 1970s .
Around every decade or so , the press uncovers something both ominous and familiar under the floorboards : white , affluent heroin users .
Given that heroin has existed for so long in the city , is it any wonder middle - class whites have long gotten their hands on the stuff ?
During periods of economic growth , they scrape by without causing trouble .
In periods of economic decline , however , the consequences of hard drug use become more prevalent .
The financial motivation to deal increases , coupled with an attempt to reach new clients .
Prescription opiate painkillers , more expensive than heroin on the black market , and favored by most suburban users , can also become more difficult to obtain for many in bad times as well .
In any event , as new users get in over their head , social ills such as shoplifting and overdoses begin to rise .
That ’s when junkies begin to be noticed and editors assign their heroin stories and reporters try to craft a nightmare scenario for a new generation .
It ’s a sunny Friday morning , and a crew - cut white kid struts into a near - empty Tompkins Square Park .
He impatiently asks two homeless crust punks rinsing their dreadlocks at the water fountain to please move .
He fills a syringe with water and sits down on a nearby green wooden bench .
Balancing the rig beside him , he guides a plastic cap and a small , square unstamped glassine bag of skag out of his striped shorts .
He pours the bag ’s contents into the cap , sprays water into it , shakes up the solution and draws it back up into the syringe through a cotton ball .
Licking his lips while he brings the syringe to his forearm , he gets distracted as I eye him from the bench across the blacktop .
“ You ’re going to do that right in the open ? ” I ask .
The young junkie answers by sticking the needle into his flesh and pushing the heroin into a vein .
Smiling stupidly , he gathers his works and hurries off .
Two minutes later , he ’s back with a sullen look on his face and a bearded crust punk in tow .
They are a mix - matched pair — one clean cut , the other filthy .
Sitting down on the same bench after getting water from the fountain , they each unfurl works and prepare their shots .
Emboldened by a partner , Crew Cut sardonically asks me , “ Be our eyes ? ”
After getting his second hit of the morning , Crew Cut looks more relaxed , his eyelids droop .
He pockets his syringe and stands up .
Under the wave of sedation , his knees buckle a bit and he nods off .
Then he shakes himself awake and lopes away .
Meanwhile , waiting to feel the dope ’s flash , the bearded crust punk gazes straight ahead .
Finally he says , “ This shit I just copped is n’t very good . ”
Nodding sympathetically , I ask the him a few questions .
His name is George , and he ’s from northern New Jersey .
At 28 , he ’s homeless and has been using H since he was 18 , about the age his crew - cut pal is now .
His body shows the results : jaundiced skin , yellowing eyes and a frail posture — symptomatic of hepatitis C—combine to make him look much older .
Topped by a black Yankees cap , his yellow face — tattooed with small designs — is haunting .
His eyes flash a wary knowledge of his own decrepitude .
Despite his rough appearance , he ’s friendly and eager to talk .
As his medical wristbands — which he wears while begging for money — prove , George has been hospitalized four times in the last two weeks for overdoses and seizures .
Store managers will not let him use their bathrooms , so he gets off in the park .
George ticks off his list of ailments : addiction , alcoholism , hepatitis C and pancreatitis .
He claims to have two kids somewhere .
Adding to George ’s sordid fate , his wakeup bag did n’t even tighten him up .
He ’s been trying to get into a city detox so he can lower his tolerance , but he does n’t have any I.D. “ Basically , I ’m fucked , I have a year to live , ” he mutters .
“ Can you buy me a beer ? ”
To people who only know Manhattan in its boom - era incarnation , the existence of George and his junkie pals is something new .
While , sitting at the Sidewalk Café on East Sixth Street , a 27 - year - old blond Web writer told some friends about a bust she had seen in Tompkins Square Park .
There were syringes on the ground and everything .
“ Do people even do heroin anymore ? ” she wondered aloud .
The question was more than rhetorical ; she was about to sign a lease in the neighborhood and she was nervous about walking through the park at night .
She ’s right to wonder .
Although patterns of use and supply change , these changes typically develop underground , only triggering warning signals in the mass media when they discover
“ new ” waves of drug use when it fits other priorities — to generate buzz or stress the need for law and order .
To find out what ’s going on in the Land of Nod , you need to scratch the surface and go beyond canned quotes from suburban teens in treatment and D.A.s .
Do that , and you ’ll realize that junkies , even white middle - class ones , never went anywhere .
On the one hand , the recent experiences of some people I spoke with who are involved in buying and selling smack say that there has been a recent uptick in street - level supply .
As to the question of quality , however , most of them say purity levels vary greatly over short periods of time .
Take Jennifer ( not her real name ) , an attractive 23 - year - old redhead from a Chicago suburb , who now lives in Bay Ridge with her boyfriend .
Jennifer admits she spends a lot of time keeping up appearances , because , in her words she ’s “ very fucking vain ” and , with the exception of the small track marks on her wrist — which she covers with makeup — she could easily pass as for a fashionable college student .
But unlike most college kids , her main source of income is shoplifting from high - end stores like Apple .
She and her boyfriend got a windfall a couple of months ago when his parents sent a check to buy books for Fordham University , where he ’s enrolled in grad school .
While relating her heroin stories , Jennifer frequently starts crying .
She would be the perfect source for a newspaper reporter to latch onto to write a story about a new epidemic .
Except for the fact that she ’s been using since she was 18 , when she moved to the city on a whim to attend Hunter College .
A new user , she is not .
On the question of purity , she sides with those who claim it ’s gotten better recently .
“ Back in March , we were always complaining about the material .
But then it got a lot better , ” she says , adding , “ People were just , like , ‘ Thank God . ’ ”
Dick LaVine , who was a counselor at the city ’s first medical detox program , which was established at Beth Israel Hospital in 1961 , says that purity levels have always been in flux .
“ That ’s not an unfamiliar story .
There were periods when everything was ‘ pure ’ and people would overdose , ” LaVine explains .
“ Then it went the other way , they were getting garbage and would be sick . ”
Chris , a 47 - year - old heroin sniffer from an upper - middle class family , lives on Ridge Street in the Lower East Side .
He says he ’s been surprised at the number of “ stamps ” ( different “ brands ” of dope used by dealers to market dope ) found on his block lately .
Sitting Indian - style on his bed and chopping beige powder into lines on a CD jewel case , Chris , who says he ’s also physically addicted to Oxycontin and morphine — which are prescribed to him for an old back injury — names five dealers he knows on his block .
Unable to mask his excitement , he says , “ That ’s more than were here when I lived here in the ‘ 80s . ”
I speak to a middle - aged dealer who has stayed in the game since the mid-1990s when he ran his corner on East 15th and First Avenue .
Not a user himself , he explains that he delivers to primarily white , middle - class customers across Manhattan .
The dealer says in the past few weeks he ’s been able to find good stuff for the first time in years .
Standing in a dark tenement doorway in an East Village block , he rubs his fingers together .
“ But they make you pay full price , you know ? ” he says , referring to dealers who have dynamite product .
While dope can be found in neighborhoods as far removed as the West Village and the South Bronx , the most popular copping center for addicts right now — especially for young , middle - class ones — is Williamsburg , which displaced the Lower
East Side and East Village earlier this decade as the major location for members of the creative class .
While working on this story , I saw “ Nike , ” “ King of New York , ” “ Monster , ” “ Scorpion King ” and “ Dead on Arrival ” stamps being peddled in Williamsburg , while most bags in downtown Manhattan are usually unstamped .
Champ , a hardened white addict with a deeply creased , suntanned face waits for his girlfriend near the shimmering mesh skin of the New Museum on the Bowery .
When she finally appears , she has two unstamped sealed glassine bags in hand .
She lays one of Champ .
“ You wanna laugh real hard ? ” he asks in his gravel - pit voice .
He answers himself : “ The shit comes right from this block . ”
Champ ’s girlfriend had just run up the stairs of the Sunshine Hotel — a flophouse near the main entrance — where she copped her smack in plain view as European tourists milling around the front of the museum .
Even if heroin dealing and consumption is more out in the open during the current recession , addicts across the city would laugh if you tell them that H is five times stronger than in the 1970s , a claim made by the city ’s special narcotics prosecutor , Bridget G. Brennan , in Buckley ’s Times piece .
Ask enough dope fiends when junk was at its purest and , depending on the junkie ’s age , you get a wide range of answers .
There is one common thread , however :
The strongest shit they ever did was back when they first started , but the really good stuff — well , that was back in the day , before they were even using .
Another young white junkie , sitting on a bicycle in Tompkins Square Park , explains why he recently hooked up with a methadone clinic : “ Nothing out here is getting me high . ”
Anecdotally at least , some clinics claim to have recently seen an increase in population .
A tall man in his late forties who refrained from giving his name because of societal stigma , claims that his methadone clinic went from 200 to 800 clients in the last year .
Most of the new clients , he adds , are young and white .
Tom Daly , a head counselor at the Greenwich House program located off Cooper Square , would n’t deny a recent dramatic spike in patients .
“ In the last six to seven months , there has been a rise , ” he admits .
“ But they ’re coming from Rikers and detox programs .
It ’s not like they ’re brand new to the scene . ”
The truth is , from the South Bronx to Williamsburg to the Lower East Side , junkies have been around since at least the early 1950s , when junk swept through the predominately black New York street gangs , sapping their power and creating a permanent underclass .
In Claude Brown ’s autobiographical novel , Manchild in the Promised Land , he describes the devastation that heroin brought down on Harlem , a “ shit plague ” that , he writes , peaked in 1955 .
Some low - level Mafiosi , who were breaking their organization ’s rules , also got hooked , says LaVine .
“ Before that , it was either you got straight , or you were shivering on the cement , ” he explains .
LaVine , a septuagenarian with chiseled features and thick tousled black hair , hands over several documents from his two - decade tour at the Beth Israel treatment facility on Avenue A .
One of them is a letter , dated Aug. 1967 , from Dr. Vincent P. Dole , the founder of methadone maintenance , where LaVine transferred to when maintenance started that year .
The letter begins in part , “ So many addicts have volunteered for treatment — and everyday brings more applications — that we already have a year ’s accumulation on the waiting list . ”
The system was ballooning with inner city heroin addicts , “ mostly from Harlem , ” LaVine says .
Stacked beneath the letter is slightly yellowed pamphlet titled “ The Attack on narcotic addiction and drug abuse . ”
Published in December of 1967 by New York State , its cover is taken up by two stories about drug use encroaching into the lives of white teens in places like Ithaca .
While it focuses on LSD and marijuana as well as opiates , the alarmed tone of the piece would not be unfamiliar to readers of the big dailies today .
One can only marvel at why the state - sponsored editors deemed them more cover worthy than the stories inside , which present health care professionals and state employees with information on battling acute inner-city hard drug use .
Heroin use — and its frightening aura of an inner-city other — was an easy bogeyman to resurrect to alarm skittish middle - class parents .
But despite the terrifying headlines , and all the efforts to combat the street drugs , the junkies are here to stay .

The next time you experience a cold or the flu , remember this : rather than take conventional drugs to suppress uncomfortable symptoms , it 's better for your health to allow the cold or flu to run its course while you get plenty of physical and emotional rest .
Conventional medicine and the pharmaceutical industry would have you believe that there is no " cure " for the common cold , that you should protect yourself against the flu with a vaccine that is laden with toxic chemicals , and that during the midst of a cold or flu , it is favorable to ease your discomfort with a variety of medications that can suppress your symptoms .
Unfortunately , all three of these positions indicate a lack of understanding of what colds and flus really are , and what they do for your body .
Colds and flus are caused by viruses .
So to understand what colds and flus do at a cellular level , you have to understand what viruses do at a cellular level .
Do you remember learning about cellular division in grade seven science class ?
Each of your cells are called parent cells , and through processes of genetic duplication ( mitosis ) and cellular division ( cytokinesis ) , each of your parent cells divides into two daughter cells .
Each daughter cell is then considered a parent cell that will divide into two more daughter cells , and so on .
Viruses are different from your cells in that they cannot duplicate themselves through mitosis and cytokinesis .
Viruses are nothing but microscopic particles of genetic material , each coated by a thin layer of protein .
Due to their design , viruses are not able to reproduce on their own .
The only way that viruses can flourish in your body is by using the machinery and metabolism of your cells to produce multiple copies of themselves .
Once a virus has gained access into one of your cells , depending on the type of virus involved , one of two things can happen :
The virus uses your cell 's resources to replicate itself many times over and then breaks open ( lyses ) the cell so that the newly replicated viruses can leave in search of new cells to infect .
Lysis effectively kills your cell .
The virus incorporates itself into the DNA of your cell , which allows the virus to be passed on to each daughter cell that stems from this cell .
Later on , the virus in each daughter cell can begin replicating itself as described above .
Once multiple copies of the virus have been produced , the cell is lysed .
Both possibilities lead to the same result : eventually , the infected cell can die due to lysis .
Here is the key to understanding why colds and flus , when allowed to run their course while you rest , can be good for you :
By and large , the viruses that cause the common cold and the flu infect mainly your weakest cells ; cells that are already burdened with excessive waste products and toxins are most likely to allow viruses to infect them .
These are cells that you want to get rid of anyway , to be replaced by new , healthy cells .
So in the big scheme of things , a cold or flu is a natural event that can allow your body to purge itself of old and damaged cells that , in the absence of viral infection , would normally take much longer to identify , destroy , and eliminate .
Have you ever been amazed by how much mucous you could blow out of your nose while you had a cold or the flu ?
Embedded within all of that mucous are countless dead cells that your body is saying good bye to , largely due to the lytic effect of viruses .
So you see , there never needs to be a cure for the common cold , since the common cold is nature 's way of keeping you healthy over the long term .
And so long as you get plenty of rest and strive to stay hydrated and properly nourished during a cold or flu , there is no need to get vaccinated or to take medications that suppress congested sinuses , a fever , or coughing .
All of these uncomfortable symptoms are actually ways in which your body works to eliminate waste products and / or help your body get through a cold or flu .
It 's fine to use over - the - counter pain medication like acetaminophen if your discomfort becomes intolerable or if such meds can help you get a good night 's rest .
But it 's best to avoid medications that aim to suppress helpful processes such as fever , coughing , and a runny nose .
It 's important to note that just because colds and flus can be helpful to your body does n't mean that you need to experience them to be at your best .
If you take good care of your health and immune system by getting plenty of rest and consistently making health - promoting dietary and lifestyle choices , your cells may stay strong enough to avoid getting infected by viruses that come knocking on their membranes .
In this scenario , you wo n't have enough weak and extraneous cells to require a cold or the flu to work its way through your body to identify and lyse them .
Curious about how to differentiate the common cold and the flu ?
Here is an excellent summary of the differences from cbc.ca :
A cold usually comes on gradually — over the course of a day or two .
Generally , it leaves you feeling tired , sneezing , coughing and plagued by a running nose .
You often do n't have a fever , but when you do , it 's only slightly higher than normal .
Colds usually last three to four days , but can hang around for 10 days to two weeks .
Flu , on the other hand , comes on suddenly and hits hard .
You will feel weak and tired and you could run a fever as high as 40 C .
Your muscles and joints will probably ache , you will feel chilled and could have a severe headache and sore throat .
Getting off the couch or out of bed will be a chore .
The fever may last three to five days , but you could feel weak and tired for two to three weeks .
One final note on this topic : because the common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses , antibiotics are not necessary .
People who take antibiotics while suffering with a cold or flu often feel slightly better because antibiotics have a mild anti-inflammatory effect .
But this benefit is far outweighed by the negative impact that antibiotics have on friendly bacteria that live throughout your digestive tract .
In this light , if you really need help with pain management during a cold or flu , it is usually better to take a small dose of acetaminophen than it is to take antibiotics .
Swimmers and sunbathers arriving at Humiston Park Beach in Vero Beach , Florida got a disgusting surprise last Wednesday evening when they found a mysterious mile - long trail of large feces in the sand .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like it , and I ’ve lived along beaches all my life , ” onlooker Bill Becker told TCPalm .
“ It was disgusting , but mystifying .
It looked like Great Dane poop all along the beach . ”
Officials with the county ’s Environmental Health Department were able to rule out humans as the source of the mess on arrival at the beach , but it took a bit more digging to determine the actual culprit .
“ We did a feel and smell test , and based on the description we gave to Florida Fish and Wildlife , they told us it was manatee droppings , ” environmental health specialist Charles Vogt said .
“ I ’ve never followed a manatee closely enough to know otherwise . ”
Not that a big group of manatees came ashore to use the beaches as their own personal open - air privy .
The excrement was washed onto the shore , probably stirred up from the ocean floor by strong winds .
A couple hours of poop scooping took care of the problem and the beach was reopened by the following afternoon .
The DVR - clogging onslaught of fall programming is pretty much over , at least for freshman series .
Sure , there will be a trickle here and there before the holiday season kicks in , but Sunday 's premiere of " Three Rivers " on CBS is essentially the end .
Oh , hey , look - it 's a hospital drama .
Never saw that coming .
Doctors and nurses - and really good - looking ones at that - in a hospital saving lives ?
What will they think of next ?
Actually , that 's not fair to " Three Rivers " in a few ways .
First , this series at least tries to be different in that it focuses on transplants , donors and patients .
( The transplant part - that 's the twist . )
And , at least in the pilot , there is only one quick reference to doctors and dating - with nary a kiss or a sideways look of lust .
That 's progress .
Also , for what it does - toil in the most overused of all genres , especially this season - " Three Rivers " makes mediocrity move more quickly than its recent competitors .
Fine , that 's not much of an endorsement .
" Not nearly as bad as ' Trauma ' or ' Mercy ' or ' HawthoRNe ' and less edgy than ' Nurse Jackie ' " might have made a better blurb for the boxed set ( if it lasts that long ) .
But let 's face it if you decide to make a series in a tired genre and do n't offer anything innovative , it 's a dog - bites - man story as far as TV criticism goes .
" Three Rivers " has had some trouble getting launched .
CBS replaced Julia Ormond as the lead .
Then it reshot the pilot .
Then it decided that pilot was n't quite right and , on Sunday , we get an out - of - order episode serving as the pilot .
Not a total failure
It 's not a gratuitous failure and makes enough sense to see to the end .
And to see the intended points :
Being a donor is important ; being grateful for being saved by a donor is good drama ; rushing donated body parts around is better drama .
At least in theory .
That 's why these shows get made .
Unfortunately , " Three Rivers " does n't reinvent the wheel , it just spins it a little differently on the axle of network sameness .
Alex O'Loughlin ( " Moonlight " ) plays the hunky transplant king of all doctors , Andy Yablonski .
Katherine Moennig ( " The L Word " ) plays Miranda Foster , the surgical fellow whose father essentially built Three Rivers hospital in Pittsburgh , but ended up never being there for her in the process .
So now she has issues as she follows in his footsteps .
Daniel Henney plays the good - looking surgical resident who , according to CBS , " has broken as many hearts as he 's replaced . "
And Alfre Woodard holds them all together as Sophia Jordan , the head of surgery .
There are others , including a newbie organ transplant coordinator and several other types who will be instantly familiar .
It 's a hospital drama , people .
There are only so many types you can create .
What 's immediately different about " Three Rivers " is the length the series will go , to at least look original .
This is one high - tech , modernist hospital .
There 's enough glass and elegantly appointed rooms to make you wonder - aloud , even - if anyone who made this series has ever been in a hospital .
But this is a new hospital .
Shiny new .
Digital hospital
No expense has been spared .
Everything is digital , and the computers are fast .
There appear to be HD TV sets in every room .
And if a doctor is looking at a monitor , chances are that monitor has picture - in - picture capabilities that can show a woman who just got a new heart and - wait for it - also gave birth on the same day , and an HD look at her happy husband a couple of floors down in the nursery , holding the new one .
( Apparently there are so many nurses that a few have the time and the training to be camera operators . )
" Three Rivers " also uses split screen - graphics a la " 24 " ( but uses colors to wash them out , like paintings ) .
It sets up that the heart of a dying person is in Point A , the hospital is way over here at Point B , and there 's traffic .
And people are frantic .
Last , it has a code .
You can't hover over dying people .
" This is not how we do it ! " one doctor says .
" Why , because of some rule ? " asks an eager transplant coordinator .
" Because it 's the right thing to do , " says the doc .
" It has to be a gift . "
So , yeah .
It 's a little different .
But not .
It 's a hospital drama .
And here 's the best part : Norfolk Southern says it costs the same to make as a traditional locomotive .
So from the sounds of it , there 's no downside to shoving the old coal - guzzling engines to the side ( along with their their significant greenhouse gas emissions ) .
The anti-Goldman sentiment keeps on growing : next up is Bloomberg 's interview with former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in which he chimes in with his views of Taibbi's Goldman Sachs article and Goldman 's money making prowess ( " because it is a conspiracy does not mean it is wrong " ) .
In a impressively coherent presentation , the former Governor also talks about bankrupt states and the lack of regulation ( his family life disclosure may be fast forwarded ) .
Must watch .

We strive to make our products cheaply , with low quality , so that consumers will initially buy them on price , but will later pay us a fortune in maintenance fees .

Chief Executive
Shoddy Products That Cost Less Money , Inc .
Sounds like a great corporate mission statement , does it not ?
As silly as it sounds , the above is the basic business model for many technology companies , consulting companies , and internal technology groups .
The software craftsmanship movement is doing everything it can to renew focus on the importance of quality software , but until we find a way to make software quality a contractual obligation , quality will always lose .
In the End , It 's What Was Signed on the Dotted Line
Are we really all like our fictional Dr. Evil , purposefully trying to make poor - quality software that hobbles businesses with levels of technical debt that would make a maxed - out credit card look like an accounting error ?
I do n't think so .
I think that most people in the business of software delivery — developers , project managers , or any other title — want to deliver high - quality projects that make a positive economic impact .
The problem is n't that we do n't have good enough intentions .
To get at the root of the issue , you have to start looking at the language that controls how developers ultimately get paid .
( When conditions of payment for a given project depend on everything but quality , it 's usually not hard to guess what happens when crunch time hits . )
In technology consulting , and even in many internal IT departments that have implemented internal chargeback systems , the language of control begins in the Statement of Work — the main contract that defines the legal terms and conditions under which a project operates .
This document often references what features a given piece of software will have ( sometimes with mind - boggling levels of detail ) .
In some contracts , the Statement of Work references who will staff some or all of the roles for executing the project .
Pretty much without exception , the two most notable items on a Statement of Work are duration and total cost .
Noticeably absent from any language in the Statement of Work is anything about required level of quality , particularly quality of source code delivered .
As a result , unless extraordinary effort is expended to ensure that the software is of the requisite level of quality , the forces of economic inertia will dictate that , all other things being equal , quality will lose .
One of the first recommendations I make when someone asks me how they can save money on groceries is :
Buy as much meat in bulk as you can afford when it ’s on sale .
It ’s likely the most expensive ingredient you ’ll be making a meal with and the biggest item , so if you can save here , you ’ll save big .
It ’s a rare day indeed when I pay full price for a steak or a pack of chicken !
If you ’re picking up product from the local butcher or grocery store , it ’s easy enough to select packs that are single - meal sized .
These are so convenient and easy to toss in the freezer as -is .
But keep your eye out for a much better deal : Prices per pound are usually significantly lower if you buy in big lots or “ family - size ” .
This tactic however brings with it a little extra work :
How to best break it all down to store so you can just take out the amount you need as you need it ?
This tutorial has you covered !
Important :
You want to wrap meat nice & air tight .
It ’s vital to package with care to preserve the quality of the product and protect it from freezer burn or your expensive grocery investment is surely shot .
How to do this ?
You ’ll find several pictures below including easy to follow , step - by - step instructions .
These are from an old vintage book in my collection , details are still bang - on for today .
Directions
To make a good , air tight bundle that will protect the product , it ’s best to use good quality freezer paper .
1. Place roast on paper .
Tear off a sheet to go about one and a half times around roast ( or chops or sausages or poultry , whatever you ’re prepping ! ) , put shiny side next to flesh ( if using wax coated variety ) .
Lay roast on center of paper and allow ample room on all sides .
2. Bring ends together .
Start folding ends of paper together over center of roast .
Turn edges over to create a seam about an inch deep .
Run your fingers along fold to make a good crease .
3 . Fold to meat .
Keep turning paper over and crease each fold .
The last one you make should pull the sheet tight around the product .
You want to get all the air out of package to prevent “ freezer burn ” .
4 . Turn in ends .
Press the sheet down close to sides of meat .
Press out all the air you can to make a tight bundle .
Fold in each of the four corners of paper .
This will make a point at each end .
5 . Turn under ends .
Turn pointed ends of paper under package .
Then fold under about an inch at each end of bundle .
You have made a tight packet that will keep air out and moisture in . . . moisture - vapor - proof .
6. Seal and label .
Seal with tape ( you can use masking tape ) .
Label each package with kind and amount of meat and date you prepped .
Now it ’s ready to stack and store .
This method of wrapping is also known as “ The Drug Store Wrap “ .
Tips : Arrange finished items seam side down to protect seal .
You can double layer if the paper you ’re using is n’t the best quality ( or use one layer aluminum foil or plastic wrap then cover with freezer sheet ) .
Better Food From Your Appliance
Foods of highest quality that are first properly prepared for freezing ( such as first blanching vegetables and other methods ) , can lose color , flavor , texture and nutritive value if packaged improperly .
Proper packaging methods mean :
Using moisture - vapor - proof products or containers
Removing as much air as possible from packet
Carefully sealing tightly wrapped bundles
Labeling packet for usage within recommended storage time .

If you ’re in Manhattan and suddenly feeling some not - so - good vibrations , it could be the effects of the New York Police Department ’s latest siren , called the Rumbler .
“ It emits vibrations that can be felt , so drivers , even with their windows rolled up and stereos on , can be alerted to the approach of emergency vehicles , ” Paul Browne , a spokesman for the Police Department , told The New York Post .
“ It also gets the attention of pedestrians with headphones or iPods or who may be otherwise inattentive to conventional sirens , ” he said .
The Rumbler , which is manufactured by the Federal Signal Corporation , has a range of 200 feet and can be used in conjunction with the Police Department ’s existing five siren options .
The department said that 25 cars were fitted with the Rumbler last week and another 132 are getting the super siren on Monday .
According to an article The Times wrote about the Rumbler two years ago :
Robert S. Martinez , director of the department ’s fleet services unit , says the Rumbler has brought pedestrians and traffic to a dead stop every time he has tried out the test model .
Departments in Alexandria , Va. , and elsewhere in the Washington area already have Rumblers , according to Tom Morgan of Federal Signal , a leading siren supplier .
It works like a bass - heavy boombox , sending out vibrations through two woofers .
The Rumbler has been in use by the police in Washington since 2007 .
Other cities have also adopted the siren .
Here is a video of a Kansas City , Mo. , police officer giving a demonstration of the Rumbler .
Danny
Welsh is sweating .
Droplets are forming beneath his black quiff , trickling down his oversized sideburns and falling into the hairy cleavage of his half - open jumpsuit .
Fiddling with the tassled belt that almost disguises his sizeable gut , the 49 - year - old painter and decorator from Essex is an unlikely rock star .
But he is about to step on stage as The King himself .
Welsh is one of 26 Elvises vying to be crowned impersonator of the year at Europe 's biggest Elvis festival , held every year in Porthcawl , South Wales .
It is not for the faint of heart .
Trembling as he waits backstage , he says : " I 'm the second one to go on and I 'm really nervous .
I 've been doing this professionally for four years and it would mean a hell of a lot to win . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is unlikely that , even in his final years , Elvis looked quite like this .
As with many of the Elvis Tribute Acts – or ETAs as they like to be known – Walsh 's enthusiasm for the crooner far outstrips any similarity .
And enthusiasm , more than anything else , is what it is all about .
Normally sedate , Porthcawl is exploding with enthusiasm , as it does every year when the last weekend of September comes around .
More than 10,000 visitors descend on the seaside town , doubling its population .
And Elvis hysteria kicks in .
The Brentwood Hotel rebrands itself as the Heartbreak Hotel , unfurling Elvis banners and transforming its lobby into a makeshift stage .
Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson – the closest thing urban South Wales has to royalty – have been out with friends dressed as Elvis .
The party to launch the festival is legendary .
Officially , there are 25 venues in the town ; in reality The King is everywhere .
Standing in a chippie , walking along the seafront or just waiting for a bus , you are never more than 10ft from a pair of oversize sideburns .
The only people more passionate about Elvis than the Elvises are the Elvis followers .
Nicola Lewis , 35 , from Pontypool , has been coming since the festival began six years ago .
Her group of eight friends and relatives all dress in matching , spangly Elvis T - shirts , custom - made of course .
" I was brought up on Elvis and my mum loves it too , " she says .
" So it 's a great family day out . "
She confesses to the lengths they have taken to be there .
" We were so desperate that when all the accommodation ran out we booked ourselves rooms in the Rest Bay convalescent home . "
Festival director Peter Phillips views proceedings with a wry smile : " It 's as if we open some portal to a lateral universe and these people just pour in . "
A TV producer , he first set up the festival for a documentary six years ago , but running it has proved more lucrative than his former career .
Yet , he is unlikely to don a skin - tight , white suit himself .
" Get up on stage as Elvis ?
No , there 's not enough money in circulation that would get me to do that . "
There 's no shortage of those who will .
In the Grand Pavilion , Elvises are legion – each with every last strand of quiff combed into submission , eyeliner drawn , and heaving bellies cajoled into jumpsuits for what is now known as " The Elvies Awards " .
Gordon " Elvis " Barbarra , 25 , is crowned the one , true ( ish ) King .
The prize – a free costume and the chance to headline next year 's festival – is not what has brought him here .
Barbarra came to the UK from Malta earlier this year to make his fortune as an Elvis lookalike .
At home he worked as a beer delivery boy , but now he makes £ 500 a night being The King .
" I came to Britain because they value Elvis here .
There 's no future for me in Malta , but here it 's different .
My mum has always loved Elvis and now I can be Elvis for her . "
PRI se abstiene de votar ; PRD , PT y Convergencia se oponen a aumentos
El pleno del Senado aprobó la noche de ayer una cascada de impuestos a la población mexicana para 2010 .
En una sesión que al cierre de esta edición llevaba más de 10 horas , los legisladores ratificaron el incremento de la tasa general del IVA de 15 % a 16 % , con votos de AN , PVEM y uno del Panal , y la abstención de PRI , y un aumento de 10 % a 11 % en las zonas fronterizas .
Avalaron el aumento a la tasa del ISR de 28 % a 30 % como tasa máxima , además del Impuesto de Depósitos en Efectivo ( IDE ) , que pasó de una tasa de 2 % a 3 % , y ahora será a partir de los 15 mil pesos , en vez de los 25 mil con que hoy opera .
Hasta la medianoche , se mantenía pendiente de discusión del impuesto de 3 % a las telecomunicaciones ( telefonía celular y televisión restringida ) , aunque se avizoraba un acuerdo para echar abajo el impuesto a internet , confirmó el presidente de la Comisión de Hacienda , el panista José Isabel Trejo .
El Senado cambió el polémico artículo 244 - E de la Ley de Derechos , que exentaba del pago hasta por tres años a empresas que ganen una licitación para operar el espectro radioeléctrico , y se desechó esa posibilidad .
Se espera que hoy las cinco minutas de la Ley de Ingresos 2010 pasen a San Lázaro , con el fin de analizar cambios ya avalados .
El clímax de la sesión se centró en la discusión y votación del IVA .
Luego de las reservas de perredistas , petistas y convergentes , vino el conteo nominal de votos .
La bancada del PRI abandonó el salón de sesiones en la votación del IVA , y quienes se quedaron como su líder , Manlio Fabio Beltrones , Francisco Labastida , Fernando Baeza Meléndez , Adolfo Toledo Infanzón , Pedro Joaquín Coldwell , Ricardo Pacheco , y Jesús Murillo Karam , votaron en abstención .
El conteo final arrojó un saldo en favor del IVA , con 53 votos en pro ( PAN , PVEM y uno de Irma Martínez , del Panal , partido de Elba Esther Gordillo ) , 28 en contra ( PRD , PT y Convergencia ) y siete abstenciones ( PRI ) .
Esta votación revivió el acuerdo entre PAN y PRI , para que estos últimos no votaran en contra del gravamen .
En tanto , los panistas fueron convencidos al final de votar en bloque en favor del impuesto , a excepción de Rubén Camarillo , de Aguascalientes , a pesar de la advertencia interna del “ costo político ” .
Murillo Karam , también secretario general del Revolucionario Institucional , explicó que se salieron del salón como una forma de manifestar su abstención ; aseguró que su bancada actuó de una forma “ absolutamente responsable y absolutamente congruente ” .
Confirmó que votaron en ese sentido por no estar de acuerdo en los términos generales , “ de uno ni del otro ” .
Al preguntarle cómo debe leer la gente su actuación dijo : “ como eso …
No haber llegado en la negociación que nos satisfaciera plenamente ...
Por eso es la abstención ” .
¡ Cumplan el acuerdo !
Otro momento de tensión ocurrió cuando se discutía la consolidación fiscal , en la cual el PAN adoptó la propuesta de Labastida de bajar la tasa de 40 % a 25 % .
De inmediato el líder de los perredistas , Carlos Navarrete Ruiz , reclamó al coordinador de Acción Nacional , Gustavo Madero .
“ ¿ Por qué en 48 horas cambiaron su postura ? , sé que es por ganar simpatías electorales de los empresarios de las 400 empresas más ricas del país .
Lo platicamos anoche y ahora , sin cumplir el acuerdo , cambian de parecer .
Se vale dar a conocer un cambio y decir ‘ no puedo sostener el acuerdo ’ , lo que no se vale es no cumplirlo sin avisar ” .
Navarrete había esperado a que Madero acudiera al salón de donde se había ausentado , para hacer el reclamo .
Madero pidió la tribuna y argumentó que la propuesta de 25 % era suficiente para alcanzar los objetivos .
“ Ha sido información superviniente ” .
Después abandonó la tribuna .
Navarrete le pidió responder una pregunta , pero Madero se negó .
La discusión sobre el IDE tampoco estuvo exenta de reclamos .
Ricardo Monreal , del PT y Dante Delgado , de Convergencia , reclamaron la propuesta de gravar con 3 % cada depósito mayor a 15 mil pesos .
Monreal lo calificó como “ un atraco en despoblado ” , pero en sus dichos fue más allá al soltarles a todos sus compañeros del pleno que estaban en favor del incremento en el gravamen : “ ¡ Qué partida de madre le están dando a la gente ! ”
The Queen found the balloon while walking her dogs at Windsor Castle A five - year - old boy from Buckinghamshire received a personal message from the Queen after she found a balloon he had released .
Charlie Castle was one of about 50 schoolchildren who released balloons during an end - of - term farewell at his school near High Wycombe in July .
The Queen came across it about 14 miles away , in the grounds of Windsor Castle .
A letter from Buckingham Palace to Charlie said the Queen was " so happy it was your balloon she found " .
A numbered ticket was attached to the balloon , naming Charlie 's school .
Call from palace
The Queen 's personal assistant , Angela Kelly , was entrusted with returning it to Charlie , along with a note .
Anne Harding , head of Little Marlow school , said : " There was a message left on the school answer phone from someone who said they were calling from Buckingham Palace .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I thought it could be a wind - up but when I made contact , I was told that the Queen would like to send a letter . "
Mrs Harding said the school kept quiet about what had happened until the letter arrived last month .
When the envelope was opened , the little boy also found his green balloon tucked inside .
The letter read : " Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to write to tell you that she found your balloon in her garden at Windsor Castle when she was walking her dogs .
" Her Majesty was delighted to see how far it had flown and was so happy it was your balloon she found . "
' Happy and excited ' Mrs Harding added : " It was a very lovely letter , written to the little boy .
" For the Queen to send it back , with the balloon , was really special .
" When his mummy mentioned it to him , he was very excited . "
Kylie Castle , Charlie 's mother , said she was " gobsmacked " .
" In the letter she ( the Queen ) said she was very surprised to see how far it had come and she also said she hoped he had a lovely birthday .
" It was a very personal letter and he was very surprised and happy and excited . "
Fifteen balloons were returned to the school , the furthest from Bordeaux in south - west France .

Has Iran Actually Violated Any Specific International Obligations Here ?
Created : September 25 , 2009 12:40 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
[ Updated 4:08 p.m. , Saturday September 26 : I think this post is wrong .
Carnegie 's James Acton explains carefully what obligations Iran has violated .
My apologies . ]
The disclosure of Iran ’s nuclear facility under construction for years in secret near Qom — the second such undisclosed facility operated by Iran — deepens “ a growing concern , ” President Obama said in Pittsburgh this morning , “ that Iran is refusing to live up to those international responsibilities , including specifically revealing all nuclear - related activities . ”
But notice that neither Obama , French President Nicholas Sarkozy nor British Prime Minister Gordon Brown accused Iran of a specific violation of its international nuclear responsibilities , and pivoted their case instead on Iran ’s concealment .
That ’s because it ’s not actually clear whether Iran has committed a specific violation of either the Nuclear Nonprofileration Treaty or its follow - on agreements negotiated separately with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Under the NPT , each state negotiates a safeguards agreement to the IAEA so the atomic watchdog can work out where and how to establish monitoring devices like cameras at declared facilities .
“ Iran ’s specific safeguards agreement does n’t say anything about the time limits for the provision of design information , ” says Ivanka Barzashka , an analyst with the Federation of American Scientists ’ Strategic Security Program .
Specific time - frames for site or design disclosure typically occur in * additional *“ subsidiary arrangements , ” and usually provide for disclosure around 180 days before the introduction of nuclear material into a given facility .
But Iran ’s subsidiary arrangement with the IAEA “ has not been made public as far as I know , ” Barzashka says .
That said , in its Aug. 28 report , the IAEA criticizes Iran for not adopt implementing a section of its subsidiary arrangement that dealt with design notificiation .
“ The absence of such information results in late notification to the Agency of the construction of new facilities and changes to the design of existing facilities , ” the IAEA warned .
Barzashka translates that such adoption would require Iran to notify the IAEA “ of the construction of a new plant , any kind of new facilities , as soon as a decision has been authorized by the government . ”
And that clearly has n’t happened .
According to an U.S. intelligence official who would only speak on background , “ We ’ve known about this facility for years .
Over time , a clearer picture evolved of Iran ’s intentions and activities at this covert site — one that , it turns out , was n’t unknown to us . ”
That ’s still not the same thing as a broken obligation binding under international law .
But the lack of a specific broken obligation , in turn , is n’t a reason to dismiss today ’s disclosure .
“ It adds to the fact that Iran ’s behavior is ambiguous , ” Barzashka says .
“ The issue for Iran should be to do anything to dissuade this concern , like [ implementing ] further transparency measures … that should be the issue Iran should address . ”
Update : Just in case , maybe this post from Barzashka and her boss , Ivan Oelrich , can clarify the point :
The latest IAEA report ( GOV / 2009 / 55 ) states that Iran has not yet implemented early provisions of design information in accordance with the revised Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements General Part , which would require Iran to notify the agency of the construction of new facilities or modifications to existing ones as soon as such a decision has been authorized by the government or the plant operator .
The original agreement required Iran to submit such information no later than 180 days before the introduction of nuclear material into the facility ( GOV / 2003/40 ) .
So that looks like an if - then trigger for a violation .
If there was some reason to suspect that Iran was going to place nuclear material for enrichment at the Qom facility within the next six months — and I ’m not sure what that may have been , to be clear — then that , as well , might explain why this announcement came when it did .
Thanks to reader / pal MWH for the tip .
Update 2 : Much much more on that here .

I took a walk through the Tea Party that called itself a " March on Washington " on September 12 , 2009 .
The Washington Post ran a picture ; a couple of people put up photo - essays on Flicr.com ; somebody else put a video up on YouTube that went viral : See : Teabaggers can ’’t handle a little dissent .
http://www.youtube.com/...
Although it made a mess of my law practice for a week , it made last week one of the best of my life , and for that , I have you to thank .
So this is my thank - you note to the boggosphere for letting me hear more kind things about me than will be said before my funeral .
Many had questions .
WHY ?
Why do people attend the other guys ’’ rally with a giant sign ?
Mostly just to show them what we are really here ; show them what we look like ; show them that we wo n’t back down .
To listen to the radio clowns , " we " are ignorant and lazy and hoping to sponge free health insurance off those who work .
I ’m a lawyer , who , as quite a few noticed , has n’t missed enough meals .
I have health insurance .
I have a nice income .
I know how important it is to make sure America gets what it is paying for from the health providers and I know how important it is that everyone has access to affordable , adequate health care .
It seemed important to show them that picture .
And I won ’’t deny that needling my opponents was on the agenda .
Providing a photo op for press covering the event was probably on my list as well .
A question that many many many of them were shouting at me was " how much are you being paid ? "
Sometimes in the video you see me laugh out loud .
That was one of those times .
Seriously : how much would you have to pay somebody to do that ?
PATRIOTS ONE ; PATRIOTS ALL
But for many , the " why " question was " why was n’’t I scared ?
The answer to that is twofold .
First , I was very confident that I was n’’t going to be hurt .
This was not my first rodeo .
At about every march I ’ve been to over 40 years , there were opponents .
Frequently pretty loud and nasty opponents .
The anti-abortion folks and the anti-gay folks are pretty much a fixture at any left - wing event .
But I ’’ve never personally witnessed anyone being hospitalized .
If anyone were killed or even seriously hurt , I feel like I would have read about it , and it has n’’t happened .
At least not since Kent State .
And that ’’s with both sides screaming obscenities in each others ’’ face .
As you can see in the video , I was almost completely moot except to answer the questions of reporters and police , at least until the melee subsided .
This is not true of , say sports rallies .
When feelings are up this high over one team vs. another , it ’s not uncommon at all for people to be injured .
I ’m convinced that this is because people who turn out at events designed to make America a better place are people who care about people .
People who take off time to go try to change policy .
Patriots .
On both sides .
Our rallies , their rallies .
We have far more in common with people on the other side of the issue than with folks who do n’t know what " public option " means .
I respect them for that , and I hope it showed .
Shoot , it may have saved my life .
Secondly , both I and they knew what would have happened if I was wrong .
Now nothing at all can sound as pretentious as somebody with my crabby nature and occasional temper invoking the Mahatma .
But if every sinner in the bar can call himself a Christian who tries , albeit unsuccessfully , to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ , then I feel like I can tell you that I tried to implement what I think I have learned from Gandhi .
That is that if they hit me , it will hurt them 10,000 times as much as it hurts me , but that if I even thought about hitting back , it could mean . . . well , that 's a pretty brutal thought .
But confident as I was that if anybody jumped me , the others would pull her off before she could do real damage , I also knew that if she did hit me in the head or throw a rock at my back , she would so shake the faith of everyone who saw it , everyone who was shown a picture of it .
An instant loss of any moral high ground .
I ’’ve been punched before ; I can take a blow .
That little bit of discomfort would be a very small price to pay to strike a blow like that at those who are denying health care to millions of Americans .
MdFriendofHillary ????
The first blog I saw about the video was one in Daily Kos that identified me by my Kos and Flickr persona , MdFriendofHillary .
So a few have questioned the moniker " MDFriendofHillary . "
Does that mean I do not support the President ?
Hardly .
Although I worked very hard for Hillary ; I campaigned in eight states ( if you include the District of Columbia ) , but after she withdrew on June 7 , asking us to work as hard for Barack Obama as we did for her , I took her at her word .
I had signs similar to the one you see in the Tea Party ready for the July 4th Parades in 2008 .
It has always seemed important to me to show the world that there were a LOT of us who worked hard for Hillary and quickly assembled behind Barack Obama .
But the biggest reason is the Flickr.com page .
I use that page to distribute pictures I have taken of supporters posing with my signs .
As you will see if you check out the Flickr page for " MdFriendofHillary " , there are several thousand pictures of people posing with my signs .
I passed out little slips of paper telling people they could go there and download the pix that they could then put on their Facebook page , or use to make t- shirts , or send to Mom to tell her who you support .
I ’ ’ll go over 50,000 " views " this week .
That ’’s a lot of folks who know that name , I thought .
WHERE CAN WE GET SIGNS LIKE THAT ?
I made each one of those signs with office equipment .
They are 8 ½½ x 11 " sheets of paper that I printed on an Hewlett - Packard 6310 color - jet all - in - one printer - scanner - fax machine .
The important point is the " postering " software .
What I use is a program I bought in 2001 on Ebay called " Monster Photo . "
I can ’’t find another copy of the software , but the " poster " option is available on most photo - printing software .
IF YOU ’’RE EVER IN [ pick one : JUNEAU , NY , CLEVELAND , . . . . .]
I ’ ’D LOVE TO [ pick one : MARCH WITH YOU , HUG YOU , BUY YOU A BEER ] !
And I ’’d love to march with you , too .
But please do n’’t wait for me to make it to Oswego .
This thing can ’’t wait till I get to Oswego .
We need a public option .
NOW .
There are several ways you can march with me without waiting for me .
First , as soon as you finish , go to www.my.barackobama.com.
That ’’s the old campaign web - site .
It appears on the screen as " Organizing for America . "
There , once you sign in , you can plug in your zip code and find events near you , volunteer opportunities , and , well , news about what thousands and thousands of " Friends of Hillary " are doing now to make this thing happen .
You can also help me out a bit .
I told Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz of Montgomery County , Pennsylvania that I would be a co-host her fundraiser - reception , and , well , I ’’ve been a bit distracted .
She is the Co-Chair of the New Democrats ’’ Task Force on Health Reform and has been a leader of our cause for I do n ’’t know how long .
Here are some links to YouTube videos of her defending our issue :
Now this is an important district for us .
It ’’s the swing district that was held by Marjorie Margolies - Mezvinsky who lost it in the first off - year election after Bill Clinton won , famously risking her political career to be one of the last votes to put Bill Clinton ’ ’s transformational budget over the top .
It would be intollerable to lose that seat in the first off - year election after the next Democratic President because she was a leader in passing his health care reform .
So if you could drop by her web - site and mention my name when you made some show of support , it might help me be a hero instead of the goat .
AllysonSchwartz.com
Finally : Giant Brass Ones .
For a guy with real insecurity issues , seeing all of the praise is . . . . well it 's wonderful .
And sooooo over the top .
" My hero ! " " courageous " .
Oh my .
Thank you so much .
But at the risk of sounding ingracious , I 'm at least a little embarrassed by the connection between " courage " and my male body parts .
Of all of the " courageous " people I 've heard about in all of my life , the bravest of the brave is a whole group of people I 've never met .
In Viet Nam and , I guess , in any modern war zone , they ferry the wounded into field hospitals on helicopters , where they are first met by triage nurses .
Those young ladies ( they were nearly all women ) had to decide in a split second whether this one was " savable if we get him into surgery immediately " , " savable and can wait " or either " not savable " or " only savable if we could throw out a better candidate and there fore not savable . "
If " not savable , " they to dispatched them to another group of young women who were USO volunteers who would hold their hands until the passed .
It 's been said that the USO volunteers always wore perfume because they wanted the soldiers to know it was a woman holding their hands even if they were blinded or bandaged to the point that they could not see .
Somehow , those women got themselves out of bed in the morning knowing that that would be their day .
They got up , put on a folded a cotton cap and walked into absolute hell every morning they were there .
Courage .
Courage that makes you wonder how they invented the word before they say those young women go to work .
Courage that makes me embarrassed to be called " brave . "
And maybe even more embarrassing is having my courage praised by pointing out the most obvious difference between them and me : my sex .
I am so flattered to be so praised .
You do n't know how much ; you can't .
But I would soooo prefer to be praised in a way that shows what faint impersonation of those women ’’s courage I was able to display when my chance came around , instead of having being praised for the way in which I can never be like them .
Thank you so much .

On Oct. 7 , 2009 , the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Salazar v. Buono , a case involving a constitutional challenge to the presence of an eight - foot - tall Christian cross in the Mojave National Preserve in San Bernardino County , Calif .
The case arose when Frank Buono , a former assistant superintendent of the preserve , filed a lawsuit demanding that the National Park Service , which administers the preserve , remove the cross .
Buono argued that because the cross is on government land it amounts to a government endorsement of religion and thus violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
After eight years of litigation in lower courts , the case is now before the Supreme Court .
The high court ’s decision has the potential to determine the fate of the cross and similar displays across the country as well as to limit who may bring Establishment Clause lawsuits in federal court .
The Pew Research Center ’s Forum on Religion & Public Life provides a brief overview of the case ’s long path to the Supreme Court and the arguments that the parties are likely to make when they appear before the justices .
What is the origin of this controversy ?
In 1934 , the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) , a private organization , honored World War I veterans by placing a Christian cross on top of a large outcropping known as Sunrise Rock , on public land in what is now the Mojave National Preserve .
Over the years , other private groups and individuals have replaced the cross several times ; the current cross was erected in 1998 by Henry Sandoz , a private citizen who lives in the area .
In 1999 , a Utah resident asked the National Park Service for permission to erect a stupa , a type of Buddhist memorial , near the cross .
The Park Service rejected the request , saying that federal law prohibits private parties from installing memorials and other permanent displays on federal property without authorization .
In rejecting the Buddhist memorial , the Park Service also declared that it intended to remove the cross from Sunrise Rock because the bureau had never authorized its installation .
In December 2000 , in response to this announcement , the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of government funds to remove the cross .
Following the passage of this law , the Park Service did not remove the cross from Sunrise Rock .
How did the case progress through the federal court system and ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court ?
In March 2001 , former Assistant Superintendent Buono filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California claiming that the National Park Service had to remove the cross because its display violated the Establishment Clause .
In January 2002 , while Buono ’s lawsuit was still in the district court , Congress designated the cross as a national memorial , putting it in a select group with just 45 other national memorials , including famous structures such as the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial .
In addition , Congress allocated federal funding to the Park Service for the purpose of installing a memorial plaque at the site and obtaining a replica of the original VFW cross .
Shortly after , in July 2002 , the district court held that the display of the cross on federal property violated the Establishment Clause and ordered the Park Service to remove it .
Three months later , to ensure that the district court ’s order was not carried out , Congress passed another law that banned the use of federal dollars to remove the cross .
The National Park Service then appealed the district court ’s order to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
In September 2003 , while this appeal was still in the 9th Circuit , Congress passed yet another law , this time instructing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer ownership of Sunrise Rock and a surrounding acre to the VFW .
In exchange , Sandoz , who had erected the current cross , voluntarily gave the federal government approximately five acres of land that he owned near Sunrise Rock .
The 2003 law also stated that if the VFW used the property as anything other than a memorial , the federal government would regain ownership of the land .
In June 2004 , before the Secretary of the Interior completed the property transfer to the VFW , the 9th Circuit , in a unanimous opinion written by U.S. Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski , affirmed the district court ’s ruling that the Park Service had to remove the cross because its display violated the Establishment Clause .
The government did not seek the U.S. Supreme Court ’s review of this ruling , a fact that would become highly relevant to the argument in Buono ’s brief to the Supreme Court .
Despite the 9th Circuit ’s ruling that the display violated the Establishment Clause , the National Park Service did not remove the cross but instead took steps toward transferring the property to the VFW , as required by the September 2003 congressional statute .
Buono responded by filing a new lawsuit in the district court , this time to enforce the district court ’s order to remove the cross as well as to prohibit the Park Service from transferring the land to the VFW .
The district court agreed with Buono and invalidated the property transfer as an illegal attempt to evade the court ’s earlier order to remove the cross .
The Park Service appealed the new ruling to the 9th Circuit , which in 2007 affirmed the district court ’s judgment .
The Park Service then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , and in February 2009 , the high court agreed to hear the case .
Because the Park Service is administered by the Department of the Interior and Ken Salazar is currently the Secretary of the Interior , the case now before the Supreme Court is called Salazar v. Buono .
What arguments does Salazar make in the government ’s brief to the Supreme Court to explain why the National Park Service is not required to remove the cross ?
In his brief to the high court , Salazar makes two principal arguments .
First , he claims that the district court and the 9th Circuit did not have jurisdiction over the case because Buono did not have legal standing ( the right to sue ) .
To have standing in a federal court , the person bringing the lawsuit must show that he or she was injured in some way by the opposing party .
Salazar contends that the public display of the cross did not injure Buono because Buono is a practicing Catholic , and , moreover , Buono has conceded that he does not find the sight of a Christian cross on public land offensive in and of itself .
Rather , Buono objects to the government ’s prohibiting people from installing other freestanding , permanent displays – such as the Buddhist memorial – on the preserve .
Because Buono does not find the cross itself offensive and because he is not one of the people who has requested to install a display on the preserve , Salazar argues that Buono has not suffered any injury and thus does not have legal standing .
Salazar ’s second claim is that even if Buono did have standing to bring the case , the 9th Circuit was wrong in holding that the display of the cross violates the Establishment Clause .
Salazar contends that although the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from endorsing religious messages , the display of the cross in this case does not violate the clause because the cross no longer sits on government property and thus , by definition , does not constitute a government - sponsored religious message .
According to Salazar , the link between the cross and any government message ended when Congress passed the 2003 law instructing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer Sunrise Rock to the VFW .
Salazar further argues that the 2003 law was valid because its primary purpose was not to endorse a religious message but rather to preserve the memorial .
According to Salazar , Congress sought to transfer the property to the VFW instead of putting the property up for a public bid because Congress concluded that the VFW , as the group that originally created the memorial , would give the memorial the best attention and care .
What is Buono ’s argument in response ?
Buono makes two principal claims in his brief .
First , he contends that he had standing to bring an Establishment Clause claim in federal court against the National Park Service because Supreme Court precedents recognize such standing for persons who have had “ direct and unwelcome contact with a religious symbol on government land . ”
Buono argues that his contact with the display was “ unwelcome , ” even if the cross itself did not offend him , because it represented for him the government ’s preference for one faith over others .
Second , Buono argues that the continued display of the cross violates the Establishment Clause .
Part of his argument is based on the rules that govern lawsuits in federal court .
Buono contends that because the government never appealed the 9th Circuit ’s 2004 ruling that the display of the cross violated the Establishment Clause , federal court rules prohibit the Supreme Court from reversing that 9th Circuit decision .
In other words , Buono argues that the Supreme Court may not rule any longer on the original question of whether the display violates the Establishment Clause .
Instead , Buono asserts , the high court ’s Establishment Clause inquiry must now be limited simply to whether the 9th Circuit was correct in its 2007 ruling that the transfer of Sunrise Rock to the VFW did not eliminate the original Establishment Clause problem .
According to Buono , the congressional transfer of the property did not correct the original Establishment Clause violation because in transferring the property Congress did not repeal the law that designated the cross as a national memorial .
Buono argues that because one of the most important Establishment Clause principles is that the government may not favor one faith over others , a congressionally designated national memorial is unconstitutional if it includes a cross but not other religious symbols .
Because of this designation , Buono concludes that Congress could not remedy the Establishment Clause violation by transferring the property to the VFW and that the only remedy would be to remove the cross itself .
Buono further argues that even if it were possible in the abstract for Congress to correct the original Establishment Clause violation by transferring the cross to a private group , the display in this case would still be unconstitutional because the transfer of property was incomplete .
Under the congressional statute that gave the land to the VFW , the federal government would regain the property if the group stopped using it as a memorial .
Because the federal government maintains an interest in the property and this interest is tied to the continued display of the memorial , Buono argues that the government has not sufficiently disconnected itself from the religious display .
What might be the significance of Salazar v. Buono ?
The significance of the case will come down to which legal avenue the court chooses to resolve the dispute .
If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Buono on the Establishment Clause issue , then that ruling could require federal , state and local governments to remove many sectarian religious symbols from memorials across the country .
Alternatively , if the high court holds that the display of the cross does not violate the Establishment Clause , then that ruling might allow the government to give one religious group ’s symbols special prominence in public parks and buildings .
Moreover , if the court reverses the 9th Circuit ’s decision on the ground that Buono did not have standing to bring his Establishment Clause claim , then in the future other citizens across the country might find it more difficult to bring similar lawsuits in federal court .
The court could limit such a lack of standing to people who claim to be offended specifically by the government ’s preference for some religious displays over others , or the court might go further and rule that people who generally object to public religious displays lack standing .
The case also might provide a significant indication of how the Supreme Court ’s newest member , Justice Sonia Sotomayor , views church - state issues .
She has replaced Justice David Souter , who was widely considered to be the high court ’s most ardent supporter of church - state separation .
Sotomayor ’s position on this case thus might provide some insight into the direction of church - state law under the newly constituted Supreme Court .

Patadas voladoras contra el crimen
En México hay distintas formas de combatir y prevenir los delitos .
A la policía de Reynosa , Tamaulipas , al norte del país , no se le ocurrió nada mejor que contratar a un luchador enmascarado para que le auxilie en su trabajo .
Pie de foto , El experto en artes marciales está inspirado en un personaje de Indonesia .
Se trata de Tajac , experto en artes marciales , inspirado en un personaje de Indonesia que hasta tiene su propia página en Facebook .
El “ Poliluchador ” ( contracción de policía y luchador ) como se le conoce en Reynosa , tiene la misión de enseñar a los niños a denunciar a los delincuentes y de paso ofrece consejos y técnicas de lucha para defenderse de ellos .
El secretario de Seguridad Pública de Reynosa , Carlos Leal , aseguró que el programa ha dado buenos resultados .
“ Queremos que los niños depositen su confianza en un superhéroe al que sientan cercano , como Tajac ” , dijo en conversación con BBC Mundo .
Patadas voladoras
Las presentaciones del luchador se realizan en patios de las escuelas primarias , a donde llega a bordo de un auto de la policía municipal , al que en Reynosa le llaman “ mula ” .
Como parte del evento , dos sujetos fornidos simulan atacarlo , pero el enmascarado responde con patadas voladoras y llaves de lucha .
En unos minutos logra vencerlos .
Los niños aplauden y gritan emocionados , mientras por un altavoz los maestros explican la moraleja del espectáculo : los delincuentes no pueden derrotar a la policía .
Enseguida , Tajac enseña a los niños a defenderse de los ladrones .
“ Les dice qué hacer si alguien pretende quitarles la mochila o su dinero , son técnicas de lucha libre ” , explicó Leal .
Detrás de la máscara
Tajac ofrece sus clases en silencio , con señas , pues supuestamente el personaje que representa no habla español .
Pero la realidad es distinta , pues tras la máscara hay un policía mexicano , experto en artes marciales , que cuando no aconseja niños vigila las calles de Reynosa , una de las ciudades más violentas de la frontera norte de México , según datos de la Procuraduría General de la República , la fiscalía del país .
Pie de foto , El " poliluchador " enseña a los niños a denunciar a los delincuentes .
Sin embargo , su tarea más importante es evitar que los niños de esta población sean reclutados por la delincuencia organizada , señaló el secretario de Seguridad .
Y que los niños aprenden a no tener miedo a los delincuentes y a denunciarlos ante policías como Tajac , añadió el funcionario .
Por lo pronto , la policía de Reynosa organizó concursos de dibujo entre los niños para definir el trabajo del luchador .
“ Todos querían que siguiera luchando contra los malos ” , dijo Leal .
JOINT BASE BALAD , Iraq 
There is no more visible sign that America is putting the Iraq war behind it than the colossal operation to get its stuff out : 20,000 soldiers , nearly a sixth of the force here , assigned to a logistical effort aimed at dismantling some 300 bases and shipping out 1.5 million pieces of equipment , from tanks to coffee makers .
It is the largest movement of soldiers and matériel in more than four decades , the military said .
By itself , such a withdrawal would be daunting , but it is further complicated by attacks from an insurgency that remains active ; the sensitivities of the Iraqi government about a visible American presence ; disagreements with the Iraqis about what will be left for them ; and consideration for what equipment is urgently needed in Afghanistan .
All the while , the Army must sustain its current force of about 124,000 troops across the country , trucking in fuel , food and other essential supplies while determining what to leave behind for the 50,000 troops who will remain in a mostly advisory role until 2011 .
“ It ’s a real Rubik ’s Cube , ” Brig .
Gen. Paul L. Wentz , the commander of the Army ’s logistical soldiers , said in an interview at this sprawling military complex north of Baghdad , which will serve as the command center for the withdrawal effort .
My last post stirred up a lot of interesting feedback ; some folks thought calling yourself a Software Artisan was pretentious ( which is true , used in general conversation ) , some people thought it was a reasonable term , and some thought of other even more pretentious terms ( My favorite : Software Auteur .
It would be an amusing world where you could break the ice telling someone you were a Software Auteur . )
And some folks denied that software is handmade at all .
This is , to me , baffling .
I ’ve remodeled homes , moved bathrooms , built decks , made furniture , restored old hand - tools , assembled computers , jury - rigged a paint shed , and bought a ton of stuff at the hardware store destined not to be used for its nominal purpose .
I ’ve know professional wood - workers who could make a chair so pretty you would cry to see it , and no two they made were exactly identical .
My experiences are not much different from many of you , I expect .
I am astonished anyone could think software creation was anything but handmade .
Look , you ’ve heard the old saw that if you give ten good programmers the same task , they ’ll write ten different solutions , all of which meet the task .
I ’d go further :
If you gave me the same task ten times throughout the year , I ’d be likely to build ten fairly different solutions .
If you gave me the same task ten times across a few years , the ten solutions would bear little - to - no resemblance to each other at all .
Why the differences ?
Greater experience , use of whatever tools which were at the top of the heap at the moment , my mood , whether I had chai this morning or Coke , and a hundred other factors .
Fred Brooks in the Mythical Man Month talked about the need “ Plan To Throw One Away ” — the hindsight you have after building the first implementation drives the improved second implementation .
With compilers and IDE ’s today , the reality is every interesting program is written and rewritten tens if not hundreds of times before you even call it done the first time .
It is strange that people who work with an entirely logical medium — software developers — continually want to pretend they are ‘ artists ’ , ‘ craftspeople ’ , ‘ artisans ’ , ‘ writers ’ , ‘ performers ’ even .
It is some kind of delusion .
If you design systems by some logical understanding of their component properties , and some experiment where things are incompletely known , then you are doing engineering .
And there is nothing wrong with that !
It does not mean the job is automatable or predictable — engineering requires insight , judgement , and creativity .
— comment on Hacker News
Without commenting the use of ‘ delusion ’ , I will point out one core difference between software creation and other sorts of engineering : malleability .
malleable : Capable of being shaped or formed , as by hammering or pressure
Is there an engineering discipline where the product you create is anywhere near as subject to change during the development process as software ?
And when I say subject to change , I am talking about change driven by the designer , not by PHBs .
I ’ve worked with electrical engineers ; guys designing and testing circuit boards .
The spin cycle ( edit / compile/test/debug ) on interesting Verilog designs is large .
For really useful pieces of IP like a PCI Bus implementation the simulations may take hours , if not much longer , to complete .
Software guys have no patience for that ; it drove me nuts to burn an hour playing basketball between tests of my embedded code .
And the engineer in question is a really smart guy .
In a two - week cycle of development for a new feature I will rewrite , improve , destroy , re-frame , and generally fold , spindle and mutilate my implementation .
Yes , not every task gets this treatment , but if it is an interesting , important part of the code , you ca n’t just shoot out your first cut and be done .
In this , software seems to be fundamentally different from other traditional engineering disciplines .
I ca n’t imagine bridge builders really have this sort of cycle time ; or mechanical engineers , etc .
In many , if not most , of the physical engineering disciplines they use computers to model their designs up front , and that has gained them some turnaround time , but in software it ’s different : the model is the product .
You do n’t finish analyzing your model , then then push out a “ real ” one , and see if your modeling / simulation software was accurate : in software you ship the model .
This leads me to another observation : Software is often finished for a long time before it is complete .
By this I mean that every developer needs to evaluate , constantly , whether they have achieved the best trade off between better and good enough .
The chunk of code you ’re working on may be executed once in a blue moon and not be a performance hindrance ; call it done as soon as it works at all .
Or it may be deep code , linchpin code around which your product ’s performance and correctness revolves : get that sucker as right as you can in the time constraints you have .
Making that trade off at the right time gives managers headaches , and is all too often ignored by young software people .
So you know what I think .
What do you think ?
Is software handmade ?

Firefox feature looks to foil XSS attacks
The Mozilla Foundation released on Wednesday a preview version of the Firefox browser that implements a technology to protect against scripting attacks .
The technology , known as Content Security Policy , allows Web sites to specify restrictions on how they handle scripts .
Using CSP , a Web site can create a white list of sites from which the browser should accept scripts as well as mandate that the scripts are labeled as applications and are not obfuscated .
A number of other features are also available , all aiming to prevent malicious scripts from executing in the context of the current site .
The preview does not implement the entire specification , and Mozilla is looking for testers and feedback , Brandon Sterne , security program manager for Mozilla stated in Wednesday 's blog post .
" Please be aware that there are still a few rough spots , " Sterne said .
" The implementation is not quite complete so you may notice some small gaps between the preview builds and the spec . "
Content Security Policy is based on recommendations made by Robert " rsnake " Hansen back in 2005 .
Most browsers treat all scripts the same , executing in the context of the current site , no matter where they originated .
The defacto policy is what allowed untrusted ads on The New York Times site to recently serve up malicious software to visitors and allowed the Samy and other Web worms to spread .
Content Security
Policy allows sites to tell browsers which scripts should be allowed as well as additional restrictions on scripting .
Mozilla has created a demo page for security researchers who want to see content security policy in action .

Little girl at the window :
Only known film of Anne Frank is posted on YouTube
Courage : Video footage of Anne Frank , shown here in an undated photo , has been released on YouTube
The only known film footage of diarist Anne Frank has been released for the first time to a worldwide audience .
The haunting black - and - white images show the then 12 - year - old schoolgirl leaning out a window in her home city of Amsterdam at the height of World War II in July 1941 .
Despite clearly smiling , she looks vulnerable and alone as she stares out on to the busy street .
Soon afterwards Nazi persecution of Jews meant she and her family had to go into hiding , before she was finally captured and sent to a concentration camp where she died aged 15 .
Anne Frank ’s Diary , chronicling her last few years , was first published in 1947 and became an international symbol of the Holocaust .
But while Anne ’s prose has moved millions across the world and plenty of still photographs have been published , few have seen the only known film of her .
The Anne Frank House , a museum dedicated to her legacy , was in possession of the film - but previously it was only accessible to those visiting the museum or watching documentaries that contained the footage .
[ caption ]
Now , however , the museum - which is celebrating its 50th anniversary - has launched a YouTube channel as part of a virtual museum about her life .
The channel includes the 20 - second video segment shot before a neighbour ’s wedding - making it available around the world to anyone with an internet connection .
A clearly excited Anne can be seen watching the bride and groom heading off to Church , surrounded by friends , family and passers - by .
There are few clues to the horrors to come .
See the video here
‘ People around the world will be able to explore the life and significance of Anne Frank through such unique images , ’ a museum spokesman said .
The site contains a clip of South African anti-apartheid activist and Nobel peace prize laureate , former president Nelson Mandela , talking about the strength he had derived from Anne 's diary during his own imprisonment .
The newly released channel also includes an interview with Anne ’s father , Otto Frank .
He was the only member of the family to survive the war and , after returning to Amsterdam , found his daughter ’s diary had been saved and got it published .
Started by Anne shortly after her 13th birthday , it chronicles her life from 12 June 1942 until 1 August 1944 , not long before she perished at Germany ’s Bergen - Belsen camp from typhus .
The diary was first published in Dutch in 1947 .
Since then it has been translated into numerous languages , and is now one of the world ’s most widely read books .
The virtual , online museum will be launched on April 28 next year as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Anne Frank House museum
This day will always bring more questions than answers .
How to explain to your child what happened on a crystalline morning eight years ago ?
And if your child is Muslim , those questions have added layers , and more complicated answers .
In a guest blog today , Moina Noor ( a freelance journalist who blogs about public education at NorwalkNet.com ) describes trying to make sense of it for her young son , while still trying to understand it all herself .
Explaining 9/11 to a Muslim Child
By Moina Noor
Recently on the morning drive to school my 8 - year - old son asked me a question I ’ve been dreading since he was a baby , “ Mom , what happened on 9/11 ? ”
Mass murder is impossible to explain to yourself , let alone a child .
But how do I , as a parent , explain the slaughter of innocent people in the name of a religion that I am trying to pass on to my boy ?
Bilal was just 8 months old when September 11 happened .
He was just starting to crawl and put everything in sight into his mouth , and I remember having to peel my gaze away from the television screen and remind myself to keep a watchful eye on where he lay nearby .
After Bilal was born I viewed everything — especially current events — through the lens of parenthood .
I knew the world had changed irreparably on 9/11 , and while I mourned the innocent and raged against my crazy coreligionists , my nagging anxiety was for my son .
Even in those early surreal hours after the attacks when images of towers falling and long - bearded men in caves flooded the television screen , I knew that Bilal ’s childhood would not be like mine .
When I was growing up in suburban Connecticut few people knew much about Muslims , let alone cared .
My parents and their friends would gather in community rooms or church basements for our version of Sunday school .
They were devout but were n’t necessarily interested in teaching their neighbors about Islam .
We were few in number and invisible .
After 9/11 , the spotlight was aimed at Muslims everywhere , especially here in America .
Like many Muslims , I felt the need to defend my religious identity .
I threw myself into all things Muslim , and explained and explained : “ We are like you .
Islam is peaceful .
Complex sociopolitical factors create lunatics who kill people .
Please do n’t judge a billion people by a few bad apples . ”
I hung tightly to my spiritual rope .
I could not let go of a faith has given me and my family comfort and solace for generations .
Since 9/11 , I ’ve worried how Bilal would feel about his identity as a Muslim living in America .
A survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life appeared in 2007 stating that 35 percent of respondents had an unfavorable opinion about Islam .
Could one of those 3 in 10 people be Bilal ’s teacher or soccer coach ?
Over the past eight years I ’ve read about Muslims being deported and pulled off airplanes and mosques being vandalized .
My sister , a former middle school teacher in Brooklyn , heard kids taunt a Muslim student on the playground , calling him a terrorist .
And even though I fear the possibility of discrimination for Bilal , what I fear most of all is that the din of Islamophobia will rob my son of self - respect and confidence .
So just as I became an activist , I became a proactive Muslim mommy .
When Bilal was a preschooler , I took him to Muslim playgroups , organized activities in Ramadan and bought him board books about the Prophet Muhammed .
I pushed him in his stroller at peace walks and brought him to interfaith events .
These days , I organize local Islamic school classes and give talks about the Hajj at his elementary school .
My husband and I read him books about Islamic contributions to math and science .
Over the years , I ’ve tried to protect my son from any negative associations made with Islam .
I ’ve developed lightening quick reflexes — the second I hear a story about suicide bombers or terrorists on the radio , I switch to a pop music station .
I ’ve made my husband limit his CNN time to after the kids go to sleep .
I do n’t want to have to answer the question , “ Mom , what is the ‘ threat of radical Islamic extremism ? ’ ”
For me , the thought of talking to Bilal about terrorism is a bit like talking about sex for the first time .
It is awkward and difficult I ’m just not sure how much a child his age is ready to hear .
This year 9/11 falls during Ramadan , the Muslim holy month of fasting .
I made Bilal watch President Obama ’s five minute long “ Ramadan Message to Muslims ” on the Internet .
President Obama spoke with respect , knowledge and a sense optimism to Muslims around the world .
He found the speech interesting but nothing out of the ordinary .
For Bilal , who is just starting to become conscious of a world bigger than our front yard , there is no “ clash of civilizations ” .
Bilal is proud to tell others that he was named after “ the Prophet ’s best friend , ” an African Muslim with a beautiful voice who gave the first call to prayer .
He is also a Cub Scout who has learned how to fold the American flag .
I did try and answer Bilal ’s question .
I relayed the day ’s events in broad cartoonish strokes : bad guys attack , buildings collapse .
Do n’t worry , I assured him , we ’ll get the bad guys so they wo n’t do it again .
As I looked at Bilal in the rearview mirror , I explained that good and bad exists in every group , even your own .
I think he understands .

( NewsTarget ) France`s highest court has ruled that Monsanto lied about the safety of its weed killing herbicide Roundup .
The decision came just days ago and confirms an earlier court judgment in France finding that Monsanto had falsely advertised Roundup as being " biodegradable " and that it " left the soil clean .
"
The original case was brought to court in 2001 by several French environmental groups alleging that Roundup 's main ingredient , glyphosate , has a classification as " dangerous to the environment " by the European Union .
That case drug on for years and finally ended in a ruling against Monsanto in 2007 .
The GMO giant quickly appealed and that appeal was heard in 2008 in the Lyon court .
Monsanto lost that case as well .
They appealed again .
This time it went to France 's Supreme Court ; it lost that hearing and now faces fines and nowhere else to go for further appeals .
The court levied a 13,800 Euro fine against the company ( about $ 22,400USD ) .
Monsanto is also looking at continued losses with fourth quarter losses of $ 233 million ( US ) , mostly due to plummeting sales of the Roundup brand .
So far , Monsanto has made no public statement about the court`s ruling , but it is also possible that the ruling could mean civil cases from farmers and communities harmed by the false advertising .
That could mean millions of dollars more in losses .
Roundup is the world`s best - selling herbicide and is marketed as a weed - killer to both commercial farmers and home owners .
Monsanto is also the world`s largest purveyor of genetically modified seeds ( GMO seeds ) .
Often , the seeds are sold in conjunction with Roundup , the seeds being modified to be " herbicide tolerant " ( HT - ready ) .
Some have argued that these GM crops and seeds are worse for the environment and could be a real problem .
Crop failures of GMO seeds in Africa have highlighted the lack of a crop diversity issue while other studies have found that GM versus non-GM seeds have little or no bearing on higher yields , as seed companies like Monsanto have claimed .
Currently , in the United States , nearly all of our soybean plants and most of our corn crops are now GMO , and most of the seed crops for those plants are Monsanto - owned .
In fact , at least 68 % of corn and 90 % of soy is a GMO ( HT - ready ) crop in the U.S. now and Monsanto is working hard to make that a fact worldwide .
Recent decisions , such as this one in France and a court finding in the U.S. earlier this month , as well as a common blockade in many European countries , are pushing back against the Monsanto takeover of our food crops .
Other initiatives , such as Shelly Roche`s " Replace Roundup Challenge , " are using consumer boycotts to further take it to Monsanto`s pocketbook .

Mormons Play Victim , Claim Threats by Gays Like Treatment of Blacks in the South During Civil Rights Movement »
Today 's Wall Street Journal has a rather eye - opening article about how Irving Azoff tried doing an unholy ( for fans ) deal with ticket scalpers to drive up ticket prices : Before Ticketmaster Entertainment Inc. , the nation 's leading ticket seller , and Live Nation Inc. decided to merge , Ticketmaster pursued a strategy to thwart the concert promoter 's plan to enter the ticket - selling business , according to several people familiar with the matter .
Spearheaded by Irving Azoff , Ticketmaster 's current chief executive , the effort sought to combine several of the nation 's biggest ticket scalpers with Ticketmaster and other major concert - industry players .
At the time , Mr. Azoff was the CEO of Front Line Management , which handles dozens of top musical acts and was partly owned by Ticketmaster .
The goal of the initiative , codenamed " Project Showtime , " was to capture a piece of the sky - high prices charged by scalpers , which can exceed a ticket 's face value by hundreds , or even thousands , of dollars .
They could then compete against Live Nation 's nascent ticketing business by offering to share the scalpers ' revenue with entertainers and venues .
Others involved in the talks included AEG Live , the largest concert promoter after Live Nation , and MSG Entertainment , which owns Madison Square Garden .
After months of talks , the initiative against Live Nation -- which back then was in effect positioning itself as a competitor of both Ticketmaster and the brokers -- fell apart amid mutual distrust , according to people familiar with the matter .
Neither side was confident it would get accurate accounting from the other .
Nonetheless , the plan sheds light on the motives behind the current merger , whose antitrust implications are currently under review by the Justice Department .
The proposed merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster would join the two former rivals and also create a more efficient way to realize many of the financial benefits Ticketmaster would have received if it had teamed up with the brokers .
A combined company could set prices that are closer to what the market will bear , according to people familiar with the company 's strategy , allowing it to snag much of the money that currently flows to scalpers .
" Ticketmaster continually explores new and viable revenue streams in both the primary and secondary marketplace on behalf of our clients and live event rightsholders , " a Ticketmaster spokesman said .
He cited numerous ways the company has sought " to maximize sales and capture the fair market ticket value for promoters , venues , teams and artists .
" Testifying before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Competition earlier this year , Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino cited all the money flowing to the burgeoning scalping industry as a key rationale for the merger .
" [ Scalping ] is about a billion - dollar business that we receive zero dollars from , " Mr. Rapino complained .
" We spend millions on real - estate and artist investments , and we realize zero of the scalping market .
" Scalpers , who prefer to be called brokers , are worried that the merger could run them out of business .
" If this merger were to go through , the secondary market for concert tickets as we know it would cease to exist , " predicts Paul McCann , a ticket broker near Baltimore who was not involved in the Project Showtime talks .
" They would replace it with something they create , and they will keep all the money the secondary market generates .
" The attempt to create Project Showtime got started with a meeting at Ticketmaster 's West Hollywood , Calif. , headquarters in the summer of 2007 .
It was led by Mr. Azoff , who opened with a joke .
" I always knew we 'd end up in a room together , " he told the assembled brokers , according to people with knowledge of the meeting .
" I just thought it would be a courtroom .
" Present at the meeting , according to these people , were senior executives of AEG Live , Ticketmaster and Cablevision Systems Corp .'s MSG Entertainment , which owns Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall .
Spokesmen for AEG and MSG Entertainment declined to comment .
The brokers at the meeting were the owners of Boston - based Ace Ticket ; Los Angeles 's Barry 's Tickets Service ; Fort Lauderdale 's Total Tickets ; Chicago 's Gold Coast Tickets ; New York City 's Elite Ticket Service ; and Alliance Tickets , which operates in Denver , Las Vegas and Seattle .
Promoters and others in the mainstream concert business have long looked with envy at the steep markups scalpers charge for hot concerts .
The Internet has made such resales easier and even more lucrative , allowing brokers to buy tickets for events in distant cities and list them on Web sites like eBay Inc. 's StubHub.com .
But brokers can also be left holding the bag when they bet big on a show that flops or an outdoor event that is rained out .
Under the plan , the consortium led by Ticketmaster and its then - parent , IAC / InterActiveCorp. , was to acquire the six regional ticket brokers for as much as $ 25 million apiece and give them seats on the new venture 's board .
( Ticketmaster was spun off last year by IAC and subsequently acquired a majority stake in Mr. Azoff 's Front Line Management , installing him as CEO of the combined entity .
A spokeswoman for IAC declined to comment . )
At a dinner later , Timothy B. Schmit , a member of the Eagles , one of Mr. Azoff 's longtime management clients , stopped by .
There was even a test run in the fall of 2007 , according to numerous people with knowledge of the matter .
Up to 500 of the best seats to each of about 20 concerts by Van Halen , the veteran hard - rock band managed by Mr. Azoff , were pulled from the Ticketmaster system and passed directly to the brokers being considered for acquisition .
The brokers kept 30 % of the marked - up sale price for themselves , and the remaining 70 % was divided among Ticketmaster , the band and its handlers .
The band netted an extra $ 1 million , at least , from the arrangement , according to people familiar with the matter .
A spokesman said the band was n't available for comment .
But Ticketmaster executives were ultimately wary of going into business with the leaders of an industry they had long opposed .
The company briefly explored another avenue into the secondary market , paying $ 265 million last year for a ticket - resale site called TicketsNow .
Ticketmaster is now trying to sell that Web site , and people familiar with the situation say the company ultimately decided the merger would allow it to achieve many of the same goals as buying the ticket brokers .
Just last week , Ticketmaster also opened another front in its battle against scalpers , initiating a new technology that blocks any computer that attempts to access the company 's
Web site 1,000 times or more in a day , a frequency achieved by some professional scalpers using special computer software .
The move is likely to further heighten tensions with brokers .
A spokesman for Ticketmaster said , " We regularly take measures to protect the security of our Web site and system to enforce our terms of use .
" They do n't call him the Poison Dwarf for nothing , kids
Barely a day passes in which a story does n't emerge about Rupert Murdoch 's determination to charge for content .
If he is n't speaking about it himself , his senior executives are doing so .
The latest example , reported by Bobbie Johnson , saw News Corp 's deputy chairman , Chase Carey , suggesting that Hulu , the hugely popular TV and video streaming site in the US , could start charging users .
He did n't say it would definitely do so .
But even announcing that it might is part of a Murdochian script just now , a propaganda exercise to tell the world - and , most importantly , News Corp 's partners and rivals - that paying for content is The Way Ahead .
He is , in effect , trying to spin us into the belief that the freedom of exchange exemplified by the internet is a bad thing .
It makes it impossible for content - providers to profit from their content and thereby reduces the likelihood of those providers having enough revenue to provide more content .
Think about that for a moment .
It is a classic example of both media mogul arrogance and desperation .
It suggests that the current media corporations have a divine right to produce movies , TV programmes , music and journalism and , in so doing , to reproduce themselves .
They must be preserved at all costs .
Will the public accept that ?
Are they convinced that what Murdoch ( and the others ) have to offer is so unique , of such high quality and impossible to do without that they will pay for it ?
Hulu , an advertising - supported free - to - air site ( not available in Britain ) , is popular precisely because it is free .
Owned jointly by
News Corp 's
Fox division , Disney and NBC , it has built an audience since 2007 with shows such as House , The Simpsons and Lost .
It 's a great site , but given that it 's a catch - up service , providing second - run showings , it 's extremely unlikely that too many people will wish to pay .
In justifying a possible subscription model , Carey says : " I think a free model is a very difficult way to capture the value of our content . "
That 's an interesting phrase , coming straight from a commercial textbook : capturing value .
Similarly , Murdoch has spoken of the need to erect paywalls to overcome a " malfunctioning " business model .
But the net is a functioning non-business model , of course , one of the major reasons for it being so loved by people .
No wonder that a survey by Lightspeed Research into the likelihood of people paying for newspaper - related content came up with such startling results .
It found that 91 % of its respondents " would never pay " for online news and 90 % would n't pay for analysis .
I accept that people are bound to say that when the question is hypothetical , so there would be defectors from the purist position should they be required to pay .
But Murdoch , and those media corporations he is trying to persuade to join his paid content crusade , are going to get a nasty surprise .
Despite his success with BSkyB and pay - TV , there is no parallel with content on the internet .
Tens of thousands of detained refugees from the war in Sri Lanka are threatened by the imminent arrival of monsoon rains in the north of the country , according to an internal United Nations document .
The UN believes that about 66,000 people held in the vast Menik Farm internment camp since May face a humanitarian disaster when the rains start , bringing the spectre of disease .
Officials have urged the government to move those whose tents are most likely to be flooded by a mixture of rain and sewage .

And when one UN official spoke up in the press about the condition of children in the camps , he was expelled from the country According to the latest OCHA humanitarian report , " 253,567 people are accommodated in temporary camps " across Northern Sri Lanka .
Since the conflict only " 7,835 people have been released from temporary camps " ... Picture courtesy David Gray / Reuters .
Video discovered via Stop Genocide
Something in that picture hit me in the face .
These are not refugees , but Internally Displaced People ( IDPs ) .
Refugees are people driven from their homes to cross a border , " hosted " on foreign soil .
The ethnic Tamil population locked up behind barbed wire and sharpened sticks as fences , are Sri Lankan civilians , on Sri Lanka soil .
They were first held as human shields by the LTTE ( the " Tamil Tigers " ) during the last weeks of the civil war , and are now kept as prisoners by the government .
What kind of government locks up tens of thousands of their own civilians in inhumane circumstances ?
Maybe this video explains what government we are dealing with here ...
When markets were more agitated than they are today , one source of background worry was the Baltics .
The countries went on a debt binge , borrowing heavily from Swedish banks .
And while the amounts at issue are hardly earth - shaking by credit crisis standards , there is always the possibility that unexpected knock - on effects could lead to more serious consequences than now appear likely .
Not that the impact is not meaninful to parties immediately involved , namely Sweden and Lativia .
John Hempton provided background earlier in the year :
Latvia and to a lesser extent Estonia and Lithuania had a massive and unsustainable current account deficit .
That means they bought more from the rest of the world than they sold ( just like America buys far more from China et al than they sell ) .
The current account deficits ( relative to GDP ) was however much bigger in Latvia .
In a floating exchange rate regime this would usually be remedied by the currency falling dramatically , increasing the competitiveness of exports ( and increasing the price of imports ) .
The market provides a solution .
With America this can’t happen because the Chinese fix their currency against the US dollar .
In the Baltic States the currency is fixed against the Euro .
Normally to fix the exchange rate a central banker needs to buy the currency that is tending weaker .
They buy it and remove it from circulation .
In so doing the reduce the money supply in the weaker currency causing interest rates to rise and a mild monetary deflation ( increasing the competitiveness of local industry versus foreign competition ) and hence over time remedying the current account deficit .
Unfortunately this monetary deflation causes a recession in the country with the naturally weaker currency .
Ultimately that makes fixed rates unpopular in countries with chronic relative economic under - performance – because the populace does n’t like more or less continuous mild recessions …
Now there is one exception …
And that is if somebody cheaply finances your current account deficit ad - infinitum .
Then you can have the nice strong currency and spend it and not have any domestic price pressure .
Unfortunately you also wind up owing your foreign benefactors just way too much money .
The party has to end .
And it can end quite sharply when the foreign benefactor becomes less willing to lend to you .
Foreign benefactors have just put the choke collar on Latvia .
The government was unable to roll over its debt this week .
From MarketWatch :
Latvia ’s central bank warned Wednesday of “ another wave of distrust ” beginning to roll over the Baltic country , as the government received no bids for one of its three auctions for debt securities , heightening worries over its financial situation and the sustainability of its currency peg .
The Bank of Latvia , in an uncharacteristically dramatic statement for a central bank , said the lack of confidence can potentially bring higher interest rates and exacerbate conditions for entrepreneurs … .
Latvia has been battling to emerge from a deep financial crisis .
Sweden on Tuesday put pressure on the tiny Baltic nation to fulfill required spending cuts , threatening to withhold payments due at the turn of the year from a 7.5 billion euro rescue loan put together by Nordic countries .
Sweden , in other words , finds itself a major actor , along with the EU and the IMF , in negotiating a rescue package that extends new loans only if austerity measures are implemented .
But Latvia does not appear to be ready to accede to Sweden ’s demands .
The immediate cause for concern is that Latvia will simultaneously devalue its currency and provide a mechanism for its consumers to partially default on mortgages held by foreign banks .
From another MarketWatch story :
The Baltic country is squabbling with Western — mostly Swedish — leaders over spending cuts , and it ’s a very real possibility that the country may be forced to devalue its euro - pegged currency if emergency global funds do n’t arrive .
Were Latvia to devalue , that would hit economies in neighboring countries like Lithuania , and Swedish banks would rack up additional losses on the loans they have made throughout the region .
The real nightmare scenario would be the Swedish banks then pulling down other European banks , and then triggering Credit Crunch : Part 2 .
There is , of course , a long way before that unwieldy scenario comes to pass .
Latvia has n’t devalued — yet – and , even if it does , that does n’t mean it would drag the Swedish banks under .
Latvia just had a $ 17 million bond auction fail , as in no bids .
Which is understandable given the real possibility of a near - term devaluation .
The Guardian comments less than enthusiastically about the central bank ’s idea of how to cut the Gordian knot , that of reducing mortgage borrowers ’ liability en masse ( deep principal mods , as we would call them here , on mortgages held by foreign banks ) :
The Latvian government was struggling to avert a financial meltdown today as ministers convened emergency talks with Scandinavian banks to discuss a bold and controversial plan to slash mortgage - holders ’ liabilities to lenders .
The scheme could mean billions in losses for the big Swedish banks most exposed by the small Baltic state ’s financial and economic crisis .
Valdis Dombrovskis , the embattled Latvian prime minister , said he was confident he could get his proposal through the parliament in Riga , but was still examining the legal implications of the scheme .
But the powerful Latvian central bank delivered an unusually blunt attack on the prime minister , saying that his budget and bank policies were feeding a fresh “ wave of distrust ” towards the small and highly vulnerable state .
Banking sources in Riga warned that the radical proposal on mortgages , which could see borrowers repaying only a fraction of their loan , would backfire , deterring foreign investment , bringing already low bank lending to a complete standstill and wrecking international confidence in Latvia .
Dombrovskis said the foreign banks , which hold controlling stakes over 90 % of the Latvian banking sector , shared the blame for the crisis and would also have to share the costs .
“ Some balance has to be found between the interests of borrowers and the interests of lenders , ” the prime minister told the Guardian .
“ The real incomes of people are diminishing and it is getting more difficult to repay loans . ”
Dombrovskis ’s surprise proposal came amid growing international concern about Latvia after he revealed plans to cut public spending next year by only half the level agreed with international creditors earlier this year as part of a € 7.5 bn ( £ 6.9 bn ) rescue package put together by the EU , the IMF and the Nordic countries .
Sweden , currently chairing the EU , reacted by threatening to withhold more than € 1bn in credit scheduled for next year .
The FT also weighted in :
The finance ministry denied there had been any weakening in commitment to Latvia ’s currency peg with the euro amid a renewed round of speculation that the country would be forced to devalue the lat .
Riga announced tentative plans on Tuesday to cap the amount that banks would be allowed to collect from mortgage holders in a move that analysts said would make it easier for Latvia to devalue .
This has revived concern among international investors about the heavy exposure of Nordic banks to the Baltic region and the risk of contagion if devaluation in Latvia forced other eastern European countries with fixed exchange rates to follow suit .
The Latvian proposals would allow banks to collect only the current value of a property rather than the original value of the mortgage , insulating homeowners from the 70 per cent drop in property prices since their peak .
The move would remove one of the biggest obstacles to devaluation by ensuring that holders of euro - denominated loans , which account for about 80 per cent of mortgages in Latvia , would not face a sharp increase in debts if the peg with the euro was broken .
When a country starts denying that it is going to devalue , it is almost inevitable that it winds up doing just that .
On the surface , the Latvian crisis appears far too small to trigger another round of upheaval .
But it could serve to reveal how weak European banks really are .
They entered the crisis with lower equity levels than their US peers , and the biggest have just as sizable derivatives exposures .
When you add to that the fact that they have realized even fewer of their losses than the US banks , a seemingly minor eruption like Latvia could serve to reveal that the banking emperors across the pond are wearing no clothes .
While the odds of Latvia precipitating a larger set of problems are low , they are not zero .
While I am really happy that perl moves forward , things get fixed or deprecated and later removed but I know several companies that are still using 5.6.x and even older versions of perl .
The gap is widening for many companies and I am not sure what to think about it .
Recently I asked on the mailing list of Israel .
pm :
Why are you ( or your company ) still using an older version of Perl ? and I got a couple of good answers .
Then , today I saw a post on the perl5porters list by H.Merijn Brand that was related to this .
Let 's look at these companies .
The systems as they are now are working , none of the features in newer versions of perl seem to be very important to those companies .
( Actually I think even that might not be true , just companies learned to live with some of the shortcomings of old versions of perl )
Upgrading perl only seems to involve cost : Someone might need to fix the code if it was using deprecated or changed features .
Someone needs to verify that everything works well and if the code was written 5 - 10 years ago then the number of automated tests will be very low .
Someone will have to install the newer perl on every machine and upgrade the applications .
There is also a risk - no matter how much you verified the code - that something will stop working which can cause downtime , lost revenue or penalties .
So there does not seem to be a compelling reason to make that investment .
On the other hand ...
It will be cheaper to develop for newer versions of perl More and more modules on CPAN require 5.8.x and even 5.10 .x .
In some cases you can find an old version of the module that can work on older perl but it is getting more and more difficult .
In addition there are new modules that from the beginning required a relatively recent version of perl .
( e.g. both Devel : : NYTProf and Moose require 5.8.1 )
That means the company wo n't be able to leverage the extra work that went into the CPAN modules so it wo n't be able to enjoy the saving opportunities in development cost .
In short , developing on newer versions of perl would cost less money than developing on older versions of perl .
The same is true with core perl .
The new features ( e.g. say , given , named capture , smart - match ) help reducing development cost for future code .
Staying with older perl will cost extra money in future development .
Easier to find good developers for modern Perl
There is another reason I can think of .
Companies complain that it is hard to find good perl developers .
I am quite sure that it is much harder to convince a good perl developer to work in a shop that sticks with an old version of perl than in a shop that uses modern perl .
So staying with old perl will cost in recruiting and retaining Perl developers .
We can go back in time and ask again :
Is it really hard to find good Perl programmers ?
It costs more to get any support for older versions of Perl and older CPAN modules Older versions of perl are not supported .
Just as with any other technology if you stay with an old version you are on your own .
You wo n't find open source developers to help you free of charge and even finding commercial support will be increasingly hard and thus increasingly expensive .
So there is a risk factor in staying with old versions of perl .
Other reasons ?
Are there other reasons to upgrade perl ?
About a year ago I started to use the Kohana framework to build websites where PHP was the preferred language .
I ’ve used many PHP frameworks in the past , from Fusebox , CakePHP and my own home brewed framework that I called Fraction .
For me Kohana has proved to be far superior to all of those .
Kohana is a PHP 5 framework that uses the Model View Controller architectural pattern .
It aims to be secure , lightweight , and easy to use .
Although Kohana was originally forked from Code Igniter it has been rewritten from the ground up since for — amongst other things — strict PHP5 compatibility .
Despite being a solid framework that provides great performance , with an awesome community Kohana ’s popularity still lags behind the other PHP frameworks .
So I thought I ’d put together a little showcase of sites built with Kohana to show what can be done with this excellent framework .

I say this as someone who is most certainly not a Goldman conspiracy theorist .
I do not believe that Goldman is a “ vampire squid ” that has been at the root of every financial crisis since the Depression , as Rolling Stone magazine claimed a few months ago .
I do n’t believe that Henry Paulson Jr. , then the Treasury secretary , saved the American International Group because he was really trying to save Goldman Sachs  even if he was Goldman ’s former chief executive .
( I think he did it to prevent the financial system from collapsing completely . )
I do n’t even believe that there was anything wrong with all the phone conversations Mr. Paulson had with Mr. Blankfein in the fall of 2008 .
It was a crisis , for crying out loud .
During times of trouble , it makes perfect sense that you would talk to people with whom you ’d shared a foxhole during past crises .
And I also think it is important to give the company its due : it is really good at what it does .
“ They went through the crisis like everyone else , ” said Brad Hintz , the analyst who follows the firm for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company .
“ But they recovered faster and they did n’t make mistakes . ”
Mr. Hintz added that after Lehman went bankrupt , some 20 percent of the fixed - income market share was up for grabs .
“ Goldman was able to take advantage of that , ” he said .
“ They were able to get their trades done . ”

Ah , yes , but why were they able to get their trades done ?
One reason is that Goldman had far more capital at its disposal than any other firm .
In a market like this one  with interest rates so low they are practically negligible ( which is itself a government policy that greatly aids Goldman Sachs ) , and with competitors either hobbled or out of business , capital is basically the only thing you need to make money hand over fist .
That $ 10 billion of TARP money meant that Goldman Sachs could free up an additional $ 10 billion to put to work making money  instead of having to use it to shore up its capital .
Indeed , when the firm paid back the TARP money last summer , it went out and raised new capital so that it would n’t have to reduce the amount it could deploy to make money .
In addition , early in the crisis , at a time when lending had essentially frozen , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation set up an emergency program to guarantee commercial paper loans .
Like every other firm , Goldman took advantage of that program , borrowing $ 28 billion ( it has since reduced that amount to $ 21 billion ) .
Although that program is about to be eliminated , I saw an analysis in The Wall Street Journal recently showing that Goldman was likely to save around $ 754 million over the life of the guarantee program .
Then there was the fact that during their moment of maximum vulnerability , the government let Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs become bank holding companies  something it had earlier refused to allow Lehman Brothers to do .
In practical terms , it was n’t all that big a deal ; it primarily meant the two firms were going to be regulated by the Federal Reserve rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission .
1987 Ford RancheroStar - Click above for high - res image gallery
The last time that we spotted today 's eBay find of the day , it was cruising along Woodward Ave in Birmingham , MI this past summer .
The RancheroStar immediately caught our attention , but evidently the For Sale sign in the window did n't catch enough eyeballs from onlookers .
Thus we now find it again .
According to its eBay listing , the creator of this minivan - trucklet died before completing the project , although he apparently had some pretty serious plans for it going forward .
The truncated 1987 Ford Aerostar currently has its stock front V6 , rear - wheel drive ( not front - wheel drive as in the listing ) configuration , but the deceased creator had plans to eventually replace it with a mid-mounted 460 cubic - inch V8 .
Apparently , the bodywork as it stands today is all metal , with no fiberglass or dreaded Bondo .
From what we saw briefly at Woodward , the vehicle seems to be well executed for as far as it got .
If you are interested in an oddball project to complete , this one might be worth checking out .
At this point , there are n't any bids , so you might get a good deal .
If you do pick it up and complete it or at least paint it , let us know and it could get an Autoblog follow - up .

Big city papers had lost as much as a quarter of their circulation in the last six months , and CNN finished dead last in prime - time against more partisan rivals like Fox and MSNBC .

News gets worse for the MSM
There have been a lot of bad days recently for what ’s come to be known as the mainstream media — or MSM — but Monday was one of the worst .
New circulation figures showed that big city papers had lost as much as a quarter of their circulation in the past six months .
And new TV ratings showed that CNN , the cable network that prides itself on news coverage down the middle , finished dead last in prime time against more partisan rivals like Fox News and MSNBC .

Are the two connected ?
Eric Alterman , a media columnist for The Nation , and a frequent critic of the MSM , thinks they are .
" Nonpartisan news , and news aimed at a broad audience , does n't have the cachet , and therefore the consumer base , it once had , ” Alterman said .
“ The whole notion of citizenship has been declining for decades now . ”
With the proliferation of media across platforms these days , there ’s less shared knowledge among people , who are increasingly heading to niche outlets for information .
At the same time , there ’s a large appetite for the new media world where the MSM gatekeepers no longer hold as much clout , and “ he said , she said ” journalism gives way to strong point of view .
Just last night , NYU hosted a debate among prominent journalists on the subject : “ Good Riddance to Mainstream Media . ” .
And in today ’s cable news universe , Alterman said , “ politics without a slant , without a point of view , is interesting to very few people . ”
That ’s probably one thing that the Nation writer and Fox News ’s Bill O’Reilly agree on .
O’Reilly , host of the top- rated cable news show , told an audience last week that networks need to give viewers “ a product that is entertaining and informative . ”
As for his 8 p.m. rival on CNN , O’Reilly said : “ Nobody watches Campbell Brown .
You have to evolve if you want to survive in the commercial world .
If you are going to do a straight newscast in prime time , you are going to lose . ”
Brown is losing not only to O’Reilly and a partisan on the left , MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , but also to Nancy Grace , who hosts a more tabloidy show at the same time on sister network HLN .
CNN President Jon Klein says he knows why those approaches work , and he ’s not going to go there .
“ It ’s the oldest trick in the book to trot out over - the - top hosts and put them on a cable - news show , ” Klein told POLITICO in May .
There ’s no doubt that the over - the - top , and politically partisan , hosts are having more success attracting viewers on nights when there ’s no major news event .
Acknowledging the low ratings , Klein told staffers on Tuesday , according to TVNewser , that CNN “ refuse [s ] to do the things that might get us a quick number or cater to the extremes that would alienate our core viewers . ”
But if CNN ’s president accepts that political agendas — or the lack thereof — play a role in the prime - time ratings , does that hold true for newspaper circulation as well ?
“ I do n’t think newspaper circulation has dropped because of any ideological thing , ” said Alex S. Jones , director of Harvard ’s Shorenstein Center on Press , Politics and Public Policy .
“ Mostly , it ’s a matter of the economics of the situation — free versus expensive . ”
While Jones said he ’s impressed by how many people still buy newspapers that are available online , it ’s hard for top newspaper executives to hide their concern these days .
During a benefit event on Monday night , New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. offered up an ominous , yet telling , analogy for the newspaper business : the Titanic .
Sulzberger told New York magazine that the “ industry is in the midst of massive transition , ” a fact clearly on display that morning when newly released circulation numbers showed a 10.6 percent drop across over 300 newspapers .
The Times , which announced last week that 100 newsroom jobs needed to be cut by the end of the year , lost 7.3 percent of its print circulation in the past six months .
And the Times was hardly alone .
Besides The Wall Street Journal — which caters more to a niche business readership — all of the top U.S. daily newspapers witnessed drops in circulation ranging from the single digits to upward of 25 percent .
The Washington Post , whose website has fewer unique monthly visitors than the Huffington Post — a site that offers news and aggregation with a liberal slant — fell 6.4 percent in print circulation .
The long - running tabloid war between the New York Daily News and the New York Post is a thing of the past , as both papers continue falling — 14 percent and 18.7 percent , respectively .
USA Today , previously the highest - circulation national newspaper , saw its readership plummet 17 percent .
Attempts by newspaper executives to cast the numbers in a positive light had a slightly desperate feel to them .
A headline in The San Francisco Chronicle , which dropped more than 25 percent , read : “ Chronicle ’s strategy shift starts to pay off . ”
Chronicle Publisher Frank Vega was quoted as saying that a new business model for the paper , in which it moves away from relying on advertising revenue , was beginning to emerge and that the Chronicle ’s online audience continued to grow .
Similarly , CNN reacted to Monday ’s numbers by emphasizing that the recently relaunched CNN.com leads other cable news websites .
It also said in a statement that the network “ measure[s ] our audience across all CNN worldwide platforms and throughout the day , not just prime time . ”
While it ’s clear that CNN is trying to downplay the significance of winning in prime - time — after talking up the importance of the three - hour block last year — it ’s true that nightly viewers are just one part of the day ’s audience .
And it ’s also a relatively small audience by comparison with the numbers reached by broadcast network programming .
“ The O’Reilly Factor ” averaged nearly 3.4 million viewers in October — the highest among cable news shows — and another 1.5 million for the repeat at 11 p.m , a few million less than top broadcast anchor Brian Williams averages on the “ NBC Nightly News . ”
While the evening newscasts do n’t have the same power as decades past , about 20 million viewers still tune in each night across the Big Three .
By comparison , under 6 million people typically watch the four cable networks at the prime hour of 8 p.m .
A few million viewers , Alterman pointed out , are “ a complete failure in terms of what historically has been a successful television show . ”
However , cable new shows “ only need very small numbers to make these shows work . ”
But while some of CNN ’s prime - time shows may only be pulling in six - figure audiences , the network ’s success online shows that there ’s still an appetite for general - interest news , perhaps at the expense of readers actually buying newspapers for sports , weather and the latest word out of the White House .
Last month , CNN ’s digital network brought in over 38 million unique visitors , second only to Yahoo !
News .
Similarly , newspaper executives point out that their product , still generated in the newsroom , has more readers than ever .
The problem is that millions of those readers are n’t paying .
It ’s why issue No. 1 on the minds of publishers and top editors is how and when to charge for the news .
Mark Jurkowitz , associate director for Pew’s Project for Excellence in Journalism , agreed that newspaper executives have a point about the general news product being strong , despite declines in advertising and circulation .
“ I do n’t think the newspaper circulation numbers are reflective of people not wanting objective news , ” Jurkowitz said , pointing out that papers like the Boston Globe still have plenty of readers online .
While the Globe ’s circulation dropped 18.5 percent over the past six months to 264,000 — half what it was two decades ago — Boston.com brought in over 5.2 million unique visitors last month .
A similar argument can be made for the Times — which had 21.5 million unique monthly visitors in September — and CNN , both established news brands that continue to grow in online readership .
“ The problem is n’t an audience problem , ” Jurkowitz said .
“ It ’s fundamentally that nobody ’s been able to make money on the online side . ”

Case - Shiller CPI is formulated by substituting the Case - Shiller housing index for Owner 's Equivalent Rent in the CPI .
For a complete description of the reasons and methodology , please see What 's the Real CPI ?
The chart and commentary below is courtesy of my friend " TC " who writes :
CS - CPI continues to fall albeit at a less rapid pace and measures - 5.1 % YOY .
Meanwhile the government ’s CPI - U also continues to fall at a slower pace and measures - 1.5 % YOY .
The divergence is to due to the government ’s housing metric of Owners ’ Equivalent Rent ( OER ) continuing to show price increases ( + 1.7 % YOY ) vs. Case - Shiller data showing price decreases ( - 13.3 % YOY ) .
click on chart for sharper image
Since the Case Shiller housing market peak in June 2006 , OER is up +7.7 % , while the Case - Shiller index is down - 30.9 % - an amazing 3860 basis point divergence !
CS - CPI YOY has now fallen for 11 consecutive months and 14 of the past 18 .
Meanwhile the government 's CPI - U YOY has fallen for 6 consecutive months .
Prime One Twelve is one of the finest restaurants on South Beach .
Gleaming wooden plank floors , exposed brick columns , and creamy white leather - upholstered chairs set the stage for a menu listing three items that , to devotees of fine food , might seem inexpensive : $ 25 " Kobe beef sliders , " a $ 25 " Kobe beef hot dog , " and for those with an appetite , a $ 30 " one - pound Kobe hamburger . "
The problem is that the meat is n't what 's advertised .
It 's not the product of cattle raised in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan that in some cases drink beer and receive sake massages .
Moreover , its listing on the menu is an apparent violation of federal standards and state law .
" We were not aware of the requirement for the specific labeling , " owner Myles Chefetz says when told of the problem .
" Given this info , we will state this on the menu immediately . "
Info Kobe beef
Dozens of Miami restaurants include the same type of misleading information on their menus .
And scores of customers every day pay top dollar thinking they are ingesting the world 's most precious meat .
The list of offending eateries includes upscale and casual , local and national chains , and in Miami Beach and Brickell .
There 's 8 oz .
Burger Bar , Bancroft Supper Club , China Grill , Gordon Biersch , Plat Bleu at the Delano , Meat Market , and Prime One Twelve .
Contacted by New Times , representatives of each of these places admitted to serving high - quality American or Australian beef from similar cattle even when the item was listed as Kobe beef on the menu .
Indeed , the issue repeats in cities across the nation .
Though the federal government has known of the trend for almost a decade , not much has been done .
" It 's basically become a free - for - all , " says Charles Gaskins , spokesman for the American Wagyu Association , a Washington state - based industry group with more than 250 members .
" We 're aware of the [ federal ] guidelines , but people do what they want ...
Some of them use the term Kobe in their farm names . "
Kobe refers to beef from the black Tajima breed of Wagyu cattle , which are raised in Japan under strict ministry of agriculture oversight .
Wagyu , which literally means " Japanese cattle , " were imported to the island nation in the Second Century to cultivate rice .
They have a genetic predisposition toward heavy fat marbling in the muscle .
Prime cuts such as filet , rib eye , and strip loin are distributed the world over , prized for their rich flavor and tender , velvety texture .
Of course , this beef is expensive , selling for $ 16 to $ 30 per ounce depending on the cut , according to Anshu Pathak , owner of Kobe Beef Incorporated , a leading online purveyor .
So in 1976 and later from 1993 to 1994 , some American farmers tried to come up with a cheaper product .
They imported a few dozen Wagyu cattle and then cross - bred them with domestic Angus .
The offspring looks similar to the pure - bred Japanese , but the meat is darker , with less marbling and a bolder flavor and texture .
American Wagyu costs four to ten dollars per ounce , depending on the cut .
( Australians produce something similar . )
This beef began to gain popularity between 2001 and 2004 , when Japanese meat imports into the United States were temporarily banned during the mad cow scare .
Now it 's relatively widespread .
At the Bancroft Supper Club in Miami Beach , manager Karen Martin blames the restaurant 's distributor for the menu items labeled " Kobe beef mini burgers " ( $ 18 ) and " Kobe beef carpaccio " ( $ 18 ) , which she admits are Australian Wagyu .
" The invoices say Kobe , " she explains .
" That 's why we list it like that . "
She will work with chef Tim Andriola to make the description change .
Chef / owner Sean Brasel of high - end Lincoln Road steak house Meat Market lists a genuine Kobe item in a menu section called " Reserve Cuts . "
The " six - ounce Japanese A5 Kobe tenderloin " goes for $ 95 .
Then there 's the meat labeled " Kobe skirt steak " ( $ 31 ) and " white truffle Kobe tartare " ( $ 21 ) , which come from Snake River Farms in Idaho , not Japan .
Brasel explains that listing the real provenance of the skirt steak would be " redundant . "
" Customers know [ those items ] are not Japanese Kobe because of the price .
In the other section with more expensive cuts , I specify . "
Not all chefs understand they are misrepresenting products .
Executive chef Maria Manso at the Delano in Miami Beach says her Plat Bleu menu offers " Kobe beef sliders " for $ 28 and then reveals they are American Wagyu .
" The menu labeling comes from corporate , " she explains .
" We leave it up to the servers , who are well - trained to explain where it comes from if a customer has an issue or a question .
There 's no reason to change it . "
Phone calls to owner / operator China Grill Management were not returned .
It 's perhaps more understandable that casual - dining establishments would mislabel their victuals .
Take Chattanooga , Tennessee - based Gordon Biersch , which has locations in 17 states and Taiwan .
The " Kobe sliders " ( $ 10.95 ) , popular at its Brickell Avenue outpost , are American Wagyu .
To meet demand , corporate executive chef Bill Heckler also recently introduced a $ 13.95 " German Kobe burger , " using the same beef , on his Oktoberfest menu .
Heckler will update the Gordon Biersch menu nationwide in January to accurately denote the provenance of the meat .
He emphasizes the company trains servers to answer customers ' questions about the product .
He believes the majority of diners do n't know the difference .
" To my knowledge , use of the word Kobe was an acceptable marketing term , " Heckler explains .
" I recently had a situation with my rep where I specifically ordered Kobe beef from Japan and got American Wagyu instead .
I was n't happy . "
Hefty salaries for some of Ontario's highest paid civil servants – including the deputy health minister , who earned nearly $ 500,000 last year in salary and taxable benefits – are being channelled through hospitals to skirt government pay guidelines , the Star has learned .
As Premier Dalton McGuinty 's administration clamps down on untendered contracts and consultants ' meal expenses in the wake of the eHealth Ontario spending scandal , salaries for top bureaucrats are being buried in hospital budgets .
The premier 's hand - picked climate change adviser , Hugh MacLeod , was paid $ 320,695.60 last year by University Health Network , according to the government 's public sector salary disclosure documents .
Deputy health minister Ron Sapsford earns a salary of $ 433,611.55 plus $ 64,781.35 in taxable benefits through the Hamilton Health Sciences Centre .
Gail Paech , an associate deputy minister of economic development and trade and a former senior health bureaucrat , was paid $ 291,997.20 by University Health Network last year .
The salaries are well above the maximum $ 220,150 recommended for deputy ministers and the range of $ 146,700 to $ 188,950 for associate and assistant deputies .
By comparison , Premier Dalton McGuinty earned $ 207,427 and Health Minister David Caplan made $ 164,623 last year .
The practice is used as a means to attract top talent to the bureaucracy , said Kevin Finnerty , a spokesperson for the health ministry .
" We need to pay them comparable salaries .
...
This is a longstanding practice back to 1994 , " he said .
MacLeod is listed in salary documents as a deputy director of special projects at UHN .
Asked Monday if he ever worked at the hospital network , which includes Toronto General , MacLeod replied , " No . "
He was previously an assistant deputy minister in the health ministry and has reported directly to the premier as associate deputy minister responsible for the climate - change secretariat since March 2008 .
MacLeod confirmed in a telephone interview that his paycheque comes from the hospital network .
" It was part of the contract I entered into when I came here from B.C ... in 2003 , " he said , adding he is unaware of the reason for the arrangement .
" I do n't know . "
At UHN , vice - president of public affairs and communications Gillian Howard confirmed MacLeod and Paech are both being paid through the hospital .
" We 're asked to put them on our payroll , so we do , " she said .
" The answer to why , you 're going to have to talk to the ( health ) ministry . "
UHN and other hospitals are fully compensated for the salaries paid through them to non-staffers like MacLeod , health ministry spokesman Finnerty said .
" The individual is on secondment from whatever organization ( pays the salary ) .
The organization pays that individual salary and the ministry reimburses that salary at the end of the year , " he said .
" The UHN has agreed to be a sponsoring organization for this arrangement and did so at the request of the ministry . "
He said the reason for shifting the money around is simple .

" At Ontario public service salary scales we could not attract these people to work in the Ontario government , " he said .
The practice is transparent , Finnerty said , because all Ontario civil service and Crown agency employees who make more than $ 100,000 have their salaries disclosed online each year .
But anyone looking for Sapsford 's salary , for example , would have to look for his name under the hospital section of the disclosure documents , because he is not listed under the Ministry of Health and Long - Term Care .
Salary ranges for deputy ministers and assistant and associate deputy ministers in the Ontario Public Service are established by the Ministry of Government Services as guidelines rather than hard - and - fast rules .
Executives at government boards , agencies and commissions , such as eHealth , where former CEO Sarah Kramer was hired at an annual salary of $ 380,000 , and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. , where former CEO Kelly McDougald earned $ 411,437 in salary and benefits last year , are not subject to the guidelines .
Deputy health minister Sapsford , who was paid nearly $ 500,000 in salary and benefits by the Hamilton Health Sciences Centre last year , is a former chief operating officer of the group of six Hamilton hospitals and a cancer treatment centre .
But that posting was " five years ago , maybe , " said Hamilton Health Sciences Centre spokesperson Jeff Vallentin .
He declined to answer any questions about the deal and referred queries to health ministry officials in Toronto , where Sapsford , who declined comment , is the boss .
Finnerty insisted it is not a conflict of interest for Sapsford to be in charge of a health ministry that makes decisions affecting the hospital that pays his wage .
" Every civil servant , whether on secondment or not , has an oath of allegiance to the Crown and is bound by that , " he said .
One former government official , who asked for anonymity , said pay arrangements like Sapsford 's and others are put through hospitals because they have " enhanced pensions " for senior executives .
Sapsford 's pay packet is higher than that of his boss , cabinet secretary Shelly Jamieson , who earned $ 327,953 in salary and $ 10,079 in taxable benefits .
She is the province 's most powerful public servant in charge of 65,000 employees .

Der “ Tommy darf alles ” - Modus , in dem sich Moderator Thomas Gottschalk angesichts der Bedeutung seiner Sendung für das Selbstwertgefühl des ZDFs seit Jahren befindet , nimmt immer absurdere Formen an .
Der jüngste Beleg ist dieses Video :
( Hier oder auf Bild klicken )
Gottschalk hält ein ZDF - Mikro in der Hand , während das Filmchen zugleich mit einer Bild.de - Sendersignatur versehen ist .
Gottschalk nennt prominent den Namen des Werbepartners Audi – Bild.de hat dem Video noch eine Nissan - Werbung vorgeschaltet .
Ein deutlicheres Sittenbild der Verstrickung von öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehen mit dem boulevardmedial - kommerziellen Komplex kann es eigentlich nicht geben .
Stern.de-Medienkolumnist Bernd Gäbler schreibt zum ZDF - Bild.de-Mix :
Dazu gibt es ein Video , das durch das Logo “ bild.de ” oben rechts als hauseigen ausgewiesen ist , obwohl das neue TV - Traumpaar die Gegeneinander - Wetterei umständlich in ein ZDF - Mikrofon hinein erklärt .
Dreht das gebührenfinanzierte ZDF jetzt schon nebenbei die Videos für “ bild.de ” ?
Gäbler , der auch einmal das Grimme - Institut leitete , ist fassungslos , wie schamlos das ZDF “ zwar von unser aller Geld lebt , aber “ Bild ” exklusiv bedient . ”
Die ZDF - Bild - Kooperation habe nichts mehr mit den guten öffentlich - rechtlichen Sitten zu tun und sei sogar möglicherweise eine illegale Quersubventionierung :
Einseitig “ durchgesteckte ” Infos , ZDF - Videos auf “ bild.de ” , Exklusiv - Interviews und die Kooperation bei der Suche nach Wettkandidaten – das alles hat mit Journalismus natürlich nichts zu tun .
Jeder , der noch halbwegs auf korrekte Begriffe achtet , wird das PR nennen .
Ist dieser offenkundige Verrat an der Ursprungsidee öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehens nun einfach nur übliche Kungelei oder mehr ?
Erfüllt diese exklusive ZDF - “ Bild ” - Kooperation den Tatbestand illegaler Quersubventionierung ?
Dabei müssen diese Verletzungen wohl als Fortsetzung des Dauerwerbecharakters der Sendung auf anderen Kanälen betrachtet werden .
Meedia schreibt in seiner Nachbesprechung zur “ Wetten , dass …? ” - Sendung vom Samstag :
Und auch geworben wurde wieder , bis der Arzt kommt .
Egal ob Wickie - Film , der neue Vroni- Ferres - Streifen , der ZDF - “ Seewolf ” , die neuen Alben von Tokio Hotel , Whitney Houston und Nelly Furtado , eine Dinosaurier - Show ( mit durchaus beeindruckenden Dino - Puppen ) , Kulmbacher Bier , Teldafax , SWR3 oder Audi .
Die Marken - und Produktparade nahm kein Ende .
Für das ZDF und Gottschalk mag sich die Kooperationitis dabei auf den ersten Blick ausgezahlt haben : Die Sendung hatte mit einem Marktanteil von 37 Prozent die besten Quoten seit März 2008 – auch Dank vorbereitender Berichterstattung in der Bild .
Gottschalk profitiert zugleich von der wohlwollenden Berichterstattung als Goldbären - Werbeträger .
Als Bild- verwöhnter Promi darf Gottschalk dann im Gegenzug auch mal für Bild werben .
Doch am Ende leidet die Glaubwürdigkeit des ZDFs .
Es entfällt jede Legitimation , für ein derartiges Spektakel Gebührenmillionen zu verschleudern ( Wie viele eigentlich ?
Und was verdient Gottschalk dabei ? ) .
Für Bernd Gäbler hat das Kooperations - Gebaren von “ Wetten , dass …? ” ein Ausmaß angenommen , dass er am liebsten einen “ großen Fragekatalog ” an den ZDF - Fernsehrat schicken würde .
Tatsächlich wäre der Fall “ Wetten , dass …? ” schon lange reif für eine unabhängige Untersuchung durch einen Rechnungshof oder das Grimme - Institut .
Aber warum in Kolumnen über Fragen fabulieren – man sollte und kann sie ganz konkret an den ZDF - Fernsehrat richten .
Man kann dem Vorsitzenden Rubrecht Polenz ja mal Screenshots von der Bild - ZDF - Kooperation schicken oder ähnliche Fragen zu “ Wetten , dass …? ” stellen oder ihn auch mal anrufen .
Wir als Carta werden das am Montag machen – und sind auf die Antworten schon einmal sehr gespannt .
On September 11 , 2001 , a fellow New Yorker and friend of mine , a public health historian who knew instantly what the dangers were , bicycled directly into the smoke , ash , and chemicals that hung over lower Manhattan searching for his daughter whose school was only blocks away from the collapsed buildings .
She was , it turned out , " safe " in that same pall of dangerous smoke .
She had been evacuated to the street with her class in time to see people leaping or falling to their deaths from the upper floors of one of the crippled towers .
You probably could n't live in New York City that day and not be connected , however indirectly , to someone who died .
In my case , it was the father of a classmate of my son's , a photographer , who also advanced into the chaos near one of the towers , leaving behind an eerie , moving trail of photographs .
As for myself , I was on my bedroom floor that morning most undramatically exercising when my wife called to tell me that something was happening .
By then , TV cameras were already focused on the first punctured tower and , remembering tales of the B - 25 that had hit the Empire State Building in 1945 , I assumed I was watching a horrifying accident .
Another friend , a rare North American who remembered the first 9/11 -- that day in 1973 when Salvador Allende , the Chilean president , was overthrown and murdered in a U.S. - backed military coup -- thought it might be Chilean payback .
Any half - plausible idea was , for a while , possible .
History had n't set .
The Bush administration , in disarray , had n't yet hijacked the day or the country .
September 11th , still being lived , had n't been renamed " Patriot Day . "
There was , as yet , no Department of Homeland Security , no Patriot Act .
No one had been rounded up .
No wars had been launched .
As for New Yorkers , those of us not making our way out of -- or into -- the danger zone were on the phone checking on loved ones , listening to rumors , or outside in the streets , talking to each other , wondering while the sirens wailed .
It was a memorably terrible moment , but not , in fact , a nightmare of fear ; nor would New York ever , as far as I could tell , find itself in the grip of blind revenge as , it seemed , so much of the country would soon be .
Not so long after 9/11 , for instance , two New Yorkers I know -- one had been close indeed to the collapsing towers -- headed for Afghanistan , not armed to kill but to help .
I remember my own now - embarrassing first reaction to 9/11 ( once I grasped what was actually happening ) .
It was unexpectedly dense and unprophetic , given the American reaction to come .
I thought , then , that perhaps the horror of those acts of destruction and mass murder in my own city would open Americans to the sort of pain so many others in the world had felt -- sometimes , in fact , at our own hands .
It might , I thought , change our politics .
It did , of course , do that , but in no way I imagined .
And that was the strange , unexplained thing for me : it seemed as if living at " ground zero " during the assaults of 9/11 somehow made you the worst predictor of what our nation would feel and do .
For me , even today , an especially unnerving aspect of 9/11 was the way so many Americans donned " I [ heart ] New York " T - shirts and hats -- New York having , until then , been Sodom to Los Angeles 's Gomorrah for much of the country -- and under the Bush administration 's fear - filled ministrations , began beating the drums of war , while panicking over prospective terrorists launching improbable attacks on their local amusement parks and landmarks .
It seemed craven to me then and still does today .
Eight disastrous years later , I suddenly understand that day so much better , thanks to Rebecca Solnit , whom 9/11 indirectly sent my way offering hope in dark times .
Now , she 's returned with her latest book , A Paradise Built in Hell , which capsizes our most basic sense of what disaster is all about , humanly speaking .
As befits an author who has written a guidebook to getting lost , she is bold beyond belief and her originality matches that boldness .
And here 's the thing : if you take a journey into disaster with her ( 9/11 being but one of the many disasters she explores in the book ) , you wo n't get lost .
You 'll find yourself .
You 'll find ourselves , our better selves , even in catastrophe .
Think of Paradise as the perfect companion volume to Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine .
Klein explained how governments try to take advantage of disasters to optimize their power and wealth ( and that of their cronies ) ;
Solnit explains what ordinary people in disasters regularly do for themselves .
They do n't , as we have been taught , run screaming from danger .
They head for the smoke , pedaling hard , and then , without the help of governments , they begin to organize .
They become , briefly , their better selves .
So here 's a thought : Maybe it was the lack of the actual experience of 9/11 that left the rest of America so vulnerable when the Bush administration led them toward their lesser selves .

Eight years ago , 2,600 people lost their lives in Manhattan , and then several million people lost their story .
The al - Qaeda attack on the Twin Towers did not defeat New Yorkers .
It destroyed the buildings , contaminated the region , killed thousands , and disrupted the global economy , but it most assuredly did not conquer the citizenry .
They were only defeated when their resilience was stolen from them by clichés , by the invisibility of what they accomplished that extraordinary morning , and by the very word " terrorism , " which suggests that they , or we , were all terrified .
The distortion , even obliteration , of what actually happened was a necessary precursor to launching the obscene response that culminated in a war on Iraq , a war we lost ( even if some of us do n't know that yet ) , and the loss of civil liberties and democratic principles that went with it .
Only We Can Terrorize Ourselves
For this eighth anniversary of that terrible day , the first post - Bush - era anniversary , let 's remember what actually happened :
When the planes became missiles and the towers became torches and then shards and clouds of dust , many were afraid , but few if any panicked , other than the President who was far away from danger .
The military failed to respond promptly , even though the Pentagon itself was attacked , and the only direct resistance that day came from inside Flight 93 , which went down in a field in Pennsylvania on its way to Washington .
Flights 11 and 175 struck the towers .
Hundreds of thousands of people rescued each other and themselves , evacuating the buildings and the area , helped in the first minutes , then hours , by those around them .
Both PS 150 , an elementary school , and the High School for Leadership and Public Service were successfully evacuated -- without casualties .
In many cases , teachers took students home with them .
A spontaneously assembled flotilla of boats , ranging from a yacht appropriated by policemen to a historic fireboat , evacuated 300,000 to 500,000 people from lower Manhattan , a nautical feat on the scale of the British evacuation of an army from Dunkirk in the early days of World War II ; the fleet , that is , rescued in a few hours as many people as the British fleet rescued in days ( under German fire admittedly , but then New York 's ferry operators and pleasure - boat captains were steering into that toxic cloud on a day when many thought more violence was to come ) .
Adam Mayblum , who walked down from the 87th floor of the north tower with some of his coworkers , wrote on the Internet immediately afterward :
" They failed in terrorizing us .
We were calm .
If you want to kill us , leave us alone because we will do it by ourselves .
If you want to make us stronger , attack and we unite .
This is the ultimate failure of terrorism against the United States . "
We failed , however , when we let our own government and media do what that small band from the other side of the Earth could not .
Some of us failed , that is , for there were many kinds of response , and some became more radical , more committed , more educated .
Mark Fichtel , the president of the New York Coffee , Sugar , and Cocoa Exchange , who scraped his knees badly that morning of September 11th when he was knocked over in a fleeing crowd , was helped to his feet by " a little old lady . "
He nonetheless had his Exchange up and running the next day , and six months later quit his job , began studying Islam , and then teaching about it .
Tom Engelhardt , the editor of this piece , began to circulate emails to counter the crummy post - 9/11 media coverage and his no -name informal listserv grew into the website Tomdispatch.com , which has circulated more than 1,000 essays since that day and made it possible for me to become a different kind of writer .
Principal Ada Rosario - Dolch , who on the morning of September 11th set aside concern for her sister Wendy Alice Rosario Wakeford ( who died in the towers ) to evacuate her high school two blocks away , went to Afghanistan in 2004 to dedicate a school in Herat , Afghanistan , that included a garden memorializing Wakeford .
In a Dust Storm of Altruism
Hollywood movies and too many government pandemic plans still presume that most of us are cowards or brutes , that we panic , trample each other , rampage , or freeze helplessly in moments of crisis and chaos .
Most of us believe this , even though it is a slander against the species , an obliteration of what actually happens , and a crippling blow to our ability to prepare for disasters .
Hollywood likes this view because it paves the way for movies starring Will Smith and hordes of stampeding , screaming extras .
Without stupid , helpless people to save , heroes become unnecessary .
Or rather , without them , it turns out that we are all heroes , even if distinctly unstereotypical ones like that elderly woman who got Fichtel back on his feet .
Governments like the grim view for a similar reason : it justifies their existence as repressive , controlling , hostile forces , rather than collaborators with brave and powerful citizenries .
Far more people could have died on September 11th if New Yorkers had not remained calm , had not helped each other out of the endangered buildings and the devastated area , had not reached out to pull people from the collapsing buildings and the dust cloud .
The population of the towers was lower than usual that morning , because it was an election day and many were voting before heading to work ; it seems emblematic that so many were spared because they were exercising their democratic powers .
Others exercised their empathy and altruism .
In the evacuation of the towers , John Abruzzo , a paraplegic accountant , was carried down 69 flights of stairs by his coworkers .
Here 's how John Guilfoy , a young man who'd been a college athlete , recalled the 9/11 moment :
" I remember looking back as I started running , and the thickest smoke was right where it was , you know , a few blocks away , and thinking that , like , whoever 's going to be in that is just going to die .
There 's no way you could -- you 're going to suffocate , and it was coming at us .
I remember just running , people screaming .
I was somewhat calm , and I was little bit faster than my colleagues , so I had to stop and slow up a little bit and wait for them to make sure we did n't lose each other . "
Had he been in a disaster movie , he would have been struggling in some selfish , social - darwinist way to survive at others ' expense , or he would simply have panicked , as we are all supposed to do in disaster .
In the reality of September 11th , in a moment of supreme danger , he slowed down out of solidarity .
Many New Yorkers that day committed similar feats of solidarity at great risk .
In fact , in all the hundreds of oral histories I read and the many interviews I conducted to research my book , A Paradise Built in Hell , I could find no one saying he or she was abandoned or attacked in that great exodus .
People were frightened and moving fast , but not in a panic .
Careful research has led disaster sociologists to the discovery -- one of their many counter - stereotypical conclusions -- that panic is a vanishingly rare phenomenon in disasters , part of an elaborate mythology of our weakness .
A young man from Pakistan , Usman Farman , told of how he fell down and a Hasidic Jewish man stopped , looked at his pendant 's Arabic inscription and then , " with a deep Brooklyn accent he said ' Brother if you do n't mind , there is a cloud of glass coming at us .
Grab my hand , let 's get the hell out of here . '
He was the last person I would ever have thought to help me .
If it were n't for him I probably would have been engulfed in shattered glass and debris . "
A blind newspaper vendor was walked to safety by two women , and a third escorted her to her home in the Bronx .
Errol Anderson , a recruiter with the fire department , was caught outside in that dust storm .
" For a couple of minutes I heard nothing .
I thought I was either dead and was in another world , or I was the only one alive .
I became nervous and panicky , not knowing what to do , because I could n't see ...
About four or five minutes later , while I was still trying to find my way around , I heard the voice of a young lady .
She was crying and saying , ' Please , Lord , do n't let me die .
Do n't let me die . '
I was so happy to hear this lady 's voice .
I said , ' Keep talking , keep talking , I 'm a firefighter , I 'll find you by the response of where you are . '
Eventually we met up with each other and basically we ran into each other 's arms without even knowing it . "
She held onto his belt and eventually several other people joined them to form a human chain .
He helped get them to the Brooklyn Bridge before returning to the site of the collapsed buildings .
That bridge became a pedestrian escape route for tens of thousands .
For hours , a river of people poured across it .
On the far side , Hasidic Jews handed out bottles of water to the refugees .
Hordes of volunteers from the region , and within days the nation , converged on lower Manhattan , offering to weld , dig , nurse , cook , clean , hear confessions , listen -- and did all of those things .
New Yorkers triumphed on that day eight years ago .
They triumphed in calm , in strength , in generosity , in improvisation , in kindness .
Nor was this something specific to that time or place : San Franciscans during the great earthquake of 1906 , Londoners during the Blitz in World War II , the great majority of New Orleanians after Hurricane Katrina hit , in fact most people in most disasters in most places have behaved with just this sort of grace and dignity .
It Could Have Been Different
Imagine what else could have sprung from that morning eight years ago .
Imagine if the collapse of those towers had not been followed by such a blast of stereotypes , lies , distortions , and fear propaganda that served the agenda of the Bush administration while harming the rest of us -- Americans , Iraqis , Afghans , and so many others , for people from 90 nations died in the attacks that day and probably those from many more nations survived at what came to be called Ground Zero .
Not long ago I talked to Roberto Sifuentes , a Chicano performance artist who was then living in New York .
Like many New Yorkers , he still marvels at that brief , almost utopian moment of opening in the midst of tragedy , when everyone wanted to talk about meaning , about foreign policy , about history , and did so in public with strangers .
It was a moment of passionate engagement with the biggest questions and with one another .
On a few occasions , Sifuentes was threatened and nearly attacked for having approximately the same skin tone as an Arab , but he was also moved by the tremendous opening of that moment , the great public dialogue that had begun , and he took part in it with joy .
In five years of investigation and in my own encounter with the San Francisco Bay Area 's Loma Prieta earthquake 20 years ago , I 've found that disasters are often moments of strange joy .
My friend Kate Joyce , then a 19 - year - old living in New Mexico , had landed in New York on the very morning of September 11 , 2001 , and spent the next several days in Union Square , the park - like plaza at 14th Street that became a regular gathering point .
She relished the astonishing forum that Union Square became in those days when we had a more perfect union : " We spoke passionately of the contemporary and historical conflicts , contradictions and connections affecting our lives , " she wrote me later .
" We stayed for hours , through the night , and into the week riveted and expressive , in mourning and humbled , and in the ecstasy of a transformative present . "
Such conversations took place everywhere .
We had that more perfect union , and then we let them steal it .
Perhaps Barack Obama , the candidate who delivered that address on race , pain , and nuance entitled " A More Perfect Union " some 18 months ago , could have catalyzed us to remain open - minded in the face of horror , to rethink our foreign policy , to try to grasp the real nature of the attack by that small band which was so obviously not an act of war , and to make of it an opportunity to change , profoundly .
Such a response would have had to recognize that many were killed or widowed or orphaned on that September 11th , but none were defeated .
Not that day .
It would have had to recognize that such events are immeasurably terrible , but neither so rare as we Americans like to imagine , nor insurmountable .
( Since 9/11 , far more have been killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , the 2005 Pakistan earthquake , the 2008 Burma typhoon , and of course the wars in Afghanistan , Iraq , and the Congo , among other events .
More in this country have , in fact , died of domestic violence since that day . )
Obama , the candidate , might have been capable of that ; of President Obama I 'm not so sure .
He has , after all , expanded the war in Afghanistan that was the first monstrous outcome of that day in New York .
But he 's had his moments , too , and it may be that another set of disasters -- the social disasters of racism , poverty , and government failure laid bare during and after Hurricane Katrina -- helped make it possible for him to become our president .
After the 9/11 storm struck , the affected civilians in New York were seen as victims ; after Katrina , those in New Orleans were portrayed as brutes .
In both cities , the great majority of affected people were actually neither helpless nor savage ; they were something else -- they were citizens , if by that word we mean civic engagement rather than citizenship status .
In both places ordinary people were extraordinarily resourceful , generous , and kind , as were some police officers , firefighters , rescue workers , and a very few politicians .
In both cases , the majority of politicians led us astray .
All I would have wanted in that September moment , though , was politicians who stayed out of the way , and people who were more suspicious of the news and the newsmakers .
The media , too , stepped between us and the event , failing us with their stock of clichés about war and heroes , their ready adoption of the delusional notion of a " war on terror , " their refusal to challenge the administration as it claimed that somehow the Saudi - spawned , fundamentalist al - Qaeda was linked to the secularist Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein and that we should fear mythical Iraqi " weapons of mass destruction . "
Rarely did they mention that we had , in fact , been bombing Iraq without interruption since 1991 .
After 9/11 , it could all have been different , profoundly different .
And if it had , there would have been no children imprisoned without charges or release dates in our gulag in Cuba ; there would have been no unmanned drones slaughtering wedding parties in the rural backlands of Afghanistan or the Iraqi desert ; there would have been no soldiers returning to the U.S. with two or three limbs missing or their heads and minds grievously damaged ( there were already 320,000 traumatic brain injuries to soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan by early 2008 , according to the RAND Corporation ) ; there would not have been a next round of American deaths -- 4,334 in Iraq , 786 in Afghanistan to date ; there would have been no trillion dollars taken from constructive projects to fatten the corporations of war ; no extreme corrosion of the Bill of Rights , no usurpation of powers by the executive branch .
Perhaps .
We Are the Monument
It could all have been different .
It 's too late now , but not too late , never too late , to change how we remember and commemorate this event and that other great landmark of the Bush era , Hurricane Katrina , and so prepare for disasters to come .
For the 99 years before that hurricane hit the Gulf Coast on August 29 , 2005 , the biggest urban disaster in American history was in my city , San Francisco .
Half the city , including more than 28,000 buildings , was destroyed , and about 3,000 people probably died .
The earthquake early on the morning of April 18 , 1906 , did a lot of damage , but the fires did more .
Some were started by collapsed buildings and broken gas mains , others by the army troops who streamed in from the Presidio at the northern tip of the city and ineptly built firebreaks that instead actually spread the fires .
The presiding officer , Brigadier General Frederick Funston , presumed that the public would immediately revert to chaos and that his task was restoring order .
In the first days after the disaster , the truth was more or less the other way around , as the Army and the National Guard prevented citizens from fighting the fires and collecting their property , shot people as looters ( including rescuers and bystanders ) , and generally regarded the public as the enemy ( as did some of the officials presiding over the post - Katrina " rescue " ) .
As with many disasters , a calamity that came from outside was magnified by elite fears and institutional failures within .
Still , on their own , San Franciscans organized themselves remarkably , fought fires when they could , created a plethora of community kitchens , helped reconnect separated families , and began to rebuild .
Every year we still celebrate the anniversary of the earthquake at Lotta 's Fountain , which , like Union Square after 9/11 , became a meeting place for San Franciscans in the largely ruined downtown .
That gathering brings hundreds of people together before dawn to sing the silly song " San Francisco , " get free whistles from the Red Cross , and pay homage to the dwindling group of survivors .
( Two , who 'd been babies in 1906 , arrived this year in the backseat of a magnificent 1931 Lincoln touring car . )
Some of us then go on to the fire hydrant at 20th and Church that saved the Mission District , the hydrant that miraculously had water when most of the water mains were broken and the men who had already been fighting the fire by hand for days were exhausted beyond belief .
The oldest person at the gathering always begins an annual repainting of the hydrant with a can of gold spray paint , and then some kids get to wield the spray can .
San Francisco now uses the anniversary to put out the message that we should be prepared for the next disaster -- not the version the Department of Homeland Security spread in the years after 9/11 with the notion that preparation consists of fear , duct tape , deference , and more fear , but practical stuff about supplies and strategies .
My city even trains anyone who wants to become a certified NERT -- for the nerdy - sounding Neighborhood Emergency Response Team -- member , and about 17,000 of us are badge - carrying , hard - hat owning NERT members ( including me ) .
Every city that has had , or will have , a disaster should have such a carnival of remembrance and preparation .
For one thing , it commemorates all the ways that San Franciscans were not defeated and are not helpless ; for another , it reminds us that , in disaster , we are often at our best , however briefly , that in those hours and days many have their best taste of community , purposefulness , and power .
( Reason enough for many of those who are supposed to be in charge to shudder . )
For the fourth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , New Orleanians were invited to ring bells , lay wreaths , pray , encircle the Superdome , that miserable shelter of last resort for those stranded in the hurricane and flood , and of course listen to music and dance in the streets to second - line parades , but also to keep volunteering and rebuilding .
( Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of that disaster is the vast army of citizen - volunteers who came to the city 's aid , when the government did n't , and are still doing so . )
New York has its pillars of light and readings of names for the anniversary of 9/11 , but it seems to lack any invitation to the citizenry to feel its own power and prepare for the next calamity .
For there will be next times for San Francisco , New York , New Orleans , and possibly -- in this era of extreme and turbulent weather , and economic upheaval -- a great many other cities and towns in this country and elsewhere .
That hydrant on a quiet residential corner of San Francisco is about the only monument to the 1906 earthquake and fire .
The rebuilt city , the eventual rise of disaster preparedness , the people who go on with their everyday lives -- these are the monument San Francisco needed and every city needs to transcend its calamities .
New Yorkers could gather in Union Square and elsewhere to remember what happened , really remember , remember that the heroes were n't necessarily men , or in uniform , but were almost everyone everywhere that day .
They could open their hearts and minds to discuss mourning , joy , death , violence , power , weakness , truth and lies , as they did that week .
They could consider what constitutes safety and security , what else this country could be , and what its foreign and energy policies have to do with these things .
They could walk the streets together to demonstrate that New York is still a great city , whose people were not frightened into going into hiding or flight from public and urban life .
They could more consciously and ceremoniously do what New Yorkers , perhaps best of all Americans , do every day : coexist boldly and openly in a great mixture of colors , nationalities , classes , and opinions , daring to speak to strangers and to live in public .
The dead must be remembered , but the living are the monument , the living who coexist in peace in ordinary times and who save one another in extraordinary times .
Civil society triumphed that morning in full glory .
Look at it : remember that this is who we were and can be .
Twenty years ago this October , Rebecca Solnit was writing about the Kennedy assassination for her first book when the Loma Prieta earthquake struck .
She hit save , stood in a doorway until the shaking was over , and marveled in the days after at the calm , warm mood of the people of her city and her own changed state of mind .
She 's written regularly for TomDispatch since the outbreak of the war in Iraq .
Her just published new book , A Paradise Built in Hell ( Penguin , 2009 ) , is a monument to human bravery and innovation during disasters .
Enlarge Pool photo by Ralf - Finn Hestoft President - elect Barack Obama , flanked by Vice President - elect Joe Biden , left , and future Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , speaks to elementary school children on Dec. 16 in Chicago .
Some schools wo n't show President Obama 's online speech to the nation 's students Tuesday because of the objections of administrators and parents .
Independence , Mo. , School District Superintendent Jim Hinson says he 's gotten " more calls than we 've ever had on an issue , " some from parents who will keep their children home Tuesday .
Obama will challenge students " to work hard , stay in school and dramatically reduce the dropout rate " in the noon ET speech , says White House spokesman Tommy Vietor .
" This is n't a policy speech . "
Lesson plans sent to schools originally suggested that students write letters to themselves " about what they can do to help the president . "
That language prompted conservative radio host Glenn Beck to say the White House goal is the " indoctrination " of children .
This week , the wording was changed to suggest that students ' letters focus on ways to achieve their educational goals , Vietor says .
The speech will be posted online Monday , he says .
Sandra Abrevaya , U.S. Education Department spokeswoman , notes that President George H.W. Bush addressed the nation 's students on live TV in 1991 .
Regardless of who the president is , says Brett Curtis , a parent in Pearland , Texas , " I do n't want him coming into the schools and making a political speech to my children .
...
It 's just wrong . "
Some schools are setting their own limits .
Hinson says Obama 's remarks wo n't be shown in elementary schools .
Other teachers can decide whether to watch .
Stu Silberman , superintendent of Fayette County Public Schools in Lexington , Ky. , says about 50 people have called to protest .
Some " got riled up " after hearing on talk radio that the speech will have political themes , he says .
The speech will be shown in many classrooms , Silberman says .
Other activities will be found for students whose parents do n't want them to see it .
Instead of showing the speech , Texas ' Wichita Falls Independent School District will put a link on its website so students and parents can watch at home , says spokeswoman Renae Murphy .
David Bradley , a Republican and member of the Texas State Board of Education , says Obama 's speech bypasses the authority of states and local school administrators .
His advice to parents : " If you 're concerned , keep your kids home for the day . "
Chuck Saylors , National PTA president , a father of four and a trustee of the Greenville County , S.C. , School District , approves of any president 's involvement in " doing something positive " to encourage students .
" It 's sad that we 've had to turn yet something else into a political issue . "
Elsewhere : •
The communications department at Florida 's Sarasota County School District has gotten about 50 calls , says spokesman Scott Ferguson .
Teachers can show the speech if it fits into their courses , and parents can decide if their children watch .
• Granite School District in Salt Lake City has gotten a few complaints at each of its 89 schools , says spokesman Ben Horsley .
The district is sending a notice to parents advising them that they also can watch online .
• Mark Enderle , superintendent of the Fort Osage , Mo. , School District , started getting calls on Monday .
He 's not requiring teachers to show the speech , nor is he discouraging it .
Parents who object can have their children excused .
Enderle wonders why the speech has stirred such controversy .
He supports a positive message about education from the White House , he says , " regardless of whether my president 's name is Obama , Bush or Millard Fillmore . "

BusinessWeek 's veteran tech reporter Stephen Baker wants a severance package from Bloomberg , not a job .
At least we assume that 's what he 's after , with this post on his personal blog , where he says Bloomberg 's executives do n't get the Internet :
Still , I 'm trying to think ahead 10 years and wondering about the future of Bloomberg 's model .
They have a proprietary technology platform in a world moving toward open standards .
Their box has an interface that requires training courses -- this in a global market where simple , intuitive systems rise to the top .
These limitations have n't mattered to date , because Bloomberg holds a trump card : speedy and reliable data .
Traders have plenty of incentive to pay for the boxes and figure out how to use them , because real - time data is a must .
If their competitors get the news first , they lose .
It 's this dynamic which fuels the 300,000 ( and counting ) subscriptions for Bloomberg boxes .
How much can this market grow ?
To listen to Bloomberg execs , they make money from the boxes and invest that money in more news - gathering power , which makes the boxes even more attractive .
It 's a virtuous cycle which presumably leads to continuous growth .
With BusinessWeek , Bloomberg hopes to extend its brand into the wider business audience , including c- suite executives , and open up further markets for their boxes .
I do n't see it .
In my experience , every continuous growth projection encounters some force that disrupts it .
Seems to me that for Bloomberg to reach wider business dominance , it must leverage the power of its box outside the box -- finding a way to sell premium data services for a fraction of $ 20,000 a year on the Web .
This will require far more than the virtuous cycle .
The company , which a generation ago innovated with the box , will have to innovate again , developing a new business model .
Of course , it does n't hurt to have $ 6 billion in box revenue and and an immense news organization backing it up .
But still , it will require establishing new and cheaper services that provide a dose of magic from the box , but without cannibalizing it .

Health Care : An Anarchist Approach
The current US debate about health - care funding can be understood as concerned with meeting the challenge of doing three things at once :
(1) Ensuring that everyone can afford to buy ample medical services and ( 2 ) lowering the price of care while ( 3 ) not interfering with our choices .
An Unnecessary Tension among Health Care Goals — Created by the State
If you assume that most or all of the features of our current health care system should be treated as given , the trilemma really does seem irresolvable .
Suppose everyone can afford ample medical care .
We know what doctors charge .
We know what hospitals charge .
We know what drug manufacturers charge .
We know what medical device manufacturers charge .
And we know what insurers charge to , we ’re told , make it all possible .
And we know the charges are anything but insubstantial .
So , given they way things work right now , if everyone can afford ample medical care , then everyone must be able to spend a lot of money .
If the current pricing of medical care really reflects conditions in the current market , and there ’s no reason to think it does n’t , then there ’s no way to lower the cost of care without , realistically , making fewer services , fewer drugs , fewer devices available , as long as current market conditions persist .
And that means , of course , interfering with our choices , since it ’s hard to choose an option that ’s not on the table .
With fewer services available , options have been reduced , and , assuming the real value to patients of some available procedures that would be less prevalent as a result of cost - control measures , the quality of services would be reduced .
So Goal 1 does n’t look too achievable .
Of course , we could insist that Goal 1 be achieved no matter what , perhaps along with Goal 3 .
But then it ’s hard to see how Goal 2 could be achieved .
Or we could dramatically reduce choice , and perhaps , just perhaps , that might enable us to offer an ample supply of , well , some kind of care judged by someone to be of high quality , while controlling costs .
Would the quality be adequate ?
Without choice , it would be hard to tell , and it would be hard to require quality , since that ’s what unrestrained markets do , and since we would n’t have anything like an unrestrained market .
So it might seem , at first glance , as if there were a real problem achieving all three goals .
But there ’s not , if you vary one assumption that is n’t being made explicit in most of the discussions being conducted on - line , on TV , and in the print media by Beltway insiders .
That ’s the assumption that we need to keep a whole range of monopolistic cartels intact , cartels established by the state at least in part precisely to keep costs up .
A natural approach for anarchists to take is to challenge this assumption , while suggesting that , if it ’s not endorsed , the three explicitly stated goals can all be achieved at the same time .
One way to think about this is as an ongoing contribution to the debate about “ socialism . ”
The Tuckerite claim ( I ’m not precisely a Tuckerite , but I like to think of myself as a fellow traveler ) is , I take it , that “ socialism ” is best understood as naming a series of goals which can be achieved using the political means or the economic means .
For the Tuckerite , the economic means turns out to achieve the desired set of goals more efficiently than the political means — and so without the aggression that ’s definitionally part of the use of the political means .
But what is achieved is still socialism .
The Tuckerite socialist can achieve what the state socialist purports to want , but without many of the human and financial costs created by a state - based approach .
What the State Does to Keep Health Care Costs High
Consider the impact of the monopoly power drug companies and medical device exercise by retaining and enforcing patent rights arbitrarily conferred by the government .
Or consider the effect on prices when licensing requirements limit who can be a doctor , how many doctors there can be , what kinds of procedures non-doctors can perform ?
Or the effect exerted by similar licensing requirements that dramatically reduce competition in other health - care professions .
Or the effect of limiting the accreditation of hospitals — too frequently in light of the market conditions of the communities in which they wish to operate ( so that there ’s as little head - to - head competition as possible ) .
And there ’s more : what about the rules that provide tax incentives for employers to purchase health insurance for employees , thus taking responsibility out of the hands of employees with incentives to seek good individual deals ?
And what about state rules that make it harder , or impossible , for people to seek insurance from out - of - state carriers ?
Or ones that limit who can be an insurer ( hint : not a physician who wants to offer her patients care on a flat - fee - per - year basis ) .
These constraints create or promote monopolistic or quasi- monopolistic positions for many players in the health - insurance industry .
The FDA approval process is also , of course , a state monopoly that drives up costs and lengthens the time - to - market of many products .
It ’s also one of the factors that helps to make health care unaffordable for many people .
State subsidies to agriculture also contribute to health - care costs by encouraging the purchase of lots of low - nutrition foods .
Purchasing these items simultaneously redirects resources that could be used to buy foods that made positive contributions to people ’s health away from the purchase of such foods and encourages the purchase of items that may actually decrease health and thus boost health care costs .
Finally : it ’s not a monopoly , precisely , but it is a dubious legal privilege that also drives up costs .
A punitive damage award can turn an individual person into scapegoats , someone to be “ taught a lesson ” on behalf of the entire class of victims of conduct like his or her own .
Punitive damage awards drive up costs unnecessarily while forcing health - care professionals and hospitals to focus on defensive medicine .
How the State Can Help to Make Health Care Accessible by Stopping Its War on Poor People
Remember , the driving force behind so much of the debate about health care is accessibility .
That ’s a function of cost .
But it ’s also a function of the incomes of people who might want access to care but ca n’t afford it .
The first step would be to lower taxes .
The long - term goal must be to eliminate all the tribute people pay to the state at all levels , but legislators might start by dramatically increasing the standard deduction while , at the federal level , increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit .
It ’s worth asking , too , about the impact of multiple monopolies on the circumstances of poor people .
The state does lots of things that make and keep people poor .
Some kinds of jobs require business licenses , or other kinds of permissions from local actors to start up .
Maybe the licenses require costly and dispensable equipment or unnecessary certification , or maybe they just involve prohibitive up - front costs .
( Think about how much it costs to obtain a New York taxicab medallion . )
Sometimes , they preclude people using the low - cost facilities that are their own homes for business purposes , imposing the heavy burden of working elsewhere .
And sometimes — as when Tulare , California , officials recently shut down a little girl ’s lemonade stand because it did n’t have a license — licensing requirements are just exercises in petty tyranny .
Whatever their form or their motivation , the burdens created by licensing requirements fall hardest on poor people .
Those same requirements impact where poor people can find housing : housing that does n’t meet someone else ’s standards of middle - class acceptability is denied to poor people who could pay for it , but might be able to pay for anything else .
And the burden on the poor is only increased when certain kinds of jobs are denied to people at all — like selling medications that the government wants sold only by government approved pharmacists in government - approved pharmacies .
Tariffs also hurt poor people by significantly increasing the costs they need to pay for imported goods ( including , often enough , food that would be less expensive than domestic alternatives absent import duties ) .
Often touted as propping up poor workers ’ incomes , they serve primarily to boost the profits of poorly performing domestic producers at the expense of both domestic consumers ( especially poor ones ) and foreign producers .
In a perfect or near - perfect market , it might make little difference whether or not everyone was unionized .
But in today ’s un- freed market , state - guaranteed privilege , rather than competitive excellence , is responsible for some corporate profits .
In this kind of market , unionization can help to improve workers ’ economic positions .
State limitations on union activity can tend to reduce unions ’ influence , and so to reduce the incomes of workers who might make more were they free to engage in more radical bargaining tactics .
An Initial Anarchist Agenda
Bottom line : arguably the most important thing government officials could do to reduce health care costs would be to get completely out of the way , to stop privileging favored elites and driving up prices .
State functionaries could :
Stop offering protection to patents and copyrights .
Eliminate hospital accrediting and professional licensing rules , leaving a variety of flexible , competing market - based certification systems to do the job .
Limit malpractice awards to actual damages plus the costs of recovery ( including reasonable legal fees ) .
Repeal regulations that prevent the sale of insurance across state lines and the prevent the operation of what amount to insurance schemes by health professionals .
Alter the tax code to de-link employment and insurance .
( This change would have the potential to boost net taxes , of course , if it were n’t made in tandem with the tax cuts for which I ’ve argued . )
Replace the FDA approval process with alternative , voluntary private certification systems .
Eliminate agricultural subsidies .
And government officials could also ensure that ordinary people had the resources needed to pay for ( newly much less expensive ) health care .
They could :
Eliminate licensing , zoning , and related restrictions that prevent people from starting small , low - capital businesses .
Eliminate rules that prevent poor people from entering business regarded as off - limits ( like selling non-approved pharmaceuticals — which could be certified by voluntary , non-state certification services ) .
Eliminate rules that force poor people to choose between the kind of housing middle - class planners and neighborhood busybodies prefer — and no housing at all .
Eliminate import duties .
Slash the tax burden at the state and federal level as much as possible — sharply increasing the standard income tax deduction and the Earned Income Tax Credit — and make corresponding reductions in spending .
Eliminate state limitations on collective bargaining , including compulsory arbitration requirements , prohibitions on secondary boycotts , back - to - work orders , and “ all state Right - to - Work Laws which prohibit employers from making voluntary contracts with unions . ”
Notice how the Tuckerite socialist model would work .
It would ensure that poor people had more money .
By eliminating monopolies ( and quasi - monopolistic market distortions like tax subsidies for particular insurance choices ) , it would also ensure that prices for health care services — whether purchased directly or provided via insurers — were lower .
By keeping a competitive market in place , it would ensure that competitive market pressures would tend to elevate overall product and service quality .
And because it would n’t involve the installation of yet another czar , or the equivalent , because it would leave people free to make their own health - care choices , it would preserve liberty rather than limiting it .
It would achieve all three of the goals proponents of current health - care reform measures say they want .
Putting it on the able could also provide an opportunity to link a variety of other pro-freedom legal changes with ( radical ) health - care reform .
And it would force proponents of statist options to ask more clearly whether they value the goals they say they want to achieve more than they value the opportunity to give more power to technocrats .
While a Tuckerite socialist plan would , indeed , provide a way of achieving state - socialist goals via the economic rather than the political means , such a plan would be anything but a continuation of the status quo .
Indeed , it would be a dramatic attack on the status quo , one that redistributed wealth from privileged monopolists to ordinary people , and dramatically increased the likelihood of access to inexpensive , high - quality medical care for all Americans .

Americans have lost their ability for introspection , thereby revealing their astounding hypocrisy to the world .
U.S. War Secretary Robert Gates has condemned the Associated Press and a reporter , Julie Jacobson , embedded with U.S. troops in Afghanistan , for taking and releasing a photo of a U.S. Marine who was wounded in action and died from his injury .
The photographer was on patrol with the Marines when they came under fire .
She found the courage and presence of mind to do her job .
Her reward is to be condemned by the warmonger Gates as " insensitive . "
Gates says her employer , the Associated Press , lacks " judgment and common decency . "
The American Legion jumped in and denounced the Associated Press for a " stunning lack of compassion and common decency . "
To stem opposition to its wars , the War Department hides signs of American casualties from the public .
Angry that evidence escaped the censor , the war secretary and the American Legion attacked with politically correct jargon : " insensitive , " " offended , " and the " anguish " and " pain and suffering " inflicted upon the Marine ’s family .
The War Department sounds like it is preparing a harassment tort .
Is n’t this passing the buck ?
The Marine lost his life not because of the Associated Press and a photographer , but because of the war criminals 
Gates , Bush , Cheney , Obama , and the U.S. Congress that supports wars of naked aggression that serve no American purpose , but which keep campaign coffers filled with contributions from the armaments companies .
Marine Lance Cpl. Joshua M. Bernard is dead because the U.S. government and a significant percentage of the U.S. population believe that the U.S. has the right to invade , bomb , and occupy other peoples who have raised no hand against us but are demonized with lies and propaganda .
For the American war secretary it is a photo that is insensitive , not America ’s assertion of the right to determine the fate of Afghanistan with bombs and soldiers .
The exceptional " virtuous nation " does not think it is insensitive for America ’s bombs to blow innocent villagers to pieces .
On Sept. 4 , the day before Gates ’ outburst over the " insensitive " photo , Agence France Presse reported from Afghanistan that a U.S. / NATO air strike had killed large numbers of villagers who had come to get fuel from two tankers that had been hijacked from negligent and inattentive occupation forces :
" ’ Nobody was in one piece .
Hands , legs , and body parts were scattered everywhere .
Those who were away from the fuel tanker were badly burnt , ’ said 32 - year - old Mohammad Daud , depicting a scene from hell .
The burned - out shells of the tankers , still smoking in marooned wrecks on the riverbank , were surrounded by the charred - meat remains of villagers from Chahar Dara district in Kunduz province , near the Tajik border .
Dr. Farid Rahid , a spokesperson in Kabul for the ministry of health , said up to 250 villagers had been near the tankers when the air strike was called in . "
What does the world think of the United States ?
The American war secretary and a U.S. military veterans association think a photo of an injured and dying American soldier is insensitive , but not the wipeout of an Afghan village that came to get needed fuel .
The U.S. government is like a criminal who accuses the police of his crime when he is arrested or a sociopathic abuser who blames the victim .
It is a known fact that the CIA has violated U.S. law and international law with its assassinations , kidnappings , and torture .
But it is not this criminal agency that will be held accountable .
Instead , those who will be punished will be those moral beings who , appalled at the illegality and inhumanity of the CIA , leaked the evidence of the agency ’s crimes .
The CIA has asked the U.S. Justice ( sic ) Department to investigate what the CIA alleges is the " criminal disclosure " of its secret program to murder suspected foreign terrorist leaders abroad .
As we learned from Gitmo , those suspected by America are overwhelmingly innocent .
The CIA program is so indefensible that when CIA director Leon Panetta found out about it six months after being in office , he cancelled the program ( assuming those running the program obeyed ) and informed Congress .
Yet , the CIA wants the person who revealed its crime to be punished for revealing secret information .
A secret agency this unmoored from moral and legal standards is a greater threat to our country than are terrorists .
Who knows what false flag operation it will pull off in order to provide justification and support for its agenda .
An agency that is more liability than benefit should be abolished .
The agency ’s program of assassinating terrorist leaders is itself fraught with contradictions and dangers .
The hatred created by the U.S. and Israel is independent of any leader .
If one is killed , others take his place .
The most likely outcome of the CIA assassination program is that the agency will be manipulated by rivals , just as the FBI was used by one mafia family to eliminate another .
In order to establish credibility with groups that they are attempting to penetrate , CIA agents will be drawn into participating in violent acts against the U.S. and its allies .
Accusing the truthteller instead of the evildoer is the position that the neoconservatives took against the New York Times when after one year ’s delay , which gave George W. Bush time to get reelected , the Times published the NSA leak that revealed that the Bush administration was committing felonies by violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The neocons , especially those associated with Commentary magazine , wanted the New York Times indicted for treason .
To the evil neocon mind , anything that interferes with their diabolical agenda is treason .
This is the way many Americans think .
America über alles !
No one counts but us ( and Israel ) .
The deaths we inflict and the pain and suffering we bring to others are merely collateral damage on the bloody path to American hegemony .
The attitude of the " freedom and democracy " U.S. government is that anyone who complains of illegality or immorality or inhumanity is a traitor .
The Republican Sen. Christopher S. Bond is a recent example .
Bond got on his high horse about " irreparable damage " to the CIA from the disclosures of its criminal activities .
Bond wants those " back stabbers " who revealed the CIA ’s wrongdoings to be held accountable .
Bond is unable to grasp that it is the criminal activities , not their disclosure , that is the source of the problem .
Obviously , the Whistleblower Protection Act has no support from Sen .
Bond , who sees it as just another law to plough under .
This is where the U.S. government stands today : Ignoring and covering up government crimes is the patriotic thing to do .
To reveal the government ’s crimes is an act of treason .
Many Americans on both sides of the aisle agree .
Yet , they still think that they are The Virtuous Nation , the exceptional nation , the salt of the earth .
Regional telco TDS Telecommunications last week issued a press release announcing a major milestone for the company : 50 M bps service over fiber optic cable to residents of Monticello , Minnesota .
The Minneapolis suburb became one of the few non-FiOS communities in the country to experience full fiber - to - the - home deployment , and subscribers will all receive a free upgrade from 25 M bps service to the new 50 M bps tier .
Even better is the price , which starts at $ 49.95 a month for 50 M bps fiber service without the need to buy other services .
TDS is thrilled .
" This is a huge first for TDS , " said market manager Tom Ollig .
" TDS is working incredibly hard to deliver the faster speeds customers want . "
But the entire congratulatory press release glosses over a key fact : the reason that Monticello received a fiber network was the town 's decision to install a municipal - owned fiber network to every home in town spawning a set of TDS lawsuits that went all the way to the Minnesota Supreme Court , which ruled in favor of the town .
Screaming to be heard
The saga began in 2007 , when the town passed a referendum approving the city - owned fiber network .
The city says that it had approached TDS and was told that no such system would be installed in town in the near future , so it went ahead with its own plans .
After the referendum , the city was sued by the telco just before groundbreaking began .
The suit did n't seem to have much of a chance under Minnesota law , and indeed judges at multiple levels ruled for Monticello .
But in the meantime , TDS rolled into town with nine crews of its own and began installing — you guessed it — fiber to the home .
Monticello had just become one of the only US cities in which twin , parallel fiber networks were being built at the same time .
Backers of the muni fiber plan were outraged ; not only could TDS build a modern fiber network on a moment 's notice when it wanted to do so , but the lawsuits prevented the city from doing much of its installation even as TDS moved ahead .
We spoke to TDS about the situation last year , and its director of legislative and public relations told us that TDS did n't act earlier because it did n't actually know that people really , really wanted fiber ; once the referendum was a success , the company moved quickly to give people what it now knew they wanted .
After delaying the town 's deployment through lawsuits and rolling out fiber service of its own , TDS issued a statement in June 2009 in which it then called the whole rationale for the government project into question .
" In view of TDS ' development of a robust broadband platform in Monticello during the past year , it is questionable whether or not the City 's feasibility study supporting its own fiber project , which was premised on no broadband competitors and on which the revenue bond purchasers relied when they secured the bonds more than a year ago , is still accurate , and whether the city fiber project is feasible today . "
Now , it has upped the ante by doubling everyone 's speeds .
The moves all seemed designed to keep the idea of a muni- owned fiber network from spreading , but they might well have the opposite effect ; one takeaway from the entire saga is that trying to build a muni fiber network is an excellent way to " encourage " investment and innovation from regional or national companies that might not otherwise have your town 's own best interests at heart .
Such stories are n't limited to Minnesota suburbs , either .
Just last month Telephony Online ran a piece on how Cox cable prices had " dropped considerably " since Lafeyette , Louisiana lit up a fiber system of its own .
" Cox froze the cable rates in Lafayette , and they did n’t freeze the rates in other areas , " said Terry Huval , director of the muni project .
" We figured our citizens saved over $ 3 million in cable rates even before we could offer them service . "
Competition
This should n't be a surprise , as it's really just a classic case of direct competition — something not seen often enough in the wired broadband market .
Unfortunately , getting high - speed Internet to your town is n't always as simple as threatening to start a municipal network .
Many times , incumbent providers simply file lawsuits while keeping speeds the same .
If your town is really unlucky , the incumbent will just head right to the state legislature , seeking to pass laws constraining the practice .
That 's what happened to Wilson , North Carolina , which runs a moderately famous 100 M bps system known as Greenlight ( which just happens to be the fastest ISP in the entire state ) .
When Time Warner Cable ( which still tops out at 10 Mbps and no DOCSIS 3.0 ) was asked why it had not stepped up to meet the city 's demand for faster access , a company rep told TechJournal South that it had n't actually heard a citizen outcry over the issue — or it would have acted .
Wilson 's Internet manager is having none of it .
" We do n’t want to run anyone out of business , " he said , " but we also do n’t want to take the leftover table scraps .
If they had offered us what we were asking for , next generation good service , we would have happily stepped aside . "
I 've made no attempt to hide my venom for the way Sony has handled the PSPgo at launch .
From its ludicrous price point to the lack of features and way upgraders have been completely stiffed , Sony has done an amazing amount of things wrong with the latest PlayStation Portable .
However , spending a few days with the system , and doing my damnedest to like it , has revealed that there are at least few things Sony did right with the machine .
It would be unfair to paint the PSPgo in an entirely negative light , as much as it deserves the criticism it 's received .
With that in mind , we 've restored the balance a little by examining some of the things Sony 's actually done right with the system , bringing a little positivity to a system that has been surrounded by very little rage and disappointment .
Are these positives enough to justify the system 's existence ?
In the case of many people , not at all .
However , perhaps those that bought the system will be able to feel a little less conned by looking on the brightside .
Read on as we discuss the things Sony did right with the PSPgo .
The aesthetics :
Obviously scoring huge points for those prone to technolust is the sleek and saucy new design of the PSPgo .
I 'm not going to praise its " smaller form factor " because that 's Sony marketing speak and it makes me cringe when people use it .
However , there is no denying that it is a sexy bitch , and that 's not something you 'll hear from PR .
I love the way it 's designed , and there 's something immensely satisfying about popping the screen up and watching the system instantly buzz into life .
Let 's face it , the old PSP models have always been a bit on the bulky side , despite efforts to reduce its size .
The PSPgo 's lightweight design makes it so much easier to carry around , certainly a blessing for someone who secures a multitude of games devices and gadgets about his person when traveling .
The controls :
I do n't care what anybody says about the so - called " cramped " controls .
The PSPgo 's button layout is superior to previous PSP models , and I 'm not even sure how they did it .
Despite situating the analog nub , D - pad and face buttons close together and putting the shoulder buttons behind the screen , Sony somehow made the control layout feel comfortable and sensible on the PSPgo .
I have been pleasantly surprised by just how nice it feels to play on a PSPgo than an older PSP , and this is coming from someone with great big fat mammoth hands .
One has to get used to the fact that the analog nub is situated within an indent , but when your thumb comes to terms with that , it feels great .
I always felt like my hand was about to slip off the nub when playing games on my old system , but with the PSPgo is feels like I 've always got a good grip on the thing .
The shoulder buttons behind the screen works out great too , with the index fingers unwittingly providing decent support for the screen itself .
It 's not perfect , by any means .
The volume and brightness controls are hidden between the shoulder buttons and are quite awkward to get to , while the flatness and proximity of the Select and Start buttons make them a hassle to use .
However , while actually playing games , which is the important bit , I 've found that the discomfort I used to feel when using the PSP is next to nonexistent .
Playing an action - intensive game like Undead Knights no longer causes my hands to cramp , and that 's good news !
The " pause game " feature :
Imagine you 're on an airplane , and you 're getting your Final Fantasy VII freak on .
The plane is about to touch down and the Nazi-esque cabin crew has demanded that you switch off your electronic devices like a bunch of damn Nazis .
However , you 're righting Ruby Weapon and you can sense that you 're going to beat it !
What do you do ?
Put the PSP on sleep mode and wait silently , paranoid that the pilot can detect your PSP and will kill you , or that the plane will crash thanks to your selfish actions and kill everybody ?
Do you switch the PSP off like an obedient puppy and destroy everything you have achieved ?
If you have a PSPgo , the answer is this : None of the above !
The " pause game " feature is one of the best new additions to any handheld , ever .
While certain games allow for a temporary " save anywhere " feature , like the DS Castlevania games , the ability to save whenever you want in a game and then come back to it later is nonexistent in far too many portable games .
It should have always been a mandatory feature for every handheld title , and thanks to the PSPgo , it now is .
With the " pause game " feature , you can stop playing , temporarily save the game 's progress to the PSPgo 's internal memory , and then safely power the machine down .
This is different from simply pausing the game and putting the PSP into sleep mode , since you can turn the PSPgo off completely and still pick up where you left off during the next play session .
What 's more , you can exit a game and then do other things with the PSPgo , like listen to music or watch a movie , before going right back to the game .
It 's not quite as good as having direct access to the XMB while running a game , but it 's certainly better than nothing .
The Bluetooth :
Okay , so actually using the Bluetooth is a needless hassle and requires all sorts of roundabout bullshit to pull off , but hey , it 's something , right ?
Having the ability to use a Bluetooth headset and a PS3 controller with the PSP is a pretty cool addition , and maybe in time it will lead to some neat and inventive videogame design opportunities .
It probably wo n't , but the option is there regardless .
I guess this one 's a bit of stretch .
Sony did right by including it , but did n't exactly do the inclusion itself right .
Ah well .
The PlayStation Network rollout :
While not exactly a feature of the PSPgo , it 's certainly something that happened because of the PSPgo .
The recent boost to the PlayStation Network 's content , coinciding with the system 's October 1 release date , has been terrific .
In just a day , PSN was transformed into a service full of actual choices , with some great deals and cool additions to the PSP library .
The PSPgo ushered in 16,000 pieces of digital content , and while only a small percentage of that content was game content , there are loads of cool titles to choose from , and some of the prices really are n't bad .
God of War : Chains of Olympus is totally worth a purchase at $ 15.99 , while some of the discounted NIS games are more than welcome .
Perusing the PlayStation Store , I now feel spoiled for choice , which is something I 've never really been able to say about PSN before .
The huge digital support Sony has shown for the PSPgo is a huge step in the right direction , and if Sony can keep up the momentum , the PlayStation Network will be an awesome , awesome place .
Yeah , the full - priced digital versions of games like Persona and Gran Turismo is utter crap .
The stuff that is n't a racket , however , is plentiful and worth scoping out .
The Rock Band Unplugged ' demo ' :
This was genius .
Bullshit , but genius .
I 've never been a big fan of music games with plastic peripherals , but I like a good old fashioned button - based rhythm game , and Rock Band Unplugged is certainly that .
However , by not including the full game , Sony and EA have stumbled upon pure strategic brilliance .
They 've given me a mere taste of the game , and now I keep wanting to supplement it with downloadable songs .
Sure , getting " Still Alive " for free is great , but then I see Spinal Tap 's " Back From the Dead " is on there , and I want it .
Then I see other songs I recognize , and I want them too .
It was rather shitty of Sony to not provide a proper bundled game , and the whole idea of giving us a free taster and hiking the price up is something that stereotypical drug pushers do in eighties movies .
Even despite the somewhat scummy nature of the scheme , it was a very smart move and one that has worked like a charm on this poor sucker .
Even if it 's a grift , you have to give credit where credit 's due .
This was a smooth move .
Oh , and the battery is removable :
Y'know ... just saying .

Some of the most important lessons take place in the classroom .
For educators elementary through high school , we have compiled a list of some of our favorite freedom of speech and freedom of the press lesson plans from around the web .
This series of three talks will give a nontechnical , high level overview of geometric complexity theory ( GCT ) , which is an approach to the P vs. NP problem via algebraic geometry , representation theory , and the theory of a new class of quantum groups , called nonstandard quantum groups , that arise in this approach .
In particular , GCT suggests that the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann Hypothesis over finite fields .
No background in algebraic geometry , representation theory or quantum groups would be
assumed .

Tadcaster – ( The Celebrated ) Oatmeal Stout
Samuel Smith Old Brewery , N. Yorks , England
History : ( From the Site ) “ Originally a drink for lactating mothers , oatmeal stout was described as nutritional on early labels .
Oats are in the same family as barley , and a small addition yields great flavor .
Popular in the late 1800 ’s , the last oatmeal stout was brewed before the First World War until Samuel Smith reintroduced this style in 1980 .
Almost opaque , with an unusually silky texture and complex , medium - dry velvet palate .
Bittersweet finish . “
I have to say , I really enjoy purchasing these beers of late in the 550 ml size ranges .
Not only do you , essentially , get more beer if you snatch up 4 or 5 as compared to a standard 6 , but you also get six distinctly different beers , again , as opposed to the standard 6 .
Very cool .
Anyway , this is a quite lovely brew that is , as it says up there , nearly opaque .
The pour immediately opens up the scents of oats , some richer malts , and the slightly bitter nose of the supporting hops .
The head is creamy and fluffy and hangs on a good bit before settling to a thin disk of foam .
Certainly not nearly as heavy as many of the stouts I ’ve had recently .
At first it has a wonderfully velvet mouth - feel , but that subsides nicely into a not - quite - standard stout finish .
The oatmeal is most certainly there , but not at its overly - done and burnt taste that can occur with careless brewers .
It has a hint of that milky , chocolaty note that comes with just about every stout , but it ’s not quite as prominent .
This is a different stout , to be sure , and it lets you know of such by the way you can distinguish its years - old complexity and brewing technique .
Adding this to my repertoir of tasted stouts and porters , I would solidly put this within the top ten I ’ve ever had .
It is a very nice selection .
For food pairing , go with a nice grilled surf and turf : lobster and steak would have a happy marriage with this fine brew .
Rating : * * * *
Age - old brewing techniques make this oatmeal stout a true treasure and a beer to be shared with friends .
Most people dread tax season when April 15th comes rolling around , but I actually get excited and almost giddy .
The reason is not because I enjoy filling out paperwork and paying the government large sums of money , but because it ’s only during tax time that I fully realize how large of a tax deduction I can take on my business expenses every single year .
Most people get caught up on the sidelines doing research and debating whether their business idea even has a chance , but they are missing the point .
They do n’t realize how much money can be saved by having a small business even if it initially does n’t make any money at all .
Enjoy this guide which will teach you what business expenses you can deduct and what you can not .
When you do n’t have a small business , the government is truly ripping you off .
All of your earnings get taxed as ordinary income ( up to 39 % ) before you are even allowed to spend it .
With a small business however , you get to spend your money first and only get taxed on what is left over .
The best part is that even if your business is losing money on paper , you can pass these paper losses from your business directly to lower your own taxable income !
Either way , your net worth benefits whether you are profitable or not .

What Expenses Are Deductible ?
The IRS states that any “ ordinary and necessary ” business expenses can be subtracted from your business income prior to being to taxed .
For our online wedding linens business , this includes computers , office equipment , machinery , office supplies , utilities and much more .
In addition , by planning our vacations around our business trips , we save a lot by deducting travel and entertainment expenses as well .
The general rule is that as long as the expense is made for business and not personal purposes , you can deduct it from your business income .
Small Business Deduction Guidelines
Naturally , the government imposes many rules and regulations over how and what can be deducted on your tax return .
Otherwise , small businesses would abuse these deductions all over the place .
I ’ve put together a mini small business tax deduction guide below along with an outline of the most commonly taken small business writeoffs .
Disclaimer : I ’m not an accountant or a tax lawyer .
Any information provided in this article should be used as a guideline only and not taken as fact .
Tax rules change all of the time and you should check with the IRS before taking any deductions with your business .
The Tax Code
The tax code is a little bit vague which is why many people get themselves into trouble .
A deductible business expense is defined as any expense that is ordinary and necessary for the business and not extravagant .
The expense must also be primarily used for business and not for personal reasons .
While it is up to you to interpret the above statement , its best to always err on being conservative .
For example , if I owned a delivery business , I probably would n’t want to try and write off a Ferrari as the company car .
For all of your expenses , use common sense and always be able to justify your deductions .
Keep good documentation of all of your purchases .
Common Writeoffs for Small Businesses
While there are many items that you can deduct off of your taxes , here are some of the big ticket items that will save you the most on your taxes .
Depending on your business , some of these may not apply .

Once again , keep in mind that I am not a tax professional and that you should consult your own accountant for the specific rules that may apply to you or the area that you live in .
How To Deduct Your Vehicle On Your Taxes
Deducting your vehicle as a business expense is a bit tricky but well worth it , especially if you ’re putting a lot of miles on your car .
The number one rule of thumb when expensing your vehicle is to keep detailed records .
Make sure you use a trip or mileage log and write down each and every mile that you are using the car for business .
This sounds like a major pain , but it ’s not too bad if you keep a log book and pen in your car at all times .
There are also many smartphone apps that do this for you
Whenever you drive somewhere , just write down your starting and ending odometer value for all business related travel .
( Note : This only applies to the mileage method )
There are 2 main ways to deduct your car , the mileage method or the actual expense method .
The Mileage Method
This is the simplest way to deduct the use of your car .
Simply take the number of miles that you ’ve driven for business at the end of the year and multiply this number by the per mile deduction amount specified by the government .
Add in additional expenses such as parking and tolls and you ’re done !
Using this method is advisable when you ’re using an older vehicle that is n’t worth very much money or if you drive a super fuel efficient car such as a hybrid .
Actual Expense Method
With newer vehicles , you can almost always deduct more with the actual expense method .
Below is how you calculate your deduction using the actual expense method .
Add up all of your vehicle related expenses including gas , repairs , insurance and registration etc …
Add a depreciation deduction .
There are different ways of depreciating your vehicle which will be covered in a later post .
If you are leasing your vehicle , you do n’t have to worry about this at all .
Go ahead and deduct the value of your lease payments .
Calculate the percentage of time you are using your vehicle for business .
You can do this by simply dividing the number of business miles driven by the total number of miles driven for a given year .
Multiply this percentage by the sum of expenses and use this as your deduction !
Be Careful
Before deducting any portion of your vehicle , make sure you check the IRS for the latest rules .
There are changes every single year so make sure that the rules that you apply still work based on the present year and locale .
You can always switch from the mileage method to the actual expense method at any time , but not the other way around .
In the beginning , you should do the calculations for both and choose which one gives you the greater deduction .
As with all taxes , bookkeeping is key .
As long as you log all of your miles and destinations , you should have no problem justifying your deductions .
How To Deduct Your Home Office
In order to deduct your home office , your business must follow the following rules .
Your home must be your principal place of business .
This means is that you conduct all of your business related activities in your home and you have no other set locations where you do business
You must have a special area sectioned off for your business .
This might be a separate room or the garage .
Anywhere that you store inventory or products counts as well .
You must actually conduct business at home and use the dedicated space solely for business .
This one sounds like a no brainer , but this is to prevent people from setting up a fake office and taking it as a deduction .
What this also means is that you should remove the bed and dressers from the room as well .
If you meet the above rules , the way you handle the deduction depends on whether you own or rent your home .
Deducting a Rental
Deducting a home office for renters is the simplest case to deal with .
Simply calculate the percentage of space that your business occupies and multiply this by the amount of rent that you pay each year .
Also , do n’t forget to include your utilities and insurance policies as well .
Deducting a Home That You Own
When you actually own your own home , things start to get a bit more complicated and the tax rules are n’t nearly as advantageous as when you rent .
Below are steps you must follow to claim your home office deduction .
Calculate the percentage of space that your business occupies .
Calculate the cost of your house itself .
You ’ll need to separate out the cost of the house versus the cost of the land .
Unfortunately , in many cases , the value of your land greatly trumps the value of your house Calculate all of the expenses relating to utilities , repairs , taxes and insurance .
Add up items 2 and 3 above and multiply this by the percentage calculated in item 1 .
Add the depreciation amount applicable to your house .
Check the IRS and figure out what the depreciation rules are for your house .
This is n’t that complicated , but you should check with your accountant just to make sure how to do it properly since it changes from year to year .
Add in any expenses that we done directly to your home office and not to the rest of the house .
This includes decorations and furnishings .
The main disadvantage of running your business out of a home that you own is that you ’ll have to pay taxes on the amount you ’ve depreciated on your house when it comes time to sell your home .
For example , if your house is worth 100k and you depreciated it 10 k .
When you sell your house , you ’ll need to pay taxes on the gain from what you sold it for minus 90k .
How To Deduct Equipment And Supplies
The biggest advantage for small businesses is a little Internal Revenue Code known as Section 179 .
Section 179 allows small businesses to deduct up to 1 million dollars ( Note : This number changes every year ) of assets completely every year .
What this means is that you can deduct up to this amount in business equipment , computers , furniture etc … without having to worry about depreciation or other tax calculations .
Of course , section 179 comes with a few requirements that must be met .
Purchases must be used mostly for business
The official rule is that the asset that you are deducting must be used for at 50 % or more for business .
Let ’s say for example that you are trying to write off a computer in its entirety for a given tax year .
You should make sure that you are using this computer more for business more than pleasure and be able to demonstrate this if you ever get audited .
For the most part , as long as you do n’t abuse this rule , you should be fine .
Certain Purchases are excluded
Some common things that you ca n’t use section 179 are listed below .
I might be missing some items so you should definitely check for yourself but these are some of the more common exclusions .
Inventory – Basically you can’t write off stuff that you are planning on selling Gifts – Anything that you ’ve obtained or inherited as a gift ca n’t be deducted Real Estate Items that you already own or did not purchase for the tax year
Most small businesses will choose to take the Section 179 deduction for most of their assets .
There are some cases where you would n’t want to however .
For example , if you business profits are low and you ’re at the lowest tax bracket already , you might want to defer some of those write offs for when your business is more profitable to keep yourself at a lower tax bracket later .
In any case , you should always do the math both ways to see what makes sense for you .
Audit Risk
In general , your chances of getting audited when taking the home business deduction are much higher if your business does n’t show a profit for an extended period of time .
If you do take the deduction , make sure that you can prove that your business is actually legit and not just a hobby of yours that you are taking advantage of .
Also keep in mind that your chances of an audit go up for every year that you do n’t show a profit .
How To Deduct Entertainment And Meals
Deducting entertainment and meals is often a gray area that people take advantage of .
My general rule of thumb is that as long as you do n’t abuse the tax code , you should be fine .
I use what I call the “ BS ” code .
If I can tell my wife with a straight face that a particular expense was used for business purposes , and my wife does n’t think its BS , its usually good enough for me .
Officially though , anything you expense must obey the following rules .
The entertainment expense must be reasonable and accepted in your field of business – For example , if I ’m selling vegetarian food over the internet , it most likely would n’t fly if I took the employees out for a steak dinner .
In any case , you get the point .
The purpose of the entertainment expense must be to bring in revenue – For example , if you are hosting an event to promote your company , this is perfectly acceptable .
Even if you and your business partner go out to eat to discuss the business , your meal can be deducted as well .
The expense ca n’t be extravagant – Basically , this means do n’t abuse this deduction !
Anyways , entertainment is defined as any activity or recreation that is directly for customers , clients or employees .
Only 50 % of entertainment and meals is deductible but these expenses can add up over the course of the year .
For our store , my wife and I go out at least once every few weeks to discuss new ways to expand the business .
How To Deduct Travel Expenses
Ever heard your spouse complain that you never go on enough vacations ?
Using your business as a tax shelter is a great way to fund your next vacation without breaking the bank .
With proper planning , you can get your business to pay for and write off most of your trip !
For starters , the trip ’s primary purpose must be for business .
As long as your destination is not completely random , chances are you can find a way to do business there .
Below are some general guidelines on what and how you can deduct during your travels .
Keep in mind that you can only deduct expenses on those days in which you are actually conducting business .
Lodging is can be deducted in its entirety Food can be deducted 50 % Transportation can be deducted 100 % Laundry and Mobile Office related fees can be deducted 100 %
There are 2 ways of deducting your business travel , the per diem method or the actual expense method .
Per Diem Method
The IRS allows for a set deduction per day when you travel .
Every year , the IRS publishes a table which specifies a per diem value depending on your destination .
You should check what the per diem rate is before you do your calculations .
In any case , even if you spend less than your per diem rate , you can still take the entire per diem deduction .
One thing my wife and I do ( when we ’re not trying to make a vacation out of it ) , is to travel on the ultra cheap .
That way , we end up deducting more than we actually spend on our trip .
Keep in mind though that sole proprietorships are not allowed to use the per diem method for their lodging deductions .
All other expense are fair game as far as per diems go .
Actual Expense Method
This is pretty straightforward .
Simply keep all of your receipts and add up the total amount of deductions based on what you have spent .
The important thing is to make sure you keep the receipts for everything you spend your money on .
We always carry along a small box where we throw all of our receipts in at the end of the day .
As with all tax deductions , do n’t go overboard .
Make sure you document exactly which business partners or customers that you are visiting on a given day .
After your meetings , you are free to spend the rest of your day as leisure .
My wife and I typically plan on hitting one vendor per day early in the mornings leaving the rest of the day for pleasure .
We also usually try and plan ahead to decide whether we ’re going to use the per diem or actual expense method .
On business vacations , we usually go all out and use the expense method .
If the trip is purely for business , usually we ’ll skimp and take the per diem .
What To Be Careful Of
Before you proclaim yourself a small business and start taking deductions all over the place , there are a few things to watch out for as far as the government is concerned .
For one thing , you have to be able to prove to the IRS that your business is in fact a real business .
The definition of “ business ” is fairly broad .
In general , you only need to prove to the IRS that you are actively trying to make money even though you may not necessarily be succeeding .
Here are the criteria that the IRS uses to determine if your business is “ real ” .
If your business makes a taxable profit for 3 out of 5 consecutive years , you ’re generally safe from your business being considered just a hobby .
, you ’re generally safe from your business being considered just a hobby .
If your business continues to declare a loss year after year , you will need to gather and keep evidence that you are making an active effort to turn a profit .
This includes having a business website , business cards , a distinct and separate set of financial books , business licenses , permits and advertising expenses etc …
, you will need to gather and keep evidence that you are making an active effort to turn a profit .
This includes having a business website , business cards , a distinct and separate set of financial books , business licenses , permits and advertising expenses etc …
You have to stay up to date with all of the necessary business filings .
For example , if you sell physical goods , you still have to declare your sales taxes even if you made no sales at all
Do n’t Be Afraid Of The IRS !
Most people do n’t take deductions that they are entitled to because they do n’t want to get audited or even take the risk .
But the tax rules for businesses are in place for a reason so you should take advantage of them !
Naturally , your chances of getting audited can go up depending on what you choose to deduct but if you are truly trying to a run a legit business , you have nothing to worry about .
For our wedding linens business , we make sure not to be too over aggressive when it comes to taking business expenses yet we still manage to save thousands of dollars in taxes every year .
Just make sure that you consult a tax accountant before taking any crazy deductions .
In addition , if you have any specific questions regarding what we deduct with our wedding linens business , feel free to drop me a line .
Once you sit and down and think about it , the tax benefits alone make starting your own venture a safer bet .

Gasser also helped develop the training mechanisms to make sure the analysts are consistent about more subjective matters — like how “ emotionally intense ” that Stan Getz solo is .
( It ’s a 4 out of 5 , in the genome ’s view . )
The test that candidates take involves being able to pick out , quickly and by ear , harmonic structures , melodic organization and other musical elements .
The indoctrination that follows revolves around examples .
( You think that vocal gets a 5 on the gravelly scale ?
Here ’s Tom Waits .
Is it that gravelly ? )
Recently I sat in as several of Pandora ’s song deconstructors gathered in a small conference room to talk about Indian music .
Pandora listeners have been asking for Indian music for a while , but adding it to the service has n’t been a simple matter .
A new genre must arrive in a big batch — about 3,000 pieces of music — because Pandora ’s algorithm needs lots of choices to be able to recommend something similar - sounding .
And all of it has to be pulled apart first .
This entails squaring the very different structures of Indian music with Pandora ’s “ genome ” data points .
Over the previous six weeks or so , the Pandora analysts listened to 650 Indian pieces , and the session I observed was a refresher course .
Steve Hogan , who oversees Pandora ’s analyst squad , had given a half - dozen of its members the same two songs to analyze .
The first was “ Raga Ahir Bhairav , ” recorded by Bismillah Khan in 1955 .
But the analysts had not been given this cultural information ; all they had for the assignment was the music and their ears .
Hogan played a snippet and pointed to Kurt Kotheimer , a bass player who often gigs around the Bay Area .
Kotheimer consulted his listening notes : “ Flat second , major third , perfect fourth , perfect fifth , major sixth , flat seventh . ”
Everybody nodded : that ’s the tone set , which helps identify the particular raga , one of 25 new “ genes ” added to Pandora ’s algorithm to accommodate this variety of non-Western music .
Based on the beat , everyone agreed that this raga was set in Teentaal , with a 16 - beat rhythmic cycle often heard in North Indian classical music ; it ’s now in the genome too .
But that was the easy part , apparently .
They moved on to vocals , and Alan Lin , a violinist , ticked off the scores he came up with for things like rhythmic intensity and the relative exoticism of the melody scale .
“ I actually put exotic at 3.5 , ” he said .
This prompted Sameer Gupta — a percussionist and an expert on Indian music who was weighing in by speakerphone from New York — to lead a brief discussion of how to think about melody and exoticism in this context .
Seven or eight scores related to melody , and then about the same number for harmony .
( “ A 5 for drone , ” one analyst announced . )
More scores related to form .
Tempo .
The timbre of the reeds .
When Gupta gave his score for riskiness on the percussion — a 3.5 — Lin did a sort of fist pump : “ Yes ! ” Evidently he ’d scored it the same way , meaning progress toward properly fitting Indian music into the Music Genome Project .
Things went on like this for a while .
“ Even if you have a solo violin with a tabla , you ’re still going to have monophony , ” Gupta remarked at one juncture .
“ I just wanted to point that out . ”
It was hard to believe there was a business riding on this kind of conversation .
But while some of the genes involve expert , subjective judgment , they are n’t qualitative in the most traditional sense : there ’s no rating that allows an analyst to conclude that a vocal or a sax solo is simply lousy .
What Pandora ’s system largely ignores is , in a word , taste .
The way that Gasser or Westergren might put this is that it minimizes the influence of other people ’s taste .
Music - liking becomes a matter decided by the listener , and the intrinsic elements of what is heard .
Early on , Westergren actually pushed for the idea that Pandora would not even reveal who the artist was until the listener asked .
He thought maybe that structure would give users a kind of permission to evaluate music without even the most minimal cultural baggage .
“ We ’re so insecure about our tastes , ” he says .
While his partners talked him out of that approach , Westergren maintains “ a personal aversion ” to collaborative filtering or anything like it .
“ It ’s still a popularity contest , ” he complains , meaning that for any song to get recommended on a socially driven site , it has to be somewhat known already , by your friends or by other consumers .
Westergren is similarly unimpressed by hipster blogs or other theoretically grass - roots influencers of musical taste , for their tendency to turn on artists who commit the crime of being too popular ; in his view that ’s just snobbery , based on social jockeying that has nothing to do with music .
In various conversations , he defended Coldplay and Rob Thomas , among others , as victims of cool - taste prejudice .
( When I ran Bob Lefsetz ’s dismissal of Pandora by him , he laughed it off , and transitioned to arguing that Journey is , actually , a great band . )
Roman Polanski innocent : framed by Manson cult satanists !

If it were not for Roman Polanski , the anti-satanic - cult movement would never have been started .
Satanic Ritual
Abuse would have gone unnoticed , and sources of satanism like
Satanic Cults have tried to silence Roman Polanski before - the Charles Manson Family even tried to assasinate him , but only succeeded in murdering his wife , Sharon Tate , and their unborn child .
The Manson Family and his allies in the International Satanist Movement have struck again , framing Roman Polanski for the " statutory rape " of a 13 - year old girl .
This is a lie .
ROMAN POLANSKI IS INNOCENT .
The incident began when Roman Polanski met Samantha Gailey .
When he heard her name , pronounced " Samantha , Gay - ly " he would have concluded that she was a lesbian recruit , who needed to be recruited back to heterosexuality .
Samantha Gaily , 13 .
In the 70's only lesbians wore jeans .
Of course , to recruit her into hetrosexuality , he would have to lay with her .
Yes , this is technically against secular law , however , THERE IS NO AGE OF CONSENT IN BIBLICAL LAW .
This is the Biblical Law that applies to Roman Polanski : Deuteronomy 22:28 - 29 ( King James Version )
28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin , which is not betrothed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ; 29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
The just punishment for Roman Polanski is for him to pay Samantha Gailey 's father , and then to marry her , with no option of divorce .
In fact , Roman Polanski has reportedly already paid half a million dollars in an out - of - court settlement .
I 'm not certain of the exact numbers for inflation and exchange rates , but that has to be worth more than 50 shekels .
I for one am happy to see the Free Market at work in the justice system , I 'm sure the judgement of the Free Market is better than that of a government - run ( socialist ) court case .
This leaves one last accusation , that of sodomy .
If Roman Polansky purposely sodomized Samantha Gailey , he is guilty of lust and sperm - murder .
However , before we jump to judgement , let 's remember that a woman's two holes are very close together and easily confused , and this is especially true on a tiny little 13 - year old .
And let 's not forget the sole witness in this entire case : that of a drunken , drugged - up 13 - year old harlot .
Yes , harlot , read the Bible for yourself : Deuteronomy 22:23-24
23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city , and ye shall stone them with stones that they die ; the damsel , because she cried not
Samantha Gailey did not cry out loud enough for anyone to hear her .
This makes her complict in the hymen- vandalism .
I do n't believe Samantha should be executed , as she was not married at the time .
With no husband , it 's a victimless crime .
The only victim is her father , and he 's already been paid more than 50 shekels .
Dear Friends , we already know that Satanic Cults are in day - care centers , the recording industry , and the government .
We know this because of the risk Roman Polanski took when he produced the docu- drama Rosemary 's baby .
It has been proven that Satanic Cults , led by Charles Manson , have tried to silence Roman Polanski by any means necessary .
STOP THE SATANIST AGENDA !
FREE ROMAN POLANSKI !
Please pray for Roman Polanski , the documentary director who was first to introduce the world to satanic witchcraft cults with the 1968 docu- drama Rosemary 's Baby .
If it were not for Roman Polanski , the anti-satanic - cult movement would never have been started .
Satanic Ritual Abuse would have gone unnoticed , and sources of satanism like Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons would be corrupting Christian children with impunity .
Satanic Cults have tried to silence Roman Polanski before - the Charles Manson Family even tried to assasinate him , but only succeeded in murdering his wife , Sharon Tate , and their unborn child .

TUSCALOOSA -
As if he is n't menacing enough in a football helmet , as if he is n't intimidating enough wearing a perpetual scowl , rugged and sullen Rolando McClain walked into the Alabama football team 's media interview room on Monday with a Viking helmet on his head .
It was the goofy kind with white plastic horns protruding from each side .
This could n't have been Rolando McClain .
He wore a smile .
He did n't want to take the helmet off for television interviews , but media relations folks insisted that he check his hat at the door .
It turns out McClain is n't as good at college football games on a video screen as he is on a field .
He lost a friendly bet Sunday to a former Decatur High School teammate who now plays basketball at Shelton State Community College .
The payoff was wearing the helmet on Monday .
When McClain wages a battle in the real game , it would take guts to wager against him .
He 's lean , he 's mean , and he's as serious about football as anyone could be .
Lean ?
The program says he 's 6 - foot - 4 and weighs 258 pounds .
Does he really weigh 258 ?
" Yep , " he said , seemingly offended that someone would ask .
Then his percentage of body fat must be extraordinarily low .
" Nine percent , I think , " he said .
" That was about a month ago . "
And his time in the 40 - yard dash ?
" This summer , I ran a 4.59 and a 4.63 , " he said .
Size .
Speed .
Power .
Strength .
Do n't forget intelligence .
That 's always the quality that Alabama coach Nick Saban mentions first .
So which of these gifts makes McClain special ?
What makes the introspective middle linebacker an All - American ?
What makes NFL scouts and executives count the days until next spring , when they expect the junior to turn pro ?
" It 's a little bit of everything , " McClain said .
" A lot of guys have size .
A lot of guys have speed .
When you put it all together and you can watch film and dissect plays and know what plays they run out of each formation , it makes you a lot better . "
But when he watches film of himself , he is not impressed .
" I do n't go , ` Wow , ' " he said .
" I expect myself to make plays .
Sometimes I do n't see how I made some plays , how I got off this block .
I 've just got to give all the credit to Coach Saban .
He 's made me what I am .
He 's pushed me to be a better player . "
Saban knows he has more than an exceptionally talented player .
He has a leader .
" He is very smart , " Saban said .
" He has got great knowledge and understanding of football .
He 's got great knowledge and understanding of what we do .
" He does a great job of implementing it in a game , in terms of his performance as well as the leadership that he provides for others . "
McClain , Saban added , " usually plays his best in the biggest games .
That is always something you like to see in great players . "
A big game is days away .
At 2:30 p.m. Saturday , the third - ranked Crimson Tide ( 5 - 0 , 2 - 0 in the Southeastern Conference ) visits 20th - ranked Ole Miss ( 3 - 1 , 1 - 1 ) in a game that will be televised nationally by CBS .
Ole Miss coach Houston
Nutt gushes about the star of the nation 's second - ranked defense .
" Rolando McClain : 6 - foot - 4 - and - a- quarter , 260 pounds , " Nutt said .
" And as fast as he wants to be .
He gets to the ball carrier and he arrives in a bad mood every time I see him .
...
You feel like he 's the heartbeat of their team .
Brings a lot of energy .
But you do n't see anybody blocking him .
He stays unblocked , refuses to get blocked and he goes and makes the play . "
Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy gushes about his teammate .
" Week in , week out , the best linebacker we go against is No. 25 on our team , " McElroy said .
" He does such a great job of getting players in position .
He does a great job of encouraging guys .
He 's a fantastic leader .
He does so many things that go unseen . "
No matter how good McClain is , he burns with a desire to be better .
He had a good game Saturday at Kentucky .
With 12 tackles ( eight solo ) , an interception and a forced fumble that was returned for a decisive touchdown , he earned SEC defensive player of the week honors .
Kentucky coach Rich Brooks called him a " man-child . "
" I expect myself to make good plays , " McClain said .
" When I watched film yesterday of the game , the interception and all that , I looked over it , but I looked at the two tackles that I missed and the two mental errors that I had , and I just beat myself up about it . "
It makes for an interesting relationship between a perfectionist player and a perfectionist coach .
" When I first got in , he would always yell at me , like the first week or so , " McClain said of Saban .
" And then he just stopped .
I mean , I did n't understand why .
" Then he took me into his office and he talked to me .
He 's like , ` It 's hard for me to yell at you . '
I was like , ` Why ? '
" Because I beat myself up so bad when I make a mistake , I 'm on myself worse than he can . "
It seems like a foregone conclusion that McClain will not return for his senior year .
But McClain wo n't acknowledge the speculation .
" That ain't something I 'm really worried about , really , " he said .
" I do n't even really care about it .
I ai n't thinking about it . "
A minute later , he was out of the room and off to prepare .
His Viking helmet was back on his head , but his game face was back in place .
As authorities reported flood - related deaths had climbed to nine and scores of roads and portions of some highways remained closed , Gov. Sonny Perdue asked President Barack Obama to declare a federal state of emergency .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency was reviewing the request Tuesday , and Georgia ’s congressional delegation contacted the White House and emergency officials , urging them to hustle .
There they go again : asking the Government to hustle .
In case you did not know it , the Georgia Congressional delegation includes stalwarts such as Rep Tom Price , through whose district runs the swollen Sope Creek and the Chattahoochee rivers .
Now , here is how you can help :
Please call Rep Price and tell him to stand fast to his principles of no Government intrusions in our personal lives .
Remind him of how steadfastly he shares your belief that the Government is never the answer .
Also , we are looking for some volunteers to go into Douglas County and tell the homeowners in the area that they should fix their flooded homes themseleves .
After all , no one gave Midas Mulligan a helping hand when he was acquiring that wonderful place in Colorado .
Please remember to picket the fire department to remind people that they are depending on a ' Government service ' to show up in boats to help them leave their flooded homes .
Ideally , in a free market economy , the market should determine what it is worth to you to be saved by a boat .
Also feel free to hold seminars in the affected areas and remind folks who are taking shelter in churches that the ' Church , I think , will stand .
They will need it ' as Franciso D Anconia so eloquently reminded the folks in South America .
And if they decide they do n't like your message and want to hurt you , save yourselves with your god given right to carry guns .
Just do n't expect the Government funded cops to come to your help .
Oh , and one more thing : if you lost your home to the floods but you also are a follower of Boortz , Beck et al , do the right thing and decline all federal and state aid - like you urged your governor to decline stimulus funds .
Thank you for your kind attention .
UPDATED - fixed some typos as suggested by kind commenters .
And , by the way , Price is my Congressman and I have a full ringside view of the disaster .
Thankfully our home was not affected but many of my friends are .
The community is pulling together , as it always does and we are all helping .
Hart , David Bentley , Atheist Delusions , Yale University Press , London / New Haven , CT £ 19.99 Hardback : ISBN 978-0-300-11190-3
Review by Matthew Feldman , University of Northampton
The battle has finally been joined .
For Atheist Delusions is the frontal counter - attack that intelligent persons of faith have been long awaiting .
Poor arguments against belief are simply swatted away ( e.g. “ the truth is that religion and irreligion are cultural variables , but killing is a human constant ” , 13 ) .
But the main target of attack is the “ New Atheism ” , particularly those ‘ devoutly undevout ’ academics evangelizing what David Bentley Hart calls ‘ the Gospel of unbelief ’ .
Hart is certainly not alone in his criticism – even if he goes further than most , to the extent that his hyperventilating apologia for Christian humanism might leave more mild - mannered readers somewhat uncomfortable .
A taste of his assault on a group he dubs ‘ manifestly moral idiots ’ is enough to make one blanch ; extending to the ‘ extravagantly callow ’ Sam Harris ( The End of Faith ) and the ‘ borderline illiterate ’ Dan Brown ( The Da Vinci Code ) ; to the ‘ intellectual caricature[s ] ’ and failure of ‘ consecutive logic ’ by Christopher Hitchens ( God is not Great ) ; let alone Hart ’s disdain for the High Priest of Atheism , Richard Dawkins ( The God Delusion ) , that ‘ tireless tractarian ’ with ‘ an incapacity for philosophical reasoning ’ ( 236 , 3 - 4 ) .
Clearly unwilling to suffer those he considers fools ,
Hart ’s book also , unusually and significantly , demands of readers a choice : there are either materialistic truths bereft of any metaphysical Truth , or Truth is but partly served by the Heideggerian techne of modern science and its ideological shock - troops .
Fence - sitting is not allowed here any more than in books by Hart ’s antagonists .
In sum , this is a post - secular ( to use Charles Taylor ’s term ) apologia by a believer in both the faith and superior values underwriting nearly two millennia of a “ Christian interruption ” in Europe .
And this Christian epoch , for Hart , effectively book - ended between the Desert Fathers and Friedrich Nietzsche , is proudly characterized here as precisely the ‘ slave morality ’ famously decried by the latter .
Yet contra Nietzsche ’s withering attack against humanism , argues Atheist Delusions , there is an intolerance in Christianity that is thoroughly unbourgeious and deeply unmodern ( and for Hart , therefore , positively against contemporary “ nihilism ” ) .
For Christians , in short , not all is permissible : “ pagan religious culture was immeasurably more ‘ tolerant ’ than Christianity ever was – indeed , it could tolerate just about anything ” ( 120 ) .
And the pagans of late modernity , Hart suggests , can themselves tolerate just about anything but canonical doctrines .
It is here that Hart elides his dual , overlapping narratives : of the 4th century Roman Empire under religious attack from within , and of a 21st century that Hart fears is heading in the opposite direction ; namely ; regressing toward a kind of ‘ learned barbarism ’ .
Only now , posits Hart , has Christianity ’s Faustian pact with temporal power fully come home to roost .
If Christianity ’s greatest triumph was via Constantine ’s conversion in 313 , and more symbolically Theodosius ’ submission to Bishop Ambrose ’s authority in 390 , it was simultaneously “ the Christian revolution ’s greatest defeat ” : political power .
With the wholesale divestment in earthly power now obvious for all to see , Atheist Delusions is not itself deluded about the threatened future for organized religion .
But Hart ’s point throughout is different .
Losing the Christian morality underpinning ‘ Western ’ civilization is also fraught with danger , potentially leading to “ a fairly unsentimental calculus of utility ” when it comes to the value of human life ( 237 ) .
And wherever one stands on this prickliest of issues , Atheist Delusions should be welcomed enthusiastically , for opposing ‘ sides ’ now have their ammunition .
The remainder of this review shall draw attention to a phenomenon situated firmly in a no - man ’s land ’ that I feel neither Hart nor his opponents have properly grasped ; namely , the concept of ‘ political religion ’ .
For the former , this is merely secularism masquerading as an extreme ideology ; and for the latter , it is yet another manifestation of a monotheistic faith that has sacralized a form of totalitarian rule .
Ironically enough , the charge of “ atheism ” levelled at early Christians by the polytheists ( noted across Hart ’s account ) is quite analogous to his own dismissal of political religions as a convoluted form of modern atheism ( cf. 14ff ) .
In short , is ‘ political religion ’ a bastardized form of religion , or an intolerant offshoot of secularism ?
Correspondingly , are the political religions of the last hundred years a pox on the position of Christians or New Atheists – to use the dialectic favoured by Atheist Delusions – or more widely , of non-believers or all persons of faith ?
To see the glass as half - full , the opposing camps on ‘ religion ’ are together partially right .
Political religions , as understood in current scholarship , are neither orthodox religions per se , nor simply a manifestation of secular modernity .
It is both and neither : these are utopian , faith - based doctrines , fuelled by a demonization of otherness in the creation of an earthly Shangri - La .
In a way , ‘ political religions ’ are to monotheism what polytheism was to early Christianity : an enormous obstacle meriting only conquest , or better , erasure by appropriation ( think of the mapping of Christmas on the pre-existing pagan festival of Saturnalia ) .
As Hart puts it regarding the Christian takeover of the pagan Roman Empire : “ The old and new faiths represented two essentially incompatible versions of sacred order and of the human good . ”
Yet just like the revolution wrought by fourth century Christianity forming the core of Hart ’s argument , the 20th century political religions , too , touted “ the invention of an entirely new universe of human possibilities , moral , social , intellectual , cultural and political ” ( 134 ) .
As Emilio Gentile , for one , has repeatedly shown in exhaustive detail , this more recent and disastrous ‘ revolution of faith ’ struck observers with the same force as early Christianity ’s heresies struck its pagan critics .
But political religions are not just an updated paganism which , like modern spiritualism , permits all but the doctrinaire .
If hostile to traditional forms of monotheism , political religions nevertheless usurped these aesthetics in order to draw upon the affective power of an all - encompassing system of secular faith : totalitarianism .
For this way of doing politics , value was stripped from the individual , now become a cell in a larger body of her or his sacralized racial , class or national group .
The political religions of Mao , Stalin , Hilter and Mussolini were thus not religious in any supernatural sense .
This was the deification of the secular .
Importantly – since many seem to fudge this critical point – political religion is therefore not as a metaphor but an actual replacement , or ersatz , religion in its own terms .
If one accepts Emilie Durkheim ’s conception of religions through their phenomenological , concrete manifestations in the world – that is , how initiates act within communities of belief , and how such these functionally employ religion to provide meaning to everyday life ( leaving open the question of manipulation from above or natural occurrence from below ) – political religions are not like , or similar to , monotheistic religions .
Instead , they are precisely these monotheistic religions in modern purple , simply shorn of otherworldly expectation .
Redemption came to be fulfilled by other , far more intolerant and voluntaristic programs .
And in the end , true believers were no less religious extremists than that inverse form of ‘ sacralized politics ’ , religious fundamentalism – even if this ‘ mission ’ was to eliminate the Church ’s influence , as in the Soviet Union .
Finally , in terms of the legacy , or perseverance , of Christian humanism , the stakes riding on interpretations of political religion are high in debates over faith .
Between the totalitarian ‘ political religions ’ of the 20th century – notably Pol Pot ’s Cambodia , Mussolini ’s Italy , Hitler ’s Germany , as well as communist North Korea , China and the USSR – more than 100 million people were violently murdered since 1917 alone ; through starvation , overwork , neglect , experimentation , systematic extermination … the list is as long as the noir imagination .
This was not traditional religion at work , whatever its pasts might suggest .
Nor were these enormous projects of human engineering secular in any conventional use of the term .
Political religions , rather , are a hybrid .
They draw upon religious impulses , signs and behaviour , but do so to realize secular aims .
That this should uncomfortably veer into the post - humanistic horrors of totalitarianism – which both believers and non-believers ought to recognize as a part of ‘ their ’ respective narratives – can be brought home by citing two representative accounts from those notorious ‘ totalitarianisms in comparison ’ , Nazism and Stalinism :
I could not believe that Germany would lose the war until I saw a tank in front of my door .
In the terrible spring of 1933 I saw people dying from hunger .
I saw women and children with distended bellies , turning blue , still breathing but with vacant and lifeless eyes ….
I saw this and did not go out of my mind or commit suicide .
Nor did I curse those who had sent me out to take away the peasants ’ grain in the winter , and in the spring to persuade the barely walking , skeleton - thin or sickly - swollen people to go into the field in order to “ fulfil the Bolshevik sowing plan in shock - worker style . ”
Nor did I lose my faith .
As before , I believed because I wanted to believe .
( Cited in Life and Death in Nazi Germany , p. 179 ; and Dictatorship of the Air , p.193 . )
I am going to make an argument I do n’t see much .
Reading the pros and cons on this subject is a bit like watching a pea roll around on a plate .
My goal is to stick a fork in that pea and focus on something very fundamental .
The point I will make is that one can say with high confidence bordering on certainty that only a predominantly local food system will ever be sustainable .
Books , blogs , and articles about local foods have been popping up with high frequency recently .
I am not going to get into who ’s involved or even what they are discussing in any detail , but instead refer readers here , here , and here for background .
Or if you want to stick to The Oil Drum , similar discussions occurred here a couple years ago .
What I mean by sustainable is the ability to endure .
Quite simply and irrefutably I conclude that the current globalized food system is a flash in the frying pan because it does n’t respect the first law of thermodynamics .
Whatever other argument you might want to make against the global and for the local ( and several legitimate ones come to mind ) this fatal flaw is insurmountable .
No quibbles , qualification or value judgments need to get in the way of this basic fact .
The Linearity Problem
The first law of thermodynamics is that matter and energy are never created nor destroyed , they only change form .
The forms of matter and energy in the human body come from food , which primarily comes from soils .
When plants and fungi occupy soil and grow , they ingest atoms in simple or mineralized forms and incorporate them into organic forms .
This process essentially mines soils at an atomic scale .
The concentration of people into urban centers requires shipment of food far away from agricultural lands .
Soils , therefore , are constantly depleted of nutrients .
Currently , these nutrients are replaced by adding soil amendments and fertilizers that themselves derive from mining operations .
In the same way that oil fields deplete , so do the mines that support current agricultural practices , whether based on man-made chemicals or imported organics , such as bat guano from Chile .
In essence , the food system is predominantly a linear chain from mine to soil to food to plate to bodies and excretions to the treatment plants to the water ways and land fills and to the oceans .
Fig .
1 . The linear flow of minerals from mines to farms and then dense human settlements leads to depletion at one end , and the concentration of wastes or dispersion into water at the other .
Graphic from Folke Günther
Because we can’t create matter out of thin air to replace these depleting resources ( First Law ) the system is unsustainable .
To make it potentially sustainable we ’d have to take the waste outputs and make them inputs again to yield a cyclical food system .
Transportation Constraints
A sustainable system must be primarily local because of energetic and logistical constraints .
What is removed from a plot of land needs to be returned .
Okay , not the exact atoms , but roughly the same kinds atoms in the original quantities and proportions .
This line of thinking has led me to a very important question :
What is the average mineral composition of human urine and feces ?
My search has not been exhaustive , but I did come across two fairly recent publications that both reference a 1956 study by the World Health Organization .
One of these , The Humanure Handbook is available online or in many bookstores .
The other is a booklet published by Ecology Action titled affirmatively , “ Future Fertility : Transforming Human Waste in Human Wealth . ”
Here ’s a table from those sources , which are really one .
Table .
1 . Mineral composition of human waste in pounds per year .
A classic composting method is to combine animal manure and urine with mature crop residues , usually straw .
When mixed appropriately , this combination has an ideal ratio of carbon to nitrogen ( C:N ) leading to the formation of quality finished compost .
Straw also includes various transformed soil nutrients , so the final product is nearly a perfectly balanced source of soil replenishment , which is what you ’d expect given the First Law .
Let ’s put our mind in the toilet for a moment .
What is going to be the best strategy for taking the contents of that porcelain bowl and mixing them with straw ?
Should the straw be brought to every home ?
Should it go to the municipal treatment plant ?
Or perhaps the straw should stay on the farm with the “ precious cargo ” shipped from city to country ?
Fig .
2 . Some of Fido 's best ideas arise during moments like this .
Right now he is thinking about all the plastic baggies that pick up his " deposits " in the neighborhood .
Should n't that stuff get back to the farm , somehow ?
Would life be better as a country dog ?
Folke Günther
These questions may amuse and be largely ignored , but they are completely fundamental .
One of the few people I know of who studies this issue is the systems ecologist , Folke Günther .
His website provides more up to date calculations for human waste , and he even uses the metric system !
To simplify the subject a bit , he focuses on phosphorus .
The reasoning is straightforward -- it is ten times more concentrated in the human body than in the Earth ’s crust and therefore the most limiting nutrient in most locations .
Essentially , if phosphorus can be reclaimed effectively so can everything else .
Fig .
3 . Günther ’s model of the phosphorus cycle in a balanced agricultural system with exports of food being returned to the land in the form of processed human waste .
In Günther ’s writings and presentations on the requirements for sustainable cycling of nutrients , he suggests that the population of rural areas needs to be about twelve times larger than urban areas .
He gives a scenario where ruralisation occurs in a region over 50 years based on the normal turnover rate of infrastructure — essentially as urban centers decay they are not rebuilt and investments in housing and other infrastructure are made instead in the adjacent hinterlands .
Furthermore , assuming a rise in transportation costs , he also shows that a rural economy based on local food and energy weathers oil depletion well , in contrast to a city that must import basic needs .
I find these concepts obvious .
I think a child can understand the basic premise operating here :
If you take and do n’t give back , it runs out .
The implications , on the other hand , are stunning .
Will the migration to the cities , a demographic phenomenon that has gone on for so many decades , be necessarily reversed in the 21st century ?
If so , is it even remotely possible that this might happen in a thoughtful way as envisioned by Günther ?
And of course ruralisation in a region like Las Vegas is impossible .
Historic Model : China and Village Ecosystems
This topic has not gone unexplored on The Oil Drum .
Phil Harris described the essentially local and long - term persistence of agrarian village ecosystems , especially in China .
I have heard stories about farmers in China competing for humanure by building comfortable and decorative outhouses along roadside borders of their land .
Please send pictures of these if you come across any of them .
I am looking for some design ideas for the future .

Tags : Deportation
Australia has a long history of brutalising refugees .
Rudd Labor is continuing that tradition .
It has deported a number of Sri Lankan refugees in recent days , including some forcibly .
Sri Lanka is a hell hole .
The Sinhalese Government there , after defeating the Tamil Tigers , is committing genocide against the civilian Tamil population .
According to Josh Lees in Governments applaud massacre of Tamils in May ’s Socialist Alternative :
The Sri Lankan government has a lot to hide .
Around 300,000
Tamils are being held in concentration camps where they face torture , rape , starvation and constant “ disappearances ” .
In the first four months of this year , at least 20,000 people were killed .
Access to the killing fields continues to be denied , but UN documents obtained by The Times suggest that a further 20,000 were killed in the last three weeks of the conflict .
So people have fled the fighting or the consequences of that fighting , such as the concentration camps .
A society which conducts genocide against part of its own people is not fit to live in .
So it is not surprising that Sinhalese as well as Tamils are among those fleeing Sri Lanka .
There is a precedent for this disgusting treatment of refugees .
According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum :
The sudden flood of [ Jewish ] emigrants created a major refugee crisis .
President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened a conference in Evian , France , in July 1938 .
Despite the participation of delegates from 32 countries , including the United States , Great Britain , France , Canada , and Australia , only the Dominican Republic agreed to accept additional refugees .
The plight of German - Jewish refugees , persecuted at home and unwanted abroad , is also illustrated by the voyage of the “ St. Louis . ”
At the Evian Conference the Australian representative T H White , the Minister for Trade and Customs in the Lyons Government , said ‘ that as we have no racial problem , we are not desirous of importing one . ’
It is an approach whose undercurrents inform the debate today and in the recent past .
Howard ’s immigration policies were all predicated on a strong Australian capitalism rejecting those fleeing the destruction imperialism unleashes , and appealing to the ‘ crimson thread ’ of racism that defines it .
Rudd ’s actions show he continues those policies .
Politicians on both sides of the capitalist divide think there are votes in bashing refugees .
And so , as the election comes into distant view , and the number of refugees fleeing poverty and war in places like Sri Lanka , Somalia , Afghanistan and Iraq increases , Rudd Labor toughens its stance against refugees .
Repelling refugees is something that flows from the very way capitalist production works , with competing blocs of capital organised in nation states , even in a globalised world .
In fact globalisation makes a strong home state for capital , one prepared to extend its rule militarily as well as economically , even more important than ever .
It also reinforces the alienation we experience from each other through the theft of the products of our labour , and the effect this produces of fear of the other .
But the very act of socialising production creates the class capable of destroying borders and allowing labour to flow around the world as freely as capital does today .
The Australian newspaper is claiming that ‘ ASIO could be set to issue adverse security assessments against some Sri Lankans already in detention ’ .
This is shadowy , rumour filled muck designed to deliberately link Tamils to terrorism without a shred of evidence and with the clear goal of influencing public feeling against Sri Lankan and indeed , all , refugees .
The Australian then quotes the Sri Lankan High Commissioner who warns against infiltration of Tamil Tiger fighters into Australia .
The Tamil Tigers are not a proscribed organisation here .
This type of reporting is being used to justify sending back refugees on the grounds of terrorism , when in fact the real terrorist is the Sri Lankan Government .
We are also sending a number of Sinhalese back as ‘ economic refugees ’ .
This is a catch all used to justify deporting refugees to a sick society like Sri Lanka .
First , there is a brutal genocidal Government in power in Sri Lanka .
Fleeing that barbarity for a better life makes perfect sense and we should welcome any refugees from that country .
Second , the imperialist powers have created these hellhole conditions or been the midwives to their birth .
It is no accident that the intervention of Western imperialism , either directly or indirectly , in places like Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia and Sri Lanka has created a flood of would be settlers in the West .
Rather than rejecting them , we should welcome all those fleeing the hellholes we have created or helped create .
Ford Motor Company says as many as one in four cars it sells by 2020 will be electrified .
The company says giving more vehicles electric motors and big batteries is needed to meet tightening fuel economy standards and ease emissions , while providing consumers with cars they want to drive .
" By 2020 , between 10 percent and 25 percent of the fleet will be electrified , " said Nancy Gioia , head of Ford 's EV program .
Ford is serious enough about cars with cords that it has named Gioia , who started with the company in 1982 as a trainee in the electronics division , global director of vehicle electrification .
She 's shooting for an ambitious target , considering hybrids currently comprise about 3 percent of the market .
But that market is expected to grow , and Ford says vehicles like the Fusion Hybrid will be the bulk of its electrified fleet for the foreseeable future .
" The hybrid will dominate that market through 2020 , " Gioia told Wired.com .
But Ford is hard at work on an electric delivery van slated for next year , an electric car we 'll see in 2011 and a plug - in hybrid we 'll see the year after that .
Hybrids and EVs are but one part of CEO Alan Mulally 's push to increase the efficiency of Ford 's entire lineup .
The centerpiece is Ford 's EcoBoost engines , which the company says deliver 20 percent more fuel economy and 15 percent less pollution than comparable engines with no loss in performance .
Ford plans to offer the turbocharged direct - injection engines in 90 percent of its vehicles by 2013 .
Other tech slated for the showroom includes dual - clutch transmissions , electric power steering and increased use of aluminum , magnesium and high - strength steel to cut the weight of every vehicle by 250 to 750 pounds .
" We are focusing on sustainable technology solutions that can be used not for hundreds or thousands of cars , but for millions of cars , " Mulally said .
Gioia says hybrids , plug - in hybrids and electric vehicles will play an increasingly vital role in the push toward more environmentally friendly motoring .
Ford brought a prototype of its Focus EV to San Francisco and let us take it for a spin downtown .
It was utterly unremarkable , save for the excellent torque , but then that 's the point .
Ford wants the Focus EV to be largely indistinguishable from the gasoline version .
" The Focus is the DNA , " said Steve Daleiden , Ford 's powertrain system engineering leader .
" The Focus is the benchmark . "
As such , the car is n't terribly quick – Daleiden says the goal is a zero to 60 time in the nine - to 10 - second range – but it was peppy in traffic .
Daleiden would n't offer any performance or technical specs but said Ford is shooting for a range of 100 miles from a 23 - kilowatt - hour lithium ion battery .
" We 're pretty sure we can get there , " he said .
The prototype has a range of about 80 miles and needs 10 to 16 hours to recharge at 110 volts , and about half that at 220 .
Ford is keeping mum on who 's supplying the batteries , but the drivetrain has been developed with a lot of help from Magna International , one of the world 's leading automotive engineering and component suppliers .
" I 'd say the prototype is about 60 percent of what we 'll see in production , " Daleiden said .
" There is a significant amount of engineering work to be done . "
There 's no word yet on just what the car will look like – those cool Focus EVs you 've seen on The Jay Leno Show are prototypes based on the European - spec Focus .
But it will be built on Ford 's global C platform , the chassis underpinning the Focus , C - Max and Transit Connect vehicles .
Ford has the capacity to crank out as many as 2 million C - platform vehicles annually , but Daleiden says EVs will comprise a fraction of that .
" We 're looking at 5,000 to 10,000 vehicles a year to start , " he said .
" We 'll see what the demand is and go from there . "
No word yet on the price , but Gioia says the goal is to make it " affordable " because " this is not about a small niche .
This is about affordable transportation for the masses . "
Ford plans to roll out 15 prototypes in London next year to begin testing the cars and their charging stations .
The tests mirror those currently underway in the United States , where the Department of Energy , the Electric Power Research Institute , Southern California Edison and 10 other utilities are testing a fleet of 20 Ford Escape plug - in hybrids .
Ford says the vehicles have logged more than 75,000 miles during the past two years .
The vehicles are helping everyone involved study battery technology , system integration , customer vehicle usage and charging patterns , as well as grid infrastructure .
Ah , the grid .
Mark Duvall , director Electric Power Research Institute , says 10 million electric vehicles would need less than 1 percent of the juice generated in the United States .
Each of those cars would draw about 700 watts , he said .
" Three plasma TVs , in one year , use about as much power as a Ford Escape plug - in hybrid , " he said .
That said , the grid may need improvements at the local level – new transformers , for example , or overhauled substations – to handle a big influx of electrified vehicles , he said .
" But there 's a near - term investment that leads to a long - term benefit , " he said .
The benefits include a more efficient generation system with greater integration of renewable energy sources and reduced need for new peaker plants , which run only at times of high demand .
Jon Wellinghoff , chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , says utilities could even reimburse owners for the battery storage offered when the cars are plugged in .
More important , Duvall said , is making sure the cars can communicate with the grid .
That will allow the cars to charge themselves at optimal times , minimizing the impact on the grid and avoiding peak times .
Ford already is developing a system by which its electric cars can communicate with the grid called V2G technology and says it could be ready by 2013 .

Ford got a big assist from Magna International , which developed much of the electric drivetrain in the Focus prototype .
We 'd love to give you the tech specs , but Ford 's keeping mum for now .
The prototype sports a pair of lithium - ion packs that together produce 23 kilowatts - hours .
Ford says splitting the pack allows it to more effectively distribute the weight , an important consideration given the two packs weigh a total of 700 pounds .
This car is a prototype , and the air - cooled packed in the production model will be more neatly integrated into the vehicle .
Thursday is a big day for Windows users .
Microsoft is finally making Windows 7 publicly available , and the number of pre-orders for the operating system on Amazon.com has already surpassed orders for Harry Potter in the U.K .
Not bad for an operating system that costs $ 120 and does n't even have any magic wands or dragons in it .
That 's a good indicator that a lot of people are upgrading , and we 're sure there will be even more that follow after consumers spread the word about the vast improvements in Windows 7 over its predecessors .
Here 's a simple guideline of what you should know to ensure your upgrade process is smooth — from purchase to install .
Read Wired 's review : Lucky No. 7 Is Microsoft's Best Windows Yet1 .
You should get this upgrade
We 've written about Windows 7 's strong points as well as its weaker points .
On balance , we 're confident saying this is the best Microsoft operating system yet .
If you 're running any earlier version of Windows , you 'll almost certainly want to upgrade — and you should feel no hesitation about buying new computers preloaded with Windows 7 .
2 . But you 'll have to pay for it
Apple offers an upgrade to its latest operating system , Snow Leopard , for $ 30 — and you can even take advantage of it if you do n't have the previous version , Leopard .
Not so with Microsoft :
You 'll need to pay $ 120 for the upgrade — or even more , depending on which version you get .
( Unless you 're a smart shopper and can find a discounted price .
See tips 6 and 7 below for details on which version to buy and how to find discounts . )
As with previous versions of Windows , Microsoft has created a bewildering array of variations .
3. Double - check compatibility with your hardware
Paranoid about losing access to some of your third - party accessories and software after upgrading ?
You should be , at least a little bit .
Microsoft claims Windows 7 will work smoothly with most third - party gadgets and software , but to be on the safe side , you should check out the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor .
The tool automatically scans your system and provides a report of any potential issues , as well as steps to resolve them .
4. Scout for computers shipping with Windows 7
If you 've been shopping for a new computer — but waiting for Windows 7 to come out first — there 's a Microsoft tool to help search for new computers that ship with Windows 7 .
It 's called PC Scout , and it searches for computers based on your preferences .
As of this writing , the results do n't bring up Windows 7 systems ( since Windows 7 is n't officially released yet ) , but the website clarifies that all the computers listed in the database are eligible for a Windows 7 upgrade .
That means if you purchase one of those computers today , all you have to pay is $ 10 for shipping , and you get the Windows 7 upgrade free .
By the time Windows 7 ships , the PC Scout should be showing results for computers that include Windows 7 .
Amazon customers shopping for Windows 7 computers :
There 's a web page just for you .
Amazon breaks down a list of netbooks , notebooks and desktops shipping with Windows 7 , so definitely check those out .
5. Upgrading from XP ?
Back up your data , wipe and migrate
Windows XP users cannot do a straight upgrade ; they 'll have to back up their files , format their hard drive and perform a clean install .
After your fresh copy of Windows 7 is on your computer , Microsoft offers a tool called Easy Transfer to migrate your files .
( If you 're a Vista user , you 'll be able to upgrade without doing a clean install — though fresh installations are generally recommended for optimal performance anyway whenever you switch to a new operating system . )
6 . Know what you want
Disregard the awful , intimidating Windows 7 upgrade chart when you 're picking a version to buy .
Choosing the right version really is n't as complicated as Microsoft has made it sound in the past .
Consumers :
The vast majority of you should go with Windows 7 Home Premium .
Business users :
Most of you will want to go with Windows 7 Professional .
( There 's a Windows 7 Ultimate edition , but that 's aimed at a very niche audience of ultra geeks who want to do everything they could possibly imagine doing with their computers . )
Again , if you want to be safe , use the Upgrade Advisor to check your hardware and software compatibility .
7 . Look for limited - time discounts
If you 're buying Windows 7 while it 's brand new , you should n't be paying the full price .
Microsoft and its partners are holding a weeklong sale called " 7 Days of Windows 7 . "
Companies offering Windows 7 discounts with Microsoft include Best Buy , Dell and Acer .
You can sign up to hear about daily offers on Windows.com .
Also , you can check discount - aggregation sites such as PriceGrabber.com or Froogle.com to find the cheapest Windows 7 deals .

Sumatran rainforest , 1986 : The fastest rate of deforestation in Indonesia is occurring in central Sumatra ’s Riau province , where some 4.2 m hectares ( 65 % ) of its tropical forests and peat swamps have been cleared for industrial plantations in the past 25 years .
Under the Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation ( Redd ) scheme $ 30 bn a year could be transferred from rich countries to the owners of endangered forests .
But experts on all sides of the debate - from international police to politicians to conservationists - warned that the scheme may be impossible to monitor and may already be leading to fraud
ejabberd is one of the most well know erlang application and the one I learnt erlang with .
I think it 's the one of most interesting project for learning erlang because it is really building on erlang 's strength .
( However some will argue that it 's not OTP , but do n't worry there 's still a trove of great code inside ... )
Why ?
An XMPP server ( like ejabberd ) can be seen as a high level router , routing messages between end users .
Of course there are other features , but this is the most important aspect of an instant messaging server .
It has to route many messages simultaneously , and handle many a lot of TCP / IP connections .
So we have 2 features :
handle many connections
route messages given some aspects of the message
These are examples where erlang shines .
handle many connections
It is very easy to build scalable non-blocking TCP / IP servers with erlang .
In fact , it was designed to solve this problem .
And given it can spawn hundreds of thousand of processes ( and not threads , it 's a share - nothing approach , which is simpler to design ) , ejabberd is designed as a set of erlang processes ( which can be distributed over several servers ) :
client connection process
router process
chatroom process
server to server processes
All of them exchanging messages .
route messages given some aspects of the message
Another very lovable feature of erlang is pattern matching .
It is used throughout the language .
For instance , in the following :
access ( moderator , _ Config ) -> rw ; access ( participant , _ Config ) -> rw ; access ( visitor , # config{type= " public " } ) -> r ; access ( visitor , # config{type= " public_rw " } ) -> rw ; access ( _User , _Config ) -> none .
That 's 5 different versions of the access function .
Erlang will select the most appropriate version given the arguments received .
( Config is a structure of type # config which has a type attribute ) .
That means it is very easy and much clearer than chaining if / else or switch / case to make business rules .
To wrap up
Writing scalable servers , that 's the whole point of erlang .
Everything is designed it making this easy .
On the two previous features , I 'd add :
hot code upgrade
mnesia , distributed relational database ( included in the base distribution )
, distributed relational database ( included in the base distribution ) mochiweb , on which most http erlang servers are built on
, on which most http erlang servers are built on binary support ( decoding and encoding binary protocol easy as ever )
a great community with great open source projects ( ejabberd , couchdb but also webmachine , riak and a slew of library very easy to embed )
Fewer LOCs
There is also this article from Richard Jones .
He rewrote an application from C++ to erlang : 75 % fewer lines in erlang .

Japan readies first mission to Venus for 2010 launch
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : October 24 , 2009
Japan has christened its next deep space mission Akatsuki , meaning dawn in English , a half - year before the spacecraft is dispatched toward Venus to analyze the planet 's smothering atmosphere .

The name Akatsuki was selected because Venus shines brightly as the morning star just before sunrise , according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency .
The mission was previously named Planet C and is Japan 's first spacecraft to be sent to Venus .
The 1,058 - pound robotic probe will launch aboard an H - 2A rocket from Japan 's Tanegashima spaceport around May 20 , 2010 .
If Akatsuki departs Earth in May or June , the spacecraft will arrive at Venus in December 2010 .
The satellite has spent the summer in comprehensive performance testing before it is shipped to Tanegashima this winter .
Akatsuki will be Japan 's second interplanetary mission after the Nozomi spacecraft that twice missed entering orbit around Mars after launching in 1998 .
The Venus orbiter also closely follows JAXA 's first lunar probe , Kaguya , and the maiden flight of the HTV cargo ship for the International Space Station .
After its six - month cruise through space , Akatsuki will enter an equatorial orbit around Venus stretching from just above the planet 's blanketing atmosphere to an altitude of nearly 50,000 miles .
Six experiments will allow Akatsuki , also called Venus Climate Orbiter , to peer deep into the planet 's atmosphere and even study surface activity .
The Venusian carbon dioxide atmosphere causes a runaway greenhouse effect that drives surface temperatures to about 860 degrees Fahrenheit .
Cloud formations in the atmosphere swirl around the planet at speeds of up to 250 mph .
Scientists want to know more about the mechanics of such a world , and Akatsuki will help Japanese researchers answer those questions .
Akatsuki 's sensor package includes two infrared cameras to observe lower level clouds and collect data on potential active volcanoes .
A longwave infrared instrument and ultraviolet imager will look at cloud tops and track global storm systems to produce wind maps .
A lightning and airglow camera will take pictures of the night side of Venus .
The sixth investigation is a radio science experiment to derive vertical temperature and vapor density profiles of the atmosphere .
This data will be produced on the ground based on the atmosphere 's effects on radio signals received from the spacecraft .
JAXA describes Akatsuki as the first interplanetary weather satellite .
Akatsuki will operate for at least two Earth years , and scientists hope the Japanese mission will arrive in time to work with Europe 's Venus Express probe already at the planet .
Venus Express is in an extended mission through December 2012 after beginning its mission at Venus in April 2006 .
If Akatsuki makes it to its destination while Venus Express is still active , it would be the first time since 1992 that two spacecraft operated simultaneously in orbit around Venus .
Let us take a trip back into history .
Not ancient history .
Recent history .
It is the winter of 2007 .
The presidential primaries are approaching .
The talk jocks like Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity and the rest are over the moon about Fred Thompson .
They ’re weak at the knees at the thought of Mitt Romney .
Meanwhile , they are hurling torrents of abuse at the unreliable deviationists : John McCain and Mike Huckabee .
Yet somehow , despite the fervor of the great microphone giants , the Thompson campaign flops like a fish .
Despite the schoolgirl delight from the radio studios , the Romney campaign underperforms .
Meanwhile , Huckabee surges .
Limbaugh attacks him , but social conservatives flock .
Along comes New Hampshire and McCain wins !
Republican voters have not heeded their masters in the media .
Before long , South Carolina looms as the crucial point of the race .
The contest is effectively between Romney and McCain .
The talk jocks are now in spittle - flecked furor .
Day after day , whole programs are dedicated to hurling abuse at McCain and everybody ever associated with him .
The jocks are threatening to unleash their angry millions .
Yet the imaginary armies do not materialize .
McCain wins the South Carolina primary and goes on to win the nomination .
The talk jocks ca n’t even deliver the conservative voters who show up at Republican primaries .
They ca n’t even deliver South Carolina !

Be notified every week of the latest stories from The Sentinel .
Our email newsletter is packed with the most important news from Presidio County and other areas of Western Texas .
The Hawkeyes ( 7 - 0 ) took the lead on a 10 - yard touchdown run by Adam Robinson early in the fourth quarter and their defense did the rest , holding the Badgers scoreless in the second half .
Stanzi was 17 of 23 for 218 yards and a touchdown , Derrell Johnson - Koulianos caught eight passes for 113 yards and cornerback Amari Spievey had two interceptions .
With Ohio State 's loss to Purdue , the Hawkeyes ( 3 - 0 Big Ten ) now are in the driver 's seat for the conference championship and a BCS bowl berth .
They 've shown plenty of poise on the road along the way , having rallied from a 10 - 0 deficit at Penn State earlier this season .
Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz also said his team was dealing with the flu this week , although he did n't discuss specifics .
" It 's reflective of our team , " Ferentz said .
" We keep pushing forward . "
Meanwhile , Wisconsin ( 5 - 2 , 2 - 2 ) squandered a chance to make some noise in the Big Ten title race .
Facing a fairly soft schedule the remainder of the season , a win Saturday might have made the Badgers a surprise contender .
Instead they 're left wondering what has happened to their offense , which looked surprisingly strong early on but now has wilted against back - to - back ranked opponents .
" We have an opportunity to come back home here against Purdue and see exactly where we are going to finish in this league , " Badgers coach Bret Bielema said .
" Early indications are that these guys are going to battle back . "
The Badgers have managed only one offensive touchdown in their last two games , Montee Ball 's 10 - yard run in the second quarter Saturday ; their lone touchdown in a loss to Ohio State last week came off a fake field goal .
Scott Tolzien , whose production in the passing game was a decisive factor in Wisconsin 's 5 - 0 start to the season , was held to 143 yards passing and threw three interceptions against Iowa .
" I take it all on myself , " Tolzien said .
" The protection was good and it was bonehead decisions on my part . "
Wisconsin began the game by tearing holes in Iowa 's defense , with John Clay running for 58 yards on 10 carries in the first quarter .
But Clay hurt his leg in the second quarter and did n't seem to be the same runner the rest of the game .
He finished with 75 yards rushing .
Down 10 - 3 at the half , Spievey picked off a pass from Tolzien near midfield .
Iowa drove to the Wisconsin 24 , where Stanzi faced a third - and - 7 .
Under heavy pressure , Stanzi rolled out and heaved deep to Moeaki , who made a tough catch in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown .
" Spievey picks it off and boom , we 're in the end zone , " Ferentz said .
" We needed something positive to happen at that point . "
Stanzi then was sacked and fumbled deep in his own territory on the Hawkeyes ' next possession , but the Badgers ' offense stalled and Wisconsin kicker Philip Welch missed a 38 - yard field goal attempt .
That allowed Iowa to take control with a seven - play , 79 - yard drive that ended with Robinson 's go - ahead touchdown run -- a reward for Ferentz , who stuck with the run despite watching his team gain only 23 yards rushing in the first half .
Then Moeaki made another big play midway through the fourth quarter , a tough catch in traffic to convert a third - and - 13 play despite being interfered with .
The catch set up a career - long 48 - yard field goal by Daniel Murray .
" It 's extremely frustrating for us to play so well in the first half and come out in the second half and do what we did , " Wisconsin defensive end J.J.
Watt said .
Tolzien threw two interceptions in the final five minutes , one to linebacker A.J. Edds and the other to Spievey .
Iowa keeps the Heartland Trophy -- a bronze bull statue -- and takes a 42 - 41 - 2 lead in what had been a deadlocked all - time series between the two conference rivals .
The sound of the first crack stops the patrol dead .
Halfway up the 3,407 metres of the Nyiragongo volcano , the rangers fan out in the direction of the chopping noise , leaving the path of shattered lava for the dense forest , assault rifles at the ready .
For a few minutes , the silence is broken only by the sharp reports of blade on wood .
Then a confusion of voices , followed quickly by the sound of bodies crashing through the undergrowth towards us .
The one ranger remaining on the path has no rifle so instead draws a machete .
There is no way to know who or what is coming .
The footfalls veer away from us and down , then the first of the rangers emerges with a prisoner on the path above .
Lying on his back on the sharp black rock is a barefoot young man ; his two friends have escaped but his arms are being bound with his own belt .
He is one of what are known as " carbonisateurs " , the footsoldiers of a huge and lucrative illegal trade in charcoal that is threatening the survival of Africa 's oldest national park .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It 's a criminal network that thrives on the extraordinary misery stretched out among the valleys of Eastern Congo below , where " choppers " like this youngster are joined by " cooks " , who feed the old - growth trees of Virunga National Park into earthen ovens , and the human " mules " who transport the 80lb sacks of charcoal on their own backs .
The trade generates an estimated £ 20 million a year , money that goes to the corrupt officials who turn a blind eye to it and the renegade government soldiers and rebel armies who sell their protection .
These cutters cannot have been working alone and the rangers want to know where the kiln is .
The forlorn man , who refuses to give his name , is clad in a filthy sweat - stained shirt with " Rooney " on the back .
He gestures up the slope to where the clouds meet the volcano 's rim .
The march begins again , a steep climb up a channel burnt through the forest by the rivers of lava that poured from Nyiragongo when it last erupted in 2002 .
Once again there is a signal for silence and lead ranger Bosco Hakizimnana veers off the rock and into the trees , running in a crouch .
He emerges into a " clear - cut " , an acre in size , with panicked people running in all directions .
At the centre of the clearing is the smouldering black dome of the kiln , standing above head height .
Beneath the mound of packed , burnt earth , the trunks and branches of the protected forest are being slowly carbonised .
Of the dozen or so people rounded up by the rangers , there is only one man – the " cook " who was feeding the oven .
The rest are women and children , dressed in rags – the human mules who will carry back - breaking loads two hours ' trek down the mountain to the road below .
Wandering in circles in the smoke is a child who can be no more than eight years old with a baby bound to his back .
Many of the women are soldiers ' wives , sent by their husbands , who know that the park authorities cannot arrest them .
The rangers smash the sides of the kiln and the dirt gives way to reveal the skeleton of tree limbs below .
As oxygen reaches into the oven , flames consume the wood giving it the appearance of a funeral pyre .
There is no time to mourn lost money or habitat .
Hakizimnana is concerned that those who have escaped have gone to fetch their protectors .
" We may be ambushed on the way back down , " he warns .
The mules in plastic sandals are loaded with the " evidence " – lumps of charcoal that lie scattered in all directions , turning the forest floor into an open hearth .
The descending path is punctuated by dozens more clearings , like angry black scars on the face of Nyiragongo .
Here and there are signs of better times , wooden steps dug into the hillside , and in one of the openings the crumpled wreckage of a few chairs .
They are all that remains of what used to be a resting station when the volcano would attract tourists who paid more than £ 100 a time to climb to the rim and camp in view of the lava lake inside .
The route has been closed since 2007 , when the carbonisateurs overseen by the FDLR – a rogue army of Rwandan Hutus made up of veterans from the genocidal Interhamwe militia who fled across the border – moved into the area .
When the rag - tag caravan finally emerges at the rangers ' station at Kibati the women are made to sit in a circle .
Hakizimnana delivers a stern lecture telling them that the park " belongs to all of Congo " and that they must find other ways to feed their families .
He finishes by asking them what they will do " when the forest is gone ? "
this is a question that haunts Emmanuel de Merode .
The boyish - looking 38 - year - old is the director of Virunga National Park , probably the hardest job in conservation anywhere in the world .
" We are losing as much as 15 per cent of the forest every year so we do n't have a lot of time , " he says .
And yet at first glance he seems to work in a veritable Garden of Eden .
The park headquarters at the hill station of Rumangabo look out over patchwork slopes of banana thickets that seem to shine with fertility .
The distant horizon is punctuated by the emerald cones of more than half a dozen volcanoes .
Blue monkeys call to each other from the treetops and larger black and white colobus apes loll in the branches around de Merode 's office , while patrols of chimpanzees occasionally pass through the grounds .
The park has an almost surreal cast of rare and endangered animals – from the okapi and forest buffaloes to the hippos of Lake Albert and the savvana elephant herds of Rwindi .
It has more endemic species than any other park in Africa and more bird , mammal and reptile species too .
And in the foothills of Virunga 's volcanoes , where the mist meets the tree line , the park 's most spectacular residents can be found .
Half of the more than 700 mountain gorillas left in the wild live in the Virunga range .
" There is no other park in the world like this , " de Merode says with conviction .
And certainly none that faces the same existential threats .
The 30,000 square miles of what was established as the Albert Park in 1925 also mark out a corridor of unrivalled human misery .
The reserve is both hideout and theatre of operations for a host of rebel armies , including the notorious FDLR and the bizarre and brutal child soldiers of the Mai Mai .
The Hutu militia are being hunted down by the largely unpaid and undisciplined Congolese army who have been blamed for an appalling litany of human - rights abuses .
The park is hemmed in , too , by an estimated 600,000 internal refugees , camped on its fringes , the human fallout from years of relentless instability and civil war .
And to the south of Virunga is the slum city of Goma , whose population has swollen to three - quarters of a million people .
De Merode , an anthropologist by training , who has been working in the Democratic Republic of Congo for 16 years , was a passionate critic of the way Virunga Park was run , until last year when the government turned to the Belgian and in his words said : " If you 're going to criticise , show us you can do better . "
" As a conservationist , to be given overall responsibility for Virunga ... " his voice trails off then comes back rapidly : " It 's the greatest national park on the continent and it's in serious trouble .
If you are serious about conservation then you have no choice . "
His predecessor at the Institut Congolais pour la Conservacion de la Nature ( ICCN ) , Honore Mashagiro , is now in jail after being convicted of orchestrating the killing of seven gorillas under his protection in 2007 .
Pictures of the murdered silverback ( or troop leader ) Senkwekwe being carried on a litter by mourning villagers made headlines around the world .
The subsequent investigation led back to charcoal money and it emerged that the park director had ordered the executions as a warning to rangers threatening to disrupt the trade by protecting the forest .
The chaos and poverty of North Kivu has left 98 per cent of the people there dependant on charcoal .
It 's their only source of fuel , what they use to cook and to boil water .
Even if there was a way to do so , de Merode explains , you cannot simply close down the charcoal trade , it would cause an immediate humanitarian crisis .
" We cannot deprive the population of Goma of energy even if it costs us the park , " he says .
" Without boiled water there would be a cholera epidemic that would dwarf what we saw last year .
You would have an immediate , massive crisis . "
The rangers raids into the charcoal - harvesting areas , where they have destroyed hundreds of kilns and made scores of arrests , are designed instead to " squeeze supply " and make a show of strength to the traffickers .
What 's needed in the meantime is an alternative fuel – and in the workshops at Rumangabo , the Belgian and his team may have found it .
While this time last year the rest of the world was waiting for the forces of renegade General Laurent Nkunda to overrun Goma , de Merode was testing technology designed in South Africa to produce " biomass briquettes " .
Made from a compost of plant waste ( like rice husks ) they look like rings pressed from animal dung .
Now that Nkunda is under house arrest across the border in Rwanda and an uneasy truce prevails in much of North Kivu , the briquette plan is being rolled out at extraordinary speed .
On a whirlwind tour of the factory set up to manufacture the presses at Rumangabo , the park director is a man in a hurry : " You have to take advantage of periods of relative peace , " he says .
" In Congo things come back to life quickly and if you work with that things happen fast . "
In the afternoon sun , dozens of the wooden presses are being varnished and branded with the ICCN stamp .
Together with the rest of the kit to start making briquettes , they cost £ 190 a piece and are being given to the communities around the park .
Local Congolese get everything they need to build a small briquette factory – two days ' training , the kit and six months ' follow - up support .
In return they commit to producing at least four sacks per week , otherwise the press is given to someone else .
In return the park guarantees it will buy the briquettes produced at a fixed price , and then sell them on to the market .
The speed with which things can change here is nowhere clearer than in Kiwanja , 15 miles north of Rumangabo .
During last year 's fighting the small town was the scene of an appalling massacre .
In the space of two days in November , 150 people , most of them young men , were summarily executed by fighters from General Nkunda 's CNDP .
Shabani Kabemba , now aged 45 , remembers the soldiers going from house to house .
" It was death , " he recalls .
" I thought I would die at any time . "
In the end , he survived but seven of friends were not so lucky and his family was forced to flee to Goma .
Now they have come back and underneath a mango tree in Kabemba 's backyard they are pressing briquettes .
" Before , my wife went to the forest to get firewood every day , " he continues .
" But in the bush there are soldiers who can take her . "
This new family business is churning out three sacks a day which ICCN buys from them for about £ 4.50 each .
Spread out among the baked - earth gardens and tin shacks of Kiwanja there are now 250 presses at work , and a waiting list of people wanting more .
Three thousand kits have been given out so far and the bulk of production is being sold on to international organisations running the camps for displaced people .
There are plans afoot to set up a drying warehouse in Goma – and remarkably , by this time next year , the dung - coloured discs will be the largest employer in North Kivu if the expansion continues .
In its report earlier this year , the influential UN panel of experts cited the briquettes as one of four key initiatives to stabilise the entire region .
" The briquettes are n't a success story yet , " says de Merode , in the measured tones of someone not wanting to tempt fate .
" But something interesting is happening . "
The rutted road from Goma to Rutshuru , trodden by the feet of more than a million refugees , draws a line between the two sides of Virunga Park .
The southern sector is dominated by the gently rising contours of Nyamulagira volcano .
The green canopy that rolls down from its summit looks unbroken from a distance .
Only the grey columns of smoke that climb from the unseen kilns below the tree line warn of what Innocent Mburanumwe calls the " charcoal war " being fought to save the park and the wildlife it contains .
The head of the Nyamulagira sector , he has been shot at by government soldiers and besieged at his own headquarters for arresting carbonisateurs and he has seen dozens of his rangers killed , the last of them shot dead by poachers in August .
" We are losing the forest , " he says and when it is gone the charcoal harvesters will cross the road into the Mikeno sector .
Already the tendrils of smoke are beginning to climb the tallest of the volcanoes , creeping towards the gorillas .
A waist - high wall built from volcanic rocks is all that marks the perimiter of Mikeno .
Beyond it , the old paths are overgrown and a steep ascent of jagged rock and thick red mud leads into a jungle which closes in overhead and has to be hacked open with a machete .
A network of bamboo thickets that dot the slopes offer breathing space in the claustrophobic vegetation , like yellowing summer pavilions with umbrella - shaped roofs of canes .
And scattered across the carpet of dried leaves are the empty yellow husks of bamboo shoots , the gorillas ' favourite food .
Nearby branches as thick as human arms have been broken with scarcely credible force and fashioned delicately into " night nests " padded with soft leaves .
Then a clumsy crashing noise announces the presence of Virunga 's most charismatic animals .
A juvenile male has tested his weight against the strength of a sapling and won with a snap .
He lands in an effortless roll , like a black ball , unfurls himself and stretches .
A mother scampers hurriedly past trailing an infant behind her , who gawks at the newcomers with huge eyes bulging in a tiny face .
A hollow rattle of a beaten chest sounds from beyond a wall of vegetation .
A flurry of unseen movement shakes the jungle floor .
Then a face appears .
His flared nostrils catch the light beneath an endless forehead and the dense black fur of his immense shoulders gives way to a silvery grey that runs the length of his saddle - shaped back .
Kabirizi is the leader one of the two largest gorilla groups in the world , the dominant male in a family of 34 great apes .
He rolls forward with terrifying speed to inspect his visitors at close quarters .
Reassured of his authority , the 450 - pound silverback returns to the shade of his bamboo pavilion .
His nervousness is understandable .
War has already touched this family and the previous silverback was killed by Rwandan soldiers fleeing across the mountain in the wake of the 1994 genocide .
And the sad truth is that – despite his immense strength and the life - or - death efforts of the park rangers he has come to accept cautiously into his family – Kabirizi is still not safe .

Dozens of protesters have rallied outside a Khartoum court in support of a Sudanese woman facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers in public , a case that has become a public test of Sudan 's indecency laws .
Lubna Hussein , a former journalist and UN press officer , was arrested with 12 other women during a party at a Khartoum restaurant in early July and charged with committing an indecent act .
Women 's groups say the law gives no clear definition of indecent dress , leaving the decision of whether to arrest a women up to individual police officers .
Ululating women outside the courtroom carried banners and headbands with the message " No return to the dark ages " and shouted slogans against the dress laws .
Speaking after the hearing , Hussein said the judge had adjourned her case until September 7 .
" They want to check with the UN whether I have immunity from prosecution .
I do n't know why they are doing this because I have already resigned from the United Nations .
I think they just want to delay the case , " she said .
Riot police advanced towards the crowd , beating their shields with batons , to try to disperse them .
One officer fired what appeared to be blank rounds into the air , a witness said .
" We are against this law .
It is against women , against Islam and against human rights , " said Zainab Badradin , one of the women in the crowd .
Indecency cases are not uncommon in Sudan , where there is a large cultural gap between the mostly Muslim and Arab - oriented north and the mainly Christian south .
Hussein has attracted attention by publicising her case , posing for photos in her loose green trousers and inviting journalists to campaign against dress codes sporadically imposed in the capital .
Her case has attracted widespread support among women 's groups in Khartoum , but there were also men among Tuesday 's protesters .
" Her main argument is that her clothes are decent and that she did not break the law , " defence lawyer Nabil Adib Abdalla said shortly before the hearing .
" Failing that , we will ask for a stay of the proceedings to challenge the trial in the constitutional court ...
We are saying the law is so widely drafted that it contravenes her basic right , her right to a fair trial , " he added .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia in a new review of its policy on use of nuclear weapons will reserve the right to undertake a pre-emptive strike if it feels its security is endangered , a senior Kremlin official told a Russian newspaper .
Russian and U.S. negotiators are in talks to find agreement on a new bilateral pact cutting stocks of strategic nuclear weapons .
Both sides are working to a December deadline for a new treaty to replace the landmark Cold War-era START pact .
While Moscow and Washington have made progress in strategic nuclear arms talks , Russia ’s security may come under threat from regional conflicts and local wars , Nikolai Patrushev , secretary of the Kremlin ’s powerful Security Council , said in an interview with Izvestia newspaper to be published on Wednesday .
Russia was revising its military doctrine to include new terms of use of its nuclear forces , he said , adding that President Dmitry Medvedev , who chairs the Security Council , would be presented with the new doctrine by the end of the year .
“ Conditions of using nuclear weapons to repel an aggression with the use of conventional weapons not only in a large - scale but also in a regional and even local war have been revised , ” he said , without naming these conditions .
“ Moreover , different variants are considered to allow the use of nuclear weapons depending on a certain situation and intentions of a would - be enemy .
In conditions critical for national security one should not also exclude a preventive nuclear strike on the aggressor . ”
Russia ’s current doctrine says the “ most important task is to be able to deter , including with the use of nuclear weapons , an aggression of any scale against Russia and its allies . ”
As Russia ’s conventional troops lack modern equipment and undergo a painful reform aimed to cut their numbers and create professional armed forces , Moscow relies heavily on its formidable arsenal of nuclear weapons .
The Kremlin prided itself on defeating tiny neighbor Georgia in a five - day war in August 2008 .
But many Russia watchers are skeptical that Moscow would be able to defeat with the same ease a larger and stronger nation .

There are many options for cat lovers who are allergic to cats but still wish to own one .
Hypoallergenic Cat Breeds
The hypoallergenic cat .
There are several cat breeds available for cat owners who want their very own feline .
The most common are the Sphynx breed , often called hairless , they have hair much more like peach fuzz .
As a result they should not be allowed to venture outside because of the cold and the sun .
Other breeds that are good for people who have allergies are the Cornish Rex and Devon Rex .
These cats have curly coats and lack some of the dander associated with causing cat allergies .
Finally there is the less known breed , LaPerm , another cat with curly fur .
Owners would be advised to note that while these cats may not have allergens associated with fur , their saliva may still cause problems for owners sensitive to cat saliva .
Above is a photo of a hairless Sphynx cat , photo source .
http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrec/3021674438/
Above is a Devon Rex , while you might not be able to see the curls and waves on the coat of the cat , you can certainly see the curled whiskers .
The cats name is Tea .
Food and Diet
Any cat fed a proper diet , high in good quality meat content , will have fewer skin problems , and less dander , than cats fed 90 % of the cat food available commercially .
Most foods sold have far too much filler and while they meet minimum standards , most stop there .
To learn more about cat food ingredients click here .
As a general rule cat foods sold in grocery stores , and departments stores ( such as Walmart ) are not quality foods , also foods who have lots of advertising are putting money into ads , not ingredients .
Cat food should never have corn as the first or second ingredient .
Good cat food also means considerably less shedding , and as bonus an owner will find the cat makes fewer trips to the litter box , as there is less waste .
Color
It is said that lighter colored cats and particularly female cats , have fewer associated allergies .
This would be the white cats , light grey , or peach colored cats , as well as dilute tortoiseshells and dilute calico cats .
Some color points ( the colors associated with Siamese cats ) might also fit into this group .
Short Haired Cats
Short haired cats often cause fewer allergies than long haired ones .
They do not have to be a fancy breed , the regular DSH , or domestic short hair , cat will be fine .
Option 5
Any cat if washed regularly will cause less problems .
Naturally cats do not like water although there are some breeds , and some cats , who really do n't mind it .
An option here is to select a younger ( short haired , female , kitten , of a light color ) and introduce it to bathing at an early age .
Bathing should be done correctly so as not to stress the cat .
Although I would not recommend this as a first choice , there are many people , and cats , who find this arrangement workable .
Products for Cats
There are products available to spray on a cat to reduce their shedding .
Some work better than others .
Otherwise have another family member , or friend , groom the cat regularly to remove any loose hair .
Run a damp cloth over the cat to remove any dander .
Allergy Medications
One of the things people seldom look at is themselves .
There are allergy medications available to help alleviate allergy symptoms .
Some of these are over the counter pills but better ones are available only with a prescription .
A doctor should be consulted to find out what other options are available , including injections .
People need to remember to wash their hands after handing a cat , and particularly before touching their face or eyes .
With proper management and considerations owning a cat is possible for anyone who wants one .

KABUL —
It seemed like such a good idea at the time .
At a staff meeting in 2006 , Lt. Gen .
Karl Eikenberry , who was then commander of Combined Forces Afghanistan , took a sip of bottled water .
Then he looked at the label of one of the Western companies that were being paid millions of dollars a year to ship bottled water by the container load into Afghanistan .
And Eikenberry , who is now the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan , said , “ There must be a way of producing bottled water in Afghanistan . ”
Thus was born the concept of Afghan First , a policy of preferential treatment for Afghan - owned companies that steers military aid into the hands of Afghan vendors .
All local procurement from fuel delivery for the Afghan army to the production of winter socks for the Afghan police — everything short of weapons and ammunition — now comes from a variety of local contractors , who are being paid about $ 800 million per year from the U.S. military .
The largesse comes out of the total $ 1.1 billion budget for local purchases that falls under the Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan , CSTC - A for short .
It is the lead U.S. agency responsible for developing the Afghan army and police .
“ We are building this country , ” said Sgt. Edward Gyokeres , chief of the public affairs office at CSTC - A , explaining that the program is intended to use the American and coalition aid money in a way that helps construct a national economy in Afghanistan .
But , paradoxically , this well - intentioned policy may also benefit the insurgency , according to those inside the system , who contend that a significant portion of that money going to Afghan vendors trickles down into the hands of the very enemy the U.S. is battling in Afghanistan — the Taliban .
Precise numbers are impossible to obtain in the lawless fringes of rural Afghanistan where there is very little accounting for this money , but those knowledgeable about the process estimate that at least 10 percent , or about $ 80 million , has in the last year gone to the diverse groupings of Afghan insurgents whom the U.S. military has come to call the Taliban .
Some contractors say as much as 20 percent of the contracts go to paying off the insurgency , which would put the number closer to $ 160 million a year .
U.S. and Afghan officials tracking where the Taliban gets its funding estimate that the Taliban ’s annual take of the poppy crop is about $ 100 million .
Over the last month , GlobalPost conducted a series of interviews with contractors , military personnel and others who work inside the system and confirmed that a flow of money goes from these local Afghan contractors to the Taliban for payoffs and protection in the widening areas of the country that are Taliban controlled .
In fact , GlobalPost found almost no one inside the military procurement and aid community who expressed surprise at the phenomenon , but very few who were willing to discuss the process on the record out of fear of losing their lucrative contracts , their jobs , or their lives .
“ There is no line item for bribes , ” said CSTC - A’s Sgt. Gyokeres .
“ That ’s not to say it does n’t happen . ”
Procurement officers working for two different companies with large CSTC - A contracts shared their stories and three military officers commented on the procurement process .
The head of the non-governmental organization that matches contractors to funders also weighed in , as did numerous ordinary Afghans and foreigners more indirectly associated with the process .
They describe a system in which huge contracts in the tens of millions of dollars are being pushed through in a chaotic and violent environment with too few project managers and accountants .
This is happening as the U.S. and coalition partners try to balance the desperate development needs of the country against the knowledge that some of those funds are ending up in the hands of the Taliban .
All agreed : Payoffs to insurgent groups do occur , are almost impossible to track and will be extremely difficult to stop .
As with U.S. assistance funds , a percentage of which find their way to Taliban coffers , military procurement money is a major source of financing for the resurgent Taliban .
“ ISAF ( International Security Assistance Force ) is aware of allegations that procurement funds may find their way into the hands of insurgent groups , but we do not directly support or condone this activity , if it is occurring , ” said Col.
Wayne Shanks , chief of public affairs for the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan ( USFOR - A ) .
“ While rigorous contract award and oversight processes exist , the relationships between contractors and their subcontractors , as well as between subcontractors and others in their operational communities , are not entirely transparent , ” Shanks added .
His candid assessment of the process and the blind spots in it reflect an age - old struggle in counterterrorism :
Money often flows through local businesses to the insurgency .
It was a problem that was faced by the British Empire here in the 19th century and later by the Soviet Union when it invaded Afghanistan .
The United States encountered the phenomenon in Vietnam and more recently in Somalia , according to aid workers who have been negotiating this terrain for decades .
Paul O’Brien is the director of the aid effectiveness team at Oxfam who has spent many years in Afghanistan .
He has deep inside knowledge of the difficulties that aid agencies and the military face in providing assistance in a war zone .
He said that some of the funding inevitably ends up in the wrong hands .
But he pointed out that imposing overly stringent accounting methods would jeopardize the overall effort and diminish the greater good of helping the Afghan people .
“ If we go in there and the first thing we say is , okay , we need to write down your names for accounting purposes and for political purposes to be sure you are not with the insurgency , it is much harder to accomplish the larger goal , ” O’Brien explained .
As GlobalPost first reported in its special report “ Life , Death and the Taliban , ” the insurgents are reaping rich dividends from local contractors who are paid through U.S. and coalition development funding .
The story prompted a probe by the USAID inspector general ’s office which is now underway .
Large contracts awarded to American firms often have accounting procedures in place , but most U.S. companies engage a variety of Afghan subcontractors to carry out the work .
This is where things begin to fall apart for both military and NGOs , or non-governmental organizations that provide development assistance .
“ Everything was done in cash , ” said one contractor who worked for an Afghan firm with a wide range of CSTC - A contracts .
“ There is no way of tracking where the money is going .
There are no controls on payments .
The military does not follow up or check on [ Afghan ] companies the way they can U.S. vendors . ”
This is the rule , rather than the exception , where Afghan companies are concerned , according to those closest to the process .
As a result , they say , money can be easily diverted .
“ Of course we pay off the Taliban , ” said one procurement director for an Afghan company that imports fuel for the military .
“ What is the alternative ? ”
There are few viable options for those who work in the widening area of Afghanistan that is under Taliban control .
Those who do not pay up - front end up bearing even greater costs in cash or blood .
Contractors often tell the story of one transportation company that refused to pay :
It lost 800 trucks before it bowed to the inevitable .
The amounts involved are far from negligible .
According to the procurement director , who spoke on condition of anonymity , when fuel comes into the country from Central Asia it costs approximately $ 1 per liter .
By the time it reaches a military base in Kandahar or Tirin Kot , in the volatile , dangerous , Taliban - controlled south , the price has gone up to $ 1.60 — billed , of course , to the U.S. military .
A modest portion — between 10 and 20 cents — goes to the company as profit .
The remaining 40 to 50 cents , or more than 25 percent of the total , goes for “ security ” — which means handouts to the Taliban or other local insurgents to allow the shipment through .
This money is baked directly into the price of the fuel – legitimate security costs , to private firms that accompany the shipments or guard the fuel storage areas , would be a separate line item in a firm ’s budget .
It adds up .
According to Mike Capstick , head of Peace Dividend Trust , an organization that matches Afghan companies to international donors , the value of military contracts given to Afghan companies last year alone was $ 1.1 billion .
If , as insiders say , between 10 and 20 percent is being siphoned off to the Taliban , then CSTC - A funding from the U.S. military would rival the narcotics industry as a source of revenue for the insurgency .
“ I think it is important to note that the ISAF and our international partners are taking a broad - based approach to identify and close vulnerabilities that criminals , including the Taliban , use to raise , store and move funds , ” said Col .
Shanks with USFOR-A .
“ We work closely with our Afghan partners to take action against specific people involved in financing of the Taliban , and to build Afghan capacity in strategic areas , like internal audits , to better track budget and procurement flows , as well as to improve overall security conditions with the help of the Afghan National Security Forces , " he added .
Shanks pointed to a series of recent military operations aimed at capturing or eliminating insurgents and their supporters .
Attempts are also being made to track and control the “ hawala ” system , a traditional financial structure in this part of the world that does not conform easily to regulation .
Hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of dollars are moved through hawala every day .
The procedure is simple , and virtually untraceable .
The customer brings his money , in cash , to a hawala trader at a central market .
The broker takes a percentage , then makes a phone call to a partner in London , Cairo , New York or Sydney , who dispenses the requisite amount in cash to a designated recipient .
In Kabul , the government has distributed forms to hawala traders , and is requiring that they fill them out for every transaction .
This also means that the hawala trader would have to pay taxes on all his profits .
“ Of course we do not record everything , ” snorted one hawala broker .
“ We record a percentage — usually for those businesses that are all legitimate and above board .
We do not register the rest . ”
The major customers for hawala , according to the broker , are those dealing in drug money and those with major international contracts .
Cracking an internal Afghan system from the outside is no easy task .
“ Afghans know how to get things done here , ” said Capstick , from Peace Dividend Trust .
“ They can seal a deal with a handshake . ”
But the Afghan way is all too often mired in corruption and nepotism , traits that have made the country the fifth most corrupt nation in the world , according to Transparency International ’s most recent annual index .
In a country where the rule of law is more a distant dream than a present reality , giving the Taliban a cut of the funding is not seen as treason — it is merely expedient .
“ We delivered fuel to all the provinces , and the only way of accomplishing that was by greasing the Taliban , ” said the contractor from the Afghan firm .
Between 10 and 20 percent of the proceeds were paid out to ensure security , he added .
The overall contract amounts were staggering .
“ I went to Camp Eggers to collect unpaid invoices , ” he said , referring to the U.S. military base in the center of Kabul that houses CSTC - A .
“ For three weeks we were owed $ 16 million . ”
At that rate , the firm would be making upward of $ 250 million per year — with a healthy cut going to insurgent groups .
The U.S. military is trying its best to build in checks and balances to keep the process honest .
“ All ISAF agencies check potential contractors and organizations to ensure that money is not going directly into the hands of known terrorists , ” said Shanks .
But none of the procedures in place can hope to catch or counter the built - in payments to the Taliban .
According to Lt. Col. Mitchell S. Appley , commander of the Kabul Regional Contracting Center , the military keeps a list of close to 4,000 Afghan vendors .
“ The policy , basically , is if there is an Afghan vendor available , we should give them preference , ” he said .
“ New rules and regulations allow us to restrict competition to Afghan only . ”
The contracting system is long and complex , with multiple layers of bureaucracy designed to ensure transparency .
First a potential vendor is vetted by Peace Dividend Trust , which checks the organization ’s registration , does a site visit to make sure that it is a legitimate company , and helps its Afghan officials to negotiate their way through the military procurement system .
The military concedes that there is much it cannot control .
“ Corruption is a possibility , ” said Sgt. Gyokeres .
“ But our job is to administer the contracts fairly and objectively . ”
For those working inside the system , this desire to remain above the fray amounts to a willful refusal to see what is going on .
“ They say ‘ just get it done , ’ ” said the procurement director .
“ They do not seem to want to know too many of the details . ”
A former international military officer explained why CSTC - A may be feeling a bit overwhelmed .
“ Someone from above is pushing on the soft spot in their forehead and telling them to get the contracts out , ” he said , speaking privately .
“ There is a lot of pressure on the military procurement system . ”
The contractor definitely agrees .
“ That is the way things happen , ” he said .
“ It is not easy to start with nothing and then create a functioning infrastructure ; some latitude is required .
But this ‘ do n't ask do n't tell ’ policy has evolved to such an extent that Taliban funding is fully baked into the system .
It stands to reason that the insurgency can now forecast revenue and accurately budget for combat resources based on lucrative contracts from the U.S. military , which were intended to rebuild their war - torn country . ”

Army leader 's aide tells how he had to beg , steal and borrow kit
Andrew Mackay has resigned - reports said was unhappy about strategy
The shock resignation of the major general who commanded Prince Harry in Afghanistan has highlighted the growing rift between military leaders and the Government over the conduct of the campaign .
Serving officers and MPs reacted with astonishment yesterday to the news that Major General Andrew Mackay has quit after clashing with ministers over the Government 's strategy in Afghanistan and resources committed to the front line .
General Mackay , the 52 - year - old commander of Army forces in Scotland , northern England and Northern Ireland , is the most senior of a string of prominent officers whose frustrations have caused them to resign in recent months .
He led UK forces in Helmand Province for six months in 2007 - 8 , when Prince Harry was among soldiers under his command , and personally oversaw the successful recapture of the Taliban stronghold town of Musa Qaleh .
Major Nick Haston , General Mackay 's deputy chief of staff , resigned from the Army earlier this year in protest at bureaucratic incompetence and kit shortages .
He said the General had raised issues over equipment shortages with the Ministry of Defence , and that British troops had to ' beg , borrow and steal ' kit to recapture Musa Qaleh in 2007 .
He said of his boss : ' There was no secret that he was openly frustrated about some of these issues .
' We were unhappy about some of the basic things , such as vehicles and the procurement process for vehicles .
The numbers that we had on equipment lists did n't necessarily match what was in theatre .
' I have many colleagues who are still in the Army who I know are immensely frustrated and their morale is affected . '
One Army officer recently returned from Afghanistan told the Mail : ' When a Major General who 's nearing the summit of his career walks away in disgust , something is really badly wrong .
' We are not talking about some grumbling passed - over junior officer .
This is a very highly - respected man who has been out there and seen it for himself , and proved himself as an operational commander . '
General Mackay 's resignation has piled fresh embarrassment on the Ministry of Defence , at a time when the coalition 's entire approach in Afghanistan is facing intense scrutiny and criticism .
Officially the Ministry attributed General Mackay 's sudden resignation , announced to colleagues on Thursday , to ' personal reasons ' .
But insiders said he had voiced anger over the Government 's strategy - or lack of it - in Afghanistan , frustration over inadequate resources and disillusionment at the apparent inability of other Whitehall departments , such as the Foreign Office and Department for International Development , to work together coherently .
General Mackay has made no secret of his unhappiness at the lack of a joined - up approach to stabilising Afghanistan , and about inadequate resources .
On his arrival in Helmand as a Brigadier in late 2007 he was said to have been shocked to find commanders ' making it up as we go along ' .
He made it his goal to draw up a template for future commanders , stressing the need to engage fully with civilians and focus on development rather than simply looking for Taliban gunmen and starting fights .
Conservative defence spokesman Liam Fox said : ' This is yet another indication of the frustration of our military commanders at the lack of clear strategy and adequate resourcing of the war in Afghanistan .
' Increasingly , people feel that Labour cannot be trusted to give our troops everything they need to carry out their mission safely and successfully . '
Liberal Democrat spokesman Nick Harvey said : ' How many more senior officers will have to go before Brown gets a grip on the situation in Afghanistan ?
' Soldiers must have the equipment they need to do the job , and a strategy they can believe in .
Right now it seems they have neither .
' If the Government is not prepared to resource our commanders properly , it should not be putting troops on the front line . '

President Barack Obama was a guest of David Letterman Monday night , the first sitting president to appear on his show .
The discussion was lively and showcased the fact that amid all of the background noise surrounding the White House , the Commander in Chief has managed to keep his sense of humor .
When Letterman asked Obama about former president Jimmy Carter 's assertion that racism is behind recent political attacks , Obama responded , " It 's important to realize that I was actually black before the election . "
The discussion took on a serious tone with the tough subjects of war and health care .
Obama said the country gets " riled up " with big change .
He said , " People are just frustrated and angry right now because they have gotten a raw deal . "
The Letterman crowd was on its best behavior , giving the president a standing ovation at the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway .
The band even managed a drum heavy Hail to The Chief .
After the early taping , Obama reportedly put on his gym clothes and a baseball cap and played some basketball with his aides at a church across the street from his Midtown Manhattan hotel .
On a side note , Obama had a fan at the 2009 Emmy Awards on Sunday night .

Organizer Report - back from the Inaugural North American Studies Network Conference
Jesse Cohn , Luis Fernandez , Nathan Jun , Deric Shannon , Abbey Willis
November 21st and 22nd marked the dates of the Inaugural North American Anarchist Studies Network Conference in Hartford , Connecticut .
We came together to organize this conference in order to begin the development of this larger project –the network –which we hope will serve as a space for the development of intellectual work on and within anarchism .
Further , in the organizing committee , the conference , and the network we have consciously included academics as well as grassroots scholars .
As anarchists , we feel that academic institutions should not have a privileged role in the production of knowledge and hope that the network can serve as a point of rupture with the notion that intellectual work is limited to academic institutions .
The conference drew around 300-350 participants over the course of the two days of the conference .
The numbers of panels , workshops , and paper presentations were well beyond our expectations and this cannot be stressed enough in conference attendance ( we expected somewhere between 80 - 120 people ) .
Since the conference , through the email list , we have seen the development of two working groups : one centered around anarchist cultural studies and another on archiving anarchist work .
The website for the network is being developed through the current blog site and members of the network have started an initiative for popular education ( to be announced ) .

Queensland Opposition spokesman David Gibson says the report is further evidence that construction should not go ahead and he has called on Premier Anna Bligh to cancel the project .
" If she has any environmental concerns or credibility at all left in her she should walk away from this project , " he said .
" Any project that has over 1,200 environmental conditions associated with it clearly is a project that is of great risk to the environment and one that we do n't need to pursue - there are other alternatives .
" With any project there would be conditions , but over 1,200 conditions is extensive and for the Premier to try and spin this as being the most environmentally friendly and greenest dam ever built just hides the fact that this dam is a risk to the environment . "
Community input
A group fighting to stop the dam 's construction wants Mr Garrett to take his time to consider the project .
Save the Mary River Coordinating Group spokesman David Kruetz says Mr Garrett should give the community a say about the dam .
" We would call on Mr Garrett to allow a public consultation period that would stop the clock for 10 days that people would have to comment on this EIS [ environmental impact statement ] report from the coordinator - general 's department , " he said .
Mr Kruetz says there are still a lot of questions to be answered .
" We think the science will not stack up - and 1,200 conditions , 38 major conditions and a 10 - year sunset clause - if they can't meet those conditions , they can't build the dam , " he said .
" [ This ] would say to any reasonable person that this has extreme environmental problems . "

Disclaimer : I 'm not a Factor compiler expert and am just getting to grips with compiler intrinsics so some of this might be a bit iffy .
' Compiler Intrinsics ' is a mechanism by which you can insert your low - level implementation of a subroutine into the compiler output .
This is useful in a couple of scenarios :
if the compiler does n't support the desired functionality - e.g. it does something hardwarey that Factor can't do yet
if the subroutine is performance critical and the compiler is n't generating the most efficient code
The old way of doing compiler intrinsics in Factor was to hand - code some assembler using one of Factor 's assembler DSLs ( PPC or X86 ) and then attach it to an existing word as a word - property along with an argument type pattern .
When the compiler compiled calls to the word it would compare the input parameters to the pattern and on match would insert the assembler directly into the generated code .
Since my last post about Factor 's compiler over a year ago Slava has pretty much re-written the whole thing .
It now has two intermediate stages :
The first frontend stage transforms the factor code into an intermediate representation called ' high level IR ' .
This is basically a decomposition of factor code into primitive word - calls and control nodes through various optimization passes .
This is very similiar to the dataflow IR in the original Factor compiler that I described in the previous blog post
The second backend stage is the new bit .
It converts the high - level IR into low - level IR , which is basically a platform independent assembler language .
An optimization stage then runs and cpu registers are allocated resulting in ' machine IR ' ( abbreviated to ' MR ' in the debug tools ) .
The real machine code generation is then done from this MR .
The new way of doing compiler intrinsics allows you to insert low - level IR code at the beginning of the ' backend ' stage .
Differences to the old way include :
You now code using the platform independent instructions defined in compiler.cfg.instructions
Instructions operate on virtual registers .
There are an infinite number of those
Subroutine arguments do n't appear in registers .
Instead you manually insert code to get them in and out of the data stack using ds - push , ds - pop
You still have to box and unbox values manually ( just as before )
There 's an optimization stage that runs after you 've emitted the low level IR instructions from your compiler intrinsic
As a really simple example here 's a word which is going to add 35 to the fixnum on the top of the stack and push the result .
To make sure that we 're executing the intrinsic assembler I 'll give it a default implementation that throws an error .
: add -35 ( n -- n ' ) drop " should n't call this " throw ;
Incidently , here are the MR instructions generated from this default implementation :
( scratchpad ) USE : compiler.cfg .debugger ( scratchpad ) \ add - 35 test - mr .
=== word : add - 35 , label : add - 35 _label 0 _prologue
T{ stack - frame { total - size 32 } } _label 1 # #load - reference RAX " should n't call this " # #replace RAX D 0 _label 2 # #call
M\ object throw _label 3 # #no - tco _spill - area - size 0
A couple of things to notice :
The instructions are prefixed with ##. E.g. ##load - reference , ##replace
This MR output is displayed after cpu register allocation has been done : RAX is an x86.64 register .
Also D is a pseudo - register that points to the data stack .
If you look at the disassembled machine code ( just below the callstack juggling ) you can see that D actually becomes R14 :
( scratchpad ) \ add -35 disassemble 00007f6d98780ce0 : 49b8e00c78986d7f0000 mov r8 , 0x7f6d98780ce0 ( add - 35 ) 00007f6d98780cea : 6820000000 push dword 0x20 00007f6d98780cef : 4150 push r8 00007f6d98780cf1 : 4883ec08 sub rsp , 0x8 00007f6d98780cf5 : 48b8e6866ca76d7f0000 mov rax , 0x7f6da76c86e6 00007f6d98780cff : 498906 mov [ r 14 ] , rax 00007f6d98780d02 : e859a385 ff call 0x7f6d97fdb060
Ok , so instead of an implementation that throws an error I want to insert my own instructions into the output .
I can do this by attaching some low - level - IR emitting code to the word using the " intrinsic " word property :
: emit-add -35 ( node -- ) drop !
do n't need to inspect the compiler node ds - pop !
insert instruction to pop value off the stack ^^untag - fixnum !
insert code to untag the value in the register 35 ^^add - imm !
insert instruction to add 35 to it ( add - imm = add immediate ) ^^tag - fixnum !
insert code to tag the result ds - push ; !
insert code to push the result onto the data stack \ add - 35 [ emit - add - 35 ] " intrinsic " set- word - prop
The emit - add - 35 just pops a value off of the stack , un-tags ( unboxes ) it and then adds 35 to it and tags the result .
A couple of points :
' Hats ' -
The ^^ form of instructions are the same as the ## form , except that after emitting the instruction the ^^ form returns the ( new ) destination register so that it can be used by the next instruction .
' tag/untag ' - Factor aligns all its heap data to the nearest 8 byte boundary , which leaves the bottom 3 bits of each pointer free for runtime type identification ( RTTI ) .
These 3 RTTI bits are called the ' tag ' , and in the case of a fixnum the tag is ' 000 ' and the other bits store the actual value rather than a pointer to the value .
So instead of unboxing fixnums we simply untag them , which equates to shifting them 3 bits to the right .
node parameter - You 'll notice that the emit - add - 35 word takes a node parameter .
This parameter is a structure passed by the compiler and contains information about the inferred types and value - ranges of the arguments at compile time .
This is handy if you 're dispatching based on type or you want to decide whether to include overflow logic .
In this example I 'm doing neither so I discard it
Now that the add - 35 word has a compiler intrinsic we can see the emitted code by compiling it within a quotation ( code - block ) and displaying the mr :
( scratchpad ) [ add - 35 ] test-mr .
=== word : ( gensym ) , label : ( gensym ) _label 0 _label 1 ##peek RAX D 0 !
- load value from stack ##sar - imm RAX RAX 3 !
- untag ##add - imm RAX RAX 35 ! - add 35 ##shl-imm RAX RAX 3 ! - tag ##replace RAX D 0 ! - replace top stack elem with result _label 2 # #return _spill - area - size 0
I 've annotated this output but you could probably guess what it was doing anyway .
I mentioned earlier that a backend optimizer stage runs after the intrinsic word is called .
To illustrate this here 's a compilation of the add - 35 word with a supplied constant argument :
( scratchpad ) [ 4 add - 35 ] test-mr .
=== word : ( gensym ) , label : ( gensym ) _label 0 _label 1 ##load - immediate RAX 312 # #inc-d 1 # #replace RAX D 0 _label 2 # #return _spill - area - size 0
You can see that the Factor compiler dispensed with our hand - coded add instruction and instead just stuck the fixnum - tagged result in the RAX register .
It did this because it could perform the evaluation and boxing at compile time .
( 312 = ( 35 + 4 ) << 3 ) .
Here 's the resulting X86 assembler :
( scratchpad ) [ 4 add -35 ] disassemble 00007feac680e0c0 : 48b83801000000000000 mov rax , 0x138 00007 feac680e0 ca : 4983c608 add r14 , 0x8 00007feac680e0ce : 498906 mov [ r 14 ] , rax 00007 feac680e0d1 : c3 ret
So that leaves the question : How do I code actual X86 assembler into a subroutine ?
To do that you need to create a new low - level instruction tuple and emit your X86 assembler from a generate - insn method on that instruction .
This is a lot easier than it sounds thanks to the INSN : and CODEGEN : words .
I 've got to add some CAS instructions soon so I 'll probably write a bit about it then .
Dear Cecil :
When I buy over - the - counter pharmaceuticals from our local drug store , I always buy the house brand .
The active ingredients and dosages in Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) are identical to that of the copy .
The same is true of the Motrin alternative , the Sudafed clone , and so on — and they 're all much cheaper .
However , my wife insists on buying a brand name — she thinks I 'm some kind of cheapskate .
If the active ingredients in these drugs are the same , is there any difference in the quality of a brand name versus a house brand ?
Dave C. , Wisconsin
Cecil replies :
Let ’s put it this way : the differences are small .
That does n’t mean they are n’t important .
It also does n’t mean they are .
When the patents on a name - brand drug expire and competitors flood the market with knockoffs , prices can drop to astounding depths .
In a quick survey of ten common drugs , my assistant Una found generics offered savings of 15 to 94 percent off name - brand prices , with the average around 60 percent .
( The most dramatic difference , for you anxious types : Valium versus generic diazepam . )
That ’s in line with an FDA analysis , which found that having just two competing manufacturers for a drug chopped the price in half .
Not surprisingly , generics are used for nearly two - thirds of all U.S. prescriptions .
The key issue in name brands versus generics is quality control .
Branded drugs are tested extensively for effectiveness , side effects , and drug interactions — a slow , expensive process — and before the Waxman - Hatch Act of 1984 , so were generics .
The new law lowered the bar .
Generic drug makers now must merely show that they use approved manufacturing processes and that the active ingredients in their products are bioequivalent to those in branded drugs — that is , that they ’ll perform the same way in the human body .
To consider two drugs bioequivalent , the FDA requires reasonable but not exceptional confidence that they ’ll be within 20 to 25 percent of each other in terms of how much shows up in your bloodstream .
So there ’s room to cut corners , if you ’re so inclined .
How much difference might there be , then ?
Una , always game for an experiment , immediately fired up the Bunsen burners , but unfortunately we ’d blown the research budget on liquid analgesics .
( You ca n’t beat a Leinie ’s for long - lasting relief of a tension headache . )
So instead we repaired to the med library and established the following :
One study found generic versions of the heart disease drug digoxin were 40 percent more likely to have “ adverse events ” than branded digoxin .
Two studies of the epilepsy drug phenytoin found wide variation in the amount of medication delivered to the blood by branded versus generic versions — the drug concentration must fall within a narrow range to be effective .
A survey of epileptics who switched from branded to generic drugs found that more than 10 percent experienced reoccurrence of seizures .
After the heartless socialists running Ontario ’s health care system forced epileptics to take generic versions of the antiepileptic drug Lamictal , more than one in eight were switched back under doctor ’s orders due to problems .
Generic diazepam was found to have a significantly slower absorption rate than Valium — if you ’re waiting desperately for the stuff to kick in before boarding an airplane , it ’s small comfort to know you ’re saving big bucks .
The antipsychotic medication clozapine has shown significant differences between generic and branded versions ; in one study some patients suffered psychotic relapses after switching to generics .
And research suggests generic versions of the blood thinner heparin are so different they ca n’t be safely substituted for one another .
You can find plenty of arguments for why generic drugs might be inferior to name brands despite using the same active ingredients .
Many drugs do n’t dissolve well in water and require the addition of what are known as wetting agents to improve their solubility .
If the manufacturer of a generic substitutes a cheaper but less effective agent , too bad for you .
The brand - name drug maker Merck , assuredly a biased source , recommends against substitution of generics when small differences in dose cause a big difference in effect , as with blood thinners like warfarin .
Merck also raises the possibility that different inactive ingredients could cause allergic reactions .
Still , let ’s note the obvious : most of the drugs we ’ve been talking about here are used to treat serious conditions .
They ’re not really an argument for buying name - brand cough syrup .
The effectiveness of any drug varies with the individual .
If you ’re the methodical sort and the worst that could happen with a generic is your sniffles last longer , the logical approach is to find the cheapest thing that works .
Then again , judging the effectiveness of over - the - counter drugs is often subjective , and I ’m guessing your wife wo n’t sit still for a double - blind test .
If so , you might simply point out that in relatively low - stakes situations , at least , heard of it + costs more = good is an assumption that favors marketers , not the rest of us .

When a group of conservatives -- angered by a video showing kindergartners singing a song praising President Obama -- announced last week that they'd be protesting outside a Burlington Township , N.J. , school today , school officials asked them to reconsider , since the school -- which houses kindergartners to second - graders -- would be in session :
The planned rally has school district officials planning to beef up security at the B. Bernice Young School in Burlington Township , which houses kindergartners through second - graders .
The song drew national attention last month after a video of the performance was posted on YouTube .
Conservatives say it shows how schoolchildren are being indoctrinated to idolize Obama , allegations school officials have denied .
The Obama song initially was performed during a Black History Month assembly in February and was repeated in March when author Charisse Carney - Nunes , who wrote the children 's book " I Am Barack Obama , " visited the school .
Someone apparently with Carney - Nunes videotaped that performance and posted it at the author 's Web site without the approval of school officials .
A copy of that video appeared in September on YouTube , titled " School Kids Taught to Praise Obama . "
Citing concerns for the safety of students and staff , Superintendent Christopher Manno has asked organizers to reconsider the protest because classes will be held that day .
Manno said protesters will not be allowed on school property and additional district staffers will be on hand .
The protesters refused , of course , to reconsider :
Bill Haney , a rally organizer , said members of several groups would take part in the protest , although it was not clear Sunday how many people would be involved .
" Consider this a protest to squelch this trend to politicize our youth , " organizers said in a prepared statement .
" We are supporting the constitutional rights of our children and protest against the progressive social agenda promoted by the New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association . "
So there they were today , frightening children and their parents needlessly .
Of course , rather than harass schoolkids , these protesters would have been more effective if they had gone , say , to a school - board meeting where decisions like these are dealt with .
At least one of the parents whose 7 - year - old daughter was in the video spoke to Fox reporter Laura Ingle at the scene , and relayed her thoughts in a brief snippet :
My child 's image has been hijacked , to produce -- I 'm sorry , to promote a political agenda .
Now , Ingle makes this sound as if the parent is concerned about the school " indoctrinating " her child , which was what the protesters were there about .
But what 's clear from reading news accounts -- as well as Ingle 's own reportage -- is that the parents were upset that the right - wingers had transformed a harmless school song into a cause celebre promoting the right - wing anti-Obama agenda .
This cropped up in local news accounts too :
The school district , in a statement , said that it " does not believe that protesting in front of an elementary school in session with four to seven year old children is appropriate . "
The statement says that on Oct. 8 , Manno contacted one of the protest 's organizers personally and offered to meet with this person , who declined to meet .
" It is unfortunate , " the statement continued , " that an innocent , well - intentioned classroom activity by a well - respected teacher has become the object of so much debate . "
Well , who were these protesters ?
Local parents upset with the district ? --
You know , people who actually have something at stake with the conduct of their local schools ?
Erm , largely no .
The Courier - Post was only able to find one local couple who actually had a child at the school among the protesters ( and they were more concerned with the video 's release than with its content ) .
According to the NY Daily News , they were a bunch of Glennbeckians who arrived at the school from elsewhere :
Haney 's group , the 912 Project Burlington Group , is an offshoot [ of ] the national 912 Project founded by conservative radio and TV host Glenn Beck .
Haney said he hopes the rally will force the reassignment of school principal Denise King and will result in a reprimand of Schools Superintendent Christopher Manno by the state Board of Education .
Classy bunch , these folks .

The report warns the situation will be " extremely challenging "
There is a " significant risk " that global production of conventional oil could " peak " and decline by 2020 , a report has warned .
The UK Energy Research Centre study says there is a consensus that the era of cheap oil is at an end .
But it warns that most governments , including the UK's , exhibit little concern about oil depletion .
The report 's authors also state that the 10 largest oil producing fields in the world are all in decline .
Reliable gauge
As this report points out , the debate about peak oil is a polarised one .
More than two - thirds of current crude oil production capacity may need to be replaced by 2030
UK Energy Research Centre
On one side , there are those who say that global supplies have already reached their zenith , and we are unprepared for the crisis that will hit world economies in the years to come .
On the other , there are oil companies and many energy analysts who dismiss the notion that supplies are running out .
The report 's authors admit it is hard to tell who is right , as the world lacks a reliable gauge with which to measure oil depletion .
Problems are created by " inconsistent definitions " , it says , noting the " paucity of reliable data , the frequent absence of third - party auditing of that data and the corresponding uncertainty surrounding the data that is available " .
It goes on : " The difficulties are greatest where they matter most , namely the oil reserves of Opec countries .
" But they also apply at a much more basic level , such as uncertainties over the amount of oil produced by a given country in a given year .
THE PEAK OIL DEBATE
There is little consensus about when the global oil production curve will hit its peak - or if it has already done so Modelling the curve takes into account proven reserves and varying estimates of oil stored in wells , shale , oil sands etc .
Some estimates suggest a production " plateau " instead of a simple decline Global market factors like the uptake of renewable energy sources strongly influence the oil production curve " The resulting confusion both fuels the peak oil debate and creates substantial risk in relying on any particular set of numbers . "
Part of the difficulty in estimating the amount of oil left is that those with the reserves are often unwilling to divulge what can be commercially very sensitive information .
Countries and companies are notoriously reticent about their oil reserves .
But the report suggests the easy oil has already been found , and new reserves will become increasingly difficult and expensive to extract , and will not make up for the current major oil fields as they decline .
It says : " More than two - thirds of current crude oil production capacity may need to be replaced by 2030 , simply to keep production constant .
" At best , this is likely to prove extremely challenging . "
More attention urged
This report does not contain new research , but is a review of data already available .
But the authors say the risk presented by global oil depletion deserves much more serious attention by the research and policy communities .
" Much existing research focuses upon the economic and political threats to oil supply security and fails to either assess or to effectively integrate the risks presented by physical depletion , " they argue .
" This has meant that the probability and consequences of different outcomes has not been adequately assessed . "
Despite the evidence , the report notes with some surprise that the UK government rarely mentions the issue in official publications .

Susan Davis reports on politics .
Here ’s a shocker : an online poll at www.ronpaul.com that asks if Texas Republican Rep. Ron
Paul should run for president again in 2012 shows an overwhelming majority believe he should .
Some 93 % of the nearly 3,000 voters said he should run in 2012 , while 3 % said he should n’t and 1 % said they do n’t know .
Online polls are unscientific and it ’s no surprise that visitors to a grassroots
Web site in support of the Texas Republican ’s political agenda favor him running again .
Paul scored few votes in 2008 , but his bid made him a household name and his warnings about the state of the U.S. economy have proved prescient at times .
If Paul were to run , he would turn 77 in August 2012 — five years older than Arizona GOP Sen .
John McCain was in the 2008 campaign where his age was an issue .
But Paul may be considering it .
He will speak Nov. 9 in South Carolina ( a key primary state ) at an event to discuss the “ future of individual liberty and the importance of the U.S. Constitution . ”
And the following week he will travel to Iowa for appearances in Ames and Des Moines .
Readers :
What do you think ?
Should Ron Paul run for president again ?
Scott Buckwald has been the prop master on a variety of popular movies and television programs , including Race to Witch Mountain and The Prestige .
Recently , Buckwald spoke with us about his experiences as a prop master for AMC ’s hit show Mad Men .
He discussed what life was like in the early 1960s , when Mad Men takes place , and the lengths he had to go to to source and create authentic period props for the show .
I always wanted to work in film , but I did n’t have anybody in my family who worked in the film business .
I ’ve been a major movie buff since I was a child , and I ’ve always been very meticulous .
I ’ve always been a collector .
The Beatles are definitely my main thing , but my wife and I collect old metal lunch boxes and I ’ve always just been good at holding onto things .
I have a fairly nice collection of movie memorabilia .
For example , I like collecting police badges .
I did the first props for The Shield , so I have Michael Chiklis ’ detective badge .
I ’ll also collect autographs of all the actors I ’ve worked with , which is something I started very early in my career .
Usually I ’ll have them sign a photograph or , if they have them , a lunch box or an action figure .
I ’m kind of geeky in that respect .
I studied history in college , which was great training for doing prop research .
When I got out of school , I started pursuing film .
I started out as a production assistant .
It was like going to summer camp — you see all the different activities , and you just decide which direction you want to head in .
I ’ve always been good at tinkering and building things , making little toys and trinkets , so I was attracted to the props department .
I started doing movies that had budgets that you and I could probably put together with our spare change .
But 20 years later , here I am , so it found me as much as I found it .
“ On a feature movie , you have 10 weeks of prep before the first day of shooting begins .
On a TV series , you have a week . ”
There are many steps to it .
It ’s not just going out and finding the props ; it ’s also maintaining them , putting them in the actor ’s hand , making sure that the continuity is correct , and making sure the props are always available .
So it ’s very much a full - time job .
I went to work yesterday at noon and got home this morning at 5:00 am .
It was a very long day .
It ’s also a lot of fun .
We were in the process of wrapping a movie last night , so I just got Betty White ’s autograph , which was a kick .
She signed a picture of herself firing a handgun from a recent TV episode she did .
It ’s a very uncharacteristic picture .
It ’s a funny photo .
She was just amazing to work with .
In 1995 , I was working with Kevin Pollak .
We took continuity pictures every time he came into a room wearing eyeglasses and a watch and what not — we take a picture in every scene just to match it .
Every single time we took a picture of Kevin , he would flip us off .
He would just give us the middle finger .
I decided this would be my constant .
So , since 1995 , I ’ve made sure to get at least one picture of every actor I ’ve worked with flipping me off , except Betty White .
Having 86 - year - old Betty
White giving me a grimace and a middle finger would be worth the price of admission .
I would love to do that .
One of the nice things about doing props on set is that I have a one - on - one relationship with the actors .
Because I have physical contact with them we get to talk , so a relationship can develop .

Weekly :
What sets Mad Men ’s focus on historical accuracy apart from other shows set in a particular time period ?
Buckwald : I do n’t really know that anything necessarily does .
First of all , I think that the promotion of the show has really highlighted its historical accuracy .
Mad Men exists in a world that people still remember .
You ’ll have people who were working in 1960 going , “ Oh , my God . I remember that item . ”
Most people are not historians .
Most people are not totally geeked out about any one time in history , so they really do n’t know .
If you do a Revolutionary War movie and you put in a weapon that did n’t come about until the War of 1812 , the majority of people are n’t going to know .
But part of the charm of a show like Mad Men is that it ’s about our life .
I was n’t alive in 1960 , but I was born in 1963 , so I remember a lot of that stuff from when I was a little boy in ’ 68 and ’ 69 .
History does n’t just change on a dime .
Things that existed in 1960 also existed in 1970 , and are still easily accessible thanks to photos .
It ’s still within our grasp .
Collectors
Weekly : Can you tell us a little bit about that Mad Men advertising world of the early 1960s ?
Buckwald :
It was definitely a transitional time when America was losing its innocence .
Mad Men takes place right before The Beatles .
When most people say , “ Oh , the 1960s were such a great time , ” they ’re talking about the period after February of 1964 .
Before February of 1964 , Elvis was in the army , and popular music meant Bobby Vinton , Frankie Avalon , and that kind of bubblegum , wimpy rock .
Rock and roll was on the way out and anybody who said Elvis was a fad was about to be proven right .
America had experienced World War II and the Korean War , and now , thanks to the Cuban missile crisis , global destruction was pretty much at our doorstep .
We were on the verge of nuclear destruction , more so probably than at any time in this country ’s history .
Vietnam was coming up and there was lots of sexism and racism — the world was a pretty scary place .
In response , I think we tried to see the world as we wanted to see it , not as it really was .
That ’s where advertising came in .
For the first time , people realized that you could harness TV and radio to put out advertising — you could use these new mediums to try to convince people to do things that common sense would normally dictate they should run away from .
For example , major actors advertised cigarettes , saying they soothed the throat .
Mad Men shows all of that .
They ’ve done episodes in which the ad men are trying to sell the virtues of smoking at a time when the surgeon general is about to release a report saying that the habit is n’t healthy .
Still , Mad Men is a TV show , and TV shows are on the air to make money .
Their principal mission is not to educate .
If you get educational value out of a show that ’s great , but it ’s only a secondary benefit .
The 1960s are n’t as different from today as people may think .
A lot of times people have the misconception that it ’s totally different , and I know we had it from members of the crew .
They ’d say , “ I did n’t know they had ballpoint pens in 1960 . ”
I wanted to have T - shirts made that said , “ This is 1960 , not 1860 . ”
If you were born in 1987 and you and I joined hands and jumped into a time machine and went back to 1960 , you would feel totally comfortable there .
The cars were different .
They only had seven channels on the TV as opposed to 500 .
The movie theaters usually only had one screen instead of 21 .
But the world was pretty much as it is today .
People had the same hopes and desires , the same fears .
Things that made people laugh then make people laugh today .
You had supermarkets , you had cars , you had airplanes .
It was pretty much modern America , just styled differently .
Hop on a jet in New York and you ’re in Los Angeles six hours later .
You can go to the supermarket and fill your grocery cart with 20 different brands of paper towels and four brands of shampoo .
Same with dishes :
There were different colors and different styles , but they were still basically the same dishes as today .
Forks and knives and spoons did n’t look any different .

Weekly : Did you use vintage items on Mad Men or were they reproductions ?
Buckwald : Usually if it was paper , like a magazine or a newspaper , I would reproduce it .
I do a lot of my own graphics .
I ’ve remade Volkswagen ads on my computer , and I remade “ Advertising Age ” magazine .
I ’ve redone “ TV Guides , ” even if they do n’t exist anymore or they ’re very hard to find .
When I get hired for a feature movie , I have 10 weeks of prep before the first day of shooting begins .
On a TV series , you have a week .
I get the script for the next episode and I have one week to start prepping it , so I do n’t have the resources to find an issue of “ Advertising Age ” that looks now like it looked brand new in 1960 .
So usually the quickest , most direct route is to reproduce it .
We ’ll find pictures of it , or we might find an old pattern issue of a magazine , and then I ’ll redo it .
I ’m constantly redoing book covers .
In one scene , a couple is reading in bed , and I could n’t find a copy of the book that looked brand new — the pages were yellowed or it was faded — so I found a new book and remade the cover based on the original .
But with hard goods like watches and rings , or if someone is supposed to carry a briefcase or have a gun , that stuff is easier to find , and I have sources for that .
There ’s a prop house called History For Hire , but even there , we very often have to take the prop and make it look new again .
For example , we may have to take an old bicycle and have it repainted and spruced up because sometimes things that sit on a prop - house shelf look like they have 50 years of age on them .
If the show takes place 50 years ago , the item ca n’t show that amount age .
It needs to look new , like it did back in the day .
So it ’s a combination of vintage and reproduction items .
A lot of times I ’ll go on eBay and look for things .
When I know I need a period item , I ’ll buy it from another collector .
One thing nice about working for the movies is that there have been times when I ’ve called up somebody and said , “ Look , I need this in three days , it ’s for a movie . ”
And they ’re like , “ Wow .
My thing is going to be in a movie , ” and they get excited .
Collectors
Weekly : Besides the paper items , what were some of the hardest props to find for Mad Men ?
Buckwald :
We had a wardrobe , which is essentially a big vinyl plastic bag that you would put your clothes in .
It has a wooden hanger , and it hangs in a closet .
You can still buy them at Target but the design is different .
There was one scene in which the actress takes this wardrobe out of her closet , lays it on the bed , and pulls her dress out of it .
The problem was that these wardrobes were made out of very thin vinyl .
Really , it was just a big vinyl bag , and it ’s not collectible like an old Coca - Cola sign or a Barbie doll .
It ’s not the kind of thing that someone would put away and preserve .
It ’s as glamorous as the tube inside of a roll of toilet paper .
When you ’re done with it , you throw it away .
There is no collectible value to it .
So I have to find one of these wardrobes , which is not an easy thing .
Unlike a paper product , I ca n’t just print one off my computer , and we do n’t have the time to rebuild one from scratch .
I searched everywhere , called every prop house , every wardrobe house , every costume house .
It looked like we were n’t going to find it , but at the last minute , I found one on eBay .
Somebody had one and I e-mailed him and I said , “ Look , I need this right away . ”
So he sent it to me right away , and it was brand new in the package .
It was from 1959 or 1960 and the package had never been opened .
I got it , opened the package , and the plastic was all dried up .
The thing was falling apart in my hands !
But it did give me a pattern .
We took it to a manufacturer and they were able to take new vinyl plastic that was the same color and texture as the original and build that over the old , rotting - out one .
So , $ 500 later , we had a new wardrobe , and it was vibrant .
And there you have it .
It was remade .
Again , on a feature film , you have more time to do it .
It ’s not as much of a crunch , but that ’s part of being a prop master — ultimately , we are Aladdin ’s lamp .
All the director needs to say is , “ Scott , I need one , ” and then I find it .
There ’s a prop house near Los Angeles called ISS ; I do n’t think you ’ll find a better one on the planet .
They have full manufacturing facilities , and there ’s literally nothing they can’t build .
I ca n’t even remember all the things I ’ve had them build for me over the years .
They do n’t just reproduce things .
They made weapons for Star Trek .
They made gadgets used in Race to Witch Mountain .
They built all of these weapons and gadgets for me from scratch .
Their facility is second to none .
Taking a tour of their facilities would just blow you away .
The Changeling , the Clint Eastwood - directed movie with Angelina Jolie , is a period film , set in the 1930s , I believe .
Angelina Jolie is a telephone operator , and you see the room with the patch board and all this old electronic equipment .
ISS built it all , and they made it look brand new .
To me , they created that scene .
The set decorator might win an Oscar for creating the set , but it ’s certainly a place like ISS that does the actual hands - on work to recreate the items .
Collectors
Weekly :
So it ’s a collaborative process ?
Buckwald :
Of course — no one possesses all the skills to do everything .
With a show like Mad Men , the writer comes up with the idea , the producer will work with his vision , and then it ’ll come to me .
I ’ll draw it out , take photographs , find pictures of the thing when it existed , and talk to a production designer .
Then the two of us will finalize what it should look like .
Because Mad Men is realistic , coming up with the pictures and the design was usually more my responsibility because I did n’t need to have someone help me create what it should look like .
If the item had existed , I would do the research and find a picture of what it looked like .
I ’d submit a picture and say , “ Here it is . ”
And then I would bring it to ISS , for example , and they would build it for me .
But if it ’s for a fantasy show , like if it ’s a sci - fi movie and there is no intergalactic walkie - talkie in real life , the production designer and I will come up with concept drawings , and then we ’ll make an initial model of it .
The director will look at it and approve it or not approve it or make little changes to it , and then , finally , we ’ll have one built based on the prototype .
By the time it ’s done , it looks like something real and off - the - shelf .
Collectors
Weekly : Besides the wardrobe , what were some of the most obscure items you ’ve had to find for Mad Men ?
Buckwald :
There was one time when January Jones , one of the lead actresses , was supposed to be putting together a birthday celebration but she did n’t have a birthday cake , so she goes to her freezer and defrosts a Sara Lee cherry cheesecake .
The cheesecake was n’t hard to reproduce , but we had to make the box that it came in .
Getting the Sara Lee logo from 1960 was easy , but finding an actual cheesecake box was hard .
Again , that ’s not very collectible .
Pretty much the second after the cake was taken out , the box would have been thrown away , so I looked through pictures of kitchen scenes , hoping to find a cherry cheesecake box sitting there .
After looking through 3,000 pictures , I was able to capture every angle of the box and I was able to redraw it on Illustrator and tweak it on Photoshop and then print it out and rebuild the box .
Packaging often takes a lot of work because sometimes the original source material just is n’t readily available .
It ’s really hard to remake something when you do n’t have pictures of what it actually looked like .
There was an episode in which we had to redo a Volkswagen ad from “ Life ” magazine .
That was easy because Volkswagen ads are collectible .
You go to Google and you type in “ classic Volkswagen ad 1960 ” and you get pictures of them .
The source material is there , so it ’s easy .
You also have a time clock ticking over your head with the producer tapping you incessantly on the shoulder saying , “ Is it done yet ?
Is it done yet ?
Is it done yet ? ”
Not only do you have to make the cheesecake box , a hundred other props are also needed for that episode .
Collectors
Weekly :
You mentioned looking at images of kitchens .
How many different rooms from the 1960s did you have to study ?
Buckwald :
The rooms are more set decorating , but the set decorator would certainly take the same steps that I would for each room .
I own a lot of period movies from that time .
I would n’t watch a modern - day movie about the 1960s , I would go back to original source material from the era .
“ Life ” magazine is great for that .
“ Playboy ” magazine is fantastic for research , too , because unlike other magazines of that genre , “ Playboy ” was always very much into fashion .
It really was a magazine that you could honestly buy just for the articles , and the articles in “ Playboy ” have always been terrific .
They would publish articles about the latest and greatest stereo equipment and cars and fashion .
It ’s just a wonderful resource for stuff like that .
You have to go back and recreate the past .
The nice thing about 1960 is that it was n’t that long ago , so the world was photographed in color .
There were movies and TV shows .
There ’s an amazing amount of information without having to dig too deep .
You go back to a show I did like The Prestige , which I think is far more stylized than Mad Men , and the research material is not as readily available because it takes place in 1890s London .
You ca n’t just go find movies of magicians that take place in the 1890s .
It ’s a great deal more work .
Collectors
Weekly :
So do you deal mostly with the hand props ?
Buckwald : Yes .
If you pick it up , it ’s a prop .
Also , for some reason , I do n’t know why , decals on a vehicle are considered props .
In Mad Men , if we did a 1960 police car , the transportation coordinator would get the actual vehicle , but it would be up to me to put all the police stickers on it .
I have to make sure that the graphics are all period correct .
If it ’s an ambulance or a fire engine , all the decals on it are mine .
Food also falls into props .
In Mad Men , there ’s an amazing amount of food .
Every episode would have a high - end restaurant and a home - cooked meal , and that ’s totally mine to cook .
You want to have food that ’s right for the time period .
You might have a burger , but probably not a bacon cheeseburger , because that just was n’t in fashion yet .
A white American family would n’t be going out for burritos and tacos in 1960 .
It just was n’t there yet .
So there ’s an amazing amount of research just for food .
Collectors
Weekly :
Do you cook the food yourself ?
Buckwald :
It depends what it is .
If it ’s a home - cooked meal and it ’s a smaller scene , I tend to do it .
I ’m a fairly competent cook for short - order food , but if the food is more stylized , like if it ’s from a really nice , high - end restaurant , I have a very brilliant chef I work with .
His name is Michael McDonald , and we ’ve been working together for years .
The guy is an artist .
He did all the period food on The Prestige , serving food that people actually ate in the 1890s , even keeping in mind that certain food was n’t available at certain times of the year .
For example , green salad was n’t popular in the 1890s because they did n’t have a way to keep it fresh and refrigerated .
I only learned that because Michael did the research .
A lot of the high - end restaurants served different styles of food in the 1960s than they do today .
Michael got all that for me .
For You Again , which I ’m working on right now , we ’re doing a million - dollar wedding , and the set decorator came up with this absolutely brilliant under - the - sea kind of theme .
Michael came up with food , it was just gorgeous .
Each hors d’oeuvre was a piece of sculpture .
Machine guns , handguns , and shotguns are also props .
All weapons on movies are 100 % real .
When you see Saving Private Ryan or a Sylvester Stallone or Schwarzenegger movie , all those weapons are real .
Those are not plastic toy cap guns .
Collectors
Weekly :
When it came to the Mad Men office scenes , did you have to get vintage typewriters and pencils and pens ?
Buckwald :
Well , pencils are pencils .
There ’s no change in the pencils , and a lot of offices were using ballpoint pens .
Fountain pens had largely disappeared .
Certainly for formal use , the fountain pen was still there , but not as an everyday office tool .
I thought Mad Men made a big mistake on the typewriters .
They knew what the right history was , but they ignored it .
The secretaries at that advertising firm would have still been using vintage - style typewriters , but they used IBM Selectrics simply because the producer liked the way they looked and they made less noise on set .
So we got many letters about how they were wrong , but , again , that ’s his call .
And right or wrong , it ’s his show .
He can do whatever he wants with it .
There was a typewriter repairman in North Hollywood , California .
He could n’t believe it when all of a sudden someone deposited 24 vintage typewriters on his doorstep and said , “ Make them look new . ”
He probably had n’t had that much work in the last 25 years .
He was probably just about ready to hang up the “ Going out of business ” sign and cursing the arrival of the laptop computer when all of a sudden here I come with 24 typewriters .
Collectors
Weekly :
What are some of the other antique or vintage items that you ’ve worked with on Mad Men ?
Buckwald :
We had a vintage rifle , which was a real gun .
And I had to put meters in the taxicabs .
How do you find vintage taxicab meters and make them look nice and new ?
But the show is about advertising , so it was mostly a case of recreating newspapers and magazine layouts more than anything else .
There ’s an episode in which the firm was going to be promoting women ’s lipstick , so we needed a department store countertop display case .
My assistant made a lipstick display case from scratch .
He found pictures of it , laid it out , designed it , and made it .
It was brilliant .
We ’ve created little household items , little point - of - purchase trinkets , stuff like that .
It was an amazing amount of work .
You watch the show and you might not notice it because sometimes the camera does n’t always capture the little things you do .
Hopefully , as a whole , it all kind of adds up .
You ca n’t expect every item that you make to be celebrated .
Collectors
Weekly :
What are some of the advertisements that you recreated ?
Buckwald :
We created advertisements for Gillette shaving cream .
We did advertisements for Volkswagen .
We worked the campaign for Nixon versus Kennedy .
We did advertisements for cigarettes .
We created old Coca - Cola ads and a Coca - Cola ad photo shoot , which was a lot of fun because old Coke memorabilia is something that I ’ve always been really fond of .
I have a bunch of old Coke signs hanging on my wall .
I ’m not a super big collector , but I have a nice amount of stuff .
It ’s more for its beauty than anything else .
Collectors
Weekly :
You mentioned you are a Beatles collector .
Can you tell us more about that ?
Buckwald : I ’ve been collecting probably since about the time I was 12 .
I collect both memorabilia and records .
I have 25 Beatles Butcher covers in all different conditions .
I have a first state of the Beatles Butcher cover album in beautiful condition , still with its original cellophane on it , never been touched .
I have toys in the original boxes .
I have advertising displays .
I have movie posters .
I have all the lunch boxes .
I go for really good condition stuff .
I have like six Beatles record players .
I ’m always on the lookout for those .
That , to me , is really a crown jewel in a Beatles memorabilia collection .
The record player is just like none other .
Collectors
Weekly :
When you collect props , you get them from the set that you worked on , right ?
Buckwald :
It depends .
If I have to buy it or build it , it ’s being done with the studio ’s money , so it ’s not mine .
My job is to get it for the studio , keep it clean , keep it in good shape , and make sure it ’s in the movie .
When the movie is over , sometimes I ’ll ask the producer , “ Do you mind if I keep this ? ” because we ’ll always have doubles , if not triples .
When you ’re doing period work , if it ’s a hero prop ( in other words , something that the actor uses throughout an entire film or episode ) , I make two of them , because if one gets stolen , is lost , or breaks , we are still going to need it in the next scene .
Sometimes an actor walks down the street carrying something , and then he turns the corner and we see him come from another angle , and those two different shots may be filmed a month apart .
If the prop gets broken over the course of that month or if the actor drops it in take one , I need to have another one ready to go for take two .
So when the movie is done , if I have a good relationship with the producer , a lot of times I ’ll say , “ You know what , I love this .
Do you mind if I keep it ? ” and they ’ll say yes or no .
I did American Pie 3 : The American Wedding .
In that movie , when Jason Biggs proposes to Alyson Hannigan , he gives her a diamond engagement ring .
That ring is out of my collection .
It ’s a knockoff fake ring that was valued at $ 10 , but it became famous because it got screen time , so now it ’s been put aside and I display it .
It ’s on a shelf celebrating being a prop from that movie .
So if it starts out in my kit and it becomes famous , then I usually set it aside and I do n’t use it again in another movie .
It ’s becomes collectible to me .
Collectors
Weekly : Did you get attached to anything in Mad Men ?
Buckwald : The Coca - Cola stuff was terrific .
Luckily a bunch of that stuff was from my own collection , which was nice .
I rent my personal items to the production , and it ’s great because it saves them money and it makes me a couple extra dollars .
A lot of the things I liked in Mad Men were the household goods , like an old toaster , and the old cars .
I just love looking at the old cars .
It really brings you into the moment .
I like a little bit of everything from Mad Men simply because it ’s a period in time that I love .
That pop culture , Americana feel is just fantastic .
Collectors
Weekly :
If someone is drinking Coca - Cola in Mad Men , would you have to get the actual Coca - Cola bottle from 1960 ?
Buckwald : Yes .
Vintage Coca - Cola bottles are pretty easy to get , so I would get the bottles , fill them up with Coke , and use a bottle capper to press the original caps back on .
We did an episode when the first canned Coca - Cola was coming out .
Coke was trying to promote its first cans , but they were nothing like today ’s cans .
There ’s nothing similar to it .
Even the material of the can was different .
It was steel as opposed to aluminum .
So I had to remake the original Coke can , which was a blast .
Believe or not , we actually found a peanut jar in the New York area that was the same size and shape of a Coke can .
It was metal on the top but the sides were cardboard .
We made a decal of a Coke label and wrapped it around the jar .
By the touch , you could tell that it was n’t made out of metal , but on camera it looked like a metal Coke can .
It ’s always turning one thing into another .
That ’s what I love about doing this .
It ’s always last - minute thinking and being innovative — being the mad scientist .
It never gets boring because everything is different .
In Mad Men , I was a 1960s advertising executive .
In The Prestige , I was a 1890s magician .
In You Again , I ’m a 2009 wedding planner .
I ’ve been a policeman .
I ’ve been a doctor .
I ’ve been a lawyer .
I ’ve been a gynecologist .
I get to step into other people ’s lives .
Doing props is like being an actor in the movie because you have to create a character .
If I ever went back in time , I might be able to be an advertising executive in the 1960s simply because of the research I ’ve done .
As a collector , it ’s perfect for me because not only do I get to come in contact with a lot of the things I collect and the things I love being around , but I get to play with these things in their original surroundings .
It ’s one thing to go to the zoo and see a lion .
It ’s another thing to go to Africa and run with the lion .
And that ’s what propping allows me to do .
Collectors
Weekly :
So what was it like to be an ad exec in the 1960s ?
Buckwald :
Very frustrating because there was never enough time to get my teeth into it as much as I would ’ve liked .
It was a different world .
If you were a sexist swine , you did n’t cover it up .
You were a sexist swine .
Today , people will try to be far more politically correct and say the things that they think other people want them to say .
But again , it ’s a TV show , and it portrays advertising executives the way the producer wants them to portray them .
I ’m sure there are many advertising executives who ’d go , “ I was nothing like that .
I would never chase women around the office , ” and “ I would never consider having an affair . ”
So that ’s why I said earlier that it ’s is a TV show , not a history lesson .
If you want to learn about advertising in 1960 , watching Mad Men might be an okay primer .
If I had to write a college thesis on 1960 advertising , Mad Men would be a footnote .
I would watch it , look at it , get a little bit of flavor from it , and then do my real research .
Collectors
Weekly :
What advice do you have for someone who wants to collect props ?
Buckwald :
If you want to collect new props , going to the prop master is probably best because you want to get it from the person who knows where it was born .
These days , a lot of studios will hire an auction house to sell key items from a movie to help them recoup some of their production costs .
Twenty years ago , the studios could n’t care less what happened to this stuff .
Usually after filming , they were happy for me to take everything back because then they did n’t have to worry about storage .
Now , whether a prop belongs to a studio or an independent producer , they paid for it , so it ’s theirs .
I take great care in wrapping it up , inventorying it , and photographing it for possible reshoots or sequels , but at the end of the day , it belongs to the studio .
Unfortunately , even a prop bought from a studio is not an absolute guarantee of authenticity .
I remember one movie that came out , it was a big hit , and an item from it was put up for sale .
It turned out not to be the original prop .
It was purchased from the same supplier , but for whatever reason the real item was no longer available .
I do n’t know whether the studio did this unintentionally or if they knew .
They could ’ve had the best of intentions , but that ’s an example of why collecting props is so hard .
The item was the same as the original , but its history was a lie .
Treat buying props the way you treat buying an autograph — even the most honest dealer could be selling you something that they think is original but may not be .
Lots of people forge autographs , but forging a prop is even easier because you ’re not really forging the thing itself , you ’re just forging its lineage , and there ’s really no way to trace that .
Even with specialty items like a pistol from Star Wars , for example , there are so many people molding and re-sculpting things .
I ’ve seen items come up for sale when I know I own the only one .
Collectors have to be very careful .
You can get props from auctions or from eBay , but most props are not specifically manufactured for a particular movie .
Sci -fi props or the Indiana Jones kind of props —items that do n’t exist in the real world — are specifically made for a film , but 99 percent of all props are just common household items that all of a sudden get famous .
It ’s a particular wedding ring that an actress wears , or a particular wristwatch .
There ’s nothing that gives it uniqueness other than its pedigree in a movie .
I worked on the Terminator TV series , The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
There are websites devoted to reproductions of the props I made .
I made driver ’s licenses and passports , and we made a gun of the future .
If you go online , you will find people who have watched the TV show , captured photos from it , and remanufactured different props that I made .
You can buy Star Wars light sabers and Star Trek communicators , and even though they ’re reproductions , sometimes they look better than the originals .
So really , I think the one key piece of advice is whenever you buy a movie prop , know its source .

Creating truly liveable neighborhoods , one square mile at a time
by Ben Cohen
The popular show ' To Catch a Predator ' snares potential pedophiles by luring them into houses after being promised sex on the internet by the NBC TV show .
They are confronted by the host Chris Hansen who humiliates them on camera by reading a transcript of their online chat , then allows them to leave only to be arrested by the local police department .
The criminals are predominantly nondescript , fat and balding middle aged men with about as much sex appeal as Rush Limbaugh .
Sympathy is n't the first emotion one feels for them as they are bustled to the floor , hand cuffed and read their rights on national TV , because in the pecking order of criminality , they rank right at the bottom .

However , contrast this with the treatment of film director Roman Polanski , who did n't just talk about sex with a minor , but drugged , raped and sodomized a child then fled the country to avoid jail time .
The European artistic community is up in arms at his arrest in Switzerland demanding he be released , and several prominent directors have signed a petition for him to be excused .
The logic ?
Apparently , his talent obscures any criminal act he may have committed .
Imagine Polanski as a run of the mill computer technician from Ohio who had raped a 13 year old girl .
Would anyone give a damn whether he was arrested and thrown into the most violent prison in America ?
Not likely .

But an artist of Polanski's stature ?
Heavens no !
I 've been scratching my head as to why otherwise sane people could argue Polanski's case , and have yet to understand it .
Chez Pazienza has perhaps the best explanation I 've read so far :
They live in a fantasy universe revolving solely around them , that
they 've been told " yes " for so long that they believe the rules no
longer apply to them -- these have a certain amount of validity .
Is
there a better explanation as to why so many intelligent people would
come together with one voice and proclaim loudly that one of their own
is above the law ?
Other than that , the only conclusion I can come up with is that anyone arguing Polanski should be released is a ) a pedophile , or b ) a victim of child rape and unable to come to terms with what happened to them .
Either way , it 's very , very sad .
There are thousands of websites that have amusing pictures of pets , but here 's one that looks at them from another angle .

Dogs features pictures of dogs lying on their backs .
The pictures are rotated through 180 degrees so that the dogs seem to be the right way up , resulting in some very strange facial expressions

Swarm power for Germany
According to German news magazine Der Spiegel , the mini power plants have an efficiency of 94 percent , while most atomic power plants have a 30 percent to 40 percent efficiency .
by Staff Writers
Hamburg , Germany ( UPI ) Sep 11 , 2009
How about a power station in your basement ?
In a bid to create a decentralized electricity grid , German carmaker Volkswagen is launching thousands of mini power plants that could be installed in the basements of any residential home .
Together with clean energy provider Lichtblick , Volkswagen plans to install up to 100,000 small power plants -- able to generate heat and electricity -- in people 's homes to generate enough energy to offset two nuclear power plants .
Taken together , all mini plants would have a capacity of 2 GW .
The project could lure many Germans away from traditional utilities toward decentralized energy generation , which experts say will be the buzzword of tomorrow 's energy mix .
The so - called at - home plants will be run by a natural gas engine based on the one that 's powering the VW Golf car , marketed in North America as Rabbit .
" A lot of parts necessary for building mini power plants are already available in most modern cars , " Rudolf Krebs , Volkswagen 's engine developer , said in a statement .
Besides producing heat and power for their homes , the plants would feed excessive electricity into the regular grid .
They would be connected electronically to create a giant intelligent power plant that can offset fluctuating energy demand and stabilize the grid , the companies involved say .
" You have to imagine the at - home plants like a swarm of fish : Many small units form a large , powerful community that creates swarm power , " Lichtblick Chief Executive Officer Christian Friege said in a statement .
According to German news magazine Der Spiegel , the mini power plants have an efficiency of 94 percent , while most atomic power plants have a 30 percent to 40 percent efficiency .
For Volkswagen , the plant project is an alternative business model in times of slumping car sales .
The Wolfsburg - based car giant , fresh from a merger with Porsche , said that the mini power plant project would likely secure manufacturing jobs .
The carmaker plans to build around 10,000 mini plant engines per year in its factory in Salzgitter .
The at - home plant is already on sale in Hamburg ( it costs $ 7,300 and is best suited for installation in an apartment building , where it should amortize rather quickly ) and will be rolled out in all of Germany in 2010 .
A report out of Colorado on Wednesday provides even further evidence to support what we all know to be true : it 's a terrifically bad time to be in law school .
According to this story in Colorado Law Week , only about 35 percent of the University of Colorado School of Law 's class of 2009 had jobs at graduation , down from 55 percent the year before .
The law school at Denver University did n't provide Law Week statistics , but Misae Nishkura , the assistant dean for the school 's Career Development Center , confirmed that " there are ...

Over the last few weeks I 've been talking to people within the comics industry to try to sniff out Apple 's plans , including Neal Adams , developer of an upcoming motion Astonishing X - Men comic on iTunes , who also told me the French saying .
Everyone in Adams ' line of work is buzzing about the tablet and what it can do for their masterpieces .
It 's an easy presumption for comic book fans .
The Sun Times ' Andy Inhatko is betting that LongBox , a digital distribution platform for comic books , will make an appearance on Apple 's upcoming tablet .
More than just an appearance , really :
I 'm pretty sure that Apple is entering into a formal alliance with LongBox .
When I asked [ LongBox CEO Rantz ]
Hoseley about what kind of partnerships the company is forming , he spoke vaguely of what was taking up most of his time at the moment : a lengthy and complicated agreement with a seriously large company operating in the media space .

One problem : Several sources I spoke to over the last couple of weeks , including top - level executives at giants like Marvel and DC , have said they 've not heard a whisper from Apple — despite a nearly desperate hope that Apple would come a - courtin ' .
One executive said to me , when I mentioned the possibility of putting his comic books on the Apple tablet , " If you 've heard anything from Apple , please tell them I 'm ready to do it . "
That means that LongBox may be the only distribution option for comic books at the tablet 's launch , through some sort of dedicated LongBox app .
And if LongBox 's distribution plan for the Apple tablet is just an app , why would they need to do any negotiations with Apple ?
Launch the LongBox app , sell the content , and go .
No Apple nod necessary .

We know that Apple has been reaching out to select publishers .
It was Andy Inhatko who passed on the rumor about " trucks loaded with books " earlier this year .
It all fits with the moves we already know Apple is making in its outreach to magazine and newspaper publishers .
For Apple , the tablet is about cleaning up ; with the addition of books , newspaper , magazines and comic books , there is n't a single vector of mass media that Apple wo n't be able to distribute through iTunes .
With the success of the App Store — a success I think even Apple was n't expecting to such a degree — they 're even a major distributor of software and games .

Oh right , there 's also music and video .
Marvel content , especially , seems like a given .
Disney bought Pixar , putting Steve Jobs on the Disney board .
Then Disney buys Marvel .
Marvel has already dabbled in publishing content through iTunes , with a new " motion comic " version of The Astonishing X - Men hitting iTunes on October 28th .

The first Read more
I spoke to Inhatko on my tiny Apple tablet last week about his story .
He 's increasingly persuaded that Apple is content to let print publishers distribute their content through apps , not through the iTunes store itself .

He may very well be right , at least at the tablet 's launch , especially given Apple 's reticence to even acknowledge the tablet 's existence , let alone provide publishers with detailed , unified specifications for an " iRead " format .
But it also strikes me as an inelegant solution at best , especially considering iTunes 9's iTunes LP format is an HTML - and JavaScript - based 720 p format that would work just wonderfully for a digital magazine and comics format .
Could just be wishful thinking on my part —
I 'd rather manage subscriptions through iTunes like podcasts , rather than individual apps — but either way it 's a win for Apple , who will happily get their cut no matter what system of digital print distribution ultimately takes off .
If you have any leads on comic book tablet activity , by all means , send us a tip .

There is one shocker I discovered in my discussions with Marvel folk :
It 's been confirmed to me that Hulk is stronger than Thor .
Chew on that one for a while — at least until you can buy Hulk vs .
Thor on iTunes .

As we talked about in the True Cost of Stuff , buying something new requires the extraction and destruction of a lot of resources , not to mention the destruction of our environment in extracting , hauling , manufacturing , packaging and shipping the item .
So if we want to avoid buying new things , what should we do if we need something ?
After all , there are always times when we feel we need something — not just want or desire , but need it for a real purpose .
We might need new clothes , or books , or a bike so we can cut back on using a car .
One woman decided to buy nothing new , which is an interesting solution , but probably not for most people .
But while you might not want to put such a drastic moratorium on yourself , here are 7 things you can do before even considering buying a new item .
1. Reconsider your need .
Do you really really need it ?
Or is it a want ?
Or can you change things so you do n’t need it ?
This should always be the first thing you do .
2. Borrow .
You might only need it temporarily .
Borrow books from friends or the library .
Borrow a dress for a special occasion .
Borrow a tool for a short - term project .
Be sure to lend things in return , when you can .
3 . Ask friends and family .
Sometimes people you know might have the item you need , but not need it any longer .
Instead of loaning it to you , they might be glad to give it to you .
You only need to ask .
I ’ll often send out an email ( or tweet ) if I need something that others might have .
4. Freecycle .
Same idea , but using a wider network .
There are Freecycle networks in many areas — people who want to give something away , or who need something , post to the list and very often exchanges are made — for free .
5 . Buy used .
It ’s infinitely better than buying new , because when you buy used you ’re not having new resources taken from the earth and manufactured , but rather extending the life of resources that have already been used .
Try thrift shops , charity stores , yard or garage sales , Craigslist or Ebay .
6 . Make your own .
This wo n’t work in every case ( if I had to make my own clothes people would laugh at me more than they already do ) , but sometimes you can make something that ’s just as good as buying , with inexpensive materials or materials you already have .
This works if you ’re good with crafts or carpentry especially .
It can also be fun to get the family involved .
7 . Go without .
I know this seems the same as the first item on the list , but actually it ’s a bit different : say you decide you really do need something , but ca n’t find it anywhere or make it .
Should you buy new ?
Well , maybe you can go without it for awhile , until you do find a used version .
Maybe you need it but do n’t need it right now .
Often things will turn up when you keep your eyes open — someone will happen to mention they have the item , or you ’ll see it on Freecycle or Craigslist after a week or two .
And sometimes , the need for the item will go away , and you ’ll be glad you waited .
Sometimes you might have to buy a new item , even after exhausting all these options .
But if you can run through this list first , often you ’ll find you did n’t need it new .
INL scientist Peter Kong is putting plasma to work , using it to produce nanoparticles , synthesize materials to store hydrogen and convert heavy hydrocarbons to transportation fuels .
Most schoolchildren learn that everything in the universe is a solid , a liquid or a gas .
But those lessons miss the fourth and by far most common state of matter : plasma .
Plasma is like a gas , but many of its atoms have been stripped of an electron or two .
These positively charged atoms swim about in a crackling - hot sea of negatively charged loose electrons , making plasmas great electrical conductors .
Plasma is mysterious and powerful , the stuff of stars , of lightning .
Scientists have harnessed it to make welding torches , fluorescent lights and bright , sharp big - screen TVs , as well as those glass novelty globes full of snaking purple current that make your hair stand on end when you touch them .
But plasma can do more , much more , and Idaho National Laboratory 's Peter Kong is giving the world a glimpse of its true potential .
Kong , technical lead for plasma processing at INL , has built a career of putting plasma to work .
He 's using it to mass - produce nanoparticles , a project that in August received $ 1 million in federal stimulus funding .
He 's also employing plasma to find ways to store hydrogen efficiently , and he 'll soon start a project using plasma to convert natural gas , coal and heavy oil to gasoline and diesel .
These last two efforts could help the United States break its addiction to foreign oil and , perhaps , to fossil fuels altogether .
A cloud of alumina nanoparticles , cooling down at a rate of 1 million degrees Celsius per second , exits the PNF ’s plasma plume .
A nanoparticle factory
Kong , a quiet , affable man who keeps a pair of soccer shoes in his INL office , first started working with plasma as a doctoral student at the University of Minnesota , where he studied under one of the top experts in the field .
" I found plasma to be a very interesting subject , " he says , " one that could be applied to a lot of areas other than welding , cutting or spraying . "
One of these areas is the production of nanoparticles , bits of matter tens of thousands of times smaller than the diameter of a human hair .
Because nanoparticles are so tiny , a high percentage of their constituent atoms are on their surfaces rather than hidden away inside .
Surface interactions thus dominate the lives of nanoparticles , and as a result , nano - sized specks of a particular substance often have different physical and chemical properties than larger chunks .
Scientists are just beginning to exploit nanoparticles , but they hold great promise in many applications , including anti-microbial and cancer - fighting drugs , stronger , corrosion - resistant materials and more efficient solar panels , fuel cells and batteries .
But nanoparticles can be difficult and expensive to make .
Kong is hoping to change that with his unique Plasma Nanoparticle Fabricator , a man-sized conglomeration of cables and shiny steel that looks a bit like a robotic squid .
Sand - size grains of material fed into the PNF get vaporized by a plasma arc exceeding 12,000 degrees Celsius , twice as hot as the surface of the sun .
As the vapor exits the reactor 's processing zone , the gas cools down so fast — a rate of 1 million degrees per second — that its atoms have very little time to glom together .
Each atom clumps with only a few others , forming nanoparticles .
Other nanoparticle - production methods grind raw materials down , burn them up using fossil fuels or dunk them in various chemical baths .
But Kong 's PNF is a step above .
It makes high - quality ( very small and relatively uniform ) nanoparticles more cheaply and can handle a wider range of raw materials .
And , because it converts 100 percent of its feedstock to nanoparticles , it generates no byproducts .
Other conventional plasma reactors can't come close to this conversion rate , which the PNF achieves with a much longer plasma arc .
Also contributing are the higher , more uniform temperatures in the PNF 's processing zones , and the fact that raw materials remain in these zones for longer periods of time .
At the moment , the PNF is in a pre-pilot stage .
Kong and his team will use the newly awarded grant money to test and tweak the invention further .
Within a couple of years , he hopes to build a bigger , more powerful version that is completely user - friendly , so that anyone can operate it with minimal training .
And he wants the new , improved PNF to make even smaller , more uniform nanoparticles .
This is possible , Kong says ; he just needs to increase the velocity of the vapor coming out of the reactor , and cool it down faster — perhaps at 10 million degrees per second or even faster .
He has ideas about how to do this but is not yet ready to discuss the details publicly .
Sometime in the coming year , Kong may also begin work on a more specialized version of the PNF .
He has a proposal in to the U.S. Army to manufacture nanocomposite materials for lightweight armors .
Nanomaterials have great protective potential ; the fine grain , high surface area and many boundaries of nanoparticles can greatly diffuse a projectile 's impact .
And they can form more bonds with each other than can larger building blocks , generating more strength .
" The material I want to develop and produce will have multi- hit capability , up to large - caliber small arms , such as a sniper rifle , " Kong says .
It 's possible his proposed nanocomposite armor could work against heavier projectiles , too , according to Kong , but such capabilities would require more work and more testing .
Kong 's armor would contain layered composite materials made of lightweight metal and ceramic nanoparticles .
His team would manufacture these composites with a new , special PNF .
Using the existing , general - purpose PNF would n't work , because the production of such materials is tricky and cannot tolerate any cross-contamination .
Kong thinks the Army will make a decision about his proposal sometime during the current fiscal year .
Cracking heavy hydrocarbons
The PNF does not monopolize Kong 's time .
He recently signed on as a consultant to a large U.S. - based multinational corporation that wants to use microwave plasma to convert coal to liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel .
Kong brings a wealth of experience to the project .
In the 1990s , he developed several plasma technologies to process hard - to - refine very heavy hydrocarbons , such as heavy crude oil , oil sands and oil shale .
His methods activated natural gas into plasma , producing large amounts of hydrogen and super - reactive molecules called radicals .
The radicals " cracked " heavy hydrocarbon molecules into lighter and shorter fragments , which then combined with the radicals and hydrogen atoms to form usable transportation fuels .
Industry showed little interest in the technologies at the time , he says , because light , sweet crude — which is easier to process — was still abundant and cheap .
That 's no longer the case .
In 2005 , an Exxon - Mobil spokesman told The Boston Globe , " All the easy oil and gas in the world has pretty much been found . "
As a result , oil companies are increasingly turning their attention to heavy hydrocarbons .
Finding efficient ways to process them could aid the American push for energy independence .
The U.S. has the world 's largest deposits of oil shale , by some estimates the equivalent of 2 trillion barrels of oil — enough to last 280 years based on current consumption rates .
According to Kong , his plasma technology is simpler and , perhaps , more cost - and energy - efficient than traditional refining processes .
Oil companies may yet come calling .
" This technology could revolutionize the entire refinery structure , " he says .
Processing raw vacuum gas oil ’s heavy hydrocarbons into transportation fuels using traditional methods requires many steps and consumes a great deal of energy .
Storing hydrogen
Kong is also working with a large multinational chemical company to find better ways to store hydrogen .
Hydrogen , many researchers believe , has great potential to power vehicles , appliances and other devices .
Further , it could help carry and convert energy generated by intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar , whose production does not always mesh with demand .
Before hydrogen can help wean the world off fossil fuels , however , scientists need to develop efficient ways to store it .
Simply putting hydrogen in a tank to power a car or appliance is difficult , because the element is a gas at all but extremely low temperatures ( its boiling point is - 253 degrees Celsius ) .
Tanks holding enough low - density hydrogen gas to power anything would have to be very large , in many cases prohibitively so .
Hydrogen could be liquefied — either by compression or cooling — to bring tank size down , but this would require a great deal of energy and raise safety concerns , as elemental hydrogen is very reactive .
Chemical storage — in which hydrogen is locked into more complex molecules , then released later after exposure to heat and / or catalysts — strikes many scientists as more practical .
But current technologies for making such chemical hydrides are complicated and energy - intensive .
Kong is using plasma in an attempt to revolutionize the production process .
Applying a natural - gas plasma breaks vacuum gas oil ’s long hydrocarbon chains , leading to the production of lighter molecules that form gasoline and diesel .
" The current method of making these complex chemical hydrides is a 13 - step process , " he says .
" What we 're working on is potentially a one - to two - step process . "
Eliminating so many steps involves tricky , difficult and unstable reactions , and Kong and his team are still working out the details .
The future
Kong is the first INL scientist to secure at least 20 patents .
He has " about 26 " — it must be hard to keep track when the numbers get so high — with several more pending .
He was INL's Inventor of the Year in 2005 , and the lab inducted him into its Hall of Fame in Inventorship in 2003 .
He has dedicated much of his career to plasma research , and a good deal of his success stems from his understanding of plasma 's potential .
Yet he feels there 's a lot more to do , a lot more to learn .
" I think I 'll be working with plasma until the day I retire , " he says .

LOS ANGELES 
In a surprising move arranged by prosecutors in Los Angeles and Washington , the authorities in Switzerland arrested the film director Roman Polanski late Saturday as he arrived at the Zurich airport , paving the way for his possible extradition to the United States in connection with a 32 - year - old sex case .
Mr. Polanski , 76 , a French citizen , was detained as he arrived to receive an award at the Zurich Film Festival .
Although he is expected to oppose extradition , the arrest raised a strong possibility that Mr. Polanski would be returned to the United States to face sentencing under his conviction for having had sex with a 13 - year - old girl in 1977 .
The arrest came as a shock to Mr. Polanski and those who have worked closely with him both on movies and in a continuing attempt to lift the outstanding arrest warrant against him .
He had just finished shooting a film in Germany and often travels to Switzerland , where he maintains a home .
In Paris the French culture minister , Frédéric Mitterrand , said in a statement that he was astonished by the arrest .
In a separate statement the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said he had spoken with his Swiss counterpart and communicated “ the desire of the French authorities that the rights of Mr. Polanski be fully respected and that this affair rapidly find a favorable resolution . ”
A terrible story we ’re hearing out of Tulsa : Brandon Patrick ( pictured ) was assaulted by two men and a woman .
There was biting .
A knife to the scalp and ear .
And knee .
Via Queerty reader
Blake comes this report from Brandon ’s partner Sam Raines :
It happened about 11:45 last night between 12 - 13th off St. Louis and Rockford … 2 females and 1 male attacked him with a knife he has a knife wound the the knee that required 3 stitches and a possible knife wound to the head that required 3 staples .
They started out by calling him a faggot as he was walking down the street minding his own business and they told him not to look at them ….
but he did n’t even look in their direction .
As he went around the corner they got in their vehicle which was a mustang late 90 ’s early 00 model and sped toward him and the male got out of the car .
he then punched him in the back of his head and that ’s when he started to have to defend himself .
He kept telling them just to leave him alone and go about their business …
As he was restraining the male the older of the 2 females came at him and bit his cheek and began to saw at his head with a knife … then ended up stabbing him in the knee !
The other 2 then jumped in after he got up from the ground and tried to get away .
After he was defending himself I think they realized that he was not going to just lay there and take a beating that he was not going to let this happen to him !
Surprise , surprise — the Ducks have ripped out a picture of Zdeno Chara in all his glory ( the fourth thumbnail ) and taped it to their greaseboard in the dressing room .
Expect numerous Ducks to be giving Chara the business tonight .
I ’d ask Big Z what he was thinking , but will leave that task to someone who would n’t crumble after the first punch and does n’t spend all night eating popcorn in the press box .
Facts about Michael Jackson
Force in Music
Michael Joseph Jackson was born August 29 , 1958 , in Gary , Indiana .
The youngest of five brothers , Michael showed a passion for performing at an early age — and at 11 in 1969 , he and the Jackson 5 had released their first single .
He remained a force in pop music for the next forty years .
Jackson 5
In 1970 , the Jackson 5 became the first group in pop history to have their first four singles top the charts : “ I Want You Back , ” “ ABC , ” “ The Love You Save , ” and “ I ’ll Be There . ”
Best - Selling Album in History
In 1982 , Jackson released “ Thriller ” — the best selling album in history , with “ Beat It , ” “ The Girl is Mine , ” and “ Billie Jean ” rocketing to the top of the charts .
His music videos made him a phenomenon — the ten - minute video for “ Thriller ” is considered one of the best music videos of all time .
“ Thriller ” spent 37 non-consecutive weeks at number one and sold more than 40 million copies .
It won eight Grammys in 1983 — a record .
Largest Endorsement Deal Ever
In 1984 , Jackson ’s endorsement deal with Pepsi was the largest of all time .
Speculation
Jackson ’s hair caught on fire as a result of a special effect accident while filming a Pepsi commercial .
Rumors began swirling that he underwent numerous plastic surgery procedures shortly after the accident .
Split from McCartney
In 1985 , he became the owner of all the John Lennon - Paul McCartney copyrights when he acquired ATV Publishing .
This reportedly ruined his friendship with McCartney .
' Bad ' So Good
“ Bad ” spawned five number one songs : “ I Just Ca n’t Stop Loving You , ” “ Bad , ” “ The Way You Make Me Feel , ” “ Man in the Mirror , ” and “ Dirty Diana . ”
Its year - long tour became the largest - grossing tour in history , and “ Bad ’s ” 17 - minute music video was directed by Martin Scorcese .
Neverland Ranch
At the end of the ‘ 80s , he moved to Neverland Ranch near Santa Barbara , Calif .
A Ferris wheel , menagerie of exotic animals and a movie theater entertained underprivileged kids , while the ranch served as the location for Elizabeth Taylor ’s eighth wedding .
Without question , he was at this point one of the most famous faces in the world .
Bizarre Behavior
In 1993 , he told Oprah Winfrey he suffered from vitiligo , a disease he says lightened his skin .
He also laughed off rumors he tried to buy the bones of the Elephant Man and that he slept in a hyperbaric chamber .
The interview was one of the most watched in history .
Accusations and Painkillers
In August 1993 , Jackson was accused of molesting a 13 - year - old boy — and police officers raided Neverland .
Jackson claimed the boy ’s father was attempting extortion , but by 1994 , he had reached a private settlement with the family .
Amid the scandal , Jackson ’s sister La Toya said Jackson spent the night with young boys , and two former employees said they ’d witnessed Jackson being sexually involved with young boys .
Jackson canceled the “ Dangerous ” tour and said the stress caused an addiction to painkillers .
A Sham Marriage ?
In the midst of molestation claims , Jackson announced he had married 26 - year - old Lisa Marie Presley , Elvis ’ daughter .
They divorced in 1996 .
Marrying Debbie Rowe
Jackson soon married Debbie Rowe , a nurse he ’d met while undergoing treatment for vitiligo .
They had a girl , Paris , and a boy , Prince .
They divorced in 1999 .
( Jackson had a third child , Prince Michael Jackson II , also known as Blanket , in 2002 .
The identity of the mother has not been revealed . )
Facing World Scorn
Jackson soon faced worldwide scorn when he held his baby , called Blanket , over the railing of a hotel balcony in Berlin .
Then , his Heal the World Foundation was cut from its tax - exempt status in California for not filing .
On Trial
In 2003 , Jackson was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two of intoxicating a minor ( the child was 14 at the time ) .
In 2005 the case went to trial with Jackson eventually acquitted on all counts .
Soon after , he moved to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf — and Neverland Ranch was closed .
Jackson was fined $ 69,000 for not offering his employees insurance .
Urge your rep to vote ' Yes ' for single payer !
This fall presents a historic opportunity for members of Congress to go on the record in support of single - payer legislation .
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) is introducing a substitute amendment to the House leadership ’s bill , H.R. 3200 , that would delete the language of that bill and substitute the provisions of H.R. 676 , the single - payer , Medicare - for - All bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised a full floor vote on Weiner ’s amendment in the weeks or months ahead .
The Weiner amendment , unlike the House leadership ’s bill , assures universal , comprehensive , and high - quality coverage , free choice of doctor and hospital , and no co-pays or deductibles through a publicly financed system similar to Medicare .
Because of the massive savings on private insurance overhead and paperwork , the Weiner amendment would entail no increase in U.S. health spending , in contrast to the House bill ’s $ 1 trillion price tag over 10 years .
Write your representative today in support of the Weiner amendment .
If you can , arrange a meeting with your congressperson ; you can find tips on how to do so here and talking points here .
Finally , please write to Rep .
Weiner so he knows that he has our support in his fight for real health reform .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) successfully offered an amendment to the House leadership ’s bill that , if incorporated into final legislation passed by the Congress and signed by the president , would allow states to adopt their own single - payer system if they chose to do so .
Specifically , Kucinich ’s amendment would waive certain ERISA provisions that could be used to obstruct such a move .
While PNHP works for a national single - payer program , and while we more specifically supports the passage of H.R. 676 , we welcome any efforts to move toward single payer .
We therefore encourage you to write your representative today in support of the Kucinich amendment .

An ice - skating bear with a visiting Russian circus turned on its trainers on Wednesday , killing the circus director and seriously wounding another man during a rehearsal in the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan .
Kurmangazy Isanayev , the director of the arena in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek , said workers with the visiting Russian troupe managed to drag the two men away from the bear and closed the exits until rescue workers arrived .
Police shot the bear dead , Isanayev said .
The circus 's 25 - year - old director , Dmitry Potapov , was reportedly dragged across the ice rink during the rehearsal by the bear before a 29 - year - old employee attempted a rescue and was also seriously hurt , according to reports from news agencies RIA Novosti and Agence - France Presse .
The incident was not the first time a visiting Russian bear has been involved in a deadly attack in Kyrgyzstan .
In 2002 a bear on loan to the Bishkek city zoo attacked and killed a small child who had reached out to pet it .
The animal 's aggressive behaviour in that incident was blamed on malnourishment .
Bears trained to perform on ice skates have been a staple of Russian circus troupes , with some , in a standard stunt , also equipped with hockey equipment , including helmets and sticks .
( CNN ) -- Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have jumped the Atlantic Ocean and expanded into West Africa , working closely with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for an assault on the lucrative European market .
Authorities destroy cannabis found in Ivory Coast .
West Africa is appealing to drug traffickers from Latin America .
The situation has gotten so out of hand that tiny Guinea - Bissau , the fifth - poorest nation in the world , is being called Africa 's first narco - state .
Others talk about how Africa 's Gold Coast has become the Coke Coast .
In all , officials say , at least nine top - tier Latin American drug cartels have established bases in 11 West African nations .
" The same organizations that we investigate in Central and South America that are involved in drug activity toward the United States are engaged in this trafficking in Western Africa , " said Russell Benson , the Drug Enforcement Agency regional director for Europe and Africa .
" There 's not one country that has n't been touched to some extent . "
The calculus is simple : bigger profits in Europe than in the United States , less law enforcement in West Africa than in Europe .
The driving force is the booming European market for cocaine .
" The exponential rise in the number of consumers has made Europe the fastest - growing and most - profitable market in the world , " said Bruce Bagley , dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University of Miami .
While the European market has been expanding , use in the United States has declined from its peak in the 1980s , the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said in its 2009 annual report , issued in July .
" Cocaine use prevalence in the USA is 50 percent lower than it was two decades ago , while Spain , Italy , Portugal , France and the United Kingdom have all seen cocaine use double or triple in recent years , " the U.N. report said .
About 1,000 tons of pure cocaine are produced each year , nearly 60 percent of which evades law enforcement interception and makes it to market , the report said .
That 's a wholesale global market of about $ 70 billion .
Criminals traffic about 250 tons to Europe each year , though not all of it makes it there , the U.N. said .
The European market totals about $ 11 billion .
About 27 percent of the cocaine that entered Europe in 2006 came from Africa , the United Nations said .
Huge profits make Europe particularly attractive .
Two pounds of uncut cocaine can sell for $ 22,000 in the United States but for $ 45,000 in Europe , analyst Ashley - Louise Bybee wrote in a policy journal this year .
The Justice Department said the price in Europe can be three times more than in the United States .
" It 's a significant market for them to exploit , " Benson said .
A strong euro and weaker dollar also make Europe attractive to traffickers because of favorable exchange rates .
There 's also the fact that the European Union recently issued a 500 euro note , currently equivalent to about $ 700 .
The largest U.S. denomination in circulation is the $ 100 bill .
Traffickers prefer the large euro notes because they are easier to carry in large quantities .
For example , Benson said that $ 1 million in $ 100 bills weighs 22 pounds , while $ 1 million in 500 euro notes weighs 3.5 pounds .
" It 's a huge difference , " he said .
Though Europe is highly attractive to traffickers , it can have tight , Western - style security .
So the Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that it 's much easier to smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to the continent -- mostly Spain , the United Kingdom and France .
West Africa is a smuggler 's dream , suffering from a combination of factors that make the area particularly vulnerable .
It is among the poorest and least stable regions in the world .
Governments are weak and ineffective and , as a top DEA chief testified to the U.S. Senate this summer , officials are often corrupt .
Law enforcement also is largely riddled with corruption .
Criminal gangs are rampant .
Foot soldiers can be recruited from a large pool of poor and desperate youth .
" It 's a point of least resistance , " Benson said .
West Africa refers to Benin , Burkina Faso , Cape Verde , Ivory Coast , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea - Bissau , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , Senegal , Sierra Leone and Togo .
" This area of the world is ripe , " Bagley said .
" There has been very little attention paid to it .
The United States is loath to give aid to these countries because they are corrupt . "
U.S. authorities find themselves at a great disadvantage fighting cartels that have much more money and guns .
The DEA has four offices -- in Egypt , Ghana , Nigeria and South Africa -- to cover a continent that spans 11.7 million square miles and has nearly 1 billion people .
" It 's a big place , " Benson acknowledges , noting that there are 54 countries on the continent .
Local police also are vastly outgunned .
Guinea - Bissau offers an alarming example .
" The Judicial Police ... have 60 agents , one vehicle and often no fuel , " analyst Bybee wrote in a journal called New Voices in Public Policy , published by the George Mason University School of Public Policy .
" As a result , when culprits are apprehended , they are driven in a taxi to the police station .
They just recently received six sets of handcuffs from the U.K. , which were badly needed .
In the military , one rusty ship patrols the 350 - kilometer ( 217 - mile ) coastline and 88 islands . "
Even when criminals are caught , Bybee said , " the near absence of a judicial system allows traffickers to operate unimpeded . "
For example , she said , " because the police are so impotent , the culprits are often held for just a few hours before senior military personnel suddenly attain extraordinary judicial powers to demand their release . "
The few officials who stand up to the traffickers receive death threats or are killed .
West Africa also is particularly attractive to traffickers because it is near " the soft underbelly of Europe , " said retired four - star Army Gen.
Barry McCaffrey , who was drug policy director for President Clinton .
Geography plays another role because West Africa is fairly close to the three South American nations that produce nearly all of the world 's cocaine -- Colombia , Peru and Bolivia .
Many of the shipments depart from Venezuela , which shares a 1,273 - mile ( 2,050 - kilometer ) porous border with Colombia and is even closer to Africa .
" They go right dead - ass across the shortest route , " McCaffrey said .
Most of the cocaine shipments cross the Atlantic in large " mother ships " and then are off - loaded to small vessels near the coastline , the United Nations said .
Small planes modified for overseas flight that can carry a 1 - ton cargo also have been used .
Most of those come from Venezuela , the United Nations reported .
A report issued in July by the Government Accountability Office said traffickers use go - fast boats , fishing vessels and commercial shipping containers as the primary means of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela .
McCaffrey also noted the use of go - fast boats and special planes .
DEA Assistant Administrator Thomas Harrigan testified before the Senate in June that authorities in Sierra Leone seized a cocaine shipment last year from a twin - engine aircraft marked with a Red Cross insignia .
The flight originated in Venezuela , he said .
The GAO report noted that " U.S. government officials have observed an increase in suspicious air traffic originating in Venezuela . "
In 2004 , the report said , authorities tracked 109 suspect flights out of Venezuela .
In 2007 , officials tracked 178 suspicious flights .
Then there 's the crime connection in West Africa .
" Colombian and Venezuelan traffickers are entrenched in West Africa and have cultivated long - standing relationships with African criminal networks to facilitate their activities in the region , " Harrigan told a Senate subcommittee on African affairs .
" These organizations do n't operate in a vacuum , " Benson said .
" They have to align themselves with West African criminal groups . "
The cartels also have aligned themselves with terrorists , Harrigan said .
" The threat of narco - terrorism in Africa is a real concern , including the presence of international terrorist organizations operating or based in Africa , such as the regional threat presented by al Qaeda in the Lands of Maghreb , " he said , referring to al Qaeda activists in North Africa .
" In addition , DEA investigations have identified elements of Colombia 's Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia [ FARC ] as being involved in cocaine trafficking in West Africa . "
Benson said the groups operating in Africa are " primarily narcotics organizations " but acknowledged that the Marxist FARC guerrillas in Colombia are a force to be dealt with .
The rebels have waged war on the Colombian government for more than 40 years .
" The profit potential is such that the FARC is one of the largest cocaine - trafficking operations globally and is also a terrorist organization , " he said .
Bagley and McCaffrey see less evidence of terrorist connections with the traffickers in Africa , both using nearly identical language .
" I 'd be really skeptical of those kinds of assertions , " McCaffrey said .
" I 'm quite skeptical about linkages between cartels and terrorists , " Bagley said .
" The criminal groups seek profits .
They 're not interested in taking over governments . "
Still , Bagley said , traffickers and terrorists may use some of the same criminal networks .
Analysts note that the surge of cartel activity in West Africa is a fairly recent development .
The U.N. report said it started around 2005 .
Bybee places it around 2006 .
McCaffrey , who was in the Clinton White House in the 1990s , said he saw the problem coming a long time ago .
" I 've been warning people in Europe and Latin America starting 10 years ago where this issue was going to move , " he said .
" The Europeans absolutely blew me off . "
The U.N. report offers some hope , saying that cocaine seizures in Europe peaked in 2006 and topped out in West Africa in 2007 .
Overall seizures have declined since 2006 , the report said .
" This trend appears to be continuing in 2009 and includes declines in the number and volume of seizures made in the region and in the number of air couriers coming from the region in Europe , " the report concluded .
For example , authorities seized 11 large shipments in Africa in 2007 , four in 2008 and none so far this year .
The report does not specify whether there are fewer shipments or smarter criminals avoiding detection .
But if there is a decline , the DEA 's Benson said he has not seen it .
" In the last three or four years , it 's increased quite dramatically , " he said .
" The Colombian organizations have been active there longer than that .
In the last two years , we 've also seen Mexican involvement in the area as well . "

Hypocrisy reigns for critics of the first non-black Miss Hampton U
The crowning of Nikole Churchill as the first non-black Miss Hampton University has caused a ruckus at the historically - black college and throughout the African - American community .
Hampton alumni , bloggers , and callers into black radio talk shows are upset that Churchill , 22 , was selected to fill a representative role for a traditionally black institution .
As a student at Hampton , Churchill was certainly eligible to compete and ultimately win the award .
Any objections to her crowning that are based on her skin color are nothing less than hypocritical .
Churchill , who is from Hawaii , was selected to be Miss Hampton University from among 10 contestants .
In addition to receiving a $ 1,500 scholarship , she will serve as the school ’s homecoming queen and will compete in the 2010 Miss Virginia pageant .
Churchill ’s mother is of Italian ancestry , and her father is from Guam .
In a letter to President Obama – a fellow Hawaiian – the nursing major said that many Hampton students do not accept her crowning , and have made negative comments about her .
“ It would be much easier to say that possibly some were not accepting of the news because I was n’t the most qualified contestant ; however , the true reason for the disapproval was because of the color of my skin .
I am not African - American , ” she told the president .
“ Despite the unfortunate beliefs that some are saying I should not have won , I am desperately trying to focus on those who believe in me and support me and my goal to represent this beautiful , multicultural campus the very best way that I can . ”
Churchill later apologized to the Hampton University community for writing the letter .
No apology was necessary ; black folks should be able to relate to Ms. Churchill ’s situation .
The black experience in America has been one of exclusion , of society questioning our abilities and qualifications .
The troubling legacy of racial exclusion by white universities is why historically black colleges and universities ( HBCUs ) were founded in the first place .

When black students first integrated into the public schools and colleges , they were greeted with insults and death threats , and were ostracized until graduation day .
Even today , people of color are still scrutinized .
They are the object of suspicion at school and , in the workplace , their credentials and capabilities are questioned .
America ’s first black president won a fair election , despite race - baiting from his political opponents .
Yet an entire segment of the population believes he is unqualified , illegitimate and unfit to serve .
Dr. Martin Luther King talked about the drum major instinct , which he described as “ a need that some people have to feel superior .
A need that some people have to feel that they are first , and to feel that their white skin ordained them to be first . ”
Sadly , the oppressed internalize their own oppression from time to time .
In the past , this resulted in “ paper bag tests ” for admission to exclusive African - American organizations , or the denial of so - called “ lower - class ” black people .
Then there were the lighter - skinned blacks who were able to pass for white and occasionally abandoned their darker family members for a full - fledged life in mainstream society .
Yet , the black community has always had a tradition of bringing in others and claiming them as their own .
African - Americans , as longstanding victims of discrimination , are in a special position to show tolerance and inclusion .
We ca n’t afford to do any less .
Anyone who gets upset over Churchill ’s victory has not learned the lessons of history .
It is fitting that Churchill has invited President Obama to come to Hampton to speak about diversity .
Hopefully he will accept the offer , and allow a constructive dialogue to take root .

The U.S. military already uses a fleet of unmanned spy blimps to keep tabs on would - be enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Now , the Navy wants to upgrade the airships ' sight and hearing , as part of its push for " wide area persistent surveillance . "
The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Lakehurst New Jersey issued a call for research proposals this week , looking for all sorts of new sensors , sensor - processors , and communication relays to use on its new , snooping aerostats .
According to the Navy , the lighter - than - air - craft should also be able to see all across the spectrum – from ultraviolet to visible light to infrared .
The system should incorporate " advanced radar for target detection and tracking ; laser radar for target tracking and identification ; ESM [ electronic support measures ] for target location cueing and identification ; C4I [ Command , Control , Communications , Computers , and Intelligence ] for receiving and disseminating target information and secure transmission of imagery and target track data . "
Ideas on other surveillance gear – acoustic sensors , magnetic anomaly detectors , " biometrics technologies , " and " non-cooperative ID sensors " – are also welcome .
Ditto the " insertion of artificial intelligence ( AI ) techniques into airborne sensors for situational optimization . "
And in case blimps ain't your thang , spyboys , the Navy will also be happy to look at proposals involving " unattended ground sensors and compact autonomous vehicles , " too .
Under this surveillance project , it 's all covered .

Public school teacher jailed for lesbian trysts can still meet victim , 15 , on release from prison
Teacher Helen Goddard has been jailed for 15 months for having sex with an underage female pupil
A public school music teacher was yesterday jailed for having a lesbian relationship with a 15 - year - old pupil - but told she could continue seeing her when she leaves prison .
A court heard that trumpet mistress Helen Goddard , 26 , helped weave a web of lies so the ' vulnerable ' girl could stay in her flat overnight , and took her for a weekend in Paris , where they joined a gay pride march .
Judge Anthony Pitts jailed Goddard for 15 months , saying : ' This case is so serious an immediate sentence of imprisonment is inevitable . '
But despite hearing from the girl 's parents the devastating effect the five - month sexual relationship had on the teenager , he rejected a prosecution request to ban the teacher from contacting her victim for five years , claiming it would be ' unnecessary , unkind , and cruel to the victim ' .
Goddard will be allowed to write to her from prison and will be able to see her in private the moment she is released from jail , probably halfway through her 15 - month sentence .
The teacher punched the air in victory when she realised her relationship with the pupil , who is still underage , could continue .
The judge refused to ban Goddard from ever being alone with under - age girls , rejecting another prosecution request .
Goddard , who wept as she was taken to the cells , will have to sign the sex offender register and is banned from teaching children for life .
Her barrister Anthony Heaton - Armstrong claimed that she was ' subjected to a lot of pressure from the child ' , and added : ' Miss Goddard is quite young for her age . '
He insisted the pair continue to ' love each other very much ' .
Goddard is a former child prodigy who was one of only six British teenagers to play at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics in 2000 .
She went on to become student union president at Trinity College of Music in London , where she earned her degree .
She is known to have had several boyfriends , including Jonathan Ansell , the tenor who found fame as a member of the operatic ' boy band ' G4 .
She started work at the victim's £ 13,000 - a- year girls ' school in 2006 and ran a lunchtime jazz club , earning her the nickname ' the Jazz Lady ' .
The head of music at the London school - which cannot be named for legal reasons - told Southwark Crown Court in a statement : ' The girls all adored her , and would flock to her room at break times .
' I did speak to her about the dangers of being over - friendly and too popular . '
But Goddard , a slim blonde who faced the court in tight blouse , waistcoat and pinstripe trousers , ignored the warning and fast became increasingly close to her victim , one of her trumpet pupils .
The girl , who had been traumatised by her parents ' separation several years ago , told police she and her teacher went for coffees together after lessons , and began confiding in each other .
By January of this year , the girl invited the teacher to join her parents dog walking on Hampstead Heath - and then began to visit Goddard 's flat in Greenwich with her father 's knowledge .
Flirting and text messages followed and in February the pair went for a walk near the school , and kissed for the first time .
Days later , they shared a bed at Goddard 's flat .
From then on , the girl would stay with her teacher every Friday or Saturday night , telling her parents she was with a schoolfriend .
Ex-boyfriend : Jonathan Ansell was previously in G4
Prosecutor Regina Naughton said : ' Miss Goddard was aware it was the girl 's first sexual relationship . '
She said the pair used sex toys and handcuffs .
By June Goddard was so brazen that when the girl told her parents she was visiting her older sister in Paris , she in fact stayed in a hotel with her teacher , and joined her on a gay pride march there .
The girl told two fellow pupils about her relationship with the teacher , however , and the school became abuzz with gossip .
In July , ' a concerned parent ' sent anonymous emails to the school to report the relationship , and called on the head : ' Please act quickly ' .
The parents were informed , police were called - and when the mother tried to track her daughter down , she discovered she was at Goddard 's home .
The child admitted everything , but said she loved her teacher .
Analysis of phones showed the girl had sent her teacher 157 texts , while the teacher had sent 60 back , many sexually explicit .
One from Goddard to the child said : ' It 's going to be a beautiful day .
I love you .
You are on my mind all night . '
Goddard refused to answer police questions , but at a hearing last month admitted six specimen counts of sexual activity with a child .
Cases of sexual activity with a child under 13 are deemed to be assault as those so young are held to be incapable of giving consent .
Those over 13 are capable of consenting , but sexual activity with them remains illegal .
According to a report published in the year 2016 , about more than a million people were arrested for being under drugs or alcohol ’s influence while driving their vehicle .
The same year reports also tell that about 30 % of accidents take place due to drink and drive case .
There is no doubt in the fact that one should not drive under influence of any such thing as it often led to rash driving and road accidents .
However , if at any emergency case you have to rush off from a party and on your way you get caught by the cops it is better to be in contact with someone who knows the laws related with the situation and can help you out in escaping , in this article we will know more about the benefits of hiring dui lawyers .

US chat show host David Letterman made an extraordinary confession to a string of affairs on his top - rated TV show after an alleged two million dollar blackmail plot .
A TV worker had threatened to expose the Late Show host 's affairs in a book and screenplay unless he was paid hush money , the married presenter claimed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
TV company CBS confirmed that an employee has been arrested over the alleged plot .
The 62 - year - old presenter even went so far as to issue a fake two million dollar cheque during an investigation into the alleged plot and has given evidence to a grand jury .
Letterman left last night 's studio audience baffled as he began relating his " bizarre experience " , but laced his confession about his " creepy " affairs with gags .
His show 's production company , Letterman , said he referred the matter to the Manhattan district attorney 's office .
An investigation ended in the arrest and suspension of an employee of the TV show 48 Hours .
Letterman , who is married with a six - year - old son , began last night 's broadcast of the Late Show by walking on stage and briefly leaning on a pillar with his back to the audience .
After a monologue with jokes about regular targets such as Dick Cheney and Sarah Palin , he sat behind his desk .
He said he was glad the audience was in a pleasant mood " because I have a little story that I 'd like to tell you and the home viewers as well " .
Three weeks ago , Letterman said he got in his car early in the morning and found a package with a letter saying : " I know that you do some terrible , terrible things and that I can prove you do some terrible things . "

He said the letter contained proof .
Letterman 's lawyer set up a meeting with the man , who threatened to write a screenplay and a book unless he was paid off .
Two further meetings resulted in the fake cheque being delivered .
Letterman said he testified to a grand jury yesterday .
" I was worried for myself , I was worried for my family , " he said .
" I felt menaced by this and I had to tell them all of the creepy things that I had done . "
He added : " The creepy stuff was that I have had sex with women who work for me on this show .
" My response to that is yes , I have .
Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Yes , it would , especially for the women .
" It 's been a very bizarre experience , " he said .
" I felt like I needed to protect these people .
I need to protect my family .
I need to protect myself .
Hope to protect my job . "
But Letterman also made light of the situation : " I know what you 're saying ... I 'll be darned , Dave had sex . "
He and long - time girlfriend Regina Lasko married in March , although they had been together since 1986 .
Their son Harry was born in November 2003 .
It is the second embarrassment for Letterman in recent months .
In June , he apologised to Sarah Palin for making a crude joke about the former Republican vice - presidential candidate 's 14 - year - old daughter .
Although there was a small " fire Letterman " demonstration outside his studio later , CBS stood by its late - night star .
After nearly 15 years in second place to NBC's Jay Leno in the ratings , Letterman took over the top spot this summer .
Letterman was the victim of a 2005 plot by a former painter on his Montana ranch to kidnap his nanny and son for a five million dollar ransom .
The alleged patent infringement applies to all iPhones since its 2007 launch
Nokia , the world 's biggest mobile phone maker , has said that it is suing its US rival Apple for infringing patents on mobile phone technology for the iPhone .
Nokia said it had not been compensated for its technology , and accused Apple of " trying to get a free ride on the back of Nokia 's innovation " .
The 10 alleged patent infringements involve wireless data , speech coding , security and encryption .
Apple , which did not comment on the news , saw its shares dip slightly .
The breaches applied to all models of the iPhone since its launch in 2007 , Nokia added .
' Basic principle '
Finland 's Nokia said that it had agreements with about 40 firms - including most mobile phone handset makers - allowing them to use the firm 's technology , but that Apple had not signed an agreement .
" The basic principle in the mobile industry is that those companies who contribute in technology development to establish standards create intellectual property , which others then need to compensate for , " said Ilkka Rahnasto , vice - president of legal and intellectual property at Nokia .
" Apple is also expected to follow this principle . "
He added that during the last two decades , Nokia had invested approximately 40bn euros ( £ 36.2bn ; $ 60 bn ) on research and development .
Earlier this month , Nokia posted its first quarterly loss in a decade amid falling sales .
Analysts said that the poor results had come partly as customers turned from Nokia models to the iPhone and RIM's Blackberry .
Meanwhile , Apple reported profits of $ 1.67 bn ( £ 1 bn ) in the three months to 26 September - partly due to a 7 % growth in iPhone sales .

What follows is purported to have been a London Times obituary .
It has been circulated on the Internet , and its actual source and authorship are , to my knowledge , unknown .
Nonetheless , I believe that , in its humorous way , it serves as a commentary on modern - day human behavior .
The text of the “ obituary , ” edited for purposes of this publication , is as follows :
Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend , “ Common Sense , ” who has been with us for many years .
No one knows for sure how old he was , since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape .
He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as :
– knowing when to come in out of the rain ;
– the early bird gets the worm ;
– life is n’t always fair ; and
– maybe it was my fault .
Common Sense lived by simple , sound financial policies ( do n’t spend more than you can earn ) and reliable strategies ( adults , not children , are in charge ) .
His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well - intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place .
Reports of a 6 - year - old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate ; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch ; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student , only worsened his condition .
Common
Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly children .
It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer sun lotion or an aspirin to a student , but could not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion .
Common
Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses and criminals received better treatment than their victims .
Common
Sense took a beating when you could n’t defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault .
Common
Sense finally gave up the will to live , after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot .
She spilled a little in her lap and was promptly awarded a huge settlement .
Common Sense was preceded in death , by his parents , “ Truth ” and “ Trust , ” by his wife , “ Discretion , ” by his daughter , “ Responsibility , ” and by his son , “ Reason . ”
He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers – “ I Know My Rights , ” “ I Want It Now , ” “ Someone Else Is To Blame , ” and “ I ’m A Victim . ”
Not many attended his funeral , because so few realized he was gone .
If you still remember him , pass this on .
If not , join the majority and do nothing .

A SENIOR Crown prosecutor has been named in a broad - scale investigation by ICAC into corruption of the NSW judicial system by barrister John Hart - who allegedly took a $ 12,000 bribe to make a police investigation " go away " .
The state 's corruption watchdog heard yesterday that Mr Hart had a " bloke " from the Director of Public Prosecutions - revealed in phone tapped conversions as Crown Prosecutor Gary Corr - who could make sure a gang rape investigation into Wagga Wagga trio Jason Kelly , Christopher Trinder and Jeff Nankievell would not proceed .
" Now , I 'm tellin ' ya my bloke , Gary Corr who 's the , the , it 's gotta go through him , he said he wo n't pursue it , I 'm telling ya , " Mr Hart was recorded telling Mr Kelly on telephone intercepts .
On a separate occasion Mr Hart said : " I 'll tell you my bloke said . . . 'he would not do anything about it '.
I 'm tellin ' ya .
All right ?
That 's what we organised ' . "
ICAC heard Mr Corr would be called and was expected to deny any knowledge of the allegations .
Counsel assisting ICAC David Staehil said the " show money " Mr Hart took from clients was one part of a series of schemes that included defrauding the Attorney General 's Department of court costs and lying to have cases moved to more lenient magistrates at country courts .
" At first blush , the circumstances indicate a desire to pervert , or attempt to pervert , the course of justice , " Mr Staehil said .
" If such payments in the circumstances described were made to Hart but he never intended they would be passed on to a public officer , then there may be the elements of fraud or false pretences present in the obtaining by him of money from Kelly . "
Mr Hart allegedly told Mr Kelly that for $ 10,000 , plus $ 5000 for a kind of finder 's fee to himself , he could make the police investigation go away .
He accepted the lesser sum of $ 12,000 , most of which was deposited into his TAB account .
The three Wagga Wagga men were never charged after the investigation into an alleged sexual assault .
Mr Hart and his instructing solicitor Anthony Paul are also alleged to have inflated a claim of court costs from the Attorney - General 's Department to $ 76,008 from the actual costs of just $ 26,371 in a previous sexual assault against Mr Kelly , who was found not guilty .

Grace had just been recited at the St. Francis of Assisi dining hall when four uniformed Portland police officers showed up , followed by a film crew from the TV show " COPS . "
About 140 homeless and low - income people -- who had come to the Southeast Portland church for a warm meal -- and the dining hall staff were stunned by the cameras and police shortly after 5 p.m. on Sept. 10 .
Officers told a dining hall director that they were looking for a homicide suspect .
The staff told police the man had been there earlier that day , but had left .
But the officers stayed , and " COPS " continued to film .
Police questioned another man in the back of the room and looked at his ID , and even searched in the restrooms .
Pastoral administrator Valerie Chapman said she was disturbed no one had alerted her staff ahead of time that police were bringing along a camera crew , and felt they had violated the church sanctuary .
" This is private property , " she said .
" For us , it 's about the privacy of the people and their dignity in the hall . "
As the cameras rolled , Chapman said she asked officers who had given the TV crew permission to film .
According to Chapman , an officer said " the woman at the door gave it . "
Chapman says nobody was at the door , and no staff members gave the TV crew permission to enter .
" I was sort of dismissed , " she said .
Chapman says there 's been an unwritten agreement that police will notify staff ahead of time if they 're trying to make contact or arrest a person they suspect might be at the dining hall .
In fact , a week later , when the man who was being sought did show up at the hall , Chapman said she alerted officers , and they came and spoke with him outside .
He ended up not being arrested .
" That 's the way the process is supposed to work , " Chapman said .
" I guess they do things a little bigger on camera .
I do n't get it .
To be honest .
I do n't understand any of this .
I do n't watch ' COPS ' TV . "
Assistant Chief Brian Martinek said he reviewed what occurred .
He said the four officers and a sergeant had a legitimate reason to be there , but may not have understood how sensitive the police relationship is with the parish , which strives to be a sanctuary to the downtrodden .
" The decision to bring ' COPS ' in was n't the best , in hindsight , " Martinek said .
But from his review of the footage , he said , four officers entered and described to a dining hall director why they were there .
He said the interaction was casual and relaxed .
" There 's no drama to it , " Martinek said .
A couple of officers did walk through the dining hall , and asked a man in the back , who police said looked like their suspect , who he was , Martinek said .
Another group of officers were outside and looked around the property .
Portland police , who have control over what will " COPS " will air , said the footage from the dining hall will not be aired .
Police also declined to let a reporter view it .
Chapman said Central police Capt .
Mark Kruger later came to the church and apologized , although it was n't his officers and he did n't even know about it until afterward , she said .
The officers involved were based at North Precinct .
After a further meeting between Chapman and police Thursday , police have agreed , unless they 're chasing a violent suspect , to alert Central Precinct command staff and church staff if they 're looking for someone at the dining hall and be " as unintrusive as possible . "

DALLAS INSURANCE COVERAGE LAWYER
Insurance Coverage and Disputes and Bad Faith | Texas Attorney
Almost all people today have insurance of some kind , whether it is health , life , auto , homeowners , or disability .
Insurance coverage is intended to protect people against the cost of unexpected events such as hospital bills , car accidents , a storm damaged home or business , the death of a family member , a disabled breadwinner or being sued for damages .

The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission final report is grim reading , especially the finding that prisoners report more rape committed by guards than by other prisoners .
More than 7.3 million Americans are confined in U.S. correctional facilities or supervised in the community , at a cost of more than $ 68 billion annually .
Given our country 's enormous investment in corrections , we should ensure that these environments are as safe and productive as they can be .
Sexual abuse undermines those goals .
It makes correctional environments more dangerous for staff as well as prisoners , consumes scarce resources , and undermines rehabilitation .
It also carries the potential to devastate the lives of victims .
The many interrelated consequences of sexual abuse for individuals and society are difficult to pinpoint and nearly impossible to quantify , but they are powerfully captured in individual accounts of abuse and its impact .
Former prisoner Necole Brown told the Commission , " I continue to contend with flashbacks of what this correctional officer did to me and the guilt , shame , and rage that comes with having been sexually violated for so many years .
I felt lost for a very long time struggling with this .

I still struggle with the memories of this ordeal and take it out on friends and family who are trying to be there for me now . "
Air Force veteran Tom Cahill , who was arrested and detained for just a single night in a San Antonio jail , recalled the lasting effects of being gang - raped and beaten by other inmates .
" I 've been hospitalized more times than I can count and I did n't pay for those hospitalizations , the tax payers paid .
My career as a journalist and photographer was completely derailed .
. . .
For the past two decades , I 've received a non-service connected security pension from the Veteran 's Administration at the cost of about $ 200,000 in connection with the only major trauma I 've ever suffered , the rape . " …
Victims and witnesses often are bullied into silence and harmed if they speak out .
In a letter to the advocacy organization Just Detention International , one prisoner conveyed a chilling threat she received from the male officer who was abusing her : " Remember if you tell anyone anything , you 'll have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life . "
Efforts to promote reporting must be accompanied by policies and protocols to protect victims and witnesses from retaliation .
And because some incarcerated individuals will never be comfortable reporting abuse internally , facilities must give prisoners the option of speaking confidentially with a crisis center or other outside agency .
When we think of Halloween , the first things that come to mind are Trick or Treatin ’ , Halloween Masks and costumes , Pumpkin Carving and terrifying themes of Horror .
In this newest collection , we wanted to provide a tribute to many of our favorite Horror movies by showing amazing Pumpkin Faces , Carvings and artwork that was created based on these scary and freaky films .
Update for Halloween 2010 : 200 Pumpkin Carvings
There are many more Horror movies that could be added , but this list cannot go on forever … that would just be too scary .
Still , there are a bunch of classic films here that many adults and children would be happy they made the list .
All artists ’ credit is provided for each pumpkin , so if you want to get in touch with the maker for Pumpkin tips for a specific Horror flick … you can reach them personally .
Happy ( and Scary ) Halloween to Everyone !
Psycho Pumpkins
Probably one of the most famous films ever , Psycho , the classic shower scene by LadyBugBKT brings back some scary memories , and seeing Norman Bates face and Motel again thanks to Skeptic562000 and Norbini could only make it more difficult to sleep at night .
Predator Pumpkin
I think that this Predator pumpkin found at Toucanzoo ’s Flickr is so amazing that it could scare even Predator itself .
What do you think ?
The Exorcist
The Exorcist music theme still makes the hair rise on the back of my neck , and this Halloweenish pumpkin portrayal of Regan by NinjaSpinster is almost as freaky .
Pennywise from It
Although it is not an actual carving , this cool Pennywise clown Pumpkin painting by Denise A Wells is a great remake that brings Pennywise back to life .
Texas Chainsaw Massacre
Leatherface is one of the most scary , yet intriguing Horror characters ever , and he makes a terrifying appearance here in a well seen Pumpkin Face by OMFG Caitlin as well as the famous picture from the movie from Lauren Fiasco .
Ash from Evil Dead
The Evil Dead trilogy , including Evil Dead 1 , 2 and also the somewhat hilarious Army of Darkness are entertaining for any Horror fan .
In addition , Ash was one of those heroes you could really relate to and completely respect , so it was great seeing the two new Pumpkin Carvings by Obajoo and Goob712 making their way to someone ’s doorstep .
Pinhead Pumpkin
Pinhead from Hellraiser was a freaky looking character which I believe deserved some more actual respect , so LadyBugbkt gave it its own Pumpkin face that will glow on Halloween .
Nightmare on Elm Street Pumpkin
Freddy Krueger may not be as scary today , for the make up in the original films was n’t extraordinary , but the story still captivates and is a classic .
Norbini made this horrific Pumpkin showing Freddy in true light with his Metal Claws Glove next to his face .
Friday the 13th
Jason Voorhees
Hockey mask by Qwertyuiop lights up the doorway in a great tribute to the Horror character that continues to return for more killing , dying and remakes .
Halloween the Movie
Michael Myers is back in a glowing Pumpkin from ktsaltishok that shows just enough for those familiar with the films .
Chucky from Child ’s Play
Watching Child ’s
Play right now is kind of ridiculous , but when it first came out … whoa did it receive some attention ; everyone wanted their own Chucky Doll …a murdering doll .
The two versions by Grantsewell and Marc Evan show us some cool Pumpkin faces that show the famous Doll out of hell in respective colors .
Jaws
Not necessarily your regular Horror flick , the original Jaws movie was an amazing feat that made us afraid to go in the water .
This Pumpkin carving here from BraynH at least allow us the Giant Shark without being worried … but then again , we are on land .
Classic Horror :
Frankenstein Monster and the Bride
Still intense even today , the Frankenstein Monster and his bride are two characters that cannot be ignored and AngelaP ( Flickr ) made sure of that with two great carvings , along with
second rendition by Marc Evan .
Dracula
Dracula is a character that receives high acclaim even today as so many children dress up like him , new Dracula remakes are released and the story still capticates as one the greatest love stories ever .
Here is the classic Dracula by Kingdafy and even a cool more modern Vampire Pumpkin version of David the Vampire by ^i^heavensdarkangel2 from the cool
flick the Lost Boys .
Nosferatu
These Nosferatu versions by pattijbennet , Duncan Creamer and Marc Evan are sending chills , but in a really good way .
It still captures the eerie character , but in a cool Pumpkin art that should n’t be ignored .
Night of the Living Dead
A group of the Undead are seen walking around aimlessly on the face of this Pumpkin by AmandaMT .
The Mummy
One cool version of the Mummy by Stryfe589 was made which is simple yet makes us appreciate the classic character .
The Wolfman
With so many remakes using the Werewolf character , the classic Wolfman is still amazing for its time and story .
Norbini has made a great Pumpkin Face that could be appreciated by Horror lovers .
For More cool Pumpkin Carvings , check out the huge collection of 130 Halloween Pumpkin Carvings .
This Saturday I went to the Miami Beach Library .
I saw lots of neat statues and baobob trees on the Bass Museum Campus , which sits on the other side of 21st street .
Then , I went into the library , took the elevator up to the second floor , and ran into a strange piece of art .
See for yourself :
I am not sure what committee decided it was ok to hang this comic strip in front of the elevator , especially since it hangs right next to the Teen section , which anyone above the age of 21 is prohibited from entering .

Demand for oil in developed nations peaked in 2005 , and changing demographics and improved motor - vehicle efficiency guarantee that it wo n't hit those heights again , IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates says in a new report .
Reduced petroleum demand in developed nations could make their economic growth less vulnerable to oil price shocks , the report states .
Nonetheless , global oil demand is still expected to grow , overall , driven by China and other developing nations as the world economy recovers .
But demand for oil that has fallen in recent years in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , or OECD , nations wo n't be made up , the analysts say .
" The economic downturn has been masking a larger trend in the oil demand of developed countries , " said Daniel Yergin , the company 's chairman .
" The fact is that OECD oil demand has been falling since late 2005 , well before the Great Recession began . "
The biggest reason , the group says , is that oil demand in the transportation sector -- which is the United States ' dominant use of oil and accounts for 60 percent of OECD petroleum demand -- is flattening .
The trend has been noticed elsewhere , as well .
Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson said this month that U.S. gasoline demand peaked in 2007 .
The Cambridge Energy Research Associates , or CERA , analysis cites several reasons why demand in developed nations -- which accounts for slightly more than half the world 's total -- wo n't recover .
Among them :
Car ownership rates have reached " saturation , " while populations are aging and population growth ranges from low to negative .
Also , OECD governments , driven by global warming and energy security worries , have tightened fuel efficiency standards , while high prices in recent years have also pushed consumers away from gas guzzlers .
In the United States , the Obama administration plans to implement rules that push corporate average fuel economy , or CAFE , standards to a fleetwide average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 , four years ahead of the schedule Congress laid out in a 2007 energy law .
Use of alternative fuels like ethanol has also grown .
" New technologies such as plug - in hybrid electric vehicles and next - generation biofuels could also have a greater impact in the future , " the report states .
Global demand will nonetheless grow , fueled mostly by developing nations , CERA finds .
The company forecasts world demand to increase from 83.8 million barrels per day this year to 89.1 mbd in 2014 .
" Just 900,000 bpd [ barrels per day ] of growth is expected to come from OECD countries , just a fraction of the 3.7 million bpd of demand lost over the course of 2005 to 2009 , " the report states .
But CERA cautions that developed nations will hardly be through with oil anytime soon .
The demand reduction in OECD countries between the 2005 peak and 2030 is expected to be " fairly modest , " it states .

DNA molecules will be held in place by tiny voltages within the nanohole
IBM will announce on Tuesday how it intends to hold DNA molecules in tiny holes in silicon in an effort to decode their genetic secrets letter by letter .
Their microelectronic approach solves one of two long - standing problems in " nanopore " DNA sequencing : how to stop it flying through too quickly .
The aim is to speed up DNA sequencing in a push toward personalised medicine .
IBM 's chief executive Sam Palmisano will announce the plans to the Medical Innovation Summit in the US on Tuesday .
While sequencing the genomes of humans and animals has become relatively routine in a laboratory setting , the ability to quickly and cheaply sequence genomes of individuals remains out of reach .
That widely available genetic information will help bring about the era of " personalised medicine " - in which preventative or therapeutic approaches can be tailored to individuals based on their specific genetic makeup .
All - electronic
" There have been a number of attempts to sequence DNA much faster than it was sequenced when the first human genome was announced , " said Gustavo Stolovitzky , a computational biologist from IBM .
Individual genetic information will lead to more directed therapies " All of them use some complicated sample preparation - chopping the DNA , amplifying , reverse transcribing - and some sophisticated and labour - intensive optics , " Dr Stolovitzky told BBC News .
" All this makes sequencing faster , but still slower and more expensive than it needs to be before it could be used for personalised medicine . "
Instead , Dr Stolovitzky and colleagues are pursuing a method involving silicon peppered with holes just three billionths of a metre across - 20,000 times thinner than a human hair and just wide enough for one strand of DNA to pass through .
Researchers have been looking into using such nanopores for a number of years - mimicking the proteins in cell membranes that perform the same trick - because using a semiconductor offers significant advantages over biochemical and optical techniques .
" DNA nanopore sequencing continues to be one of the great candidates to do fast and cheap DNA sequencing without sample preparation or sophisticated optics , using only electronics to fetch the signal out , " Dr Stolovitzky said .
Moreover , the approach could be done in a " massively parallel " way - that is , with hundreds or thousands of DNA strands passing through an array of holes on a single chip .
Trap stack
The idea is conceptually simple but devilishly difficult to carry out .
Because DNA naturally carries a net electric charge , simply applying a voltage across the two sides of the chip drives the DNA strands through the holes .
However , the DNA tends to pass through too quickly to decode the identities of the individual nucleotides - letters of the genetic code - as they pass .
More than that , until they can study DNA strands moving at a more carefully controlled pace , researchers cannot develop the techniques to query the precise nucleotide they have trapped in place .
The Blue Gene supercomputer simulated the nanopores ' every atom
The IBM team have now hit on the idea of a chip composed of a stack of layers , each of which can hold a precisely - controlled voltage in a thin layer inside the nanopore .
These smaller voltages trap the negatively charged chemical groups called phosphates that separate individual nucleotides .
By cycling this internal voltage , the DNA strand can be made to advance one nucleotide at a time .
The team has used IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer to simulate the process in order to ensure it would work , and the team has built prototypes of the trapping nanopore .
Tuesday 's announcement marks the beginning of the testing and refinement stages of the process .
What remains is to investigate the means to identify the individual nucleotides trapped inside the nanopores , which is likely to rest on measuring some electrical or electronic property of each as it passes .
Stas Polonsky , another IBM researcher working on the project , remains convinced that with the benefit of a trapping mechanism , this last problem is tractable .
" As a company we have a lot of expertise with electrical measurements , " he said .
" We have nanopores plus the whole arsenal of microelectronics - we can integrate all these ultrasensitive circuits right on a chip , which will boost the sensitivity for measurements tremendously . "

Video - Grayson and Bernanke - July 22 , 2009
Given the dollar free - for - all announced this week for European banks , this short clip helps explain how the liquidity swaps will work .
---
Here 's an update from Bloomberg ...
Former prosecutor , Alan Grayson wants details on the $ 553 billion in foreign central bank liquidity swaps that were issued last Fall in response to the global financial crisis .
These swaps grew from $ 24 billion at end of 2007 to $ 553 billion at the end of 2008 .
Specifically , Grayson wants to know who got it , how much they got , whether it is constitutional , why Congress was not consulted , and whether these swaps contributed to the near 30 % concomitant rise in the U.S. Dollar ?
From Bernanke 's testimony this morning before the House Financial Services Committee , I have transcribed the following exchange :
Grayson : " What 's that ( the $ 553 billion ) ? "
B - 52 : " Those are swaps that were done with foreign central banks ... "
Grayson : " So who got the money ? "
B - 52 : " Financial institutions in Europe and other countries ... "
Grayson : " Which ones ? "
B - 52 : " I do n't know . "
Grayson : " Half a trillion dollars and you do n't know who got the money ? "
B - 52 : " Um , um , the loans go to the central banks and they then put them out to their institutions ... "
Grayson : " Let 's start with which central banks ? "
B - 52 : " Well there 's 14 of them ... I 'm sure they 're listed in here somewhere . "
Grayson : " Who actually made that decision to hand out half a trillion dollars ? "
B - 52 : " The FOMC . "
Grayson : " Under what legal authority ? "
B - 52 : " Section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act ... "
There 's much more ( I only transcribed a portion of the first 90 seconds ) .

When Jen-Hsun Huang , co-founder and CEO of nVidia announced that he expects to see Tegra capturing 50 % of nVidia ’s revenue within the next couple of years , a lot of people thought that this is a smoke screen to sway the attention from its battles against AMD and Intel .
Incredibly how it may sound , from what we are hearing nVidia is dead on achieving its course .
With a very aggressive approach , the company managed to sway not just Microsoft with the Zune HD multimedia player [ based on Tegra APX 2600 ] or Samsung ’s BeatPlayer M1 [ also known as YP - M1 ] , but also a long - time IBM and ATI customer – Nintendo .
Launched in 2004 , the Nintendo DS and its two latter redesigns [ DS Lite and DSi ] sold in massive 111.49 million units .
With almost 40 million handheld consoles sold in United States alone , Nintendo DS owns 68.3 % of worldwide market share .
The successor was soon on its way
As the time passed by , Nintendo started to work on the successor of its handheld console with a debut planned for late 2010 [ Tokyo Game Show 2010 ? ] .
According to our confidential sources , Nintendo is going to use Tegra System - on - Chip processor for the successor of DS / DSi handheld console .
Unlike the current design , nVidia offered a single - chip proposal to Nintendo , a company famous for keeping the hardware platform absolutely simple .
Given the fact that current Nintendo DS hardware is based upon two ARM cores [ ARM7 and ARM9 series ] , it looks like Next - Gen DS could be backwards compatible with the DS application library , courtesy of ARM11 core inside current Tegra SoC products .
According to our sources , “ all of the apps that came for old DS can run on a single ARM11 core – yet alone the CorTex A9 - based next - gen Tegra , leaving graphics subsystem to do “ something smarter ” .
In any case , the hardware is now much more potent and should easily enable developers to push the envelope even further .
Currently , we have no information what exact chip is being used [ just that nVidia won the contract ] , but with the debut set for February 2010 , the second generation of Tegra chips could make an excellent base [ to be launched at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , as confirmed by GDGTPreview.com ] .
The question of power consumption and performance
Gen2 Tegra offers quite a graphics punch ; GeForce 9 based hardware [ CUDA - enabled design ] should offer immense experience on small screens – we see no reason why you could not have 4x Anti-Aliasing and 8x Anisotropic filtering on a dual - screen system .
If Nintendo picked the current gen hardware , i.e. Tegra 600 or APX 2600 – it will be getting 65 nm chips .
If they go with 2nd gen parts , they will get 40nm chips offering even higher performance and lower power consumption .
The moment we learn about the exact hardware going into Nintendo ’s next - gen console , we ’ll inform you .
Thus , it is not hard for us to imagine that Tegra could outship GeForce boards just like Intel ’s Atom CPU shipped in more units than expensive Nehalem processors .
Naturally , the profit ratio is significantly different , but something in the range of $ 4 - 5 per chip would mean nVidia could hit a jackpot and earn half a billion USD from a single deal [ over the course of life for the Nintendo ’s next - gen part ] .
Now , the billion dollar question is : if Nintendo chose nVidia for the handheld console , does that mean nVidia may have an entrance into the lucrative Wii business ?
Bear in mind that the Wii console was sold in 53.97 million units , taking almost half of current console market [ 48.4 % , according to our sources from Invader.com ] .
Also , we wonder what is going to be in next - generation PlayStation Portable …
Update October 14 , 2009 17:14 GMT –
In order to clean up any confusion , we have clarified the article with two major updates .
Nintendo DS uses two 32 - bit ARM cores .
However , ARM7 core was used predominately for 16 - bit instructions via Thumb instruction sets [ as our source clarified to us ] .
Current Gen Tegra APX series uses ARM11 core .
Next - gen Tegra uses dual ARM CorTex - A9 cores .
That information was confirmed to us by nVidia and should not be regarded as a rumor .

Police have accused a TV presenter in Brazil of being involved in organised drug trafficking and ordering killings to get rid of rivals and boost ratings .
Wallace Souza , who is also a state legislator , says the claims are an attempt by rivals to smear him and that there is no evidence to back them .
But the police say he ordered killings in the state of Amazonas and alerted TV crews to get them to the scene first .
His TV show was halted late last year as police stepped up their inquiry .
If what the police say is true , then this is the TV show that not only reported crime , but was actually behind it as well .
Son charged
The authorities believe that Mr Souza commissioned at least five murders in order to get rid of drug trafficking rivals and to boost his programme ratings .
They say he wanted to prove his claims that the region he represented in the state of Amazonas was plagued with crime .
A local police chief told the Associated Press that the order to execute always came from the presenter and his son , and that TV crews were alerted to get to the scene of the crime first .
State Security Secretary Francisco Cavalcanti says the truth has now become clear .
" On several occasions they fabricated the facts , they fabricated news , " Mr Cavalcanti said .
Wallace Souza faces a variety of charges , including drug trafficking and weapons possession , but remains free because for the moment his political role gives him immunity .
His son Rafael , meanwhile , has been arrested on charges of murder , drug trafficking and illegally possessing guns .
Lawyers for Wallace Souza , a former policeman who was expelled from the force , say the accusations are an attempt to smear him and that there is not one piece of material proof to back the police claims .

MEXICO CITY , Mexico —
The five teenage boys slump against the wall of a dark house and eye the camcorder nervously .
Suddenly , a fist enters the frame smacking one of the boys in the face .
Then the barrel of an automatic rifle appears and the teenagers ’ expressions turn to terror .
“ Why are you here ? ” shouts a voice .
“ For robbing , ” one of the boys mumbles .
“ You see .
You were little rats and now look at you , ” replies the interrogator .
The torture video of the five alleged house burglars was posted on the internet last week .
It is the latest sign of brutal vigilante justice spreading across Mexico .
As kidnappings , muggings and car jackings spiral out of control , and the authorities appear increasingly impotent , shadowy groups have been advocating justice by the sword .
In other recent cases , alleged kidnappers and car thieves have been abducted and murdered and had their corpses dumped in public places along with threatening notes .
There are also rising cases of mobs lynching alleged thieves and leaving them beaten , naked and tied up .
“ The government is failing to provide security and people are turning to some brutal alternatives , ” said Rossana Reguillo , who studies crime and violence at the Jesuit University of Guadalajara .
“ This is not something that has always been around in Mexico .
It is a new phenomenon that has been growing since 2000 . ”
In the latest case , the five teenagers were abducted after they allegedly robbed a house in the town of Tepic in the Pacific state of Nayarit .
The boys — all students of a local high school — were taken to an abandoned building where they had their heads shaved and then were beaten by fists and rifle butts and threatened at gun point , as shown on the video .
One of the torturers is heard on the film saying he is the man whose house was robbed .
The teenagers were also forced to perform sexual acts — including kissing each other in front of the camera — as a humiliation .
The gunmen are heard threatening to cut their hands off unless they comply .
After being held all night the students were dumped naked on the street and then attended at hospital for injuries including broken ribs .
The torture film was posted on YouTube under the title “ Little Rats of Tepic . ”
YouTube ’s monitors quickly removed it from the site , flagging it as unsuitable content .
Following an outcry over the film , police on Monday arrested four building workers for the torture .
However , one of the boys said they had first been arrested by state police and it was the officers themselves who turned them to the vigilantes .
The Nayarit police chief denies the charge , saying officers did not question the boys until after they had been tortured .
The incident sparked disgust and condemnation from many .
“ Opening the door to justice by your own hand is an enormous step back to a state of barbarism and lack of culture , ” said Huicot Rivas , the president of Nayarit ’s Human Rights Commission .
“ In a democratic state , crime can never be used to combat crime . ”
However , others cheered on the vigilantes for trying to clean up the streets .
“ For me the men who made this video are heroes .
I sincerely admire them , ” wrote a reader on the website of Mexican newspaper El Universal .
“ In Mexico , we need death squads to hunt and exterminate rats and kidnappers without further expense to society and the without human rights people getting in the way . ”
“ I recognize that this is not the correct way to administer justice but I can’t deny that it makes me happy that this type of thing happens , ” wrote another reader .
Such feelings reflect desperation among many in Mexico about the lack of security .
Amid a drug war that has left thousands dead , rates of anti-social crimes such as kidnapping and carjacking have risen to become among the worst in the world .
At the same time , conviction rates for these relatively minor crimes are as low as 5 percent .
Many readers of newspapers have also written in to commend shadowy vigilante groups that have publicly announced their appearance in crime - plagued communities .
One such group called the Popular Anti-Drugs Army materialized among farming towns in the southern state of Guerrero .
Displaying blankets with written messages on bridges and buildings , the group claimed to be made up of family men who had come together to force drug dealers off the street .
“ We invite the people to join our struggle and defend our children who are the future of Mexico , ” it said on one of the blankets .
The group has been linked to several killings , including the decapitation of an alleged drug dealer in December .
Following stories of that slaying , readers hailed the efforts in some Mexican media outlets .
“ My sincerest congratulations to these brave men with their courage and determination , ” wrote a reader of Mexican newspaper Milenio .
“ God help them with their noble cause . ”
Investigators suspect that organized - crime groups themselves could be behind many of the vigilantes .
While the gangsters traffic drugs to the United States , some are against selling them in their own communities and are opposed to criminals such as muggers and kidnappers .
A similar situation emerged in Colombia in the 1990s , when paramilitary groups both trafficked drugs and enforced the law against petty crooks in the fiefdoms they controlled .
The investigator Reguillo says that while it may not get as bad as Colombia , the vigilantism does pose a real threat to the Mexican state .
“ When armed groups administer their own justice , this represents an alternate power , ” she said .
“ This a major problem for democracy in Mexico . ”
With the 10th season of The Ultimate Fighter now in full swing , here ’s a quick look at 10 things we ’ve learned so far …
1. Kimbo Slice Is Still A Ratings Winner
The first episode drew 4.1 million viewers , a record for the show , and the highest rating ever for a show debut on Spike TV .
the third episode brought what the fans had been waiting for – Kimbo Slice ’s fight with Roy Nelson .
The episode outdid the previous record , pulling in a mammoth 5.3 million viewers , with a peak of 6.1 million .
After his defeat ratings have dropped closer to 3 million viewers – still good numbers when compared to previous seasons .

2. Roy Nelson Is This Seasons Douchebag
A key ingredient of each season of TUF is for one fighter to man up and take on the time honored role of season douchebag .
Whilst no Junie Browning , Roy ‘ Big Country ’
Nelson has wasted no time in letting the other cast members know that he is well qualified to take on the role .
After only two episodes he had already infuriated his trainers who branded him “ uncoachable ” due to his poor attitude .
Dana
White also appears far from impressed .
After a less than stellar win over Kimbo Slice , Nelson strutted around the cage like he ’d just defeated a world champion , and confidently declared that he was “ glad to put on a show for Dana and Lorenzo . ”
Meanwhile Dana had a different opinion .
He thought the fight “ sucked . ”

3. Marcus Jones Is An Unusual Human Being
At 6ft 6 and 265 lbs , former NFL star Marcus Jones has an intimidating physique , perfect for a mixed martial artist .
In training he appears to be throwing his sparring partners around like ragdolls .
Despite this , when he ’s not beating the life out of his opponents , “ Big Baby ” reveals he likes nothing better than to indulge in his passion for gardening .
That ’s not the only revelation he has up his sleeve though .
“ I used to be very passionate about Dungeons & Dragons , ” he admit before sheepishly confessing , “ I might be the most boringest [ sic ] brother at home ” .

4. Kimbo Slice ’s Ground Game Rivals Cheick Kongo’s
Having been training and fighting professionally as a mixed martial artist for over two years you would have assumed that Kimbo Slice may have at least acquired the basics of the ground game .
If he has then it appears he ’s been taking lessons from Cheick Kongo who ’s idea of ground defense is to deflect his opponents punches with his head .
Proving himself to be a quick learner however , Slice did manage to nulify the worst of Roy Nelson ’s ground and pound by sticking his head into the flabby mass of “ Big Country ’s ” ever - expanding belly .

5. Rampage Jackson Is Possibly The Worst TUF coach Of All Time
… and that ’s really saying something considering Ken Shamrock was once a coach on the show .
There ’s a number of examples to illustrate this point , but really , one will suffice …
“ Do what you got to do Abe , do what you got to do ” was just one of the pearls of wisdom he shared to team member Abe Wagner in episode one .
In the middle of being beat to a bloody pulp at the time , Abe clearly had n’t the foggiest idea what he was supposed to be doing .
Not to worry , Rampage was on hand with more helpful advice born from his years of professional fighting experience .
“ … you got to do something Abe , you got to do something … ”

6. Some Of The Heavyweights Have Yet To Discover ‘ Cardio ’
Despite featuring a number of pro fighters and former NFL football players , most of this seasons heavyweights appear to have the cardio of a 60 year old couch potato .
Nowhere was this more apparent than in the James McSweeney Vs Wes Shivers fight .
Shivers appeared to gas somewhere between walking into the cage and touching gloves with McSweeney at the beginning of the first round .
Not to be outdone McSweeney threw a couple of kicks before quickly following suit .
By the end of the bout both had essentially dispensed with the notion of fighting and were busy clutching their knees and gasping for breath , occasionally responding to the exasperated pleas of their coaches to fight by shuffling around the cage after each other like a couple of asthmatic geriatrics .

7. Rashad Evans Seems Like A Good Coach
Whilst Rampage Jackson bungles his way through the coaching aspect of the show like a mixed martial arts equivalent of Inspector Clouseau , Rashad Evans could n’t fail to look like a tactical genius in comparison .
Some of the skills Evan ’s appears to have over Jackson in this area include A . Picking his team based on their skills rather than how tall or famous they are .
B. Having a strategy and C. Giving his fighters USEFUL advice during their fights .
In all seriousness he does appear to be one of the better coaches we ’ve seen on TUF to date , and his methods are working so far as his team is now up 5 - 0 .
—
8. Kimbo Slice Is A Likable Grafter
There are easier and quicker ways for Kimbo Slice to make money than appearing on The Ultimate Fighter .
He does however appear to be willing to start at the bottom and work his way up .
Aware of his weaknesses , Slice remains humble .
“ I ’m a rookie at this ” he acknowledged after his defeat , “ I ’m a street fighter trying to become an ultimate fighter . ”
His attitude and willingness to learn may help to silence some of his critics .
—
9. Rampage And Rashad Really Don’t Like Each Other
Whilst Rampage is clearly the funnier of the two , when it comes to a bit of the old verbal jousting , Rashad has proved more than a match for him so far .
In the last episode after Team Rampage slumped to a fifth consecutive defeat , Rashad critized his ‘ hands off ’ approach to coaching and , as things escalated , informed him that “ I can fight you with your style and still beat your ass . ”
On the losing end of the exchange , it was n’t long before Rampage beat a hasty retreat saying , “ Conversation over , Imma get to my troops . ”
Rashad shouted after him , “ what you gonna do , just go in there and text ?
It ’s not like your gonna teach them nothing … sorry ass ! ”
It ’s only a matter of time before Rampage punches him in the face , or , if things get really bad , digs out the ‘ Yo Momma … ‘ jokes .
—
10 . The Best Is Still To Come
… or so Dana White would have us believe .
We do have faith though , mainly because it ’s hard to imagine things getting much worse than the first three episodes .
It ’s somewhat ironic that the show had it ’s biggest viewing figures ever for some of the worst fights ever seen in 10 series of the show .
The fourth and particularly the fifth episodes were definitely an improvement .
There ’s still a lot of ground to make up though if this is to meet Dana ’s estimation that “ by episode 8 your going to be going wild . ”

What are Dual Flush Retrofit Kits ?
Without changing how your toilet flushes in " regular " mode , a dual flush retrofit kit offers you the choice of not wasting a whole gallon and a half of water with each flush if you do n't need to .
Dual flush toilets save thousands of gallons of water a year and reduce your water bills .
Up until recently you had to spend upwards of three hundred dollars for a new dual flush toilet .
Now several companies offer dual flush toilet conversion kits that are easy to install and achieve the same results as buying an new toilet .
They work on almost any low flush 1.6 gallon toilet and turn it into a dual flush toilet .
Why Dual Flush ?
Dual flush toilets have been common in water scarce regions around the world for decades .
In Australia most toilets are dual flush .
They feature two buttons , or two lever positions , one for solids and one for liquids .
Since we use the bathroom more often for " liquids " so to say , we do n't need to flush all 1.6 gallons from a low flush toilet down the drain .
Instead we can get by for small flushes with just half of that .
Imagine saving almost one gallon for those kinds of flushes and you can see how quickly a dual flush conversion kit can pay for itself .
How Hard Is It To Convert Your Toilet To Dual Flush ?
It takes someone with basic handyman skills about twenty minutes to convert a regular low flush , 1.6 gallon toilet to dual flush .
It involves removing the bolts that hold the tank onto the bowl , disconnecting the water line and taking the tank off .
See below for complete details .
How Much Water Will a Dual Flush Retrofit Kit Save ?
The best part is that a dual flush conversion kit will pay for itself in about two months at most city 's water rates .
Say for example you have a family of five and each person flushes for " liquids " about four times a day .
That is twenty flushes wasting .8 gallons if you are not using a dual flush toilet .
Once you install the retrofit kit the same twenty flushes will use 16 gallons less water .
At sixteen gallons a day , more than many families around the world use a week , you can expect to save almost six thousand gallons of water a year .
Depending on were you live that six thousand gallons can cost you from sixty dollars to three hundred dollars .
There are not many green products that are so simple and inexpensive and yet pay you back so fast .
The Coming Water Crisis
It 's front page news in many parts of the United States : " Water Shortage " .
Perhaps because of global warming or just population growth , water supplies around the country are being forced to require water rationing and increase rates for residential and commercial customers to curb demand .
It will only get worse in the coming decade so now might be a good time to start making your home more water efficient with products like a dual flush toilet .
Installing The Dual Flush Kit
First you turn off the water supply to the toilet at the small valve down near the floor .
For most toilets you will need adjustable pliers and a number 2 Phillips or flat head screwdriver ( depending on your toilet ) .
Flush the toilet and sponge out any water that remains .
Unscrew water hose at the connection where it meets the tank .
Next unscrew the wing nuts that hold the tank to the bowl .
You may need your screwdriver to hold the screw heads inside the tank while you undo the wing nuts underneath the tank .
Now the bowl should lift off easliy .
Carry it to your workbench and lie it on its side .
Now you can unscrew the plastic nut on the part where the water leaves the tank and flows into the bowl .
Most toilets have a large rubber piece that seals it to the bowl .
Pull this off and unscrew the plastic nut that holds the flapper assembly or old toilet valve assembly in place .
Place the flush assembly part of new dual flush retrofit kit assembly in the tank and make sure all the new rubber washers are in place as per the instructions .
Screw it down snug but do n't overdo it .
Do the same with the valve part , which will connect to the water hose .
Replace the old toilet flush handle with the one supplied .
Now you can place the bowl back on the toilet connect the small water line and you should be ready to turn on the water supply and fill the tank .
Just make sure you have the large rubber washer in place between the tank and bowl .
Now all you have to do is educate the family on when to lift up and when to push down to flush .
You can find more water saving ideas here : Water Saving
Update :
There is now another type of dual flush conversion kit on the market that does not require taking the tank off .
It is called the MJSI HydroRight Dual Flush Converter .
I installed one in less than five minutes .
Both types are great water savers but I must say that I much prefer a traditional handle to a push button .
The EnviroFlush is an easier to use dual flush converter in my opinion .
The following is some theoretical learning I have done about functions of functions in Haskell and F# .
It uses haskells type and function notation but has a couple of F#s ( perhaps actually ocaml ? ) names for functions because they are clearer for my purposes because they have clear directionality , and the flipped versions show some of the similar properties more clearly than the commonly used versions .
There are two main operations you can do with function values :
Apply them , and compose them .
One other operation referenced here is flip , which swaps the argument order of the function .
First up , the function application operator , with its haskell name and then the F# versions that i'm going to prefer :
$ :: ( a -> b ) -> a -> b <| :: ( a -> b ) -> a -> b -- Function application ; <| = ( $ ) |> :: a -> ( a -> b ) -> b -- Pipeline |> = flip ( $ )
The second common operator on functions is function composition ;
Again the haskell name followed by the F# names .
The latter is not to be confused with haskell 's monad operator of the same name << .
. :: ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> b ) -> ( a -> c ) << :: ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> b ) -> ( a -> c ) << = (. ) >> :: ( a -> b ) -> ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> c ) >> = flip (. )
In Haskell its not immediately obvious that monadic bind is related to function application ; in this case apply a function to a value in a monadic context .
With the flipped function application ( aka pipeline ) operator we can see clear similarities in the types :
|> :: a -> ( a -> b ) -> b >>= :: Monad m => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b <| :: ( a -> b ) -> a -> b =<< :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> m a -> m b
Note that in both cases there is a function applied to a value , in the case of the bind operators that value is in a Monad type .
The difference is that bind has a more specific type than plain application , in the form of a type that implements the monad interface .
This provides richer semantics about the function application .
We know that there is a relationship between function application and function composition .
This is particularly clear with pipeline and right facing compose .
In this expression , g and h are both functions .
f val = val |> g |> h == f = g >> h
And given we know there is a relationship between bind and application , it can easily be supposed that there is a similar operation to composition specifically for monadic functions .
If we replace the three functions in the type of compose with monadic operations , we get an operator with a type such as :
>> :: ( a -> b ) -> ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> c ) >=> :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> ( b -> m c ) -> ( a -> m c ) << :: ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> b ) -> ( a -> c ) <=< :: Monad m => ( b -> m c ) -> ( a -> m b ) -> ( a -> m c )
Indeed this operator does exist and is known as Kleisli composition of monads .
Generalized functions of functions
A key feature that Monads bring is that they allow a single operator to generalize many different kinds of function applications .
The types that implement the Monad typeclass in haskell each provide different contexts to manage how various functions are applied .
The identity monad effectively is the function application operator dressed up with a more complex type .
Given there is a generalization for application , it seems likely that there would be a generalisation for composition too as we have already seen two general patterns .
It turns out that there is , and in Haskell it is known as the Arrow typeclass .
Of particular interest here , Arrow provides an operator :
>>> :: Arrow ar => ar b c -> ar c d -> ar b d
An arrow type ' ar a b ' represents a transformation from some type a to type b.
For example :
a -> b -- becomes : Arrow ar => ar a b Monad m => a -> m b -- becomes : ( Arrow ar , Monad m ) => ar a ( m b )
This , the function application ( >> ) and Kleisli operators ( > => ) can be represented in terms of Arrows as :
>> :: ( a -> b ) -> ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> c ) >>> :: Arrow ar => ar b c -> ar c d -> ar b d >=> :: Monad m => ( a -> m b ) -> ( b -> m c ) -> ( a -> m c ) >>> :: ( Arrow ar , Monad m ) => ar b ( m c ) -> ar c ( m d ) -> ar b ( m d)
What 's the point ?
All this shows just shows a correspondence between monads , arrows and the primative operations of functions .
In particular how those operations can be generalised when more specific types are involved .
President Raul Castro told the national assembly in Havana last week that the government had cut its budget for the second time this year .
Few had expected that a decision to cut imports by 20 per cent to save government funds would have a knock on effect in the smallest room of every Cuban home , with lavatory paper among the products that have been disappearing from the shelves of state - run stores .
When writing or thinking about some organization of people , in the interest of clarity I try to put things in terms of the individuals who are acting under the auspices of the umbrella organization .
Without this mental convention I risk attributing their actions to an abstraction , the façade behind which the actual people who are doing things hide .
When someone says , " The government did this , " or " The Accounting Department did that , " in neither case is it technically true that such lifeless abstractions did anything .
Only those men and women in decision - making and administrative roles acted .
For good or ill , it is they who bear responsibility , and attributing their individual actions to the organization in which they labor leads to a host of misunderstandings .
The most pervasive of these is the state .
The state is the central abstraction by which a catastrophically wrong idea is placed into practice .
It is the organized system for employing violent action ( or its threat ) on the part of individuals , for as noted before , only individuals act .
This rationalization occurs on two levels , first by diffusing responsibility to a fiction and second by inducing a group - think inversion of standards .
Belief in the state provides the means for individuals to avoid their own perception of responsibility .
This is how we see the legislator , the cop , and the judge ( along with their armies of support staff ) able to survey the uniformly awful outcomes of their collective actions without embracing a hint of personal responsibility .
They are but cogs in the machine , they ’ll say , and they did n’t make the rules .
Even the legislator will claim that the final bill he voted for was " not ideal , " and that if it was up to him it would be different .
This is the fountainhead of the phrase , " I ’m sorry , I ’m just enforcing the rules " whereby what little personal and private empathy the enforcer feels toward her victim evaporates under the pressure of the organization in which she labors .
Occasionally we are even treated to the spectacle of enforcement bureaucrats weeping for the victims of their actions , like when a judge is " forced " by statute to unjustly imprison an individual because of " mandatory minimums . "
This bulwark against personal responsibility extends in almost equal measure to the victims ’ perceptions as well .
Rarely are specific individuals deemed personally responsible for the harms they inflict on the targets of their work .
" He ’s just doing his job " is an oft - encountered comment even among those just given a ticket for driving a safe speed that happens to be above the posted limit .
Past heads of state , though personally responsible for policies of murder and mayhem beyond description , are generally treated with deference and respect in direct proportion to the size of the armies they commanded and the height of corpse piles left behind .
This elimination of personal responsibility would be meaningless , however , without the inversion of moral standards induced by citizens ’ personal self - identification with the state .
Lifelong exposure to media - carried circuses and mythology induces an intense sense of identity with this abstraction by nearly all participants ; suddenly acts deemed universally wrong when performed by private individuals are rehabilitated into right when performed by individuals acting on behalf of a social abstraction , the state .
This inversion feeds the near - universal appeal of the state because it allows individual citizens the opportunity to systematically act on the violent impulses that reside in each person .
This rationalization is a powerful process .
It allows nice people to nod in agreement when Dick Cheney issues an unsubstantiated claim that terrorizing a helpless man by inducing a reflexive sensation of drowning has saved them from some nameless violence .
It allows 19 - year - old soldiers to " follow orders " with near total disregard of normal standards of humanity , dooming themselves to the living hell of lifelong regret that underlies the tragic condition of many veterans .
It generates a vicarious sense of power in many people when CNN shows a video of 500 - lb bombs detonating in urban areas .
It allows citizens who abhor the thought of holding pistols in their own hands the ability to employ costumed enforcers holding pistols to threaten and even slaughter those whose actions , while not harmful , fall outside those citizens ’ personal opinion of " right behavior . "
Revolutionary Language Calderwood , David C. Best Price : $ 4.48 Buy New $ 13.27 ( as of 03:45 EST - Details )
In every case , we see the belief in an abstraction , the state , allows people to act out their darkest fantasies in complete , albeit temporary freedom from natural laws , limits and personal responsibility .
No wonder the state , particularly its apotheosis , democracy , is so revered :
In the name of any definable Greater Good , any action undertaken by those claiming membership in the state is sanctified .
This renders every participant in the political process a co-tyrant ; each voter unconsciously enjoys the possibility of seeing everyone compelled to populate his or her own particular Utopia .
In the name of stamping out racism or sexism in people ’s minds , or eliminating poverty or violence , people ardently demand statism and poverty - inducing taxation / regulation , all enforced by violence .
Only the abstraction , the state , allows them the means to rationalize acting upon these dark fantasies by creating a collective morality that is an inversion of the neighbor - to - neighbor kind .
It does not require an obsession with the language to reject the silly notion that christening violence and threats with a word , government , thereby absolves of wrongdoing all the individuals employing violence and threats .
Truly peaceful people recoil from giving physical reality to their darkest impulses .
We reject any special " collective morality " and the magical thinking about the state which supports it .
This view may explain how an abstract abomination polluting human endeavor has exhibited such a tenacious hold on people .
Belief in the efficacy and utility of the state has reached apogee in our lifetimes despite its uninterrupted record of failure .
This means that caution is warranted ; as we experience the greatest failure of collectivist policy in centuries , by no means is it the end of statism as we know it .
The demon of collective violence is buried deeply and it will probably not be exorcised quickly , meaning far more difficulty ahead for the wise , who trust in and love liberty .

If you 've thought about picking up an Android - powered phone but found yourself turned off by the hardware choices ( ahem , G1 ) , you may soon wish to reconsider .
" Android adoption is about to explode , " said Eric Schmidt , Google 's CEO , in an earnings conference call Thursday .
" You have all the necessary conditions . "
Schmidt 's forecast may prove accurate with 12 Android - powered devices available in 26 countries on 32 carriers .
Recent Android rumors , announcements and releases further fuel the rumble in the mobile community .
By handing out Android as an open source platform , Google aims to help manufacturers focus more time , money and energy on their hardware and specific usability for each device .
Using the Android OS , there is no need to re-invent the wheel when it comes to the mobile software .
Developmental resources can instead be allocated to innovation and quicker adaptation of emerging technology .
This direction in mobile development does seem to create the " necessary conditions " for Android to appeal to an extremely broad range of users .
When the first Android phone , the HTC G1 , was released in September 2008 , some developers questioned how Google would address making the Android OS and third - party apps work smoothly with various types of hardware .
Screen resolution was a primary concern among developers polled by Wired.com :
How could an app designed to work with the G1's resolution , for example , work with another Android phone sporting a different resolution ?
Fortunately , the Android team at Google is working to ensure their platform is compatible with every mobile phone , specifically when it comes to screen resolution .
The Android 1.6 SDK , the developer 's kit , allows a manufacturer or developer to add code in their application to conform to different handset 's resolutions .
( For example , " Do this when the phone has a resolution of 320x480 ; do that when the resolution is larger . " )
They have created three categories of resolution sizes that any given device will fall into , ensuring a single third - party app will work across all phones .
There is also a " compatibility mode " developers can incorporate into their applications built prior to 1.6 , aka Donut .
Excited by the Android mobile - nova ?
We 've created a list of the 12 Android - powered smartphones so you can begin researching and deciding which one is best for you :

Personally , the video you are about to watch ( brought to my attention by figgifig ) is pretty amazing : I would say this is pretty conclusive evidence of why Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera is able to throw only one pitch that has unpredictable , yet precise movement .
He has mastered the Angels so far in the ALCS but has Major League Baseball gotten a look at how he " warms up " for his appearance on the mound ?
You be the judge ...
With a tie game in the bottom of the 10th , the Yankees bring in Rivera .
After warming up , he has his back to home plate so the home plate ump can't see .
He looks down at the ball , then up to see if the 2nd base ump is watching .
He then looks back at the ball and appears to spit on it .
And when he tests clean for steroids they say he is not a cheater .
The spitball was banned by baseball in the early 1920s .
It gave the pitcher an unfair advantage with the " funny " movement that the pitch seemed to make , and was deemed unsafe to batters as the ball was not as visible when marred with foreign substances .

Maxi Sopo said he was born to party in his Facebook status updates A man on the run , wanted for fraud by US authorities , inadvertently revealed where he was hiding through a series of extravagant Facebook updates .
Cameroon - born Maxi Sopo's messages made it clear he was living the high life in the Mexican resort of Cancun .
He also added a former US justice department official to his friend list who ended up helping to track him down .
US officials say Mr Sopo and an associate falsely obtained more than $ 200,000 in credit from banks .
In recent status updates Mr Sopo said he was " loving it " , described himself as " living in paradise " and said he was " just here to have fun " .

" He was making posts about how beautiful life is and how he was having a good time with his buddies , " said Assistant US Attorney Michael Scoville .
" He was definitely not living the way we wanted him to be living , given the charges he was facing , " he added .
The 26 - year - old , who is currently in custody in Mexico City , initially sold roses in Seattle nightclubs after arriving in the US in 2003 .
He then allegedly moved on to bank fraud .
The former justice department official whom Mr Sopo befriended on the social networking site said he had only met the fugitive a few times in the city 's nightclubs and had no idea that he was on the run .
He was able to discover exactly where Mr Sopo was living and the information was passed to the Mexican authorities who arrested him last month .

In an effort to expedite stolen personal identities and financial records of unsuspecting users , online deviants are using an Instant Messaging component of their attack software , coupled malware .
According to RSA Security , the Zeus Trojan informs hackers when their desired information has been poached .
With Zeus , hackers can act faster in completing their time - sensitive illegal acts , which could lead to even more victims being targeted .
Internet security firms are very familiar with the Zeus Trojan , blaming it for an endless trail of online bank account heists .
Most believe Zeus is the invention of a Russian hacker who commonly refers to himself simply as " A - Z " .
The malware is featured in most underground circles where it is sold to emergent cybercriminals .
Zeus can even be customized according to the needs of the hacker ( attacking log - in information from a pre-specified list , for example ) .

Zeus not The First Instant Messaging Malware
Zeus is not the first case of a virus utilizing instant messaging .
RSA
Security also learned that the password - stealing program Sinowal has been using instant messaging components in their attacks for some time .
Still , Zeus appears to be more damaging than Sinowal .
In total , about 3.6 million computers in the U.S. alone were affected by Zeus last month , making it one of the most prevalent malicious software programs in existence .
Protecting Yourself from Zeus Malware
You can protect yourself against a ' Zeus attack ' by installing the latest security patches on your computer , by regularly scanning for malware , and by using a firewall .
For further , detailed recommendations please download our Top 10 PC Security Essentials Tech Report from our self - serve kiosk .
Of course , there is always the possibility of a self - induced attack if a person is tricked into opening an email attachment containing the malware .
Thus , be vigilant in checking your emails and especially any files that might accompany them .
Advice for Policymakers : Time to Check Your Blind Spots
Last week , I left my Washington home , walked to the nearby Metro station , rode a train downtown , walked to the National Press Club , and settled in to hear Steven Rattner , former head of the Obama administration ’s auto task force , declare that " no one has yet invented a substitute for the automobile . "
Steven Rattner ( Photo : WSJ
This was like declaring in an airport terminal one ’s hope that man may someday enjoy heavier - than - air powered flight , but most of the heads in the audience nodded in agreement .
Rattner was there to speak on the topic of the administration ’s automobile bailout and rehabilitation strategy .
He was hopeful but realistic ; he recognized that General Motors and Chrysler face an uphill battle , but he believes that the government was able to do enough to give the firms a shot at returning to profitability .
Why that should be a concern of the government is another question altogether , and it ’s not one with which Rattner really engaged .
Understandably , I think , the administration agreed that GM and Chrysler really should n’t be allowed to fail in the depths of recession .
And then I believe they determined that if they were going to keep propping up the companies , they ought to at least shepherd them through a balance sheet - clearing bankruptcy and reorganization , in the hopes that the companies might eventually make money .
But what Rattner was careful not to address was this : Saving the car companies will not protect American automakers ’ market share , will not save the city of Detroit , and will not really save that many jobs .
The line I quote in the first paragraph was made in the context of an argument about annual auto sales , and why sales totals are likely to return to levels typically observed before the recession .
Sales of light vehicles grew to a peak of 17 million in 2005 before declining and then plummeting to their current level , in the neighborhood of 9 million ( save for the month of August , thanks to " cash for " clunkers ) .
According to Rattner , GM will break even at a level around 16.5 million car sales .
Maybe we ’ll get there .
Population continues to grow .
On the other hand , households may find themselves holding on to automobiles longer ( particularly since household debts may remain a problem for the next decade ) .
They may also find themselves buying fewer cars .
America is aging , and households with retirees may not want a car for each commuter .
More families might opt for one vehicle , and use car - sharing services when another vehicle is necessary .
But now we find ourselves in a world in which GM shareholders — among which number you and me and every other taxpayer — need sales to move above 16.5 million to get the company back to profitability .
That ’s a strange place for us to want to be .
If , given the option to buy as many automobiles as they want , Americans choose to buy fewer than they did before , we should cheer .
Cars are expensive and largely used as production goods rather than consumption goods — people buy them because they need them to do other things , like work and buy food .
If they then find that they do n’t need them as much , a lot of revenue is freed which can be used on debt service , health care , better food and homes , education , and entertainment goods .
A world in which Americans are as happy with one car or no cars as they are with two or three is a better one , just as a world in which companies can produce more goods with less energy or machinery is a better one .
The transition is a difficult one for workers in the automobile industry who find themselves needing a new line of work , but nothing in the reconstitution of GM and Chrysler will change that .
Manufacturing processes continue to become less labor - intensive .
That ’s a technological trend that the government is powerless to reverse .
The question , then , is how best to facilitate transitions into new fields .
And here , the bailout looks somewhat counterproductive .
Today a shuttered car plant in Delaware will be converted for use by a producer of electric vehicles .
The decline of GM opens up production possibilities for other enterprises , and the impeding of that decline frustrates them .
It also prevents policymakers from seeing beyond the automobile .
As David Alpert wrote yesterday ( and Sarah Goodyear noted today ) :
I ’ve been meeting with elected officials in the region about
transportation and development issues .
One representative from
Montgomery County recently expressed a general sentiment among area
leaders that " we have to do something " to accommodate increased traffic
between the American Legion Bridge and I -270 .
After all , Virginia is
building HOT lanes that will bring more cars onto the Beltway , and
Maryland is pushing for more lanes on 270 north of Rockville .
Logically , this person said , the state and the county will probably
have to connect the two with additional HOT lanes through Potomac and
Bethesda .
Later in the conversation , when discussing Gaithersburg West , I
noted the potential for biotech development at White Oak .
That location
is already a life sciences hub .
It ’s closer to both DC and Baltimore ,
reducing the likely commutes for people working there versus
Gaithersburg West .
It ’s also in a part of Montgomery County with far
fewer jobs than people , unlike the 270 corridor .
What it lacks , like Gaithersburg West , is good transit .
There
is an inactive proposal to build a Purple Line spur up New Hampshire or
Route 29 to the area .
Why not revive the idea ?
When I brought it up ,
the representative jokingly said something like , " I ’d like some of what
you ’re smoking . "
And in fact , with many transit projects including the
Purple Line , Baltimore Red Line , and Corridor Cities Transitway already
vying for funds , it would be very difficult to add a Purple Line spur
to White Oak .
That ’s the conventional wisdom among most elected officials .
We
" have to do something " to add road capacity .
But transit projects are
so difficult as to be nearly laughable .
Yet freeway projects are not
cheap .
As we saw from ACT ’s alternative plan
for the I - 270 corridor , you can build a lot of transit for the price of
some freeway lanes .
It ’s just that leaders are too accustomed to
viewing road capacity as a necessity and transit as a luxury .
There is a terrible chicken - and - egg problem to transportation planning , in which planners express regret that there is so little transit demand and so much traffic before building new roads .
They have to accommodate the demand they ’ve got !
But you ca n’t have transit demand if you do n’t have transit , and if you do n’t recognize that , then you ’re doomed to keep building roads forever .
No one in the mind of the planners has yet invented a substitute for the automobile .
But of course , that ’s not true .
There are many substitutes for the personal auto .
And now that households seem to be warming to them , the government finds itself looking at the shift as a problem to be solved , rather than a welcome trend to be encouraged .
It ’s fine to try and alleviate the pain of a major economic transition , but if officials do n’t understand that the transition is just that , and not a temporary slump , they may attempt to turn the palliative into a barrier to change .
If you think there ’s no substitute for the automobile , then the decline of the auto industry looks like running headlong off a cliff .
But in reality , there is something just fine on the other side of the transition : a world in which people drive less and do n’t mind it .
Maybe officials blind to that possibility will eventually stumble into it nonetheless .
It would be much better for all concerned — including those dependent on the auto industry for their welfare — if the government managed to see it and chart a course for it .
Fernando Alonso's move to Ferrari , which was finally announced on Wednesday , is the most exciting shift in the Formula 1 fabric for years .
Assuming F1 's traditional giants can both get back to the front , with Alonso at Ferrari going up against Lewis Hamilton at McLaren it sets the best two drivers in the world against each other in the two most famous teams .
Think of James Hunt against Niki Lauda , Alain Prost versus Ayrton Senna , Michael Schumacher taking on Mika Hakkinen .
This is the historical lineage in which Alonso and Hamilton are taking their places , and they have all the qualities required to live up to those expectations .
Schumacher v Hakkinen is perhaps the closest comparison .
Alonso 's year as Hamilton 's team - mate at McLaren in 2007 may have been tempestuous in the extreme , but there is not the personal animosity between the two that there was for a long time between Senna and Prost .
Nor , though , are they exactly the partners in playboy excess that were Hunt and Lauda .
Instead , their relationship is based on a deep respect for each other 's abilities and a similarly powerful will to win .
Alonso and Hamilton have deep respect for each other 's abilities
When they were racing , many people believed that , on a single lap , Hakkinen was actually slightly faster than Schumacher .
Equally , few had any doubts that , overall , Schumacher was the more complete driver .
It is not stretching the point to see Alonso in the Schumacher role and Hamilton as Hakkinen - and that 's not just because of the cars they will be driving in 2010 .
Alonso and Hamilton staged a fascinating battle in 2007 .
Sometimes Hamilton had the edge on Alonso , sometimes it was the other way around .
And they finished the season tied on points , with Hamilton edging second place in the championship behind Ferrari 's Kimi Raikkonen on results count - back .
On the evidence of that one season , it is incredibly difficult to judge who is the better driver .
There was rarely more than a hair 's breadth between them on pace .
But , on balance , in the races where it was possible to make a direct comparison , Hamilton was faster than Alonso slightly more often than it was the other way around .
For a guy in his first season going toe - to - toe with a double world champion , that is incredibly impressive .
But weighing against that , Alonso was never comfortable at McLaren .
By mid-season , the relationship between driver and team was already breaking down and after the watershed of the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend - when Hamilton and Alonso tried to double - cross each other in qualifying , after which Alonso had two massive rows with then - team boss Ron Dennis and threatened to expose the team to the FIA in the now - notorious ' spy scandal ' - it was clear he was on his way out .
Even so , Alonso beat Hamilton fair and square at the next two races and a significant discrepancy in speed between the two men only emerged at the final two races , when it was clear there was a real danger of Alonso beating Hamilton to the title .
And Alonso was not the only person to be suspicious about that .
Many people in F1 believe Alonso , 28 , is the most complete driver in the sport - and the evidence of his career so far makes it hard to dispute that .
Equally , though , it is clear that Hamilton , 24 , has the potential to usurp him , just as he replaced Alonso as the youngest champion in F1 history .
Certainly , the evidence of this season is that the Englishman is beginning to show signs of the wider awareness and racing intelligence that Alonso has displayed for so long .
Now , that battle is going to be staged with the drivers in different cars and teams , with the restrictions that were imposed on them by the requirements of racing for the same organisation removed .
It should be a case of sit back and watch the sparks fly .
At the same time , there are a series of intriguing sub -plots to savour .
It is looking increasingly likely that Raikkonen , who has been elbowed out of Ferrari to make way for Alonso , will move back to McLaren as team - mate to Hamilton .
If that happens , it is in itself a fascinating prospect for , on his day , Raikkonen is a match for anybody .
It would be a surprise if the Finn beat Hamilton over a season , but there may well be times when the Englishman cannot live with him .
And how Hamilton handles that will be a major test for him .
The intra -team fight at Ferrari will also be interesting .
When Raikkonen went there in 2007 , he was expected to easily beat Felipe Massa , but it did n't quite work out that way .
So people will be less willing to make the same assumption about Alonso .
Nevertheless , while Raikkonen regards his job as being to turn up and drive , spending as little time doing anything else as he can get away with , Alonso has more strings to his bow and I , and many others I suspect , expect him to prove too much for the Brazilian .
Finally , there is Robert Kubica 's move to Renault to replace Alonso .
The Pole is highly regarded in F1 , and Ferrari , for one , are known to have their eye on him for the future .
Kubica was a tough rival of Hamilton in karting , and Alonso once described him as the best driver on the grid .
So if Renault can regain the form that won them two world titles in 2005 - 6 , Kubica 's presence at the front would add another dimension .
There 's also the prospect of watching the progress of world champion - elect Jenson Button - arguably the leader of the second string of drivers behind Hamilton , Alonso and Raikkonen - and rising star Sebastian Vettel in a major fight with F1's heavy hitters , if their Brawn and Red Bull teams can maintain the form that has made them front - runners this season .
All in all , the future of F1 looks rosy indeed .
On the track , at least .
Prostitutes worldwide were this weekend congratulating Women ’s Minister Harriet Harman on a job well done – as remarks she made to last week ’s Labour Conference have dramatically increased business for sex workers using online site PunterNet .
A press release put out by the owners of the site pointed to a doubling in site traffic on the day of the speech , while some sex workers point to a near trebling of business since then .
Critics claim this is not the first time that gung - ho initiatives by the Women ’s Minister have had the opposite effect to that intended .
In the course of her speech on 30 September , Ms Harman informed delegates of " a very sinister development which we are determined to stop " .
She then explained : " There is now a website ... where pimps put women on sale for sex and then men who ’ve had sex with them put their comments online .
It is ' PunterNet ' and fuels the demand for prostitutes .
It is truly degrading and puts women at risk . "
She went on to observe that the site included the details of many UK - based women and that she had asked the Governor of California , where punternet is based , to " terminate " all this depravity or else , she added – in predictable sound - bite mode – " I ’ll be back " .
Like many similar pronouncements on sex work , Ms Harman ’s views seem to be based more on thinly veiled distaste and a desire to do all she can to stick an oar in – irrespective of the consequences for the women ( and men ) involved in it – than any informed response to the issues .
The implication that this site is new is factually incorrect , not least because PunterNet itself claims to be now in its tenth year of operation .
Far more serious is the suggestion that it facilitates pimping when , in fact , it tends to do the exact opposite .
As a detailed deconstruction of the site by leading political blogger Alix Mortimer argues : " In short , though it ’s not immediately obvious how this site makes the lives of prostitutes as a whole any better , it ’s certainly not obvious how it makes them worse , and it may even make the odd life here or there quite dramatically better if and when the police do have occasion to intervene on the basis of information they read there .
" This being the case , since no harm is being done and possibly a small amount of good may be being done , Harman ’s posturing completely and comprehensively fails the liberal test . "
This closely matches the views of organisations that represent sex workers : that any technology that allows prostitutes to control their own direct access to clients tends to reduce abuses , while abolishing such channels of communication has the opposite effect .
Thus , Catherine Stephens , an activist with the International Union of Sex Workers ( IUSW ) , was scathing of Ms Harman ’s campaign against home - based sex workers using small ads in local newspapers to find clients , since one effect of this measure was to push those women with little technological nous – and therefore unable to move their businesses online - into the arms of agencies and managers .
Less self - determination ; more potential for abuse .
Similar criticisms have been levelled at other government initiatives in respect to sex work , including measures in the current Policing Bill to attack demand for prostitution by introducing draconian new laws targeting clients , leading Ms Stephens to conclude : " Talk to us , not at us . "
As one individual posted to a discussion of Ms Harman 's remarks on PunterNet itself : " The bit HH seems to be missing , is that sites like PunterNet ENABLE women who want to advertise the selling of sexual services independently , WITHOUT the need for a pimp " . ®
情報処理学会の機関 誌 「 情報処理」の2009年9月号の小特集「コンピュータ将棋の新しい波」がおもしろい。
機械学習に基づく局面評価関数のパラメータ(重み) 調整を取り入れた
Bonanza が話題をさらったのは記憶に新しいが、今年の世界コンピュータ将棋選手権ではソースコードまで全部公開された
Bonanza を用いた手法が多数登場したらしい。( というのはtihara さんの日記で知っていたが ) ちなみに優勝したのは GPS 将棋であり、p.871 に ktanaka 先生や@shnskさん、@gyoshiki さんたちの写真が掲載されている :-)
棋譜や全体の結果は特集を参照してもらうとして、興味深いのは勝又6段の「プロ棋士から見たコンピュータ将棋」と伊藤さんの「合議アルゴリズム『文殊』」。先に後者のほうについて話すと、文殊は多数のプログラムの合議をして多数決で差し手を決めるシステムで、単にアンサンブル学習のことなんじゃないかと思うのだが、このアイデアが出てから実際に効果があることを示すまでの長い道のりについて書いてあって、びっくり。曰く、
とのことで、合議のアイデアを認めさせるために、「ヒントモード(局面を与えて候補手のみを返してくれる機能」を使って人手で(つまり各プログラム間で候補手出すプロトコルがないのでマニュアルでやるしかなかったそうだ)合議システムを実現して勝率を計算したりしていたのだが、あまり協力してくれる開発者がいなくて、そこに
Bonanza がソースコード公開したのでなんとか動くプログラムが作れた、という話。合議の方法も本当は性格(棋風)の違う複数のシステムでアンサンブルしたほうがいいと思うのだが、とりあえず
Bonanza の評価関数に異なる正規乱数を加えただけのものを6システム用意して合議させたそうで、それでオリジナルの
Bonanza より強かった(直接対決ではたまたま負けてしまったが、全体の成績では5位の
Bonanza を抜いて3位 ) 、とのこと 。
もちろん実際に実験するまでは確かなことは言えなかったわけではあるが、合議でよくなるのは(ランダムよりはいい予測を返す弱学習器を多数組み合わせれば高精度の学習器が作れるというブースティングなど、機械学習のバックグラウンドある人には)割と自然な話で、異議を唱える人いないんじゃないかと思っていたが、それに反対する人を説得するためにそこまでするか、というのが意外であった。(ちなみに3位以上は翌年の選手権のシード権があるのだが、「単純多数決の合議システムをアピールするだけに参加したので、シード権は放棄する」ことにしたそうだ)
もう一つの 勝又6段の文章( エッセイ？)は、プロ棋士の視点から書いてあるものの、機械学習(統計的手法)を用いたコンピュータ将棋(もしくは自然言語処理も似たようなものだが)の直感的な説明をしてくれているので、非常によい解説だと思う。
評価関数で苦しんできたプログラマが，機械学習による自動生成でその苦労から解放されたのが大きい．
評価関数はいわが形勢判断（＋大局観）で，コンピュータ将棋のキモになる．いくら読みが深くとも評価関数がつたなかったら意味がない．
( 中略 )
特に囲いの堅さを数値化するというのは絵の美しさを点数にするようなもので，ちょっと局面が変われば数値が変わるため，非常に難しい．(中略)
そこで今までは数値化しやすい駒の損得に多くウェイトがかかっていた．(中略)
ところが今回の大会では駒の損得よりも効率を重視することが非常に多く見られた．(中略)従来のソフトの欠点であり限界にもなっていた駒得至上主義の呪縛から完全に解き放たれたようだ．
( 中略)有効パラメータ数が100万〜80万という膨大な量で，これらの大量のパラメータでプロの感覚という質を手に入れた．まさに「量から質への転換」というべきものだ．(後略)
ちょうど我々はコンピュータ将棋の転換点にいるのでこういう驚きを共有できるのだが、数年もしたら当たり前になってしまって、それからあとこういう流れを知る若い人たちは、「評価関数の重みを人手でチューニングする時代なんてあったの？？？」って思ったりするんだろうなぁ〜……。
具体的にどういうパラメータ数で、どれくらい非ゼロの値がついていて、どういう正則化(評価関数)をしているか、なんて技術的な話は金子さんの「最近のコンピュータ将棋の技術背景と
GPS 将棋」に詳しいので、突っ込んで知りたい人(機械学習のバックグラウンドはあるけどコンピュータ将棋はしたことない人)はそっち読むと「将棋でも同じテクニックが有効なのか」と分かって興味深いと思う。逆に将棋は知っているけど機械学習とか統計とか分からない、という人は
GPS 将棋の評価関数( 機械学習の用語で言うと素性)を見ると、どんな情報を使って学習しているのかが分かっておもしろいだろう。
実際初期の段階の GPS 将棋と何回か対戦したことがあるのだが、あのころからするとこんなに強くなるというのはすごい。やっぱり現在の精度や速度がどうかってのが重要だというビジネス(開発)の立場も分かるが、将来よくなることを信じてコツコツと続ける研究というのはすごいなぁ(結局そういうのが現状から先へ進むために必要)、と改めて思うのであった。
Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software , one of the industry 's major independent developers , thinks Valve should spin off its Steam digital distribution service into an independent company , to reduce existing " conflict of interest " issues .
Pitchford , who co-founded Gearbox in 1999 , told Maximum PC in an interview that while he " personally trust [s ]
Valve , " the Seattle - area company is also a development competitor -- and in that capacity , " as a guy in this industry , I do n't trust Valve . "
" It would be much better if Steam was its own business , " the CEO said .
" There 's so much conflict of interest there that it 's horrid .
It 's actually really , really dangerous for the rest of the industry to allow Valve to win .
"
In addition to the dangers of a potential monopoly , Pitchford warned that the company is already taking advantage of developers smaller than Gearbox , although he did not provide specific details .
" Valve is taking a larger share than it should for the service its providing .
It 's exploiting a lot of small guys , " he said , adding , " For us big guys , we 're going to sell the units and it will be fine .
" Gearbox has a long history with Valve .
Its first completed game was the well - received , an expansion pack for Valve 's original , and it later developed a second expansion , .
Gearbox also contributed to several ports ofto various non-PC platforms .
The company ' sseries is also available in full through Steam .
And preorders for its upcoming shooter / RPG blend , , are currently being sold by Steam as well as by competitors Direct2 Drive and GamersGate , but not Impulse .
" I love Valve games , and I do business with the company , " Pitchford said .
" But , I 'm just saying , Steam is n't the answer . "
It is a question that has plagued lawmakers and medical experts for nearly a century .
As early as 1910 , Abraham Flexner wrote a landmark report that argued teaching hospitals should be staffed only with salaried doctors .
In 1970 , the Carnegie Commission released a report calling for drastic improvements in rural health care , and highlighted Bassett as a model .
Many doctors who work at Bassett believe deeply in its mission .
Bassett has opened 13 clinics in schools around the region .
The clinics lose money , but Bassett is considering opening 14 more .
“ I was in private practice for years in New Mexico , ” said Dr. Philip A . Heavner , the chief of pediatrics at Bassett , “ and there was no interest in doing anything like this because people thought it would take volume away from their practices . ”
Dr. Randall Zuckerman , an attending surgeon at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven , left Bassett a year ago because his wife wanted their four children to grow up closer to family .
Since many of his patients see fee - dependent doctors , Dr. Zuckerman said in an interview , their care is more disjointed than was common at Bassett .
“ They get a lot of different consultations , some necessary and some not , ” he said .
“ They are always missing parts of their medical records because the information is coming from multiple private offices . ”
Michelle Griffiths , 41 , of Edmeston found a lump on her breast six years ago .
During cancer care at Bassett , Ms. Griffiths ’s appointments to see her oncologist and primary care doctor are often scheduled on the same day .
One doctor will sometimes accompany her during a procedure performed by another , and each has her complete medical history .
“ The communication amongst all of my doctors is impressive , ” said Ms. Griffiths , who works as a database administrator for the insurance company New York Central Mutual .
“ They always call each other or shoot each other e-mails . ”
In the past month several high - profile incidents have highlighted what Major General Qassim al - Moussawi , the chief Iraqi military spokesman in Baghdad , described as the outbreak of " a frenzy of violent crime " in Iraq .
Writing in the Times , Richard Kerbaj explained how " everyone is looking for a way to make a quick buck in Iraq , but none more so than the insurgents and gangsters " .
Indeed , present - day levels of crime in Iraq reflect the institutionalisation of criminality that may undermine the country 's long - term development .
The road to the emergence of powerful mafia groups in Iraq did not begin with the 2003 invasion .
Following the 1990 - 91 Gulf war and the curtailment of Iraqi territorial sovereignty through the creation of the " no - fly zones " and the imposition of sanctions , Saddam adapted his control of the country by devolving power to loyal tribes and families .
The rationing of goods through patronage and the corruption around the oil - for - food programme encouraged practices of graft that would flourish and become far bloodier after the 2003 invasion .
In 2002 Saddam emptied his jails in preparation for the US - led invasion .
What followed was the death knell of the Iraqi state , symbolised less by the toppling of Saddam 's statue than by the mass looting and anarchy that embraced the country .
The disbanding of Iraqi security forces by the Coalition Provisional Authority included thousands of border guards , turning the country into a house without doors or windows .
And the attempt to turn it into an instant free market resulted in the abolition of trade tariffs .
Suddenly smuggling – which had blossomed under sanctions – became rampant .
While the CPA was happy to report the increase in the numbers of cars and satellite dishes that were appearing in Baghdad 's markets , one of the less - reported consequences of the invasion was that Iraq became a transit point in the flow of hashish and heroin from Iran and Afghanistan – the world 's largest producer of opium poppies – to Gulf countries and Europe .
The financial rewards of being involved in this trade were accentuated by mass unemployment and poverty in Iraq .
According to the UN's 2008 World Drug Report , a kilo of heroin sells for $ 3,000 in Afghanistan and $ 3,200 in Iran .
By the time it reaches Syria that kilo can fetch $ 17,000 , and $ 21,000 in Jordan .
In Europe the average cost of a kilo of heroin is upwards of $ 35,000 .
Hamid Ghodse , the president of the UN's International Narcotics Control Board , explained in 2005 that " you cannot have peace , security and development without attending to drug control " .
Iraqi mafia groups operated largely under the radar as the horrendous levels of pre-surge violence dominated coverage of the country .
Meanwhile , this violence has combined with greater availability to create a larger internal market for drugs .
In 2007 there was a 23 % increase in drug abuse among children and youth alone according to Ali Mussawi , the president of the local NGO Keeping Children Alive .
Although Iraqi security institutions have improved considerably since their re-establishment , the institutionalisation of criminal groups means that they are regularly able to bribe or bypass customs and security officials .
Recently , on an al - Jazeera programme that asked " Has the Iraqi government lost the war on drugs ? " , Dr Abdul Rahman Hamid , a vet from Al Muthanna province , claimed that drug smugglers have been cutting open camels ' humps to stow their illicit cache .
Drugs are not the only source of criminal financing .
There have being numerous bank robberies across the country .
In one of the most high - profile cases several members of Iraq 's presidential guards – which protect senior officials – broke into the state - run Rafidain Bank on 28 July and stole about $ 4.8 m worth of Iraqi dinars .
In addition , since 2003 the middle and upper classes in particular have been targeted with kidnapping and extortion , forcing millions to flee the country .
Photos of kidnapped relatives are everywhere in Baghdad .
Corrupt security forces provide little break on crime , and children are being ransomed off for as much as £ 63,000 .
Children also find themselves the victims in prostitution syndicates .
Time magazine reported earlier in the year that 11 - to 12 - year - olds were being sold into prostitution for up to $ 30,000 .
The article quoted a human rights activist who witnessed " the buying and selling of girls in Iraq , it 's like the trade in cattle ... I 've seen mothers haggle with agents over the price of their daughters " .
Iraqi government investigations found that 60 % to 70 % of criminal activity is carried out by former insurgent groups or by gangs affiliated to them – partly explaining the brutality of some of the crimes .
Yet when faced with a weak government , itself mired in graft and corruption , and threatening to reduce its security budget , it is easy to see how criminal groups are able to thrive .
The institutionalisation of crime in Iraq remains a reality of daily life in the country and a key challenge for a weak government struggling to enforce the rule of law .
" Do n't go outside with a wet head or you 'll catch your death of cold ! "
It 's a warning that 's been passed from one generation of parents to the next , along with the better - founded , " Do n't go swimming right after you eat or you 'll get a cramp ! "
If you 're one of those moms ( or dads ) who still follows the wet head equals head cold line of reasoning , you 're not alone .
In one survey , 40 percent of mothers said they believed sending their kids out in the cold weather with a wet head would get them sick [ source : Pediatrics ] .

Who started this familiar maternal refrain ?
Part of the blame may rest with French chemist Louis Pasteur , who in 1878 exposed chickens to anthrax and then dipped their feet in icy water to see how it might affect their odds of catching the disease .
The chickens developed anthrax and died .
When he repeated the experiment but wrapped the exposed chickens in a warm blanket , they survived .
Human studies in the early 20th century seemed to confirm Pasteur 's research .
A German scientist discovered during World War I that soldiers who slept in cold , wet trenches were four times more likely to get colds than those who rested in dry barracks [ source : Zuger ] .
Somewhere along the line , a few mothers must have caught wind of these studies and began forbidding their children to step foot outside until their heads were bone - dry .
It 's also possible that people who believe that a wet head will lead to a cold have heard that a good percentage of the body 's heat escapes through the head .
That is a myth .
In actuality , you lose just as much , if not more heat through a bare arm or leg as you do through your noggin .
The idea that going out with a wet head will lead to a cold is , like so many of those other old warnings , just an old wives ' tale .
So , if going outside with a wet head wo n't give you a cold , what will ?
Read on to find out .
NEW YORK - Wells Fargo & Co. plans to raise interest rates on a majority of credit card customers by 3 percentage points before new rules limiting such increases take effect , a company executive said .
“ This is something we ’ve been contemplating for quite a period of time , ’’ Kevin Rhein , group head of card services , said yesterday .
Wells Fargo began advising customers this week that the change takes effect Nov. 30 .
That ’s one day before the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , wants curbs on rates and fees under a new US credit card law to take effect .
He plans a hearing today on moving up the date to Dec. 1 , from February , to head off increases by card issuers .

FOLLOWERS of competition policy had expected the next big antitrust news to come out of Washington .
After all , the administration of Barack Obama has let it be known that it would be more vigilant , particularly with regard to information technology .
But on September 3rd it was the European Commission that grabbed the limelight .
Its trustbusters announced that they will take a closer look at the proposed $ 7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems , a troubled hardware - maker , by Oracle , the world 's second - biggest software firm .
Is the world heading for another transatlantic row about antitrust akin to that of 2001 , when a planned union between General Electric ( GE ) and Honeywell caused a stink ?
There are certainly parallels .
The two firms are both based in America .
And just as in 2001 , the Department of Justice had already cleared the deal — on August 20th .
But Brussels has a mind of its own .
It worries in particular that the merger will reduce competition in the market for corporate databases .
Oracle is the world 's biggest vendor of “ proprietary ” ( essentially meaning “ paid for ” ) software to run such databases , with a market share of nearly 50 % .
Sun is the owner of MySQL , the most widely used “ open - source ” database software , which already competes with Oracle 's products and could become more of a threat in the future .
Neelie Kroes , the competition commissioner , said that she had “ serious concerns ” that the deal would reduce choice and lead to higher prices .
Yet this is where the similarities end .
In the case of GE and Honeywell the European Court of First Instance criticised the commission 's legal reasoning , but upheld its decision .
Brussels has since adopted new guidelines making it harder to block mergers .
And although the commission has extended its review of the deal for several months , it will not necessarily block it .
It also thought twice before allowing Google , the web giant , to take over DoubleClick , an online - advertising agency in 2008 .
Brussels may simply want to gather more information .
The case is not clear - cut .
Oracle argues that MySQL 's revenues are negligible , particularly in Europe where they amount to a mere $ 17 m annually .
And since MySQL is open - source , anyone can use the program 's underlying recipe .
So if Oracle were to rein in MySQL , the software 's community of developers and users could always create and promote an alternative .
While Brussels ponders all this , Sun remains in limbo — and will probably lose business to such rivals as Dell and HP .
Its revenues dropped more than 30 % in the second quarter compared with a year earlier .
Meanwhile , the expected meeting of minds between America 's newly invigorated trustbusters and Europe 's also seems to have been put on hold .
OTTAWA ( Reuters ) -
The multiyear ice covering the Arctic Ocean has effectively vanished , a startling development that will make it easier to open up polar shipping routes , an Arctic expert said on Thursday .

Vast sheets of impenetrable multiyear ice , which can reach up to 80 meters ( 260 feet ) thick , have for centuries blocked the path of ships seeking a quick short cut through the fabled Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
They also ruled out the idea of sailing across the top of the world .
But David Barber , Canada ’s Research Chair in Arctic System Science at the University of Manitoba , said the ice was melting at an extraordinarily fast rate .
“ We are almost out of multiyear sea ice in the northern hemisphere , ” he said in a presentation in Parliament .
The little that remains is jammed up against Canada ’s Arctic archipelago , far from potential shipping routes .
Scientists link higher Arctic temperatures and melting sea ice to the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming .
Barber spoke shortly after returning from an expedition that sought -- and largely failed to find -- a huge multiyear ice pack that should have been in the Beaufort Sea off the Canadian coastal town of Tuktoyaktuk .
Instead , his ice breaker found hundreds of miles of what he called “ rotten ice ” -- 50 - cm ( 20 - inch ) thin layers of fresh ice covering small chunks of older ice .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like this in my 30 years of working in the high Arctic ... it was very dramatic , ” he said .
“ From a practical perspective , if you want to ship across the pole , you ’re concerned about multiyear sea ice .
You ’re not concerned about this rotten stuff we were doing 13 knots through .
It ’s easy to navigate through . ”
Scientists have fretted for decades about the pace at which the Arctic ice sheets are shrinking .
U.S. data shows the 2009 ice cover was the third - lowest on record , after 2007 and 2008 .
An increasing number of experts feel the North Pole will be ice free in summer by 2030 at the latest , for the first time in a million years .
“ I would argue that , from a practical perspective , we almost have a seasonally ice - free Arctic now , because multiyear sea ice is the barrier to the use and development of the Arctic , ” said Barber .
Fresh first - year ice always forms in the Arctic in the winter , when temperatures plunge far below freezing and the North Pole is not exposed to the sun .
Shipping companies are already looking to benefit from warming waters .
This year two German cargo ships successfully navigated from South Korea along Russia ’s northern Siberia coast without the help of icebreakers .
The Arctic is warming up three times more quickly than the rest of the Earth , in part because of the reflectivity , or the albedo feedback effect , of ice .
As more and more ice melts , larger expanses of darker sea water are exposed .
These absorb more sunlight than the ice and cause the water to heat up more quickly , thereby melting more ice .
Barber said the ice was now being melted both by rays from the sun as well as from below by the warmer water .
Scientists are also seeing more cyclones , which pick up force as they absorb heat from the warmer water .
The cyclones help generate waves that break up ice sheets and also dump large amounts of snow , which has an insulating effect and prevents the ice sheets from thickening .
After a long search , Barber ’s ice breaker finally found a 16 - km ( 10 - mile ) wide floe of multiyear ice that was around 6 to 8 meters ( 20 - 26 feet ) thick .
But as the crew watched , the floe was hit by a series of waves , and disintegrated in five minutes .
“ The Arctic is an early indicator of what we can expect at the global scale as we move through the next few decades ...
So we should be paying attention to this very carefully , ” Barber said .
Just follow these instructions , and answer the questions one at a time and as quickly as you can !
Again , as quickly as you can but do n't advance until you 've done each of them .... really .
Now , scroll down ( but not too fast , you might miss something ) .

Brazil will become the first South American country to host the Olympics after the city of Rio de Janeiro was chosen to stage the 2016 Games .
Rio won a majority of the 95 votes at the meeting in Copenhagen , eliminating Madrid in the final round .
Tokyo and Chicago had already been knocked out .
" The world has recognised that the time has come for Brazil , " said President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .
Chicago 's early exit was a surprise , after bookmakers made them favourites .
US President Barack Obama had flown to Denmark on Friday morning to join his wife , Michelle , and make an emotional address to the International Olympic Committee delegates .
But the gesture - the first time a current US president had addressed the IOC in an attempt to win the Games - failed to persuade the voters as Chicago became the first city to see its dream of hosting the biggest sporting event in the world fall by the wayside .

Speaking to reporters at the White House on his return , Mr Obama said he wished he had come back with better news , but congratulated Brazil for a " truly historic " win .
" As friends to the Brazilian people , we welcome this extraordinary sign of progress , " he said .
The president said he had no doubt that Chicago 's bid had been the strongest possible , could not be prouder of the city , and insisted that he had no regrets about travelling to Denmark .
" I believe it is always a worthwhile endeavour to promote and boost the United States of America , " he added .
' Heart and soul ' Chicago received only 18 of the 94 votes available in the first round poll of IOC delegates at the Bella Convention Centre on Friday afternoon .
Madrid came out top with 28 , followed by Rio on 26 .

In the second round , however , Rio almost secured the absolute majority needed to win outright , with 46 of the 95 votes cast .
Madrid came a distant second with 29 , while Tokyo was eliminated after receiving 20 .
The final ballot saw Rio win by a comprehensive margin of 66 votes to 32 .
More than an hour later , IOC president Jacques Rogge finally revealed the result to the world : " Like in every competition there can only be one winner .
" Tonight , I have the honour to announce that the Games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro . "
The Brazilian bid team leapt to their feet in celebration , began singing their " Marvellous City " song , waving flags and hugging each other .
A tearful President Lula told reporters afterwards : " The other countries made proposals .
We presented a heart and a soul .

The BBC's Gary Duffy in Rio said there was " absolute , unrestrained joy " on the city 's famous Copacabana beach after the result was announced , with silver glitter flying through the air and tens of thousands of people singing .
The golden sand disappeared under a sea of green and yellow , the colours of Brazil , our correspondent said .
There have been questions about Rio's bid not the least the high level of violence which so often scars the city 's image , but in one glorious moment that was all set to one side for a truly Brazilian party , he added .

In his speech to the IOC earlier , President Lula had promised : " Rio will deliver an unforgettable Games .
You will see for yourselves the passion , the energy and the creativity of the Brazilian people .
" It will not be just Brazil 's Games but South America's .
It will serve to inspire the 180 million young people on the continent .
It is time to redress the balance .
It is time to light the Olympic flame in a tropical country . "
Rogge said Rio had presented the IOC " with a very strong technical bid , built upon a vision of the Games being a celebration of the athletes and sport , as well as providing the opportunity for the city , region and country to deliver their broader long - term aspirations for the future " .

Candidates for 2016 Olympics
" This call to ' live your passion ' clearly struck a chord with my fellow members , and we now look forward to seeing Rio de Janeiro staging the first Olympic Games on the continent of South America , " he said .
Rio plans to stage all the competitions inside the city , bringing " dynamics to the Games and facilitating the athletes ' interaction " , according to the bid website .
There will be seven competition centres in four Olympic regions - Barra , Copacabana , Deodoro , and Maracana - with football matches held in the cities of Belo Horizonte , Brasilia , Salvador and Sao Paulo .
Its bid is divided into a $ 2.8 bn ( £ 1.92 bn ) budget for operating costs , and $ 14.4bn ( £ 9.90 bn ) for construction and security .
' Nearly there '
Madrid 's surprising success in reaching the final round came after former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch made an emotional appeal .

" I know that I am very near the end of my time .
I am , as you know 89 years old .
May I ask you to consider granting my country the honour and also the duty to organise the games in 2016 , " he said .
However , a win for Madrid would have made it three European - based Olympics in a row , with London 2012 and Sochi 2014 preceding it .
After the result , Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said Madrid could leave Copenhagen with " dignity " and did not rule out another bid .
" We were nearly there , but Rio won , " he told Spanish reporters .
" Now is not the moment to talk about 2020 .
Madrid is always a strong candidate , but it depends on the city , not me . "
Adam Brookes , BBC News , Chicago
The shock of Chicago 's elimination was greater for the fact that it came in the first round .
And greater for the fact that President Obama had taken valuable hours from his packed and tense political schedule to travel to Copenhagen .
His legendary powers of persuasion will be said to have failed him , though in reality it will be Chicago 's bid that failed him .
Nonetheless , this is a moment which allows the president 's detractors to allege waning prestige on the part of his presidency .
And it will raise questions about the political advice that he is receiving .
Mark Mardell 's America :
The boundaries of Brand Obama The BBC's Steve Kingstone in the Spanish capital said Madrilenos were leaving the square in front of the royal palace , where they watched events in Copenhagen , with a sense of pride .
In the lead - up to the decision , King Juan Carlos had called the Olympics " Madrid 's unfulfilled dream of hope " , and for now at least that is what the games remain .
Tokyo's bid team were said to have been shocked and stunned after their elimination in the second round , as they had felt their focus on the environment and youth would impress IOC delegates .
" It was really disappointing for us and for the children but this is not the end .
We want to carry this on to the next chance , " said marathon runner Yuko Arimori .
In Chicago , which had also believed it would be a finalist , thousands stood in silence in the city centre after it became the first to be eliminated .
" We fought a good fight and I am very proud of the team and the campaign .
I have no idea why we went out so early .
The IOC members will have to ask themselves that question , " said Chicago bid chief Pat Ryan .

This web site , clearly identified as a parody , asks : " Why wo n't Glenn Beck deny these allegations ?
We 're not accusing Glenn Beck of raping and murdering a young girl in 1990 - in fact , we think he did n't !
But we can't help but wonder , since he has failed to deny these horrible allegations .
Why wo n't he deny that he raped and killed a young girl in 1990 ? "
But is this domain name really cybersquatting the Glenn Beck name or simply fair commentary / parody protected under our United States Constitution and the right to free speech ?
Our cybersquatting lawyers provide the answer below ....
Protecting Famous Names
In Cyberspace ?
Few famous people draw as much controversy as Fox News ’ Entertainer Glenn Beck , who has become famous , in part , by accusing people of absurd - crazy - false - seemingly defamatory things by asking rhetorical questions which imply the unsettling answer .
Glenn Beck 's fame also makes Glenn Beck ’s website www.glennbeck.com a favorite target for cybersquatting ( see below for examples of cybersquatting web sites such as Glennbcek.com ) .
( More information on celebrity cybersquatting ) .
... Or Is Glenn Beck Using Lawyers To Quell Free Speech ?
Currently , Mr. Beck ’s trademark attorneys are pursuing a UDRP case against the registrant of the above parody web site despite the fact that it has no visible commercial purpose , and is clearly protected under the First Amendment right to free speech .
( For more information on the UDRP and what is elements are required to prove a case , check out this UDRP Resource Page ) .
Suffice it to say that the UDRP protects famous people , celebrities and trademark holders from the bad faith registration of domain names which are designed into confusing web site visitors that they are the mark holder , celebrity or famous person .
These domain names are designed to confuse and seek to divert web visitors for commercial gain .
The UDRP , however , does typically not protect companies or people from parody , gripe sites or the sometimes painful commentary protected by free speech .
.. Is Glenn Beck a Rapists Who Murdered a Young Girl in 1990 ?
Of course , this is a question and not a statement so I am really ' not saying . '
And of course , the implication is not remotely true .
But then again Glenn Beck has n't denied it .....
Ah , the Internet Meme .
The term " Internet meme " refers to a catchphrase or concept that spreads rapidly from person to person via the internet , largely through email , blogs , forums , social networking sites and instant messaging .
The term derives from the original concept of memes , although it has come to refer to a much more narrowly defined category of cultural information .
Examples include Rickrolling , lolcats , " Leave Britney Alone " , Keyboard Cat and " All your base are belong to us " .
It involves statements or questions which are so absurd , that no one would believe them .
Each Meme makes a point distinct from the statement / question posed .
Below is a good example of an Meme Gilbert Gottfried Meme about Bob Saget , the point of which is laughter not truth .
You need to check out the web site under attack by Mr. Beck in order to understand what is going on here and why the First Amendment protections are in play www.GlennBeckRapedandMurderedAyoungGirlIn1990.com.
The web site plays off Beck ’s tendency to start with an outrageous claim ( Muslims are terrorists ) , indicate that Beck is not saying it is true ( Beck is not saying ' so and so ' who happens to be a Muslim is a terrorist ) and then place the burden of disproof on the ambushed party ( But ' so and so ' should prove to us all that he is not a terrorist if we are to clear his / her name ) .
As noted at TechDirt commenting on cable shows like Glenn Beck's : " One of the popular tactics of such shows , is to use the ever popular " report on a rumor " setup , which lets them insinuate something , without ever officially stepping up and saying it themselves .
The simplest form is the " some are saying ... " lead in that lets these folks spend plenty of time discussing things without ever actually investigating if they 're true . "
Here is another example of Glenn Beck 's use of the rhetorical question to make an accusation , check out this video below :
This particular meme about Glenn Beck has been around a while with Google returning over 300,000 results for " glenn beck rape kill girl " , and has made its way around the internet several times .
But this is the first known attempt by Glenn Beck to take down one of the web sites that spreads the meme .
In so doing , Beck raises a lot of eyebrows given his own ' entertainment ' style and supposed support for the First Amendment right to free speech .
The First Amendment protects , by necessity , both popular and unpopular and controversial speech .
Whether the site could be considered defamation is considered here .
A decision under the UDRP should be forthcoming in the next several weeks , although Mr. Beck certainly has a major uphill battle given the First Amendment implications involved in that particular domain dispute .
One of our good friends and accomplished domain dispute lawyers Marc Randazza is representing the Respondent .
His Response Brief and proposed stipulation ( which we doubt Mr. beck will agree to since it would expose his hypocrisy ) is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the First Amendment right to Free Speech and how it applies to parody web sites .
Some money quotes from famed lawyer Randazza :
" We are not here because the domain name could cause confusion .
We do not have a declaration from the president of the international association of imbeciles that his members are blankly staring at the Respondent ’s website wondering “ where did all the race baiting content go ? ”
We are here because Mr. Beck wants Respondent ’s website shut down .
He wants it shut down because Respondent ’s website makes a poignant and accurate satirical critique of Mr. Beck by parodying Beck ’s very rhetorical style .
Beck ’s skin is too thin to take the criticism , so he wants the site down . "
" It is specious at best for Mr. Beck to assert that his fans , or the public as a whole , would confuse Respondent ’s website with Mr. Beck himself — unless of course it is Mr. Beck ’s view that his fans and the average internet user are in fact hurried morons .
Respondent presumes that this is not how Mr. Beck regards his audience .
And , even if he does so regard his audience , this is not a basis for upholding his complaint .
Given that Mr. Beck cannot genuinely believe or reasonably assert that Respondent ’s website will cause such confusion , there can be only one purpose to filing this complaint : as an attempt to silence a critic because he does n’t like being criticized . "
Glenn
Beck 's attempts to quell the very free speech rights he hides behind every day to spew his rants against other people makes us wonder .
Does Glenn
Beck really care about people cybersquatting his famous name ?
It turns out he is not .
If you review the typo variations of GlennBeck.com at DomainTools , you will see that Mr. Beck has many obvious typosquatters attempting to infringe his trademark rights in his famous name .
It kind of makes you wonder why Mr. Beck is n’t pursuing those domain names which are clearly designed to divert traffic from his primary website and make money off of his famous name …
Maybe Glenn
Beck is to busy asking other people to prove they are not terrorists , racists or communists to make the time ....
Or maybe he is just afraid of being subjected to the very tactics he so frequently uses against people .
More commentary here ...
I am definitely NOT asking you to spread the word of this post or the question of whether Glenn Beck attacks the Untied States Constitution and the right to free speech .
Because that obviously would not be true at all .

Ahead of OPEC members meeting on Wednesday September 9 in Vienna , it is worth elaborating on why OPEC will likely refrain from making any production changes and why they may in fact need a temporary tightening of compliance with existing quotas by up to 500,000 barrels per day .
OPEC members announced cuts in late 2008 totaling 4.2 million barrels per day ( Mb/d ) .
Compliance with these cuts is currently running at around 3Mb/d .
This post is a guest post by Morgan Downey .
Morgan is author of the book ‘ Oil 101 ’ .
During the 2008 - 2009 recession global oil demand fell by 2 Mb/d from 86 to 84Mb/d ( chart 1 ) .
Global demand appears to have stabilized and is beginning to grow again .
The charts in this post ( click to enlarge ) use monthly data and 12 month rolling averages to adjust for seasonality .
Almost all the global decline was concentrated in developed OECD nations ( chart 2 ) .
Less developed non-OECD nations such as China and India only saw a temporary stagnation and are now exhibiting growing demand again ( chart 3 ) .
Of the OECD decline , one third came from the US , one third from OECD Europe , and one third came from the remaining developed OECD countries .
The US accounts for just under 23 % and Europe 18 % of 2009 global oil demand .
Oil demand in the US and Europe has yet to stop falling ( see charts 4 and 5 ) .
Oil demand in the US was destroyed more in absolute barrels over the past few years than in any other region .
The severe demand destruction in the US had a lot to do with current US oil consumption patterns ( 76 % of Americans get to and from work by driving alone ) and infrastructure ( average US vehicle fleet efficiency is less than half that of available technology ) .
Relatively inefficient consumption allows for swift efficiency gains compared with other parts of the world which are already at or close to maximum technically available oil consumption efficiency .
Looking at total US oil demand ( chart 4 ) one may perceive that it is in a steady decline which can perhaps be extrapolated into the future .
However , delving deeper into the data provides clues as to exactly why US demand is declining and why we may be at or quickly approaching the end of the decline in total US demand .
The total number of miles driven on US highways has stabilized and is increasing ( chart 6 ) .
This stabilization and increase in highway miles driven is showing up in US gasoline demand which is no longer falling and has begun to grow again ( chart 7 ) .
Gasoline demand accounts for almost half US oil consumption .
The recovery in gasoline demand is because people are cutting back on vacation spending by driving rather than flying to holiday spots .
This certainly syncs with the fall in jet fuel consumption ( chart 8 ) and anecdotal evidence .
Businesses have also been cutting back on flights .
The decline in jet fuel consumption is more than offset by the increase in gasoline consumption .
Combined , jet fuel and gasoline demand ( together 57 % of total US oil demand ) are beginning to recover ( chart 9 ) .
Where is the remaining weakness in US oil demand ?
It is in industrial oil demand .
Demand for distillate ( diesel and heating oil ) , residual fuel oil ( mostly used for shipping and a little for electrical power generation ) and other oils ( lubes , waxes , asphalt , plastics and a bunch of other oils ) .
Aggregating these three categories of US oil demand into “ Industrial ” demand , these industrial oils account for 43 % of total US oil demand ( chart 11 ) .
To see a recovery in US industrial oil demand there will have to be a recovery in consumer spending ( linked to unemployment , housing and the savings rate ) , manufacturing activity ( especially autos ) , and private services sector activity .
Most indicators in these macroeconomic areas have begun to stabilize and even improve over the past couple of months .
Summary of Demand Situation
US industrial oil demand is currently the weakest part of global oil demand and the largest component of global oil demand yet to cease declining .
Non-oil macroeconomic indicators suggest that an end to the decline in US industrial oil demand is imminent .
Despite the weakness in OECD oil demand and US industrial oil demand in particular , global oil demand has stabilized and is beginning to grow due to non-OECD demand .
Inventory Situation
At the end of 2008 OPEC members removed close to 3Mb/d from supply .
This was the amount required to stabilize and reduce OECD land based storage .
While OECD land based storage is no longer increasing , global floating storage and non-OECD storage continue to creep higher .
There needs to be an elimination of inventory growth in these areas in order to bring the global oil market into balance ( a balanced market has inventories neither increasing nor decreasing ) .
This elimination of inventory growth can come from the recovery of global demand which appears to be just beginning or a further reduction in supply from OPEC .
The required number is generally estimated to be around 0.5 Mb/d .
What will OPEC Do ?
At the OPEC meeting this coming Wednesday , September 9 , members have little choice but to maintain existing production cuts .
Until nascent global demand growth strengthens , OPEC members may need a temporary 0.5 Mb / day improvement in cut compliance ( compliance with 4.2Mb / d cuts announced in late 2008 is currently only around 3 Mb / day ) in order to stall increases in floating and non-OECD storage , and bring the global oil market into balance .
The Nightmare of a MIPS R5000 Processor A microprocessor can’t wake in a cold sweat to escape the horror of its subconscious .
Its fate is dreadful .
Rigidly soldered into a motherboard , it can only replay the sinister creation of its programmers over and over again ....
Beginning in the 1970s , and continuing in the ‘ 80s , a fierce battle was waged for the supremacy of microprocessor design .
In order to maintain usability of legacy program code , processors would simply expand the vocabulary of their binary instruction sets .
The direction of this design required many compromises and soon became cumbersome in terms of programming efficiency and performance .
However , IBM designers saw a market opportunity for applications that did n’t involve legacy software but only required the maximum speed and processing power available .
Ultimately the solution was RISC ( reduced instruction set computing ) .
Its rival CISC ( complex instruction set computing ) would carry over all of the past instruction sets plus any new instruction set advancements ( such as MMX and subsequent multimedia features ) .
Essentially the RISC advantage was that it was ‘ lean and mean ’ - perfect to power machines such as servers , workstations , and ... CarnEvil !
In 1984 experts from IBM and Stanford University founded MIPS Technologies , a RISC processor design enterprise that would create , but then outsource the manufacture of its products .
They became successful with the 32 - bit R2000 and R3000 processors and then advanced with the 64 - bit designs of the R4000 and R5000 .
The R5000 , used in Silicon Graphics workstations , was a 64 - bit ‘ superscalar ’ streamlined number cruncher .
At 150 MHz it is slow by today ’s standards , but in 1998 its ruthless efficiency was ideally suited to bring to life the story of Professor Ludwig von Tökkentäkker , the legendary master of " The Greatest Show Unearthed . "
Derived from the haunting memories of " Carnival of Souls , " a 1962 horror film , CarnEvil is the electronic reanimation of a young boy ’s dark adventure .
Going on a hayride through an old graveyard seems like harmless Halloween fun .
Spooky Sam , a friendly old man with a Southern accent , enjoys giving these rides as much as his guests enjoy taking them .
But the graveyard they visit has sinister secrets and it ’s best to stay together .
As they approach Professor Ludwig von Tökkentäkker 's gravestone the old man points it out and offers a brief mention of its history , but he keeps the wagon moving .
A stone in the old dirt road jars the wagon and knocks the boy off the back .
He moves to get back on but something draws him to the gravestone - perhaps youthful curiosity , perhaps something else .
As he walks over to it with his flashlight a shiny gold token becomes visible .
He reaches for it and it comes loose in his hand .
There ’s a slot in the weathered stone where the token goes ; he now does what he ’s told .

I tell you why , women !
Because he can .
Just pack a lot of black powder between two anvils , put a notepad with the fuse in between , light up , and watch the anvil on top shooting up 100 to 200 feet into the air , stop for a second , and then fall down pretty much at the same spot .
Yes !

The other week I went to see a science - fiction thriller called Pandorum which opens – rather memorably – with a scene in which a befuddled Dennis Quaid falls out of a space - pod dressed only in his underpants .
The film that follows amounts to a prolonged bout of paranoid hysterics .
People scream and run about and get eaten .
There is a dark and rusting spaceship , a gaggle of barely glimpsed monsters and a sexy , effortlessly confident warrior woman who puts her bungling male counterparts to shame .
It is , if you appreciate this sort of thing , a perfectly serviceable motion picture .
But Pandorum gives us something else as well .
Every scene – every frame – comes tainted with the nagging , lingering whiff of deja vu ; a sense that there is an altogether better movie nestled deep inside , waiting to burst forth .
Afterwards it strikes me what that movie is , and I reel out of the cinema like a suitor at the end of a misbegotten date .
The only reason I like Pandorum , I realise , is because I am still in love with Alien .
It is now 30 years since Ridley Scott 's breakthrough picture was unleashed upon an unsuspecting public , although the exact birthday remains a mystery .
It made its debut at London 's Odeon Leicester Square in September 1979 , but was not rolled out to the other UK cinemas until January of the following year .
Since then , its influence has bloomed and mutated .
Alien was the film that set the visual template ( grungy and industrial ) for any director keen to shoot a picture about monsters in outer space .
It was the film that contained a grisly , chest - bursting centrepiece that tapped into the fears of the age .
And yet ultimately it all comes back to Ripley .
In the figure of the coltish , resolute Sigourney Weaver , Alien may just be the film that overhauled the old , unreconstructed horror genre and dared to put a woman centre - stage .
Because make no mistake : a horror movie is what Alien is .
" It 's basically a haunted house film , " explains the critic David Thomson .
" The only difference is that the old dark house just happens to be a spaceship . "
Thomson has examined the film and its three sequels in his book The Alien Quartet , and feels that this quality is what separates Scott 's outing from the ones that followed .
" It is a very slow - building film that gives the sense of some great unnamed terror to come .
That 's a quality that has much more to do with horror than it does with science fiction . "
This gave rise to Ridley Scott 's joke that nothing actually happens for the first 45 minutes .
In its opening sections , Alien rattles , seemingly aimlessly , around a utilitarian space freighter ( the Nostromo ) and introduces us to its bickering seven - member crew , John Hurt and Ian Holm among them .
If 20th Century Fox was hoping for another Star Wars ( and the evidence suggests it was ) , the studio had another think coming .
These characters are not Jedi warriors or gung - ho buccaneers ; just average working Joes , bored from too long in each other 's company and chain - smoking in front of antique computer screens .
Then , boom !
The film bursts into hideous life with one of cinema 's most notorious setpieces .
Hurt 's character , impregnated by an extra- terrestrial , abruptly goes into labour at the breakfast table .
His chest explodes and the beast is loosed .
Watching the scene now , at a 30 - year lag , you find yourself drawn as much to the reactions of the other actors as to the creature itself .
Scott famously shot the film in one take with four cameras , and purposely kept the actors in the dark as to what , exactly , they were about to witness .
It is safe to assume that none of them were as startled as Veronica Cartwright ( playing the Nostromo 's navigator ) , who is shown recoiling in genuine horror from a spray of blood .
" What you saw on camera was the real response , " recalls co-star Tom Skerritt .
" She had no idea what the hell happened .
All of a sudden this thing just came up . "
Cartwright 's shock would be mirrored in cinemas around the world .
" Everybody remembers the moment when the creature comes out , because it was such a staggering event ; totally beyond prediction , " says Thomson .
" I remember seeing the film at the time with my wife and she was so horrified that she stood up and walked right out of the theatre .
Afterwards she admitted that it was a very well - made film and all of that .
But she could not take it ; could not live with that possibility .
It was as though she thought : if that can happen , anything can . "
One could argue that it already had .
After speaking to Thomson , I sound out Mark Jancovich , professor of film studies at the University of East Anglia and an expert on the horror genre .
Jancovich explains that changes in the 1970s censorship opened the door to more gory , body - centred special effects .
" But there is an argument that these films actually reflected wider concerns .
There was a growing sense in the 70s that a range of environmental factors – be it pollution , pesticides , food additives , man -made cancers – meant that we were no longer in control of our bodies .
That our sense of self can change , mutate and become monstrous .
You see that in the early films of someone like David Cronenberg , and obviously in Alien : this sense that all that was familiar and secure starts breaking down .
And in the year after Alien you saw this burst of other big - budget ' body horrors ' , from The Howling , An American Werewolf In London , Altered States through to John Carpenter 's remake of The Thing . "
In Scott 's film , however , the horror came garnished with sexual politics .
Take another look at the creature that hatches from John Hurt 's chest .
It was designed by the Swiss artist HR Giger , who borrowed freely from the images in Francis Bacon 's 1944 painting Three Studies For Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion , which in turn took its lead from the Greek myth of the Furies .
Scott 's film was initially pitched as " Jaws in space " and Giger 's alien features the requisite razor - blade teeth and unreadable , implacable air .
Sometimes it is limpid and wet , fashioned on the set out of oysters and clams brought in from a local fishmongers .
Sometimes it is hard and blunt .
Not to put too fine a point on it , the alien in Alien comes in two guises : vaginal and phallic .
" Alien is a rape movie with male victims , " explains David McIntee , author of the Alien study Beautiful Monsters .
" And it also shows the consequences of that rape : the pregnancy and birth .
It is a film that plays , very deliberately , with male fears of female reproduction . "
Does this make Alien a conservative film or a radical one ?
Over the years the debate has been teased out in either direction .
In the opinion of the cultural critic Barbara Creed , for instance , Scott 's film epitomised what she refers to as " the monstrous feminine " .
It trades in classic Freudian imagery ( penis - shaped monsters ; dark , womb - like interiors ) and shudders at the bloody spectacle of childbirth .
Here is a horror film made by men that exploits a particularly male fear of all that is female .
Others beg to differ .
Ripley , they argue , is the game - changer ; the character that sends Alien ( and its sequels ) off in a bold new direction .
" Ripley is pretty revolutionary , " insists McIntee .
" All of a sudden you have a horror film that has a younger female character who is a survivor and a heroine as opposed to a victim . "
Originally conceived as a male character , Ripley would go on to form the heart and soul of the Alien pictures .
As played by Weaver ( then 29 and a relative unknown ) , she initially seems set up to play the conventional role of the sexy scream queen .
But after a while , we realise that not only is she not screaming , she also appears to have no romantic interest whatsoever .
Instead , she furrows her brow and tackles tasks with a steely determination .
It is Ripley who makes the right decision in refusing to allow the alien aboard the ship , only to be overruled by her male colleagues .
For good measure , it is Ripley whose misplaced maternal instincts ( hurrying off in search of the ship 's cat ) enable her to avoid the monster 's attack .
Only at the end does the film let her down , slapping us with that oddly gratuitous sequence in which Ripley escapes in a space - pod and proceeds to strip down to her undies .
It is as though the makers were so alarmed by what they had unleashed that they tried to rein her back at the last minute .
" No one would deny that Sigourney Weaver looks fetching in her underwear , " chuckles David Thomson .
" But that 's really a case of Ridley Scott playing to a very old - fashioned gallery . "
Ripley , the evil stepmother
James Cameron has often been accused of playing to that same gallery .
And yet his sequel , Aliens , which came out seven years later , proved even more radical ; taking what had been a subtext and pushing it to the foreground .
" The series became feminist , " says Thomson .
" Maybe that was because Weaver was given a bigger voice and a producer 's credit .
Maybe the guys would n't have gone in that direction out of choice .
But they could n't make the films without her . "
Not that Weaver has ever claimed to have much in common with the character she plays .
" I 'm no Ripley , " she says .
" I had doubts that I could play her as strongly as she needed to be played .
But I must say that it was fun exploring that side of myself .
Women do n't get to do that very often . "
Released in 1986 , Aliens was as much about Ripley as it was about the aliens .
Cameron 's film gave her a surrogate daughter to protect , and a new band of swaggering men to lock antlers with .
Most intriguing of all , it explored the growing affinity between its heroine and the alien " queen " that she battles .
" The thing about Ripley is that she is not especially sympathetic to the human beings in her world , " says Thomson .
" In the second film you do get the feeling that she and the beast have a kind of understanding .
There is a scene at the end where Ripley threatens to kill off its offspring and the beast backs off .
That shows a certain level of kinship .
They are both mothers , after all . "
McIntee takes it further still .
" There 's a strange twist at the end of Aliens , in that Weaver almost becomes the villain .
The queen just wants to do what 's best for her offspring .
Ripley is like the evil stepmother who wants to kill the children . "
It is the first rule of Hollywood that every good idea must eventually be milked until it dries out .
So it was with Alien , which begat ( the arguably superior ) Aliens and then led on to the diminishing returns of Alien 3 and Alien : Resurrection .
" Actually the third film is underrated , " McIntee points out .
" With those first three movies you have the sense that they are playing , probably unintentionally , with the three classic female archetypes from folklore .
Ripley goes from being maiden [ in Alien ] , to mother [ Aliens ] , to crone [ Alien 3 ] .
That 's where they went wrong with Alien : Resurrection .
If there is no fourth archetype , there 's nowhere to go . "
So where , exactly , does that leave Ripley ?
One could argue that Alien 's heroine remains an anomaly ; a rare bird in a genre that traditionally serves women up as poultry .
Conversely , you might even claim that she was n't so revolutionary to begin with .
" I 'd agree that she 's a great character ; a great archetype , " says Mark Jancovich .
" But this is actually an archetype that goes right back to [ gothic novelist ]
Ann Radcliffe in the late 18th century .
Ripley is cut from the same cloth as all those other gothic heroines .
She 's like your classic three - chord pop song .
It 's just that some versions are catchier than others . "
Others see it differently , they see Ripley breaking the mould .
" She advanced the movie heroine pretty far and pretty fast , " McIntee says .
" I think the entertainment industry would be very different without her .
Without Ripley there would be no Leela in Futurama and no Buffy either .
She 's probably also responsible for toughening up the Bond girls .
If you look at the first Bond movie to be released after Alien , you suddenly have the sight of Carole Bouquet running around with a crossbow . "
Before Ripley , the horror movie was a more ordered place .
Here was a happy hunting ground in which young , sexually active women were there to be punished and the abiding image of motherhood was provided by mummified Mrs Bates in Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho .
Alien took a tired landscape and shook it up .
Maybe it truly did open the doors to a brave new era , reconciling the genre 's in - built fear of femaleness by casting the alien in our midst , the unknowable sex in the role of hero .
Almost certainly , it paved the way for movies such as Pandorum : a dunder - headed romp that is nonetheless smart enough to put a powerful woman at centre - stage while leaving the men to stagger about in their underwear , unsure what 's going on .
Over in Europe , Ridley Scott 's 1979 picture was originally released under the extended title " Alien : The Eighth Passenger " .
Now this , I 'm guessing , refers to HR Giger 's unpleasant extra-terrestrial .
Yet it might just as easily refer to Ripley : the horror movie heroine who came in from the cold .
Three decades on , she looks far wilder and more dangerous than some mocked - up " Jaws in space " .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 23 October 2009
This column referred to a recent decision by the court of appeal .
The science writer Simon Singh had applied to the court to allow him to challenge an earlier high court finding by Mr Justice Eady , who ruled that the writer – who is being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association – could not defend an assertion he made in a Guardian article as fair comment because it was stated as fact .
But the appeal court , our column said , " struck Eady 's ruling down , deciding that his interpretation was ' legally erroneous ' " .
This was incorrect , as was an earlier news story that used " legally erroneous " without qualification .
The appeal court did not overturn the earlier ruling , but rather gave Simon Singh leave to appeal .
In explaining his decision , Lord Justice Laws said : " I give no finding as to the end result .
I only give reasons why the appeal ought to be allowed to go forward . "
One of these reasons , he said , was that " It is arguable that [ Mr Justice Eady 's ] approach to the issue of whether something that was objectively verifiable could be a comment was legally erroneous "
Trafigura 's super - injunction is weird for lots of reasons .
But the strangest fact is this : it has nothing to do with the Honourable Mr Justice Eady .
The company 's lawyers injuncted the Guardian , injuncted their injunction , and tried to injunct reports of parliament 's proceedings .
And they did all this without enlisting the help of the hanging judge of the Queen 's Bench Division , the legal censor who appears to be fighting a one - man battle against freedom of speech .
That 's quite an achievement .
But even as the Trafigura case was being discussed in parliament , the court of appeal was handing down yet another damning ruling on Sir David Eady 's judgments .
Last May Eady presided over the case brought by the British Chiropractic Association against the science writer Simon Singh .
Writing in the Guardian , Singh maintained that the BCA , which claimed that its members " can help treat children with colic , sleeping and feeding problems … happily promotes bogus treatments " .
The association sued him for libel .
Despite the prospect of massive costs , Singh bravely chose to defend himself .
To the astonishment of lawyers , journalists and scientists , Eady – England 's senior libel judge – decided that Singh was accusing the BCA of being consciously dishonest .
This meant that he did n't have a legal leg to stand on , as the libel laws , uniquely , place the burden of proof on the defendant .
To win the case , Singh would have to prove that the BCA knew the treatments were bogus and was acting fraudulently .
He did n't believe this and it had n't been his intention to suggest it .
But now he had to prove to the jury that he could see inside the BCA 's collective mind and discern that it was knowingly promoting false information .
Though this meant that his costs – which had already reached £ 100,000 – would climb even higher , Singh appealed .
Last week the appeal court struck Eady 's ruling down , deciding that his interpretation was " legally erroneous " .
( Sadly this does n't conclude the case . )
Its judgment has n't yet been transcribed , but people who were in court claim that it damns Eady as fiercely as any previous ruling .
That 's saying quite a lot .
During the libel case brought by Richard Desmond , pornographer and proprietor of Express newspapers , against the investigative author Tom Bower – who had claimed that Desmond acted on grudges – Eady refused to allow the court to hear evidence that Desmond had done just this in another instance .
In July the appeal court found that Eady 's decision was " plainly wrong " and risked " a miscarriage of justice " .
In 2004 , during a case brought by a Saudi businessman – Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel – against the Wall Street Journal , Eady decided that the newspaper 's story that the Saudi central bank was monitoring the accounts of certain businesses in case they were being used ( unwittingly or otherwise ) to channel funds to terrorists was not responsible journalism .
Among his justifications was the fact that the US government had n't published this information : Eady appeared to see the interests of the state and the interest of the public as the same thing .
The law lords decided that Eady was " hostile to the spirit " of the public interest defence and that he had " rigidly applied the old law " in a way that was " quite unrealistic … unnecessary and positively misleading " .
In one amazing passage , Lord Hoffmann compared Eady 's approach to that of the Communist party censors in the Soviet Union .
But perhaps the gravest judgments against the Honourable Mr Justice Eady are those made by legislators in the United States .
Such is the reach and severity of his illiberal rulings that four states have so far passed what are , in effect , Eady laws , and Congress is currently considering a federal bill whose purpose is to defend US citizens from his judgments , and the English law he interprets .
The Eady laws arise from his encouragement of libel tourism : allowing cases with only the most tenuous connection with this country to be heard in London , and using them to stamp on free speech all over the world .
In 2004 , the Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz applied to the high court to sue the US author Rachel Ehrenfeld over her claim that he had funded al - Qaida and other terrorist groups .
Ehrenfeld 's book was not published in this country and not obtainable from UK bookshops , but 23 copies had been bought here over the internet .
This was sufficient for Eady to decide that Mahfouz 's case could be heard .
Ehrenfeld refused to recognise the English court 's jurisdiction .
In her absence , Eady ruled in Mahfouz 's favour and ordered that Ehrenfeld retract her claims , apologise and pay Mahfouz $ 225,000 in costs and damages .
This is despite the fact that Mahfouz could scarcely be said to have a reputation to defend after he was fined $ 225 m ( exactly 1,000 times Ehrenfeld 's punishment ) for his role in the BCCI fraud .
( I can say this without being dragged before Eady 's star chamber only because Mahfouz is now dead , and dead men can't sue ) .
Eady 's clerk tells me that the judge does n't want to comment , but I expect he would answer that he was merely applying the law .
And , though his interpretation is draconian , the sad truth is that he would be right .
Long before Eady 's reign of terror began , gangsters such as Robert Maxwell were using the defamation laws to sue the backside off anyone who tried to investigate their crooked affairs .
Such are the perversities of this law that the English courts can be used by criminals to prevent exposure of their crimes .
With average costs 140 times higher than those of other European countries , libel proceedings here can be defended only by people – like the admirable Mr Singh – who have a lot of money and a lot of guts .
Until the law is changed , men like Mr Justice Eady will continue to hold free speech to ransom .
So read Jack Straw 's testimony before the commons culture , media and sport committee and weep .
Every time an MP put forward a firm proposal for reforming the law , the justice secretary responded in a manner so vague and nebulous that as you read the text his words become invisible , camouflaging themselves among the letters of which they are made .
He fended off reform not with arguments but with ambiguities , until the fizz and ambition had faded from the MPs ' questions and they became almost as absent and grey as he is .
Straw 's abstractions meant what we knew already : nothing will change if he can help it .
Perhaps the real target of this column should have been Straw , whose determination to preserve this bookburners ' law means that all of us are forced to share his terror of upsetting the rich and powerful .
Through 12 years in power , a government of frightened little men has done nothing to reform the democratic world 's most illiberal laws , which permit an old - fashioned judge to punish us for holding power to account .

Chelios Joins A.H.L. Wolves
The Chicago Wolves of the A.H.L. announced on Monday that they have signed 47 - year - old defenseman Chris Chelios , assuring that the three - time Norris Trophy - winning Chicago native will play pro for a 27th consecutive season .
Chelios , who played for the Canadiens , Blackhawks and Red Wings and won three Stanley Cups in an N.H.L. career that ended when Detroit declined to sign him after last spring ’s Cup final , joins the Wolves after a 1 - 5 start that led to the firing of coach Don Granato on Monday .
In addition to those three N.H.L. clubs Chelios also played 3 games for EHC Biel in the Swiss N.L.A. during the 1994 - 95 lockout , 23 for the Motor City Mechanics of the United Hockey League during the 2004 - 5 lockout , and 2 for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the A.H.L. last season .
Chelios is also involved in a move by the troubled N.H.L.
Players Association to investigate the union ’s constitution and the possible ouster of some officers in the wake of last summer ’s sudden firing of executive director Paul Kelly .

To you , disgruntled restaurant employee , I have much to say .
I feel your pain .
It 's a thankless job .
I have worked at some truly heinous establishments , both here in Columbus at " upscale " restaurants around Easton and downtown , and at several well - known places in downtown Chicago .
You run about like a maniac , your thighs chafing , sweat dripping down the crack of your ass , the grease in the air mingling with your perspiration to give your face what my former co-worker Erik calls " The Shimmer . "
Your hair smells like a strange mixture of french fries and spinach artichoke dip .
Your boss is too coked out to care that your last table left without paying and expects you to cover the bill out of your tips , unless you want to blow him and / or wear nothing but your server apron while he snorts blow off your tits as you whisper restaurant lingo like " on the fly " and " 86 " into his ear in the sluttiest voice you can muster .
I feel your pain .
And I understand the lure of the restaurant job .
Short , flexible hours and , in comparison to say , a job in retail , a reasonable wage .
The ability to receive the phone bill in the mail , realize you can't pay it , and be able to rectify that situation immediately by simply calling up a co-worker and offering to work for them .
The ability to get the night off at a moment 's notice so you can study for that exam or take care of that sick child or dispose of that decomposing corpse .
Free food , oftentimes free alcohol , even more oftentimes free drugs , and still MORE oftentimes free sex with willing co-workers .
Ahhh , the joy of the on - the - go blowjob in dry storage -- and while we 're on the subject , I 'd like to give a shout - out to Ryan L. , who gave me one of the best rolls in the hay I 've ever had against the cold , hard steel of the liquor cage while a table of 14 hags from the Red Hat Society became increasingly incensed about the tardiness of their coffee refills .
I understand .
But here 's the thing .
The shitty tipping procedures of the Average Joe will NEVER change .
Ever .
You are never going to finally " educate " the populace about the importance of fair tipping .
Those who get it , get it .
Those who do n't , do n't , and they never will .
The one notable exception to this is if they begin fucking someone who is or has been a waiter / waitress .
I have found that the only servers successful at changing the tipping procedures of another citizen are the ones who are , in fact , fucking that citizen .
The one exception to THIS rule is my mother , who I have simply berated enough times for abusing waitstaff that she is frightened into submission and simply hurls her entire wallet at our server as she crumples into a heap beneath the table , rocking back and forth and sucking her thumb .
But these are EXCEPTIONS .
This is not a civil rights struggle .
This is not a situation where you need to keep hollering and raising hell until you are heard and society is changed .
We shall NOT overcome , I assure you .
So it 's best that you get off of your soapbox and save your breath .
You will never convince groups of co-workers to put everything on 1 check or make them understand it takes 10 times as long to cash out a table of 10 than if those 10 people just throw in their own fair share ( including tip ) into a pile when the check comes .
People will never understand that !
Instead , do like I did : take the energy you use bitching about it and get a different job .
And you know what ?
I fucking HATE my job .
Selling insurance is akin to ... well , to hydrating my contact lenses with hydrochloric acid or shaving my nutsack with a dull , rusty garden implement .
But you know what ?
I have money , and plenty of it , I have time to work on my writing and my other super hero skills , and best of all , I do n't have to worry about complete strangers ass - raping me and leaving me on the side of the freeway to bleed to death in order to save a dollar on their fucking hamburger by punishing me because I burned my fucking fingers off on a plate in the kitchen and hence took an extra 30 seconds to refill their Diet Coke and bring them that side of ranch that will inevitably make their genitals , at long last , COMPLETELY disappear beneath a mound of abdominal fat .
Free at last , free at last , thank God almighty I am free at last .
Get out .
Go back to school .
Go to a temp agency .
Work in a factory .
Sell crack .
Whatever .
Just get out .

Imported ( Moroccan , Afghani , Nepalase ) Hash photo's and discussion ....
Although once in a while we get nice imported hash treats in North America ... its just harder to find .
Similar threads on other forums have been popular and interesting .
So c'mon everyone post up your photo's of your prized imported hashes and chat it up a bit ....
I 'll get a nice photo up shortly of some ' super afghani ' that I was fortunate to come across .
It 's hard to describe that great stone you get from hashes that come from that area of the world .... always mellow , relaxing , calming just enough to put a smile on your face , sometimes smoking bud makes me a bit paranoid ... imported hash never does ...
I have no idea why .... different strains , longer cure is what I 've read ....
Anyway , if you 're a fan of imported hash POST HERE .
Peace .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Leading banks have funded arms manufacturers , whose products include cluster bombs , to the tune of $ 5 billion in the past two years , despite an international accord to ban such weapons , a study said Thursday .
The report by Profundo consultancy and several NGOs said the banks loaned money to companies whose products include cluster bombs or their components .
It did not say the funds went directly to make cluster bombs .
The manufacturers could use the money for any of their production lines .
The top five loan providers were Bank of America , Citigroup , JP Morgan , Barclays and Goldman Sachs , the study said .
The researchers used publicly available information , such as that supplied by stock exchanges and financial databases , to produce their study .
According to the research , the banks have provided financing for diversified manufacturer Textron , aerospace and defense group Alliant Techsystems and defense contractor Lockheed Martin , all based in the United States .
Barclays said in a statement it provided financial services to arms makers within a specific policy framework , taking into account the likely use of the equipment .
“ Our policy ... explicitly prohibits financing trade in landmines , cluster bombs or any equipment designed to be used as an instrument of torture , ” Barclays said .
Asked to clarify , a Barclays ’ spokeswoman declined further comment .
Bank of America and JP Morgan declined to comment while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs also had no immediate reaction .
Cluster bombs , which open in mid-air and scatter a multitude of bomblets over a wide area , have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians , campaigners say .
Nations agreed to outlaw cluster bombs in May 2008 .
The resulting convention will come into force when 30 countries have ratified it -- 23 have already done so .
Neither the United States nor Britain , where the top five loan providers are based , have yet ratified the treaty .
The Convention on Cluster Munitions includes a ban on assisting anyone to make the bombs .
“ We feel very strongly that assistance in production means investment .
If you invest in a company , you ’re considered to assist the production of these ( bombs ) , ” Roos Boer , one of the report ’s authors , said at the launch of the study .
The report said : “ Financial institutions should develop policies that exclude all financial links with companies involved in producing cluster munitions . ”
It added : “ Policies should not be narrowed to refusing project financing for cluster munitions . ”
The report also called on governments to draw up clear legislation to prohibit investment in cluster bombs and to provide guidelines for financial institutions .
CHICAGO — The Halle Berry fan club is expanding one brain cell at a time .
By eavesdropping on the activity of single neurons in the human brain , scientists have figured out which brain cells go wild for superstars such as the popular actress .
And the newest research shows that people can activate those cells selectively .
“ This study is the first demonstration of humans ’ ability to control the activity of single neurons , ” the researchers wrote in a summary of their study .
The results , presented October 19 at the Society for Neuroscience 's annual meeting by Moran Cerf of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , may help researchers understand how each cell in the brain sees and responds to the world .
" This type of work gives us some clues about what 's going on in the brain , " comments Christoph Weidemann of the University of Pennsylvania , who studies how the brain processes information .
" It 's quite an amazing feat for the brain to make sense of its input and reliably recognize people and objects . "
The new study was conducted on people with epilepsy .
Doctors had implanted electrodes in these patients ’ brains to track where seizures originate .
The researchers used these same electrodes to eavesdrop on the activity of single brain cells in a part of the brain called the medial temporal lobe , which is important for " memory , attention , perception — the things that we care about the most , " Cerf said in his presentation .
Before the experiment began , Cerf and his colleagues showed volunteers familiar images of people , objects or places , chosen on the basis of extensive interviews about the patients ’ preferences .
Pictures included images of Bill Clinton , Michael Jackson and Venus Williams , among others .
" We hoped to locate neurons in their brains that respond selectively to one of those concepts , " Cerf said in his talk .
In each patient , the researchers found about five neurons that fired when the patient looked at an image of a certain person or object .
A person might have , for example , a Halle Barry neuron , a Marilyn Monroe neuron , an Eiffel tower neuron , a Michael Jackson neuron and a spider neuron .
Once these neurons were identified , the researchers wanted to know if the patients could control them by thinking about that certain person or object .
To do this , Cerf and his colleagues hooked up the neuron - sensing electrodes to a computer that then displayed images representative of the person ’s thought .
When a patient 's Marilyn Monroe neuron became active , the screen would show an image of Marilyn Monroe .
To see how well the patients could control these single neurons , researchers set up what they call the " fade " experiment , which is like a competition between two different neurons .
One version of the experiment involved a neuron that responded to Goonies ' star Josh Brolin and another neuron that responded to Marilyn Monroe .
Initially , the person was shown a hybrid image of these two stars overlaid on each other .
When the person was told to think of Josh Brolin , the electrodes would record that neuron ’s activity and send the data to the computer , causing the Monroe image to fade and the Brolin image to get brighter .
The experiment was finished when the picture was completely Brolin or Monroe , or 10 seconds had elapsed .
Ten patients underwent this test and successfully directed the pictures between 60 and 90 percent of the time , the researchers found .
As the testing went on , the patients became better at controlling the neurons .
Scientists are still far from being able to see people 's innermost thoughts , Weidemann says .
" When people talk about mind reading , there ’s a tendency to think of 1984 and all the negative aspects of it , " he says .
" The goal here is to understand cognitive processes . "
A better understanding of how the brain encodes information may be useful for building machines that can be controlled directly from people ’s brains .
Such devices may ultimately help people who are unable to communicate .

" And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather expose them .
For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret . "
Ephesians 5:9-14
Halloween is not just innocent entertainment .
It 's symbols and practices breathes new life into the dark rituals and symbols of past civilizations .
Many of its symbols are universal ; they are familiar to people in many parts of the world .
Yet , each cultural group sees the images from its own perspectives .
To one group , they symbolize various forms of death : physical and spiritual , scary or affirming .
To another , they point to the innocuous thrills and titillations that go with what they believe to be little more than a fun , fantasy world .
To a third group , they represent genuine evil -- the lures of an occult world view manipulated by Satan , who now as always masquerades as " an angel of light . "
In other words , the meaning depends on a person 's beliefs and world view .
The symbols below include images from Aztec religious art , from Magic the Gathering cards , from a Japanese Sailor Moon comic book , from a Dungeons & Dragons manual and from ads for Halloween treats and costumes .
This mix shows the global popularity of these symbols and reminds us that , while Halloween clashes with God 's guidelines , it fits the world and human nature very well .
That 's why the mastermind behind this spiritual war keeps using the same tactics through the centuries .
Satan 's main strategy has always been to tempt people to love what God hates , prompt them to pursue his enticing path , and deceive them into thinking that his " new " way is as good , or even better , than the old ways God has shown us .
Since his strategies do n't change , God 's warning in Proverbs 14:12 is as relevant now as it was in King Solomon 's days : " There is a way that seems right to a man , but its end is the way of death . " ( Proverbs 14:12 )
A first - grade student at Reedville Elementary was n't feeling well last Thursday and asked to go home , but she ended up leaving school with the wrong guardian .
The Hillsboro School District issued a statement Tuesday describing the incident as a case of misidentification .
" The child was misidentified upon arrival in the office , " said Beth Graser , Hillsboro School District spokeswoman .
Office staff called the wrong guardian , a grandfather , to pick up the girl .
The grandfather arrived , showed his identification and signed out the student , taking her home .
Realizing his mistake , he returned the girl to the school within five minutes , Graser said .
" It 's a very unfortunate incident but certainly not indicative of any widespread problem , " said Graser .
The school district , which has 20,300 students , is reviewing its release protocols , but immediately put in place requirements that students identify themselves and ensure staff ask the child " do you know this person ? " before sending them off , Graser said .

The Cove , the provocative film that documented the hidden dolphin slaughters in Taiji , Japan , made its Japan debut at the Tokyo International Film Festival this week , and director Louie Psihoyos was there to bear witness to its unveiling .
I talked to him just two hours after he got off the airplane from Narita on Thursday morning .
Here 's what he had to say about his experience in watching the film with the actual dolphin killers in the audience :
All the bad guys there , front row center .
The mayor , the International Whaling Committee delegate , fishermen dressed up in suits … I could n't have dreamed of a better screening .
They had all come to Tokyo with their lawyers to see if there would be any kind of litigation against the film .
The screening sold out within a few hours , so I offered to give them tickets .
At one point , the mayor stormed out , and the IWC delegate held his head in his hands .
I thought I might get arrested when I got off the airplane in Tokyo — there are arrest warrants out for me in Taiji for things like trespassing , conspiracy to disrupt commerce , and photographing undercover police .
I was invited by the TIFF , though , so that 's probably what kept me safe .
Stories about dolphin hunting have been taboo in Japan for the past 30 years .
The only reason this film was able to show there this week was because the Liberal Democratic Party was voted out .
The government is a major sponsor of the film festival , and about two weeks after the regime change , the festival 's director contacted me and said , " Given the ' environment ' theme of this year 's film festival , it would be hypocritical not to show The Cove . "
Still , the festival did seem to bury it — we had a 10:30 AM screening and not a single promotional poster in sight .
All the Japanese who approached me about the film had very positive things to say about it .
It was mostly young people , 18 - 35 year olds .
They said , how can I help you get this film out in Japan ?
I think many were in shock .
I told them that this was just the Disney version of what really happens at the cove .
During the Q&A session , I pointed out that this is not just an animal rights film , but that these dolphins have about 5000 times more mercury than allowed by Japanese law .
Unfortunately , it 's not enough to argue that these are the only animals in human history that have saved humans .
The only way we can save them is by reminding people that human beings have made their environment so toxic that we can't eat them anymore .
The question of intelligence of other animals as judged by our own intelligence is such a specie - centric thing .
We 're about to go through our sixth major extinction now , so how smart does that make us really ?
I think the most important thing that could happen is that the film would show in Taiji .
I 've sent them a formal letter to see if they 'd like to do an ocean - themed film festival at a national park that would include The Cove .
I also told the Taiji mayor and councilmen that all profits generated from the film in Japan would go directly to the dolphin hunters if they stopped their dolphin hunting .
I would gladly support them if they switch to crab hunting or whale watching .
I was only in Japan for two days — the whole thing was so surreal .
At Sundance earlier this year , people thought that this movie would never screen in Japan .
Now there are two major distributors in Japan negotiating for the rights .
And flying back over the Pacific today , I knew there are now several thousand dolphins swimming free because of this movie .
On one hand Geithner says the recovery is stronger than expected , on the other he says it 's not time to roll back the stimulus .
Please consider Geithner Says Recovery Signs Are ‘ Stronger ’ Than Expected .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said signs of economic recovery are “ stronger ” and have appeared “ sooner ” than expected , while reiterating it ’s not yet time to roll back stimulus programs .
Financial conditions have improved “ dramatically , ” particularly in the U.S. , where the housing market has stabilized , Geithner said in a statement issued in Istanbul today .
Still , jobless rates are “ unacceptably high ” and the financial system remains damaged .
As a result , it ’s too soon for governments to withdraw stimulus , Geithner said .
“ Planning for an eventual exit is the responsible and necessary thing to do , but we are not yet in the position where it would be prudent to begin to withdraw fiscal and monetary policy support , ” Geithner said in remarks released after a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations .
“ Exit will not be like flipping a switch , ” he said .
“ Instead , as conditions stabilize and growth strengthens , we will unwind the extraordinary policy measures we ’ve taken , phasing them out carefully to avoid a damaging cliff . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Epic swindler Bernard Madoff shared a prison cell with a 21 - year - old drug dealer , and other fellow inmates included a spy and a mob boss when he was sent to prison in July , according to court documents .

REUTERS / UNITED STATES MARSHALS SERVICE / Handout
The account of the 71 - year - old Madoff ’s prison life was given by California lawyer Joseph Cotchett , who interviewed the fraudster in late July and included those details in an amended civil complaint on Tuesday filed on behalf of some defrauded investors .
The complaint also alleges that from 1975 to 2003 , Madoff sent a company messenger to Harlem to buy cocaine for himself and other employees .
“ Madoff sleeps in the lower bunk and he eats pizza cooked by an inmate convicted of child molestation , ” the complaint in New York State Supreme Court said .
“ His recreation consists of walking around the prison track at night . ”
A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Madoff ’s current conditions at the medium security Butner , North Carolina , facility , which consists of four complexes , including one for medical treatment .
In August , the bureau knocked down a New York Post tabloid report that Madoff had cancer .
Madoff is confined for the rest of his life in the prison outside the city of Raleigh after pleading guilty in March to orchestrating a multibillion dollar global investment fraud .
He was sentenced on June 30 to 150 years by a judge in New York and transferred to the prison on July 14 .
“ Rather than spending time on private planes or his yachts , or residing in his luxury apartment in Manhattan , his Montauk , Long Island , and Palm Beach mansions , or his property in Cap d’Antibe , France , Madoff now shares a cell with a 21 - year old inmate convicted of drug crimes , ” the complaint said .
“ He now spends time with former Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Jonathan Pollard , who was convicted of spying for Israel .
Most of his fellow inmates are in prison for drug crimes or sex crimes . ”
The court document , based on interviews with employees and an investigation by Cotchett ’s law firm alleged “ abuse of drugs and women as a pattern of conduct in the Madoff firm , ” Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in New York .
From 1975 , Madoff sent an employee to buy cocaine and other drugs for himself and company employees , the complaint said .
It described “ wild office parties sans spouses ” and “ topless entertainers wearing only ‘ G - string ’ underwear serving as waitresses . ”

If you work in an Agile organization and are using a heavy weight specialized tool for test management , I have an important message for you :
Stop. Seriously .
Just stop .
It ’s getting in the way .
If you are accustomed to heavyweight test management solutions , you might not realize the extent to which a test management tool is more of an impediment than an aid to agility .
But for Agile teams , it is .
Always .
Without exception .
I do n’t make such claims lightly and I do n’t expect you to accept my claims at face value .
So let me explain .
The Agile Alternative to Test Management
The things you need need to manage the test effort in an Agile context are whatever you are already using for the : Backlog ; Source Control Management ( SCM ) System ; Continuous Integration ( CI ) System ; and Automated Regression Tests .
That ’s it .
You do n’t need any other tools or tracking mechanisms .
Any test - specific repository will increase duplication and add unnecessary overhead to keep the duplicate data in sync across multiple repositories .
It will also probably necessitate creating and managing cumbersome meta data , like traceability matrices , to tie all the repositories together .
All that overhead comes at a high cost and adds absolutely no value beyond what SCM , CI , & the Backlog already provide .
But , But , But …
I ’ve heard any number objections to the notion that Agile teams do n’t need specialized test management systems .
I ’ll tackle the objections I hear most often here :
But Where Do the Tests Live ?
Persistent test - related artifacts go in one of two places :
High - level acceptance criteria , test ideas , and Exploratory Testing charters belong in the Backlog with the associated Story .
Technical artifacts including test automation and manual regression test scripts ( if any ) belong in the Source Control System versioned with the associated code .
And Where Do We Capture the Testing Estimates ?
In Agile , we ultimately care about Done Stories .
Coded but not Tested means Not Done .
Thus the test effort has to be estimated as part of the overall Story implementation effort if we are to have anything even remotely approaching accurate estimates .
So we do n’t estimate the test effort separately , and that means we do n’t need a separate place to put test estimates .
How Do I Prioritize Tests ?
Agile teams work from a prioritized backlog .
Instead of prioritizing tests , they prioritize Stories .
And Stories are either Done or not .
Given that context , it does not make sense to talk about prioritizing the tests in isolation .
Hello , I Live in the Real World .
There is Never Enough Time to Test .
How Do I Prioritize Tests Given Time Pressure ?
If the Story is important enough to code , it ’s important enough to test .
Period .
If you ’re working in an Agile context it is absolutely critical that everyone on the team understands this .
But Testing is Never Done .
Seriously , How Do I Prioritize What To Test ?
This is n’t really a test management problem .
This is a requirements , quality , and testing problem that test management solutions offer the illusion of addressing .
The answer is n’t to waste time mucking about in a test management tool attempting to manage the effort , control the process , or prioritize tests .
Every minute we spend mucking about in a test management tool is a minute we ’re not spending on understanding the real state of the emerging system in development .
The answer instead is to invest the time in activities that contribute directly to moving the project forward : understanding the Product Owner ’s expectations ; capturing those expectations in automated acceptance tests ; and using time - boxed Exploratory Testing sessions to reveal risks and vulnerabilities .
What about the Test Reports ?
Traditional test management systems provide all kinds of reports : pass / fail statistics , execution time actuals v. estimated , planned v. executed tests , etc .
Much of this information is irrelevant in an Agile context .
The CI system provides the information that remains relevant : the automated test execution results .
And those results should be 100 % Green ( passed ) most of the time .
What about Historical Test Results Data ?
Most teams find that the current CI reports are more interesting than the historic results .
If the CI build goes Red for any reason , Agile teams stop and fix it .
Thus Agile teams do n’t have the same kind of progression of pass / fail ratios that traditional teams see during a synch and stabilize phase .
And that means historic trends usually are not all that interesting .
However , if the team really wants to keep historic test execution results ( or are compelled to do so as a matter of regulatory compliance ) , the test results can be stored in the source control system with the code .
Speaking of Regulatory Compliance , How Can We Be in Compliance without a Test Management System ?
If your context involves FDA , SOX , ISO , or just internal audit compliance , then you probably live in a world where :
If it was n’t documented , it did n’t happen
We say what we do and do what we say
Test repeatability is essential
In that context , specialized test management solutions may be the defacto standard , but they ’re not the best answer .
If I ’m working on a system where we have to be clear , concrete , and explicit about requirements , tests , and execution results , then I would much rather do Acceptance Test Driven Development .
ATDD provides the added value of executable requirements .
Instead of the tests and requirements just saying what the system should do , they can be executed to demonstrate that it does .
Certainly , doing ATDD requires effort .
But so does maintaining a separate test management system and all the corresponding traceability matrices and overhead documentation .
Our Management Requires Us to Use a Specialized Test Management System .
Now What ?
Send them the URL to this post .
Ask them to read it .
Then ask them what additional value they ’re getting out a test management system that they would n’t get from leveraging SCM , CI , the Backlog , and the automated regression tests .
So , have I convinced you ?
If not , please tell me why in the comments …
The government should be spying on Muslims even if they are not suspected of committing crimes , in order to hunt down terrorists before they strike , the head of an anti-extremist thinktank has said .
Ed Husain , of the Quilliam Foundation , said it was the morally right thing to do , and that waiting until people had fallen prey to extremism and were drawn into terrorism was too late .
The foundation received £ 700,000 from the government for its counterterrorism work as part of a strategy called Prevent .
That included £ 400,000 from the Office for Security and Counterterrorism , which finances projects trying to counter extremism on UK campuses and monitoring websites that appear to endorse Islamist violence .
Husain said of Prevent : " It is gathering intelligence on people not committing terrorist offences .
If it is to prevent people getting killed and committing terrorism , it is good and it is right . "
Prevent was created to increase the security services ' knowledge of extremism in Britain , he said .
" If those thoughts and beliefs are linked to killing people in a democracy , the state is the only actor in a democracy that can prevent violence .
" It would be morally wrong of a taxpayer - funded programme designed to prevent terrorism if it was not designed to gather intelligence in order to stop that terrorism from happening .
" The alternative is to let the buggers do what they wish , until they appear on the violence radar , which is too late .
If you are in the business of counterterrorism , you must want your intelligence services to know what is going on . "
The balance between liberty and security is an issue Britain has grappled with since London was bombed by al - Qaida - inspired terrorists on 7 July 2005 , resulting in the deaths of 52 people and 750 injuries .
Husain said gathering intelligence outweighed civil liberty concerns that prying into the political and religious beliefs of people was a dangerous move towards a police state : " That 's the name of the game .
It 's not about doing the right thing by Islamists or by liberal do - gooders , it 's about creating a society where liberal do - gooders survive freely . "
The government has made repeated attempts to get people who are not police or intelligence officers to inform on those they feel are suspicious .
Ministers wanted lecturers and university staff to inform on suspect students , fearing that campuses had become fertile recruiting grounds for extremists .
Their plans were leaked to the Guardian in 2006 , creating a backlash that forced the government to back down .
Today 's revelations about Prevent comes amid a debate about how to tackle terrorism .
After the July 2005 attacks on London , there was little intelligence about threats posed by al - Qaida - inspired terrorists or about British Muslim communities .
The MI5 security service had never really believed that an attack by British - born suicide bombers was likely .
The focus turned to hunting down terrorists , but now the debate focuses on whether any Islamist extremism , even behaviour falling well short of advocating violence , must be tackled .
The Conservatives are seriously considering adopting a new policy called Preventing Extremism .
Among those who would be considered extreme under those plans are those who advocate a caliphate , a pan-Islamic state encompassing many countries ; those promoting Sharia law ; and those who believe in jihad , or armed resistance , anywhere in the world .
This would include armed resistance by Palestinians against the Israeli military and those who fail to condemn the killing of British soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The Federal Reserve used all the weaponry in its arsenal during the financial crisis , and created some new ones .
The Treasury ’s decision to pull back one innovation — in which the Treasury sold bonds and put the money on deposit at the Fed — has put the spotlight on another one .
Because of an act of Congress , the Fed now has the power to pay interest on the reserves that banks leave on deposit at the Fed .
That ’ll change the way the Fed manages the economy in the future — but only in ways that credit market geeks can understand .
For years , the Fed ’s primary tool has been the federal funds interest rate , the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans .
Banks with more reserves than they need to comply with legal minimums lend to others who need reserves .
The Fed ’s policy committee — the Federal Open Market Committee — sets a target for that rate , but does n’t control it .
It influences it by affecting the supply and demand for reserves in the open market .
In the past , when it wanted rates higher , it would announce a new target with much fanfare and then the next day reduce the supply of reserves — usually by selling securities from its portfolio which drained cash from the banking system .
Rates usually responded to the announcement in anticipation of the actual Fed market maneuvers .
When the Fed wanted rates lower , it did the opposite .
Changes in the fed funds rate ricochet through the economy .
Higher rates tend to discourage consumer and business borrowing and slow economic activity .
Today , the Fed ’s target for the fed funds rates is near zero and the banking system is awash with reserves .
Many of those reserves are n’t being lent to other banks which can then use them to lend them to customers .
Instead , they ’re on deposit with the Fed .
Until recently , the Fed did n’t pay interest on these reserves .
Now it does .
That changes things .
Someday , the Fed will declare the emergency over and decide to tighten credit .
There ’s concern that because there are so many reserves sloshing around the banking system and all sorts of ordinary relationships have been distorted by the crisis and the Fed ’s response that it wo n’t be able to get the fed funds rate up simply by announcing a new target and then reinforcing that with open - market operations .
After all , as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acknowledged earlier in the crisis , from “ time to time ” its trading desk has been “ unable to prevent the federal funds rate from falling to very low levels . ”
So now when the Fed decides it wants to raise the fed funds rate , it now has two options :
It can affect the SUPPLY of reserves as it used to by buying and selling Treasury securities on the open market .
Or it can influence the DEMAND for reserves .
If it raises the interest rate it pays on reserves , it will encourage banks to put more reserves on deposit at the Fed and lend less of their reserves to other banks in the interbank market .
That should push the fed funds rate up .
This , the Fed says , will mean less credit and higher interest rates throughout the banking system .
“ Paying interest on excess balances just makes it easier for the [ New York Fed trading ]
Desk to implement the target federal funds rate chosen by the FOMC , ” the New York Fed says .
“ Raising the rate of interest paid on reserve balances will give us substantial leverage over the federal funds rate and other short - term market interest rates , because banks generally will not supply funds to the market at an interest rate significantly lower than they can earn risk free by holding balances at the Federal Reserve , ” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress earlier this year .
“ Indeed , many foreign central banks use the ability to pay interest on reserves to help set a floor on market interest rates .
The attractiveness to banks of leaving their excess reserve balances with the Federal Reserve can be further increased by offering banks a choice of maturities for their deposits . ”
This new tool , the Fed says to anyone who will listen , should reassure anyone that ’s worrying that the Fed has the technical capacity to raise interest rates when the time comes .
The Home Secretary Alan Johnson is considering sacking his top expert drugs adviser following criticism of the government 's decision to reclassify cannabis .
Professor David Nutt , who chairs the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , yesterday accused ministers of devaluing and distorting evidence by their decision to move the drug back up to Class B from C last year ( see my previous post , Scientists v Politicians : Round 3 ) .
An e-mail sent to the BBC by an official in the Home Office this morning says that " yesterday 's coverage may have some serious repercussions for Prof Nutt and his position as chair of the ACMD " .
The note goes on to say " discussions are being had ( at ) a very high level regarding this issue and a decision will be taken early next week . "
Professor
Nutt knew nothing about the moves to dismiss him when I spoke to him earlier today , but seemed resigned to the possibility .
" They are bound to be considering that , " he told me , " thinking about the least worst option . "
" I think the issue is whether I am straying into the realm of policy , " he suggested .
" I personally do n't think I was . "
A source in the Home Office tells me that " the writing is on the wall " for the scientist , although no decision has yet been made .
On last night 's Question Time , the former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was asked about Professor Nutt 's view that the process by which she increased the penalties for cannabis possession last year was " highly politicised " .
Dimbleby : " You do n't have much time for the head of the advisory council ... "
Smith : " Frankly , no . "
Dimbleby : " Why not ? "
Smith : " I think , actually , this foray into policy is not what his job is about .
His job is to advise and my job as home secretary was to decide . "
If Alan Johnson does sack the professor , there is likely to be a strong reaction from some in the scientific community who may well argue that this is an attempt to silence independent academic discussion .
However , the online Sun columnist Jon Gaunt argues that the expert advisor has overstepped the mark :
" It 's perfectly acceptable for Nutt to have these discussions in the cosseted world of academia but it is totally irresponsible for him to pontificate in public and in his position as Drug Tsar .
He must be sacked immediately . "
Also appearing on Question Time last night , Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik , accused Jacqui Smith of bowing to a tabloid agenda when it comes to drugs policy .
" What 's the point of paying people to give you expert advice if you then run your government policy through the red tops ? "
Professor Nutt waits to hear his fate .

Taing was studying at the Michener Institute .
The other minivan passenger pronounced dead at the scene was a female family friend and fellow worshipper about to be dropped off at her home , Ho said .
To 's husband , Pho Taing , 43 , is in hospital in critical condition , as is a fifth passenger of the Honda Odyssey , a woman .
Police said this afternoon that one of them is in " grave " condition while the other suffered less serious injuries , but would n't identify them .
The three dead were all thrown from the cracked - open minivan .
Traffic officers were stunned by the wreckage , saying it 's the kind of destruction seen occasionally on highways but not on a Toronto street .
The van was turning when it was hit .
Jenny
To , a friend of the 24 - year - old victim , told the Star this afternoon that Taing was a " social butterfly . "
" Any time we felt lonely we would call each other , " she said .
The 21 - year - old driver of the BMW suffered non-life - threatening injuries and is in police custody in hospital .
Police say he will be charged in the crash .
Moments before the impact , the westbound BMW flew past a police cruiser heading east on Finch , said Sgt. Tim Burrows of Traffic Services .
The officers witnessed the crash in their rear view mirror , he added .
The BMW was " out of control " and continued about 100 metres after smashing the minivan in two , Burrows said .
Police believe the BMW 's driver had been drinking .
The man has been investigated for drinking and driving in the past , Burrows said , though he could not confirm any prior convictions .
" All in all , this was an absolutely atrocious night on our roadways , " Burrows said , adding that at least half a dozen other drivers were arrested for drinking and driving offences .
" Drinking and driving is a no - brain issue , " Burrows said .
" Once you 've added alcohol to your system , driving should be out of the equation . "
This afternoon , the front of the minivan lay on grass between the sidewalk and road , wires and metal protruding from its open end .
Firefighters cut one piece of the van apart , removing its contents .
Finch was closed between Sentinel Rd. and Driftwood Ave. as police investigated .

How come technetium is a synthetic material right in the centre of all those naturally - occurring substances in the periodic table ?
Could there be a deposit of naturally - occurring technetium out there somewhere ?
If the early periodic table had been a party , technetium would have been a particularly late arrival .
However its tardy entrance has n't prevented it from becoming an important element in nuclear medicine .
Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev predicted technetium 's existence when he published the first periodic table of the then 63 known elements in 1869 , but it was nearly another 70 years before it was discovered .
Mendeleev 's periodic table was unique at that time because he arranged the elements by their atomic number , but also by their properties : with metals in the left hand side of the table , transition elements in the middle and nonmetals on the right .
This meant when he predicted that technetium was missing , he was also able to predict its properties , says Dr Ron Weiner , head of ANSTO 's Radiopharmaceutical Research Institute .
It was n't until 1937 that two Italian scientists , Emilio Segrè and Carlo Perrier , were able to isolate and finally prove the existence of the elusive element 43 — a reference to technetium 's 43 protons .
The reason technetium has proved such an unwilling guest is that it is not found in nature .
Indeed its very name is derived from the Greek word technetos meaning artificial .
Technetium can only be produced artificially because most forms or isotopes of it ( atoms of the same chemical element with different numbers of neutrons ) have an excess of neutrons , making it very unstable .
" If an atom has an equal number of neutrons and protons then it is generally stable , if it has too few or too many neutrons then that particular element is unstable , " Weiner explains .
Unstable elements undergo radioactive decay into stable elements .
Technetium is the lightest radioactive element on the periodic table and its isotopes decay into a variety of other elements including stable ruthenium .
So while it 's highly unlikely we 'll ever find a mother lode of technetium on Earth , it has been detected in the spectra of some stars , confirming the theory that elements are produced by nuclear reactions within stars .
" The idea of stars of course is they 're fusion devices , " says Weiner .
" They start with helium and hydrogen and lithium and then build up , and that 's basically one of the signatures that suggest how old a star is . "
Technetium isotopes are also found occasionally in naturally - occurring ' reactors ' , says Weiner .
These reactors are uranium deposits which naturally underwent sustained nuclear reactions in Gabon , western Africa about 1.9 billion years ago .
Technetium isotopes like the excited isotope technetium - 99 m are produced today because of their importance in nuclear medicine .
" About 80 per cent of the nuclear medicine procedures in the world use this isotope , and that 's about 10 million procedures a year , " says Weiner .
The big advantage of technetium - 99 m ( half - life six hours ) is that it is produced by decay from the much longer lived isotope molybdenum - 99 ( half - life 67 hours ) .
This means molybdenum - 99 can be stored in the hospital and the technetium - 99 m isolated for patient use when necessary .
ANSTO 's OPAL reactor produces molybdenum - 99 using uranium - 235 , and ANSTO is hoping to increase its production of this isotope with the world facing a potential shortfall in supplies as older reactors are temporarily closed for maintenance .
Technetium - 99 m is a good isotope to use as a radioactive tracer because it does n't harm the body too much , and the single gamma ray it emits enables doctors to get a very good picture of where the isotope is in the body , Weiner says .
However the downside of the procedure is it produces waste in the form of technetium - 99 ( the ground or unexcited state of technetium - 99 m ) which has to be immobilised to prevent harm to the environment .
Dr Ron Weiner was interviewed by Suzannah Lyons .

fsync ()
Sure , programmers ( especially operating systems programmers ) love their specifications .
Clean , well - defined interfaces are a key element of scalable software development .
But what is it about file systems , POSIX , and when file data is guaranteed to hit permanent storage that brings out the POSIX fundamentalist in all of us ?
The recent fsync( ) / rename ( ) / O_PONIES controversy was the most heated in recent memory but not out of character for - related discussions .
In this article , we 'll explore the relationship between file systems developers , the POSIX file I/O standard , and people who just want to store their data .
In the beginning , there was creat ( )
Like many practical interfaces ( including HTML and TCP / IP ) , the POSIX file system interface was implemented first and specified second .
UNIX was written beginning in 1969 ; the first release of the POSIX specification for the UNIX file I/O interface ( IEEE Standard 1003.1 ) was released in 1988 .
Before UNIX , application access to non-volatile storage ( e.g. , a spinning drum ) was a decidedly application - and hardware - specific affair .
Record - based file I/O was a common paradigm , growing naturally out of punch cards , and each kind of file was treated differently .
The new interface was designed by a few guys ( Ken Thompson , Dennis Ritchie , et alia ) screwing around with their new machine , writing an operating system that would make it easier to , well , write more operating systems .
As we know now , the new I / O interface was a hit .
It turned out to be a portable , versatile , simple paradigm that made modular software development much easier .
It was by no means perfect , of course : a number of warts revealed themselves over time , not all of which were removed before the interface was codified into the POSIX specification .
One example is directory hard links , which permit the creation of a directory cycle - a directory that is a descendant of itself - and its subsequent detachment from the file system hierarchy , resulting in allocated but inaccessible directories and files .
Recording the time of the last access time - atime - turns every read into a tiny write .
And do n't forget the apocryphal quote from Ken Thompson when asked if he'd do anything differently if he were designing UNIX today : " If I had to do it over again ?
Hmm ... I guess I 'd spell ' creat ' with an 'e ' " .
( That 's the creat ( ) system call to create a new file . )
But overall , the UNIX file system interface is a huge success .
POSIX file I /O today : Ponies and fsync ( )
Over time , various more - or - less portable additions have accreted around the standard set of POSIX file I/O interfaces ; they have been occasionally standardized and added to the canon - revelations from latter - day prophets .
Some examples off the top of my head include pread ( ) / pwrite ( ) , direct I/O , file preallocation , extended attributes , access control lists ( ACLs ) of every stripe and color , and a vast array of mount - time options .
While these additions are often debated and implemented in incompatible forms , in most cases no one is trying to oppose them purely on the basis of not being present in a standard written in 1988 .
Similarly , there is relatively little debate about refusing to conform to some of the more brain - dead POSIX details , such as the aforementioned directory hard link feature .
Why , then , does the topic of when file system data is guaranteed to be " on disk " suddenly turn file systems developers into pedantic POSIX - quoting fundamentalists ?
Fundamentally ( ha ) , the problem comes down to this :
Waiting for data to actually hit disk before returning from a system call is a losing game for file system performance .
As the most extreme example , the original synchronous version of the UNIX file system frequently used only 3 - 5 % of the disk throughput .
Nearly every file system performance improvement since then has been primarily the result of saving up writes so that we can allocate and write them out as a group .
As file systems developers , we are going to look for every loophole in fsync ( ) and squirm our way through it .
[ PULL QUOTE : As file systems developers , we are going to look for every loophole in fsync ( ) and squirm our way through it .
END QUOTE ]
Fortunately for the file systems developers , the POSIX specification is so very minimal that it does n't even mention the topic of file system behavior after a system crash .
After all , the original FFS - style file systems ( e.g. , ext2 ) can theoretically lose your entire file system after a crash , and are still POSIX - compliant .
Ironically , as file systems developers , we spend 90 % of our brain power coming up with ways to quickly recover file system consistency after system crash !
No wonder file systems users are irked when we define file system metadata as important enough to keep consistent , but not file data - we take care of our own so well .
File systems developers have magnanimously conceded , though , that on return from fsync ( ) , and only from fsync( ) , and only on a file system with the right mount options , the changes to that file will be available if the system crashes after that point .
At the same time , fsync ( ) is often more expensive than it absolutely needs to be .
The easiest way to implement fsync( ) is to force out every outstanding write to the file system , regardless of whether it is a journaling file system , a COW file system , or a file system with no crash recovery mechanism whatsoever .
This is because it is very difficult to map backward from a given file to the dirty file system blocks needing to be written to disk in order to create a consistent file system containing those changes .
For example , the block containing the bitmap for newly allocated file data blocks may also have been changed by a later allocation for a different file , which then requires that we also write out the indirect blocks pointing to the data for that second file , which changes another bitmap block ...
When you solve the problem of tracing specific dependencies of any particular write , you end up with the complexity of soft updates .
No surprise then , that most file systems take the brute force approach , with the result that fsync ( ) commonly takes time proportional to all outstanding writes to the file system .
So , now we have the following situation : fsync ( ) is required to guarantee that file data is on stable storage , but it may perform arbitrarily poorly , depending on what other activity is going on in the file system .
Given this situation , application developers came to rely on what is , on the face of it , a completely reasonable assumption : rename ( ) of one file over another will either result in the contents of the old file , or the contents of the new file as of the time of the rename ( ) .
This is a subtle and interesting optimization : rather than asking the file system to synchronously write the data , it is instead a request to order the writes to the file system .
Ordering writes is far easier for the file system to do efficiently than synchronous writes .
However , the ordering effect of rename ( ) turns out to be a file system specific implementation side effect .
It only works when changes to the file data in the file system are ordered with respect to changes in the file system metadata .
In ext3 /4 , this is only true when the file system is mounted with the data=ordered mount option - a name which hopefully makes more sense now !
Up until recently , data=ordered was the default journal mode for ext3 , which , in turn , was the default file system for Linux ; as a result , ext3 data=ordered was all that many Linux application developers had any experience with .
During the Great File System Upheaval of 2.6.30 , the default journal mode for ext3 changed to data=writeback , which means that file data will get written to disk when the file system feels like it , very likely after the file 's metadata specifying where its contents are located has been written to disk .
This not only breaks the rename ( ) ordering assumption , but also means that the newly renamed file may contain arbitrary garbage - or a copy of /etc / shadow , making this a security hole as well as a data corruption problem .
Which brings us to the present day fsync / rename / O_PONIES controversy , in which many file systems developers argue that applications should explicitly call fsync ( ) before renaming a file if they want the file 's data to be on disk before the rename takes effect - a position which seems bizarre and random until you understand the individual decisions , each perfectly reasonable , that piled up to create the current situation .
Personally , as a file systems developer , I think it is counterproductive to replace a performance - friendly implicit ordering request in the form of a rename ( ) with an impossible to optimize fsync ( ) .
It may not be POSIX , but the programmer 's intent is clear - no one ever , ever wrote " creat ( ) ; write ( ) ; close ( ) ; rename ( ) ; " and hoped they would get an empty file if the system crashed during the next 5 minutes .
That 's what truncate ( ) is for .
A generalized " O_PONIES do - what - I - want " flag is indeed not possible , but in this case , it is to the file systems developers ' benefit to extend the semantics of rename ( ) to imply ordering so that we reduce the number of fsync ( ) calls we have to cope with .
( And , I have to note , I did have a real , live pony when I was a kid , so I tend to be on the side of giving programmers ponies when they ask for them . )
My opinion is that POSIX and most other useful standards are helpful clarifications of existing practice , but are not sufficient when we encounter surprising new circumstances .
We criticize applications developers for using folk - programming practices ( " It seems to work ! " ) and coming to rely on file system - specific side effects , but the bare POSIX specification is clearly insufficient to define useful system behavior .
In cases where programmer intent is unambiguous , we should do the right thing , and put the new behavior on the list for the next standards session .
U.S. Defense Department Cozies Up to Open Source
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 27 , 2009
Yesterday we covered the news of the U.S. government showing a little more love to open source by relaunching Whitehouse.gov as a Drupal site .
The move came after recent clamoring for the Obama administration to more aggressively pursue open source initiatives .
Now , as matt Asay notes , the U.S. Defense Department has issued new guidelines regarding open source adoption .
From the Defense Department 's guidance document :
" To effectively achieve its missions , the Department of Defense must develop and update its software - based capabilities faster than ever , to anticipate new threats and respond to continuously changing requirements .
The use of Open Source Software ( OSS ) can provide advantages in this regard . "
You can find the entire guidance document here .
In it , there are many indications that the Defense Department likes the idea of " peer review " of code from a reliability and security standpoint .
The advantage of " many eyeballs " that open source has from this perspective is often cited .
With several examples of open source initiatives cropping up , it looks like some of the promises the Obama administration made about FOSS are starting to translate into actions .
Let 's hope for more .

Oct. 30 , 2009  -- A Washington , D.C. , television station 's decision to air stories featuring partially - nude women doing breast self - exams stemmed in part from a breast cancer awareness effort , but critics say the reports ' airing during a key ratings period suggests the station was exploiting women for gain .
On Thursday WJLA -- an ABC News affiliate -- aired the first in a series of reports aimed at increasing breast cancer awareness and teaching women the proper way to perform breast self - exams .
The move has been met with criticism from people who believe it 's inappropriate to show women 's bodies during the 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. news .
" We do n't think we 're going too far , " WJLA reporter Julie Parker told " Good Morning America " co-anchor Robin Roberts today .
" We are proud of what we have done .
There 's nothing sexy about this .
It 's a breast self - exam . "
" We decided that we were going to do this very tastefully , very clinically , " explained WJLA reporter Gail Pennybacker .
" Everything is instructional , and as you see from the reports , you see the details that you need to have to build those skills ... to do the exam . "
Report Panned , Praised
News reports like WJLA 's are exempt from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission 's indecency rules , but some say the segments are exploitative .
" It could be done on a model or mannequin .
It can be done through diagrams . …
This is exploiting women in order to exploit the audience , " said Wendy Wright of Concerned Women for America , a conservative group that promotes biblical values .
" It 's pretty clear that there 's one point in doing this , and that is to try and increase their ratings . "
Others say the series does the public a great service .
" While some may find this actual demonstration intrusive , others may view it as instructive and motivating , " Susan Brown , the director of health education at the Susan G. Komen for the Cure , told " GMA " in a statement .
" Providing these clear - cut instructions , along with more information about breast self - awareness , can also help a woman later during a more private time when she 's better able to focus . "
Breast Self - Exams Cause Controversy
Whether on television or not , breast self - exams are a source of controversy within the medical community .
Studies in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , and 2007 findings in the highly regarded Cochrane Collaboration , have found that breast self - exams may actually " harm " more than they help .
Compared with women who found their lumps by chance or through mammography , women who also performed breast self - exams were more likely to go through unneeded procedures , worry and tests for false positives , according to findings in the Cochrane Collaboration .
Breast self - exams in the studies also showed no added benefit to women in terms of overall health and eventual cancer treatment .
Even the American Cancer Society , which once pushed breast self - exams , now calls them only an " option " and states that the breast self - exam " plays a small role in finding breast cancer compared with finding a breast lump by chance or simply being aware of what is normal for each woman . "
On the other side of the debate are doctors who point out what they believe are the benefits of breast self - exams and the awareness the campaigns for the exams have raised .
And for women who have found a lump through self - exams , there is no debate .
Cancer patient Lauren Albright caught her breast cancer in time through self - examination and believes the way the message gets out is n't what matters if lives are saved .
" I know enough to save my own life , and that was very important to me , " said Albright , who is one of the women included in the reports .
In the report that aired Thursday , the 28 - year - old Albright is shown with her shirt open and arms raised .
She uses the pads of her fingers to feel each breast carefully , going in a circular motion .
Pennybacker said t it was n't difficult for the station to find participants for the reports .
" To find somebody was not a problem at all , " she said , " because they understood to instruct someone on a breast self - exam , they need to see the breast . "
Reporters Say ' Breast Cancer Touches Everyone '
The fact that the series started to air on the first day of the " sweeps " period -- when ratings are all - important -- is not lost on critics like Wright .
But Bill Lord , the station 's general manager , said there was a bigger purpose .
" The doctors we have talked to and the experts we have talked to say to really learn this correctly , you need to actually see them , " Lord told " Good Morning America . "
" This is not something we have devised for our own purposes .
It really is responding to professionals . "
In an interview with The Washington Post Thursday , Lord said he was n't bothered by the timing of the reports .
" Yes , this is an attention - getting story , but it 's also an important story , " he told the Post .
Pennybacker said that viewer reaction to the reports has been positive .
" We have had overwhelming support , " she said .
" From men , from women , people are very happy about how this was handled . "
Roberts , whose own breast cancer was diagnosed through a self - exam , asked what inspired the two reporters to participate in the series .
" [ Breast cancer ] touches every single person , " Parker said .
" We hope that that 's not the case moving forward . "

Melinda wrote a while ago about negative media representation of Latina Muslim women .
She described a lot of the common one - dimensional assumptions attributed to Latina women who become Muslim , such as the idea that :
in Latino culture , men are macho jerks and women are sex objects .
In Islam , they are covered up and immediately respected .
The author retells the woman ’s decision to leave Catholicism for Islam , her experience putting on hijab , and the sad reactions of her family .
If the journalist tries to dig a little deeper , there may be some theological reasons for choosing Islam , but they ’re usually an afterthought .
Some articles will note that Latina women like the strict gender roles of Islam because that ’s what they ’re used to .
Latina women and Latino culture in are often reduced to only the most simplistic stereotypes , and Islam being reduced to a similarly simplistic solution to Latina women ’s problems .
A recent article in the Brooklyn Rail about Latina / Latino Muslims presents a much more nuanced picture of the members of one Union City , New Jersey mosque with a growing Muslim population .
Although focused on the Latino Muslim community at large and not specifically on the women , the article does give us glimpses of the lives of a few Latina Muslim women , and some of their experiences with juggling those identities in the United States .
The first mention of Muslim women does involve the word “ hijab , ” which is no big surprise , and the first detailed description of a Muslim woman also focuses heavily on clothing :
Before Fatimah Vargas discovered Islam in the years before 9/11 she said she “ did not know the difference between a Muslim and a Hindu . ”
Born into a Dominican family in New Jersey with the name Marleny , Vargas was a single mother by the time she turned 18 .
A group of former Pakistani co-workers provided her first exposure to Islam .
“ Their character amazed me , ” she recalls , because they did not look at the scantily clad women going to the beach during the hot New York summers .
Eventually she checked out a copy of the Qur’an at the public library and read it in secret in the middle of the night .
When she read the first few lines she said she knew immediately , “ This is it . ”
When she told her brother , “ He was very upset , ” she said .
Her mother noticed a change in her daughter when Vargas started dressing more conservatively but did not initially understand why .
“ I used to dress very inappropriate — to say the least , ” Vargas said .
These days she conceals her hair behind a hijab and the only skin she shows is her delicate hands and face .
Eventually she told her parents about her conversion .
“ That was horrible , ” she remembers .
Her parents had preconceived misconceptions about Islam and her mother warned that if she converted she would become a terrorist and marry Osama bin Laden .
“ I could n’t hurt a roach , how could I kill a human ? ” Vargas protested .
When she married her husband , a Puerto Rican Muslim , she did not get her parents ’ approval . [ … ]
When September 11 occurred , Vargas knew that it would n’t help others accept her new religion .
She struggled to convince others that being Muslim was something very different than being a terrorist .
These days , her parents have accepted her choice to be Muslim , which she thinks is the best thing that could have ever happened .
They are actively involved in her life now , as she and her husband rear their three children , ages 9 , 8 , and 4 , as Muslims .
Later profiles of women , however , go into more detail about other elements of their lives .
Faiza Ocasio is a Latina woman who became Muslim and whose children and grandchildren have been raised with strong ties to their Puerto Rican cultural heritage and to their Islamic faith .
The article goes into more detail about Ocasio ’s daughter , Sultana , who was raised Muslim :
Many of Sultana ’s childhood classmates and friends called their dads “ abby , ” a slang term for father in Arabic .
One time she tried calling her father this .
“ You call me papi , ” he shot back , reminding Sultana that his family did not need to change who they were as Puerto Ricans because they were Muslim too .
Though Sultana felt different from her black counterparts in grammar school , she encountered a whole new sense of not belonging when she joined the Muslim Student Association at Baruch College , from which she graduated with a degree in political science and sociology in 2008 .
There she went through a culture shock interacting directly with Arab and Pakistani classmates who were often more reserved than her “ more colorful ” Latino friends .
Many of her peers assumed she was Egyptian “ until I opened my mouth , ” she said .
She had to adjust once more to being a minority within a minority . [ … ]
Many West Africans “ transform ” themselves , Sultana said , to symbolize their adherence to the faith , dressing in traditional Arabic dress .
They ’re adopting cultural traits , not religious ones though , Sultana pointed out .
It is important to her family to separate religion from culture .
They do not need to be one and the same .
“ Being Puerto Rican is important to me , but not as important as being Muslim , ” Sultana said .
Today Sultana works in the Bronx for the Muslim Women ’s Institute for Research and Development , coordinating ESL classes .
The Institute also runs a halal food pantry open to the entire community , in addition to many other services .
Working in social services runs in the family .
Her mother used to be a social worker in the Islamic Family Services before she became a teacher .
Sultana also has experienced bewilderment from non-Muslim Latinos about her religion .
When some Puerto Rican immigrants find out that Sultana is both Puerto Rican and Muslim , they ask her , “ Why in the world are you Muslim ? ” she said .
They find her choice radical , but she tells them , “ I like this — this is something I feel is right . ”
I liked this description of some of the many ways that Sultana does and does n’t identify with both her religious and cultural communities .
Unlike the kinds of stories mentioned in Melinda ’s piece that I linked to at the beginning of this post , Sultana Ocasio ’s experiences suggest that , rather than swooping in and saving Latina women from the oppressive elements of their culture , Islam can exist alongside a vibrant Latino culture , and that even when negotiating the two identities can be complicated at times , neither one replaces or cancels out the other .
