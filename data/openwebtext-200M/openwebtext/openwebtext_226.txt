Before they chartered planes and opened teeming offices in Des Moines or Manchester , even before they announced their lofty ambitions to the world , the current field of presidential candidates set about absorbing the lessons of Howard Dean ’s 2004 campaign .
Dean lost , of course , and in a fairly ignominious way , but his campaign was the first to harness the fund - raising and organizing power of the Internet , and both parties ’ 2008 hopefuls had visions of replicating his model  minus the meltdown .
One of the first things they did was to sign on a new class of online organizers and fund - raisers .
The Web was the new frontier of American politics , and the candidates intended to exploit it .
Now , as we come to the end of a tumultuous political year , it seems clear that the candidates and their advisers absorbed the wrong lessons from Dean ’s moment , or at least they failed to grasp an essential truth of it , which is that these things can’t really be orchestrated .
Dean ’s campaign did n’t explode online because he somehow figured out a way to channel online politics ; he managed this feat because his campaign , almost by accident , became channeled by people he had never met .
Dean for America was branded from its core antiwar message down to the design of some of its bumper stickers and buttons by laptop - laden volunteers , and these strangers , it could be argued , both made and unmade the candidate .
In the new and evolving online world , the greatest momentum goes not to the candidate with the most detailed plan for conquering the Web but to the candidate who surrenders his own image to the clicking masses , the same way a rock guitarist might fall backward off the stage into the hands of an adoring crowd .
How else to explain the notable online surge of support for Ron Paul , the onetime standard - bearer of the Libertarian Party ?
Unlike his main opponents , Paul himself did n’t have the resources to build a sophisticated Web campaign , but antiwar and antispending Republicans were happy to do it for him .
Last month , Paul supporters who had nothing to do with the campaign organized an online fund - raiser on Guy Fawkes Day , a British holiday named for the rebel who tried to assassinate King James I . Paul ’s stunned campaign brought in more than $ 4 million and 21,000 new contributors in a single day  the largest 24 - hour haul of any Republican candidate to date .

Meanwhile , those candidates who have amassed roomfuls of well - paid online experts have frequently found themselves buffeted or embarrassed ( or sometimes both at once ) by mysterious forces outside their grasp .
Take , for instance , the much - forwarded “ Obama Girl ” music video , written by a 21 - year - old undergraduate at Temple University .
( “ Universal healthcare reform / It makes me warm , ” mouths the model in the video . )
Fairly or not , that video probably had more to do with shaping Obama ’s complicated public image  young and exciting but maybe a bit shallow  than any Internet appeal devised by the candidate ’s own aides .
This week and next the Senate is considering amendments to the FY 2008 authorization for the Pentagon , an authorization that includes more money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Some of the proposed amendments would try to force the Bush Administration to end the Iraq war .
A few more Senate Republicans have rhetorically broken ranks with the Administration , and the question of the hour is whether they will put their votes where their mouths are and vote for a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops or other measures that would force the Administration to move towards ending the war .
This week , the Congressional Research Service put the financial cost of the war in Iraq at $ 10 billion a month .
The New York Times editorialized that " It is time for the United States to leave Iraq , without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organize an orderly exit . "
A key question is missing from this debate .
How many Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion ?
The New York Times editorial is silent on this matter .
In a scientific study published last fall in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet , researchers from Johns Hopkins estimated that 650,000 Iraqis had died because of our government 's invasion of their country .
The survey that produced that estimate was completed in July , 2006 .
That was a year ago .
Unfortunately , despite the calls of the Lancet authors for other studies , there has been no systematic effort to update these results .

Just Foreign Policy has attempted to update the Lancet estimate in the best way we know .
We have extrapolated from the Lancet estimate , using the trend provided by the tally of Iraqi deaths reported in Western media compiled by Iraq Body Count .
Our current estimate is that 974,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion .
The web counter and fuller explanation are here .
The Iraqi death toll resulting from the U.S. invasion is a key fact .
We cannot make intelligent and moral choices about U.S. foreign policy while ignoring such a key fact .
It has implications for our choices in Iraq , for our choices in dealing with Iran , for our choices about the size of the U.S. military ( for why do our leaders want to expand the U.S. military , except to have the capacity to invade other countries ? )
The exact toll will never be known .
But this is no reason not to attempt to know what the best estimate is .
We also do n't know many other key facts with certainty .
We do n't know how many people live in the U.S.
The census department creates an estimate , and this estimate is the basis of policy .
The Johns Hopkins researchers used the methods accepted all over the world to estimate deaths in the wake of war and natural disasters .
The United Nations , for example , uses them to plan famine relief .
Even the Bush administration relies on them when it accuses Sudan of genocide in Darfur .
At present , this represents the best information we have .
As Congress considers legislative efforts to end the war , best estimates of the Iraqi death toll must be part of the debate .

As we age , it becomes harder and harder to recall names , dates — even where we put down our keys .
Although we may fear the onset of Alzheimer 's , chances are , our recollective powers have dulled simply because we 're getting older — and our brains , like our bodies , are no longer in tip - top shape .
But what is it that actually causes memory and other cognitive abilities to go soft with senescence ?
Previous research has shown that bundles of axons ( tubular projections sent out by neurons to signal other nerve cells ) wither over time .
These conduits , collectively referred to as white matter , help connect different regions of the brain to allow for proper information processing .
Now , researchers have found that these white matter pathways erode as we age , impairing communication or " cross talk ' ' between different brain areas .
" What we were looking at was the communication or cross talk between different regions of the brain , " says study co-author Jessica Andrews - Hanna , a Harvard University graduate student .
" The degree to which white matter regions are actually stable predicts the degree to which other regions are able to communicate with each other . "
Andrews - Hanna and other Harvard researchers ( along with collaborators at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Washington University in St. Louis ) concluded that white matter naturally degrades as we age — causing disrupted communication between brain regions and memory deficits — after conducting a battery of cognitive tests and brain scans on 93 healthy volunteers , ages 18 to 93 .
Participants fell into two age groups : one 18 to 34 and the other 60 to 93 years of age .
Scientists asked study subjects to perform several cognitive and memory exercises , such as determining whether certain words referred to living or nonliving objects .
As they answered , researchers monitored activity in the fronts and backs of their brains with functional imaging magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to determine whether those areas were operating in sync .
The results , published in Neuron : communication between brain regions appeared to have " dramatically declined " in the older group .
They fingered the potential reason for the dip by doing further brain scans using diffusion tensor imaging , an MRI technique that gauges how well white matter is functioning by monitoring water movement along the axonal bundles .
If communication is strong , water flows as if cascading down a celery stalk , says Randy Buckner , a cognitive neuroscientist at Harvard ; if it is disrupted , the pattern looks more like a drop of dye in a water bucket that has scattered in all directions .
The latter was more evident in the older group , an indication that their white matter had lost some of its integrity .
The older crowd 's performance on memory and cognitive skill tests correlated with white matter loss :
The seniors did poorly relative to their younger peers .
The researchers note that the white matter appears to fray more over time in the forebrain than in the brain 's rear .
They speculate that age - related depletion of neurotransmitters ( the chemical signals sent between neurons ) as well as the shrinking of gray matter ( the tissue made up of the actual nerve cell bodies and supporting cells ) also contribute to dimming memory and cognitive skills .
Buckner says that the team now plans to examine how aging affects white matter as well as gray matter and neurotransmitters .
" We want to know , " he says , " is this an important factor in why some people age gracefully and others age less gracefully ? "
Oversight Committee calls up Rumsfeld for hearing on Tillman death
Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced Monday morning that it has invited former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other ex-Bush military officials to testify on the friendly fire death of former professional football player and Army Corporal Pat Tillman .
" On Wednesday , August 1 , 2007 ... the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will hold a hearing entitled ' The Tillman Fratricide : What the Leadership of the Defense Department Knew , ' " stated a press release from the Committee of Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
" The hearing will examine what senior Defense Department officials knew about U.S. Army Corporal Patrick Tillman 's death by fratricide . "
In addition to Rumsfeld , the Committee has invited General Richard Myers ( Ret. ) , former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , former Central Command head Gen. John Abizaid ( Ret. ) , and three officers from the US Special Operations Command .
Last Friday , Waxman announced that the White House was asserting executive privilege on its internal communications over Tillman 's death .
In their letter last week , Rep. Waxman with Tom Davis ( R - VA ) , the Ranking Republican on Committee , chided Secretary of Defense Robert Gates for not turning over documents indicating how Rumsfeld and other Pentagon staff were informed of Corporal Tillman 's death .
" There are no documents showing how the Secretary was informed that Corporal Tillman was killed by his own unit , and there are no documents indicating when this information was provided to him , whether on May 20,2004 , or any other date , " they wrote .
It was not clear whether the White House 's assertion of executive privilege relating to Waxman and Davis 's request would also apply to internal Department of Defense communications pertaining to the circumstances of Tillman 's death .
Race and IQ
The Theory of Innate Differences
Ceci and Flynn , while expressing their skepticism about the possibility of genetic differences between the races for IQ , agree that the question is a legitimate matter for scientific inquiry , to be settled by cool - headed evaluation of the empirical evidence .
I disagree .
I contend that :
The important questions about the role of genetics in the explanation of racial differences in ability are not empirical , but theoretical and philosophical , and , When the theoretical questions are properly understood , proponents of race science , while entitled to their freedom of inquiry and expression , deserve the vigorous disapprobation they often receive .
To understand the theoretical conundrums underlying this race question , the hypothesis must be stated plainly : Genetic differences between groups of people produce innate differences in their cognitive abilities .
The key is the word , “ innate . ”
What exactly it means for a characteristic to be innate is one of the great questions in the philosophy of biology , and like most great philosophical questions it gets deeper and more puzzling the longer you think about it .
Our initial intuition is that something that is innate just happens as a matter of biological development , regardless of environmental inputs .
Dogs have an innate tendency to bark ; ducks quack .
But the intuitive view turns out to be incoherent on more than superficial examination .
A point of view that is sometimes called developmentalism points out that absolutely no aspect of biology or genetics comes into being automatically without rich interaction with the environment .
Ducks raised in the complete absence of auditory input from other ducks do n’t quack , and in general organisms raised in the absence of environmental inputs do n’t do anything at all .
So the difference between learning to play the oboe and learning to walk is not that the former requires environmental input while the other does not , being in principle innate .
They both emerge from a complex interplay of genetics and environment , and thinking of walking as innate is a distraction from the real scientific question of how the extraordinarily complex process actually comes about .
Once you start to think this way , it gets difficult to say that any difference between two organisms is innate .
The contention about Africans and IQ has to be that their genetic makeup is such that they will be lower than other races in IQ not only in the current environment , but in all imaginable alternative environments , and how could we possibly know that ?
The developmentalist argument , however , is susceptible to a reductio ad absurdum .
If taken too literally , it could lead you to conclude that there is nothing to be said about biological differences between organisms .
You could n’t say that people are more intelligent than turtles , or that Africans have darker skin than Scandinavians , because it is always possible in principle to imagine an environment where that is n’t the case .
And there is a difference between learning to play to oboe and learning to walk :
Walking may depend in complex ways on environmental input , but it nevertheless develops in a very wide range of environments , whereas oboe playing requires a very specific environment to develop .
Geneticists have come up with the concept of a reaction norm to describe the range of environments in which a genetic trait might develop .
Under this view , characteristics of organisms are not either innate or learned : they vary in the width of the reaction norm describing the kind of environmental inputs they require .
Under this view , the race and IQ question comes down to the question of whether African IQ deficits are like dark African skin , so pervasive across all imaginable environments that calling them innate is perfectly reasonable as a first approximation , or more like African - American success in popular music , for which we require no scientific evidence to attribute to the particular combination of history , culture and sociology of the present time .
We are justifiably offended by a hypotheses involving , say , an innate gift of rhythm .
Why Race Science is Objectionable
If I may address my fellow Jews for a moment , consider this .
How would you feel about a line of research into the question of whether Jews have a genetic tendency to be more concerned with money than other groups ?
Nothing anti-semitic , mind you , just a rational investigation of the scientific evidence .
It would n’t be difficult to measure interest in money and materialism , and it would n’t surprise me if as an empirical matter Jews scored a little higher on the resulting test than other groups .
As a behavioral geneticist I can assure you without reservation that the trait would be heritable , and , if anyone bothered to take the time to find out , specific genes would have small associations with it .
Of course , this research program has already been carried out , at least to the extent the relevant technology was available in 1939 .
While we are at it we could open a whole scientific institute for the scientific study of racial stereotypes , and finally pull together the evidence on sneaky Japanese , drunken Irish , unintelligent Poles , overemotional women and lazy Italians .
Hopefully I am beginning to offend you .
Why ?
Why do n’t we accept racial stereotypes as reasonable hypotheses , okay to consider until they have been scientifically proven false ?
They are offensive precisely because they violate our intuition about the balance between innateness and self - determination of the moral and cultural qualities of human beings .
No reasonable person would be offended by the observation that African people have curlier hair than the Chinese , notwithstanding the possibility of some future environment in which it is no longer true .
But we can recognize a contention that Chinese people are genetically predisposed to be better table tennis players than Africans as silly , and the contention that they are smarter than Africans as ugly , because it is a matter of ethical principle that individual and cultural accomplishment is not tied to the genes in the same way as the appearance of our hair .
If the question of African IQ is a matter of empirical science , exactly what piece of evidence are we waiting for ?
What would finally convince the racialists that they are wrong ?
Nothing , it seems to me , except the arrival of the day when the IQ gap disappears , and that is going to take a while .
The history of Africans in the modern
West is roughly as follows : Millennia of minding their own business in Africa , followed by 200 years of enslavement by a foreign civilization , followed by 100 years of Jim Crow oppression , followed by fifty years of very incomplete equality and freedom .
And now the scientific establishment , apparently even the progressive scientific establishment , is impatient enough with Africans ’ social development that it seems reasonable to ask whether the problem is in the descendants of our former slaves ’ genes .
If that is n’t offensive I do n’t know what is .
Having said that I should add that I believe absolutely in freedom of expression and inquiry everywhere , but especially in academia .
The racialists are entitled to their tenure and their speaking engagements and their promotions , but they are not entitled to my encouragement or respect .
I will close with a word on Watson .
He is not really a racial scientist to any significant degree , he just expressed a point of view that I think is false and destructive .
No one deserves to be punished for expressing a point of view , but there is another consideration here .
Watson is a legitimately respected and famous person on the basis of his great scientific accomplishments and the awards they have won for him , but those accomplishments do n’t have very much to do with racial differences in intelligence , except that both domains involve the concept of “ genes ” in a very general way .
It is safe to say that he does not know anything more about the subject than anyone writing here .
He is , of course , still entitled to his opinion , but famous scientists and intellectuals have some responsibility not to use their fame in the service of dangerous ideas that are ultimately outside their real expertise .
Watson got in trouble for casually stating poorly informed opinions about a deeply serious subject .
He is still the great scientist he always was , and I admired the apparent sincerity of his apology , but he deserved most of the criticism he got .
Dr. John Brignell , a British engineering professor , runs a website called numberwatch
.
He has compiled what has to be the most complete collection of links to media stories ascribing the cause of everything under the sun to global warming .
He has already posted more than six - hundred links .
The site 's stated mission is to expose all the " scares , scams , junk , panics and flummery cooked up by the media , politicians , bureaucrats and so - called scientists and others that try to confuse the public with wrong numbers " Professor Brignell 's motto is " Working to Combat Math Hysteria . "
This exercise is not merely a lark to show the abject absurdity of this global warming nonsense .
Brignell wrote a great book titled Sorry Wrong Number , The Abuse of Measurement on this very subject .
Mr. Nasir said that since losing his engineering job about five years ago , he had been trading semiprecious stones , which has taken takes him around Europe and to the tribal areas of Pakistan , where he said he looked for bargains .
The German authorities see his trips there differently .
An Aug. 1 , German court order authorizing a police search , citing information from the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence agency , or ISI , said there was sufficient evidence that he supported Al Qaeda “ by the financial payments , by the recruitment of fighters , by the handing over of field glasses and night - vision glasses , as well as by the idea of fighting for Al Qaeda by himself . ”
Mr. Nasir was detained as he prepared to fly home from Lahore , Pakistan , on June 18 , after having spent 10 days in the tribal areas .
“ We know you were there , ” Mr. Nasir said he was told the first day by a Pakistani intelligence officer .
“ We know everything about you . ”
The agents even knew he had brought a pair of $ 180 night - vision goggles into the country .
He said he had an explanation : he brought them for a friend in the tribal area of North Waziristan who has many sheep , goats and cows .
“ He was having with him a very bad instrument , you know , to watch the animals and so I said , ‘ If you want , I can bring you some better , ’ ” Mr. Nasir said .
Then Western intelligence agents , who he said he believes were American and British , took over the questioning , he said , and pressed him to divulge all that he knew about militant plots .
“ ‘ Are you planning any attacks in the United States ? ’ ” he said they asked .
“ ‘ Are you familiar with American military installations in Japan and South Korea ?
How were you going to use the bomb - making chemicals that were found in your house ? ’ ” He said he used the chemicals to clean gems .
In daily sessions lasting as long as seven hours , he said , Western officials questioned him , while a Pakistani interrogator sat off to the side , sometimes sleeping .
“ The Americans are very intelligent , ” he said .
“ They let you speak , and do n’t tell you anything .
Only the Pakistanis were crude , saying things like , ‘ Do you make bombs ? ’ ”
Some of the questions were focused on his travels to Pakistan ’s tribal areas , particularly South Waziristan and North Waziristan , he said , and they asked about a man named Sheik Said , whom they identified as the No. 3 leader in the training camps , and about whether he visited the compound run by a man named Abu Ubayda al - Missri , who has been identified as a camp leader .
They asked how he communicated with his family in Germany .
“ They said there are Internet cafes , and asked why I did n’t send e-mails from them , ” he said .
The government yesterday announced plans for a new programme of research which could save more than 100,000 animals from use in scientific experiments .
In total , £ 2.4 m will be spent on the projects .
They include developing lab - based models of human cells to study diabetes and lung disease and techniques to improve the welfare of frogs used in experiments .
According to the Home Office , 3.1 m procedures were carried out on animals in 2006 , a 15 - year high that makes Britain the most active country in Europe for animal experiments .
Procedures involving mice , rats and other rodents accounted for 83 % of experiments .
Experiments on cats , dogs , horses and non-human primates were less than 1 % of all procedures .
The 11 new projects are part of a wider strategy to replace , reduce and refine - known as the 3Rs - the use of animals in research .
Launching the projects , science minister Ian Pearson said research using animals was a " small , but unfortunately still necessary " part of the process of scientific discovery .
" Applying the 3Rs is central to carrying out this research as ethically and humanely as possible , something that opinion polls have consistently shown is important in maintaining public support for work involving animals . "
He added : " Nobody else in the world is funding research to the level we are when it comes to alternatives to animals [ but ]
I do have sympathy with the view that we ought to be doing more in this area . "
The National Centre for the Replacement , Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research ( NC3Rs ) was set up by the government in 2004 in response to a House of Lords select committee report on the use of animals in scientific procedures which encouraged more work to find ways of reducing animal use in experiments .
Chief executive Vicky Robinson said the current focus of the agency was twofold : tissue engineering research to build better models of animals and refining those experiments that fall under the Home Office 's category of substantial severity .
" This is the highest level of suffering legally allowed in the UK ... and involves research into such things as modelling Parkinson 's disease , developing anti-microbial agents and vaccines , major surgical interventions , and toxicity studies where the death of the animal is required .
In 2005 approximately 50 licences , 2 % of the total number of licences , involved substantial severity .
Trying to reduce the suffering of animals involved in this type of research is clearly important . "
Earlier this year the government was accused of downplaying the suffering of some animals used in experiments .
A high court judge ruled that , in categorising experiments at Cambridge University on marmosets in 2000 and 2001 , the then home secretary had acted unlawfully when he licensed brain experiments as causing " moderate " rather than " substantial " suffering .
The Home Office has said it is in the process of reviewing the procedures for categorising animal suffering in experiments .
Among the NC3Rs projects funded is £ 300,000 to a team led by Jamie Davies at the University of Edinburgh to reduce animal use in growing kidney tissue .
Scientists can already grow mouse kidneys in the lab by extracting particular cells from embryos , but the procedure involves killing the pregnant mouse .
Professor Davies intends to develop the technique so that the organs can be grown in culture , reducing the need for embryonic cells .
He added that , if successful , the technique could be extended to people .
" If we can find cells that can build kidneys in mice , then we ought to , with ethically obtained human material , do the same thing - that 's the distant vision . "
Dr Robinson said the work would replace some of the 15,000 animals used in studies of kidney regeneration and transplantation each year .
She added that more work was planned to reduce animal use in experiments .
" We 'll also be shortly announcing a project which we have been working with the European pharmaceutical industry on to reduce the number of animals used in the acute toxicity tests which involve the death of the animals , " she said .
Most first - class ( consultants & employees ) and second - class ( contractors ) programmers do n’t realize that there ’s an entire class of programmers below them .
These programmers – the third - class programmers – work in Developer Purgatory with far less responsibilities , no latitude to make any decision at any level , and always get assigned the “ dirty work . ”
In fact , some even consider it an act of charity to call these poor folks “ programmers ” at all .
Most third - class programmers are third - class for a reason .
There is simply no way they could ever get a job anywhere else .
Occasionally , recent graduates get sucked in to Developer Purgatory by the allure of a “ real programming job , ” never realizing the stigma that goes along with it .
Andrew is one of these poor souls , desperately trying to get out .
And this is his diary .
May - 20 : First day on the job !
I guess the department is officially titled “ Internet Administration ” ( whatever that means ) , and has some fun people it .
Not at all what I expected from The Bank !
May - 22 : Met Diane today , she just started working on the “ Repo ” database project .
She said she ’ll definitely be asking for my help on it soon .
May - 23 : I met April today .
She seemed nice , though it was a bit odd that her entire desk was covered with Pokemon merchandise and stickers .
Her other passion , so she said , was playing First Person Shooter games online .
Other than that , it ’s been a slow first few days with nothing to do .
May - 24 : Met Steven today .
He ’s an ASP programmer for some internal sites .
Later in the afternoon , he stopped by cube , worried .
To quote : “ You 're going to have to help me on this , because I know absolutely nothing about ASP . ”
May - 27 : Diane said she might need some help on the “ Repo ” database .
She ’ll let me know .
I do n’t have anything else going on .
Jun -04 : Chatted with April ( Pokemon girl ) about Unreal Tournament .
She ’s in a “ clan . ”
It is her mission , apparently , to run out into the middle of an open area and get shot down so her teammates could spot the enemy .
Jun -18 : Don ( our manager ) got really peeved today .
We were playing foursquare between cubes again , and the ball bounced twice in his .
He should have been out , but he kept insisting that a desk - bounce does n’t count as a bounce .
Anyway , he stormed out of the office , saying he ’ll never play again , and went home early .
July - 08 : Diane asked if I had free time to help her on the “ Repo ” database .
I did , she said she ’ll let me know soon how I can help .
July - 18 : Steven was really late today .
Apparently , he was getting onto the train and his shoe got stuck in the door and left behind on the platform .
He had to go back and fetch it .
Aug - 20 : Diane asked , again , if could help her on the “ Repo ” database .
I said yes , again .
Aug - 26 : New guy , Colt , started today , transferred from Investment Banking .
He moved here because he felt he was stronger in this area .
Aug - 27 : Colt , as it turns out , has an unhealthy obsession with firearms .
Who keeps pictures of their guns in their wallet !?
Sep - 16 : Diane snapped at me today when I asked how she was doing .
To quote : “ I ’m too busy working on Repo to chit- chat ! ”
Sep - 17 : Diane apologized for yelling at me .
She ’s been under a lot of stress with Repo .
Oct -09 : Colt broke my keyboard today .
I complimented his new shoes .
“ Thanks , ” he replied .
And then , he proceeded to grab a nearby glass of water and tipped it over onto my desk .
This caused a large puddle of water that started dripping onto the keyboard .
He then lifted up one of his legs , and put his shoe on the desk , in the middle of the water .
He then grabbed his ankle , tugging at it , and said , “ good grip in the wet too . ”
And then he walked away .
Oct - 14 : Another new guy , David , started today .
He virtually wanted to move away from mainframes and basically move into web development .
He basically got a lot more money than I did because he 'd virtually been working at the bank longer .
Basically though , he was n't very good at web development .
Oh , and he virtually spoke like this all the time .
Oct - 22 : Finally got to see the “ Repo ” database .
It was literally three tables in an Access database and had a “ form wizard ” form called Form1 .
The form did n’t do anything .
This is what Diane has been working on for six months .
Nov -04 : Don asked me to review David ’s code , as it was his first coding on a full - color screen .
He had been working on a Budget Planner calculator that had lots of amounts the user could enter .
Food , electricity , gas , etc .
Next to each of these items was a drop down box with “ Weekly , ” “ Monthly , ” “ Annually . ”
Nov-05 : I took a look at David ’s code .
I suggested that , instead of having twenty odd “ Weekly , ” “ Monthly , ” “ Yearly ” options throughout the page , he should put them into an array and reference that .
He was happy to learn a better way of doing things .
Nov-08 : David showed me his revised code .
In the code now , there was not just one array , but about 20 arrays declared , each array containing “ Weekly , ” “ Monthly , ” and “ Yearly , ” with each drop down box pointing to a different array .
I told him he should just be using one array , as they are all the same .
Nov -13 : David let me know that he fixed the code again , so I took a look .
This is exactly what I found :
arrayOne = " Weekly " , " Monthly " , " Yearly " arrayTwo = array One arrayThree = arrayOne arrayFour = arrayOne ...
What Is Progress ?
The numbers show that this should be the real question at the Bali talks .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 4th December 2007
When you warn people about the dangers of climate change , they call you a saint .
When you explain what needs to be done to stop it , they call you a communist .
Let me show you why .
There is now a broad scientific consensus that we need to prevent temperatures from rising by more than 2 °C above their pre-industrial level .
Beyond that point , the Greenland ice sheet could go into irreversible meltdown , some ecosystems collapse , billions suffer from water stress , droughts could start to threaten global food supplies ( 1,2 ) .
The government proposes to cut the UK ’s carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050 .
This target is based on a report published in 2000 ( 3 ) .
That report was based on an assessment published in 1995 , which drew on scientific papers published a few years earlier .
The UK ’s policy , in other words , is based on papers some 15 years old .
Our target , which is one of the toughest on earth , bears no relation to current science .
Over the past fortnight , both Gordon Brown and his adviser Sir Nicholas Stern have proposed raising the cut to 80 % ( 4,5 ) .
Where did this figure come from ?
The last G8 summit adopted the aim of a global cut of 50 % by 2050 , which means that 80 % would be roughly the UK ’s fair share .
But the G8 ’s target is n’t based on current science either .
In the new summary published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , you will find a table which links different cuts to likely temperatures ( 6 ) .
To prevent global warming from eventually exceeding 2° , it suggests , by 2050 the world needs to cut its emissions to roughly 15 % of the volume in 2000 .
I looked up the global figures for carbon dioxide production in 2000 ( 7 ) and divided it by the current population ( 8 ) .
This gives a baseline figure of 3.58 tonnes of CO2 per person .
An 85 % cut means that ( if the population remains constant ) the global output per head should be reduced to 0.537t by 2050 .
The UK currently produces 9.6 tonnes per head and the US 23.6t ( 9,10 ) .
Reducing these figures to 0.537t means a 94.4 % cut in the UK and a 97.7 % cut in the US .
But the world population will rise in the same period .
If we assume a population of 9bn in 2050 ( 11 ) , the cuts rise to 95.9 % in the UK and 98.3 % in the US .
The IPCC figures might also be out of date .
In a footnote beneath the table , the panel admits that “ emission reductions … might be underestimated due to missing carbon cycle feedbacks ” .
What this means is that the impact of the biosphere ’s response to global warming has not been fully considered .
As seawater warms , for example , it releases carbon dioxide .
As soil bacteria heat up , they respire more , generating more CO2 .
As temperatures rise , tropical forests die back , releasing the carbon they contain .
These are examples of positive feedbacks .
A recent paper ( all the references are on my website ) estimates that feedbacks account for about 18 % of global warming ( 12 ) .
They are likely to intensify .
A paper in Geophysical Research Letters finds that even with a 90 % global cut by 2050 , the 2° threshold “ is eventually broken ” ( 13 ) .
To stabilise temperatures at 1.5° above the pre-industrial level requires a global cut of 100 % .
The diplomats who started talks in Bali yesterday should be discussing the complete decarbonisation of the global economy .
It is not impossible .
In a previous article I showed how by switching the whole economy over to the use of electricity and by deploying the latest thinking on regional supergrids , grid balancing and energy storage , you could run almost the entire energy system on renewable power ( 14 ) .
The major exception is flying ( do n’t expect to see battery - powered jetliners ) which suggests that we should be closing rather than opening runways .
This could account for around 90 % of the necessary cut .
Total decarbonisation demands that we go further .
Preventing 2° of warming means stripping carbon dioxide from the air .
The necessary technology already exists ( 15 ) : the challenge is making it efficient and cheap .
Last year Joshuah Stolaroff , who has written a PhD on the subject , sent me some provisional costings , of £ 256-458 per tonne of carbon ( 16,17 ) .
This makes the capture of CO2 from the air roughly three times as expensive as the British government ’s costings for building wind turbines , twice as expensive as nuclear power , slightly cheaper than tidal power and 8 times cheaper than rooftop solar panels in the UK ( 18 ) .
But I suspect his figures are too low , as they suggest this method is cheaper than catching CO2 from purpose - built power stations ( 19 ) , which cannot be true ( 20 ) .
The Kyoto Protocol , whose replacement the Bali meeting will discuss , has failed .
Since it was signed , there has been an acceleration in global emissions : the rate of CO2 production exceeds the IPCC ’s worst case and is now growing faster than at any time since the beginning of the industrial revolution ( 21 ) .
It ’s not just the Chinese .
A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that “ no region is decarbonizing its energy supply ” ( 22 ) .
Even the age - old trend of declining energy intensity as economies mature has gone into reverse ( 23 ) .
In the UK there is a stupefying gulf between the government ’s climate policy and the facts it is creating on the ground .
How will we achieve even a 60 % cut if we build new coal plants , new roads and a third runway at Heathrow ?
Underlying the immediate problem is a much greater one .
In a lecture to the Royal Academy of Engineering in May , Professor Rod Smith of Imperial College explained that a growth rate of 3 % means economic activity doubles in 23 years ( 24 ) .
At 10 % it takes just 7 years .
This we knew .
But Smith takes it further .
With a series of equations he shows that “ each successive doubling period consumes as much resource as all the previous doubling periods combined . ”
In other words , if our economy grows at 3 % between now and 2030 , we will consume in that period economic resources equivalent to all those we have consumed since humans first stood on two legs .
Then , between 2030 and 2053 , we must double our total consumption again .
Reading that paper I realised for the first time what we are up against .
But I am not advocating despair .
We must confront a challenge which is as great and as pressing as the rise of the Axis powers .
Had we thrown up our hands then , as many people are tempted to do today , you would be reading this paper in German .
Though the war often seemed impossible to win , when the political will was mobilised strange and implausible things began to happen .
The US economy was spun round on a dime in 1942 as civilian manufacturing was switched to military production ( 25 ) .
The state took on greater powers than it had exercised before .
Impossible policies suddenly became achievable .
The real issues in Bali are not technical or economic .
The crisis we face demands a profound philosophical discussion , a reappraisal of who we are and what progress means .
Debating these matters makes us neither saints nor communists ; it shows only that we have understood the science .

Galaxies have been seen colliding before , but this form of galactic violence is rarely witnessed by astronomers .
The jet could have a profound effect on any planets in the jet 's path and could also trigger a burst of star formation .
The findings are to be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
They were obtained using Nasa 's space - based Chandra X-ray Observatory , its Hubble Space Telescope , and Spitzer Space Telescope , as well as the Very Large Array ( VLA ) and Merlin radio telescopes on the ground .
It is like a black hole bully , punching the nose of a passing galaxy
Neil Tyson , Hayden Planetarium
Most , if not all , galaxies - including our own Milky Way - are thought to host supermassive black holes at their galactic centres .
A handful of these galaxies eject powerful jets from the vicinities of their black holes , and are known as radio galaxies - because jets are very " visible " at radio wavelengths .
The larger of the two galaxies in 3C321 - dubbed the " death star galaxy " by the astronomers - has a jet emanating from the vicinity of the black hole at its centre .
The unfortunate smaller galaxy has apparently swung into the jet 's line of fire .
Destructive force
A bright spot in some images shows where the jet has slammed into the side of the companion galaxy , dissipating some of its energy .
After striking it , the jet has become disrupted and deflected .
Jets can race out at close to the speed of light and can travel vast distances .
The jet in 3C321 was about 1,000 light - years across and might have travelled one or two million light - years from its origin .
The jet hits the galaxy at its edge
Enlarge Image
" This jet could be causing all sorts of problems for the smaller galaxy it is pummelling , " said Dan Evans , lead author from the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , US .
This type of event is rarely seen .
But astronomers Steve Croft and Wil van Breugel have observed a gas - rich jet setting off star birth in an arc of stars known as Minkowski's Object .
The combined effects of radiation and particles travelling at almost the speed of light could have disastrous consequences for the atmospheres of any Earth - like planets lying in the path of the jet .
Although we call it a death star galaxy , it might eventually be a source of new life in the more distant galaxy
Martin Hardcastle , University of Hertfordshire
Neil Tyson , director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York , commented : " Black holes are famous for wreaking havoc on their environment .
This particular black hole is disrupting its local region by dining on matter that wanders too close - which is the source of the energy for this jet .
" It also fires a jet out of the galaxy .
So it is like a black hole bully , punching the nose of a passing galaxy . "
Basic properties
" There are still basic unanswered questions about how these jets work , " said co-author Martin Hardcastle of the University of Hertfordshire , UK .
" We do n't know how exactly they 're generated close to the black hole , what they 're made of , how fast they 're going , or how they evolve with time .
So an object like 3C321 can act as an experiment which can give us an insight into the inner working of the jet . "
The effect of the jet on the companion galaxy is likely to be substantial , because the galaxies in 3C321 are extremely close to one another .
At only about 20,000 light - years apart , these galaxies lie approximately the same distance as the Earth is from the centre of the Milky Way .
It is possible that it would not all be bad news for the galaxy struck by the jet .
The massive influx of energy and radiation from the jet may induce the formation of large numbers of stars and planets once its initial wake of destruction is complete .
" Although we call it a death star galaxy , in the end it might be a source of new life in the more distant galaxy , " said Dr Hardcastle .
The images from the VLA and Chandra indicate that the jet started hitting the smaller galaxy just one million years prior to the light from the event arriving at Earth .
This is a blink of the eye in the lifetime of 3C321 , which marks it out as an important opportunity to study a rare astronomical phenomenon , say the astronomers .

You see , as the United States Bridge Federation ( USBF ) sees it , China is a country that does n’t like political dissent .
So American bridge players need to show respect for China ’s dictatorship , and China ’s need to enforce absolute rule in order to basically hold a billion - plus people prisoner , by making sure that our bridge players do n’t showcase any of those nasty American values like “ free speech ” while traveling in China .
USBF meet Yahoo .
Yahoo meet USBF .
In a nutshell , per one of my readers , “ at the recent world championship held in Shanghai , the women ’s team championship was won by a US team .
At the victory banquet , some members of the team held up a sign saying ‘ we did n’t vote for Bush . ’ “
Can anyone say Dixie Chicks ?
( More from the NYT . )
Well , the USBF , which is responsible for selecting teams for international competition , threw a conniption fit .
And I can understand why .
Yes , having a player invoke George Bush , pro or con , at an international event would give a non-partisan organization agita .
I get that .
Though the fact that the outburst happened in China certainly makes it more interesting , with China ’s record on free speech being , well , zilch .
But even that strikes me as ancillary to this debate , or , it would have been ancillary to the debate until the USBF printed a statement on its
Web site that basically says that the reason the outburst from the US team was bad is because China is a dictatorship and dictators do n’t like free speech .
That ’s seriously messed up .
Here ’s a snippet from the USBF ’s over - lawyerly statement about the incident :
Certain members of VCW [ the US team that spoke out ] have complained that the USBF apology to the WBF [ World Bridge Federation ] and the Chinese Contract Bridge Association for the VCW ’s conduct was unwarranted .
This reflects a complete disregard for the fact that the Chinese government , which does not exactly have a history of sympathetic views toward political dissent , provided the bulk of financial support for both the 2007 World Championship and the 2008 World Bridge Olympiad .
Woah , nelly !
It ’s one thing to say that as a non-partisan organization you really would prefer avoiding political protests , from the left or right , during international ( or even national events ) .
I ’m not sure that ’s okay , but I can understand the angst from the national organization .
But invoking China ’s history of suppressing political dissent as a reason why we too should stifle political dissent is absolutely sickening .
As an aside , I can understand why the American team made the point that they did n’t vote for Bush .
Anyone who travels regularly abroad knows that wearing your anti-Bushism on your sleeve is the next best thing to Kevlar in terms of self - preservation .
The world hates George Bush , they hate our government because of George Bush and the Republicans ( and the war and Gitmo and more ) , and they ’re not very happy with the fact that Americans voted twice for the idiot .
( Once , they can understand – mistakes happen – but twice ?
Second time you own him . )
I routinely let people know that I did n’t vote for Bush when I ’m abroad .
Why ?
Because the conversation routinely goes like this :
Them :
You speak great [ insert language here ] .
Me : Thank you .
Them :
But you ’re American ?
Me : Yes .
Them :
So where are you from in America ?
Me : Washington , DC .
Them : [ stone silence accompanied by cocked head and odd stare . ]
Me : I did n’t vote for Bush .
Them : [ Cold face melts to smile . ]
Ah… good !
[ Animated conversation continues , followed by new lifelong friendship . ]
The thing is , I ’m not kidding .
That ’s quite literally a conversation I ’ve had repeatedly , verbatim , with lots and lots and lots of foreigners .
I am sick and tired of getting disparaging silence every time I say I ’m from DC .
Foreigners just assume that we support this idiot , and they loathe him , and us by extension , if they assume we support him , us .
No more .
I get that politics stops at the border .
I get that we ’re supposed to rally around the flag when we ’re abroad .
But George Bush is n’t the flag .
George Bush burns the flag every time he opens his mouth or lifts his pen .
George Bush is an embarrassment to everything this country stands for , or stood for .
So the notion that we should refrain from criticizing Bush when abroad , especially because it might upset dictators , is , well , something I have a hard time accepting .
So I get why the national team felt the need to speak out .
It ’s high time more of us did .
Turmoil in Zimbabwe this week refocused the world 's attention on the 27 - year rule of President Robert Mugabe .
The world of blogging was no exception as the BBC News website discovered .
From Harare , Bev Clark writing on kubatanablogs offered an interesting analogy about the country 's situation .
No doubt the fall - out over this violence will last only a few days before the world neatly sweeps it under the carpet
The Bearded Man
" I 've been seeing Zimbabwe like a cake lately , " she wrote on the day opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai , arrested for attending a weekend rally , was taken to hospital after two days in police detention .
" Morgan Tsvangirai , Raymond Majongwe , Mike Davies , and Grace Kwinje ( etc ) are the candles burning big and bright .
The icing is made up of a small section of civic and political activists .
While the actual cake itself comprises the Zimbabwean people . "
That is not where it ends , the cake , it seems , has just been put in the oven .
" Until we , the Zimbabwean people , come to the party and support civic and political leaders working for change , not much will happen .
The cake has got to cook .
It 's got to get warm , and bake and maybe even burn , but it can't stay like it has been - unmovable .
" Because if it does , no matter how many Highfield rallies we have , and no matter how iconic Tsvangirai becomes , the struggle for freedom in Zimbabwe will remain lop - sided . "
The Bearded Man is also not convinced that this is the beginning of the end of Mr Mugabe 's rule , as some commentators would have it .
The only reason the British government is anti-Mugabe is they still consider Zimbabwe to be Rhodesia
Steph's Blog
He then goes on to echo a plea made by many Western governments to Zimbabwe 's immediate neighbours .
" Please would someone out there actually DO something about this Mugabe person ? "
' Cowardice '
Who exactly is being asked to do something ?
Well , South Africa - Zimbabwe 's powerful neighbour to the south - for a start .
" South Africa 's so called ' quiet diplomacy ' has achieved precisely nothing in Zimbabwe , " blogged Tony Sharp on The Waendel Journal .
Britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade Zimbabwe than it did Iraq
The Radical Soldier of Zimbabwe !
" Its call to Mugabe yesterday to respect the rights of citizens will change nothing .
Mugabe , like his ilk elsewhere in the world , recognises cowardice when he sees it and knows that talk is cheap . "
In a volatile situation where perceptions of events are so important , The Zimbabwe Pundit - subtitled " the world as seen through the eyes of a Zimbabwean " - seems to be losing patience with the opposition in the country .
" The media in Zimbabwe is owned and operated by the Mugabe regime .
So in Sunday 's aftermath Zimbabweans are being force fed a diet of MDC thuggery , non-attendance and opposition violence .
This makes me wonder when the pro-democracy movement will get its act together in terms of creating its own robust media and information response unit . "
Steph 's
Blog would beg to differ though - and sticks the boot into the BBC while she is at it , comparing a report on violence at an opposition rally on Sunday in state - owned The Herald newspaper with one of ours .
" The Herald is a Zimbabwean government - owned newspaper and the BBC is a British government - owned broadcaster .
The Herald 's version is pro-Mugabe and pro-police but at least it was there , the BBC was n't .
Its version is MDC propaganda , with a little bit of British imperialism chucked in , " she blogged .
" Morgan Tsvangirai is a Western - sponsored ' terrorist ' , he plotted in London to assassinate Mugabe and overthrow the elected government .
There is nothing democratic about the MDC .
The only reason the British government is anti-Mugabe is they still consider Zimbabwe to be Rhodesia . "
' Breached conditions '
The Radical Soldier of Zimbabwe ! , meanwhile , is having none of it and offers what could be a radical solution to challenges facing the country .
Laer blames China for the UN's weakness vis-a - vis Zimbabwe
" Europe intervened in the Balkans and the ' coalition of the willing ' did a job in Iraq , but nobody seems to care about Zimbabwe , " he lamented .
" Britain , in my view , has more legal grounds to invade Zimbabwe than it did Iraq .
Britain was the former colonial power in Rhodesia and negotiated the Lancaster House Agreement .
The agreement is actually worth reading .
It sets out the principles under which democratic Zimbabwe should have been governed , and was in fact governed for the first few years .
" Mugabe has clearly violated the agreement .
He has breached conditions including white representation in parliament [ NB this clause has expired ] , independence of the judiciary , citizenship and payment of pensions .
These should be sufficient grounds for Britain to demand change or otherwise invade .
Who knows ?
Maybe John Howard will even commit a couple of hundred Australian troops . "
Laer from Orange County California sees little chance of this happening though - mainly because of another world power .
" The big problem for me is that China does n't seem to care .
It will continue to block UN efforts to protect Zimbabweans from Mugabe , proving once again the powerlessness of the world body , " he blogged on Cheat Seeking Missiles .
So is there any hope at all ?
" From what I can see , the UN is frozen , the African Union is powerless to do anything , and the world just watches , " he said .
All in all , it had n’t been a good day .
Bad traffic , a malfunctioning computer , incompetent coworkers and a sore back all made me a seething cauldron of rage .
But more importantly for this story , it had been over forty - eight hours since I ’d last taken a dump .
I ’d tried to jumpstart the process , beginning my day with a bowl of bowel - cleansing fiber cereal , following it with six cups of coffee at work , and adding a bean - laden lunch at Taco Bell .
As I was returning home from work , my insides let me know with subtle rumbles and the emission of the occasional tiny fart that Big Things would be happening soon .
Alas , I had to stop at the mall to pick up an order .
I completed this task , and as I was walking past the stores on my way back to the car , I noticed a large sale sign proclaiming , “ Everything Must Go ! ”
This was prophetic , for my colon informed me with a sudden violent cramp and a wet , squeaky fart that everything was indeed about to go .
I hurried to the mall bathroom .
I surveyed the five stalls , which I have numbered 0 through 4 ( I write a lot of software ) for your convenience :
0.Occupied
1.Clean , but Bathroom Protocol forbids its use , as it ’s next to the occupied one .
2.Poo on seat .
3.Poo and toilet paper in bowl , unidentifiable liquid splattered on seat .
4.No toilet paper , no stall door , unidentifiable sticky object near base of toilet .
Clearly , it had to be Stall # 1 .
I trudged back , entered , dropped trou and sat down .
I ’m normally a fairly Shameful Shitter .
I was n’t happy about being next to the occupied stall , but Big Things were afoot .
I was just getting ready to bear down when all of a sudden the sweet sounds of Beethoven came from next door , followed by a fumbling , and then the sound of a voice answering the ringing phone .
As usual for a cell phone conversation , the voice was exactly 8 dB louder than it needed to be .
Out of Shameful habit , my sphincter slammed shut .
The inane conversation went on and on .
Mr. Shitter was blathering to Mrs. Shitter about the shitty day he had .
I sat there , cramping and miserable , waiting for him to finish .
As the loud conversation dragged on , I became angrier and angrier , thinking that I , too , had a crappy day , but I was too polite to yak about in public .
My bowels let me know in no uncertain terms that if I did n’t get crapping soon , my day would be getting even crappier .
Finally my anger reached a point that overcame Shamefulness .
I no longer cared .
I gripped the toilet paper holder in one hand , braced my other hand against the side of the stall , and pushed with all my might .
I was rewarded with a fart of colossal magnitude — a cross between the sound of someone ripping a very wet bed sheet in half and of plywood being torn off a wall .
The sound gradually transitioned into a heavily modulated low - RPM tone , not unlike someone firing up a Harley .
I managed to hit resonance frequency of the stall , and it shook gently .
Once my ass cheeks stopped flapping in the breeze , three things became apparent : ( 1 ) The next - door conversation had ceased ; ( 2 ) my colon ’s continued seizing indicated that there was more to come , and ( 3 ) the bathroom was now beset by a horrible , eldritch stench .
It was as if a gateway to Hell had been opened .
The foul miasma quickly made its way under the stall and began choking my poop -mate .
This initial “ herald ” fart had ended his conversation in mid-sentence .
“ Oh my God , ” I heard him utter , following it with the suppressed sounds of choking , and then , “ No , baby , that was n’t me ( cough , gag ) , you could hear that ( gag ) ? ? ”
Next door I could hear fumbling with the paper dispenser as he desperately tried to finish his task .
Little snatches of conversation made themselves heard over my anal symphony : “ Gotta go… horrible … throw up … in my mouth ….
not … make it … tell the kids … love them … oh God … ” followed by more sounds of suppressed gagging and retching .
Alas , it is evidently difficulty to hold one ’s phone and wipe one ’s bum at the same time .
Just as my high - pressure abuse of the toilet was winding down , I heard a plop and splash from next door , followed by a string of swear words and gags .
My poop - mate had dropped his phone into the toilet .
After a considerable amount of paperwork , I got up and surveyed the damage .
I felt bad for the janitor who’d be forced to deal with this , but I knew that flushing was not an option .
No toilet in the world could handle that unholy mess .
Flushing would only lead to a floor flooded with filth .
As I left , I glanced to the next - door stall .
Nothing remained in the bowl .
Had he flushed his phone , or had he plucked it out and left the bathroom with nasty unwashed hands ?
The world will never know .
I exited the bathroom , momentarily proud and Shameless , looking around for a face glaring at me .
But I saw no one .
I suspect that somehow my supernatural elimination has manged to transfer my Shamefulness to my anonymous poop -mate .
I think it ’ll be a long time before he can bring himself to poop in public — and I doubt he ’ll ever again answer his cell phone in the loo .
And this , my friends , is why you should never talk on your phone in the bathroom .
Dragonflies with hawk - sized wing spans and millipedes longer than a human leg lived more than 250 million years ago .
Scientists have long wondered why sci - fi bugs do n't exist today .
The reason has to do with a bottleneck that occurs in insects ' air pipes as they become humongous , new research shows .
In the Paleozoic Era , insects were able to overcome the bottleneck due to a high - oxygen atmosphere .
Unlike animals with backbones , like us , insects deliver oxygen to their tissues directly and bloodlessly through a network of dead - end tracheal tubes .
In bigger insects , this mode of oxygen transport becomes less efficient , but no one has been exactly sure why .
Alex Kaiser of Midwestern University and his colleagues at Argonne National Laboratory and Arizona State University delved deeper by shining X - rays on four living beetle species , ranging in body mass by a factor of 1,000 .
This allowed the team to measure the exact dimensions of the beetles ' tracheal tubes .
Kaiser found that bigger beetle species devote a larger portion of their bodies , proportionately , to airways than do smaller species .
And the air passageways that lead from the body core to the legs turn out to be bottlenecks that limit how much oxygen can be delivered to the extremities , Kaiser said .
The team also examined the passageways that lead from the body core to the head .
" We were surprised to find that the effect is most pronounced in the orifices leading to the legs , where more and more of the space is taken up by tracheal tubes in larger species , " he said .
Kaiser and Argonne biologist Jake Socha also used the results to predict the largest size of currently living beetles .
If data on the air passageways to the head were used as a limiting factor , they predicted a crazy - large , foot - long beetle , while the leg data predicted a beetle that matches the size of today 's largest living beetle , Titaneus giganteus .
The research is detailed in the Aug. 7 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" This study is the first step toward understanding what controls body size in insects , " Socha said .
" It 's the legs that count in the beetles studied here , but what matters for the hundreds of thousands of beetle species and millions of insect species overall is still an open question .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .

In a recent post on Framework design James Bennett describes as a fundamental dichotomy in framework design " full - stack " vs. " glue " .
In this case , Django ( which James works on ) as a full - stack framework , and TurboGears and Pylons as glue frameworks .
This is not a good way to describe the differences .
Both TurboGears and Pylons have glue .
They have taken existing components and put them together .
Both also include substantial work in the form of fully decoupled components -- components which were written for those frameworks but are not tied to the frameworks .
And TurboGears is a full - stack framework , providing a cohesive and complete story about how you create applications within its domain .
This does n't make TurboGears more or less glue than Pylons ; there is nothing exclusive about full - stack and glue .
There 's also awkward glue and easy glue .
This often has a lot to do with whether you are using the pieces as intended .
To extend the metaphor inappropriately , there are pre-measured pieces with pre-drilled holes , there are erector sets with a large number of holes , and there are piles raw wood .
Sometimes components are intended to go together just one way , and if you use them together that way then everything works great .
Sometimes there 's components meant to be used all sorts of ways , capable of being attached to any sort of system , but you have to figure out what you want .
Then there 's just raw code , recipes , all the hand - coded stuff .
The metaphor is horribly strained here , because most things are a bit of all of these .
At some point someone wrote some code by hand .
Usually there 's strongly opinioned and constrained interfaces which are still public , things that are entirely private and internal , and stuff which is explicitly built to be flexible , and all these parts coexist within the same package .
All of which to say , there 's many ways to look at program design .
There 's glue , there 's standards , there 's conventions , there 's community knowledge .
And there 's a lot of pieces , all of which have to fit together , and this is just as true in the small as in the large .
An example of what formal and explicit interfaces give you : right now both TurboGears and Pylons are in the process of changing their preferred templating languages ( TurboGears from Kid to Genshi , Pylons from Myghty to Mako ) .
The process for both is the same -- they both support the Buffet API for templating languages , and have supported alternate templating languages for a while now .
When someone decides to write a new templating language , they implement that API -- they do n't ask about design choices , they do n't have to worry that they 'll be accessing an API that is subject to change .
The new language can achieve some design maturity this way .
If a framework wants to change languages , they do n't have to force anyone -- each developer can choose to move slower or faster than the framework .
This also gives developers a way to do rewrites without causing breakage .
In the case of Myghty and Mako , Michael Bayer wrote both -- but because of loose coupling he did n't need to use his relation to Myghty to force his changes or cleanup into that existing project .
Forking makes rewrites easy -- but it only works when you build choice into your framework .
So instead of " full - stack " and " glue " frameworks , I would describe the difference as " coupled " and " decoupled " frameworks .
Decoupling is generally harder , and leaves more potential open loops , and can sometimes be misused to avoid making important decisions .
But it 's much easier to maintain and test , and this applies not just to individual projects but for the larger set of projects that makes up anything approaching " full - stack " .
Maybe it 's not entirely fair -- coupled and decoupled are not very neutral terms ( at least since Agile terminology has caught on ) .
Django people will claim to have a decoupled framework , but then they 've never put their money where their mouth is -- they 've never actually decoupled anything from the framework in the form of an extraction that they use .
So I turn it around because calling these other frameworks " glue " frameworks is n't really fair -- they wrote much of what they are gluing to .
Gluing together things you wrote yourself is called simply " software development " ; that you introduce greater discipline on yourself to create something that is independently useful does n't mean you 've necessarily created something less cohesive and complete .
( There 's other ways to describe differences in frameworks , of course .
But I think Django 's developers could make a better argument based on development methodologies and community development than they can on engineering principles . )
[ Update ]
For those of you who ’ve been living in a non-wifi- enabled cave , four days ago Stephen Wolfram awarded a $ 25,000 prize to a 20 - year - old undergraduate named Alex Smith , for proving that a particular two - state , three - symbol Turing machine is universal .
The prize was to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Wolfram ’s paradigm - smashing , foundation - shaking masterpiece , A New Kind of Science .
( More from Bill Gasarch ’s blog , Nature , and Scientific American . )
Smith sounds like a swell guy who entered this contest for exactly the right reasons : he was at his parents ’ place over summer break and had nothing better to do .
He deserves the money , and I sincerely hope the CS theory community has n’t heard the last from him .
Predictably , though , as soon as this story broke I started getting emails from journalists asking me about the far - reaching scientific implications of the new universality proof .
In trying to give them an honest answer — one that would n’t be misunderstood , or spun to support a pre-existing storyline with which I disagreed — I inevitably came off like an ornery old sourpuss .
From Scientific American :
Of course , there may be a reason the problem languished .
“ Finding the smallest universal [ Turing machines ] is a neat recreational pursuit , ” quantum computation researcher Scott Aaronson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says , but “ it ’s no longer seen as connected to the central questions of the field . ” …
“ The impact of NKS on all the areas of computer science and physics I ’m familiar with has been basically zero , ” he says .
“ As far as I can tell , the main impact is that people now sometimes use the adjective ‘ Wolframian ’ to describe breathtaking claims for the trivial or well - known . ” [ Martin ]
Davis offers a sunnier take : “ The book has a lot of beautiful pictures . ”
And from Nature :
The solution is n’t hugely relevant to modern computer science , says Scott Aaronson , a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
“ Most theoretical computer scientists do n’t particularly care about finding the smallest universal Turing machines , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ They see it as a recreational pursuit that interested people in the 60s and 70s but is now sort of ‘ retro ’ . ”
Having partially degrumpified , in the remainder of this post I wish to offer something positive .
But first some background : a month after NKS came out , I wrote a review of it for the journal Quantum Information and Computation , in which I examined Wolfram ’s claims about quantum mechanics and computational complexity , and explained what I saw as the problems with them .
( Rather than rehash the review , I ’ll just point you there if you ’re interested . )
Today I ’d like to celebrate the fifth anniversary of my critical review of NKS , by offering a $ 25 prize for stodgy , conventional work in the field of quantum complexity theory .
The Aaronson $ 25.00 Challenge
In NKS , Wolfram places himself among those computer scientists and physicists who doubt the possibility of quantum computers , not for any practical reason but as a consequence of their disbelieving quantum mechanics itself .
As he writes on page 771 :
Indeed within the usual formalism [ of quantum mechanics ] one can construct quantum computers that may be able to solve at least a few specific problems exponentially faster than ordinary Turing machines .
But particularly after my discoveries in Chapter 9 [ ‘ Fundamental Physics ’ ] , I strongly suspect that even if this is formally the case , it will still not turn out to be a true representation of ultimate physical reality , but will instead just be found to reflect various idealizations made in the models used so far .
Here , then , is the challenge :
If a quantum computer can efficiently solve a problem , can it also efficiently convince Wolfram that the solution is correct ?
More formally , does every language in the class BQP admit an interactive protocol where the prover is in BQP and the verifier is in BPP ?
In other words : can quantum computers always “ show their work ” ?
It ’s obvious , for example , that if a quantum computer spit out the factors of a 5,000 - digit number , you would n’t have to believe quantum mechanics ( or even know what it was ) to check whether the answer was right .
I ’m asking whether every problem solvable by a quantum computer has the same property .
And to make things fair to the quantum computer , I ’ll let it give not just a static proof but also an interactive protocol , by which a distrustful polynomial - time classical verifier could become convinced , to arbitrarily high confidence , that the quantum computer knows the right answer .
( An example for the uninitiated : suppose you had two graphs G and H , and suppose you picked one of the graphs at random , randomly permuted its vertices , and gave the result to a quantum computer .
And suppose the quantum computer could unfailingly tell you which graph you started with .
Clearly this should convince you that G and H are not isomorphic — since if they were isomorphic , then the quantum computer could n’t have done better than guessing !
And this is true even though you never received a proof of non-isomorphism that you could hand to someone else . )
I ’ll award $ 25 either for a proof that every quantum computation can be “ counter - Wolframized , ” or for an oracle relative to which some quantum computation provably ca n’t be .
If both problems are solved then I ’ll award $ 25 for each .
Every serious submission will be reviewed by a Prize Committee consisting of me .
The Committee may also choose to award smaller prizes for partial results .
Note : Much as I ’d like to “ pull a Wolfram , ” the beautiful question above was ( to my knowledge ) first asked by Daniel Gottesman , at a conference in February 2004 .
Also , the idea of a $ 25 prize was suggested to me by Mike Mosca .
Update ( 10/30 ) : A commenter pointed me to this thread in the Foundations of Mathematics ( FOM ) mailing list , which contains an actual technical discussion of Smith ’s universality proof .
Of particular interest :
an argument by Vaughan Pratt that Smith ’s universality proof is wrong , a response by Todd Rowland of Wolfram Research , a post from Wolfram himself , which , though written in his trademark way , comes the closest I ’ve seen of anything by him to addressing actual hard questions about the definition of universality , and this comment from John McCarthy : “ In the 1950s I thought that the smallest possible ( symbol - state product ) universal Turing machine would tell something about the nature of computation .
Unfortunately , it did n’t .
Instead as simpler universal machines were discovered , the proofs that they were universal became more elaborate , and [ so ] did the encodings of information . ”
In judging the correctness of Smith ’s proof , the key question is what counts as “ universality . ”
As I explained to the journalists who emailed me , the rules of Wolfram ’s prize left a huge gray area by explicitly refusing to specify this .
In particular : what kinds of input and output encodings are allowed ?
How do we make sure the real computational work is done by the Turing machine itself and not the encoding procedures ?
Does the tape have to be filled with 0 ’s initially , or can it be filled with other patterns , and if so which ones ?
Since the two - state Turing machine in question has no “ halt ” state , what external conditions can we impose to determine when the machine has halted ?
Still , I decided not to make a fuss about such things in my original post , since it seemed clear from Smith ’s writeup that ( 1 ) he was aware of these issues , and ( 2 ) there was some nontrivial sense in which he proved universality .
I was n’t going to lose sleep over which sense , for the simple reason that I ’d never lost sleep over the ( 2,3 ) universality question itself !
The Hardback Book now sits sadly beside the papyrus scroll and vellum codex upon the remaindered shelf in the great discount bookshop in the sky , following the decision of publisher Picador to issue all future novels in paperback , paperbacks being so much easier to pulp when an indifferent public prefers to spend its gift tokens on the new Leona Lewis CD .
Printed Material had been knocking around in libraries from Alexandria to Alnwick for centuries before some bright spark had the idea of collecting these loose pages and binding them between two hard covers .
Indeed , monks had been illuminating manuscripts for hundreds of years - normally by dropping a candle on their painstakingly crafted vellum whilst half - blind from years of rising before dawn to knock out another chapter of The Book of Hours You 'd Really Like To See and St Ethelburgha 's " Be Everythinge inne Life Shitte or Be Itte Juste Me ? " .
But , as William Caxton claimed in his book How I Inventedde Ye Booke - a bestseller in its day shifting almost 13 units and staying at the top of Ye Very Longe Rivere in Ye Undiscoverede Continente charts for nearly two hundred years - it was he and not " yon lying slagge " Johannes Gutenberg who had invented the modern Hardback as we remember it today .
Whilst printed material was taken up with gusto by medieval early adopters these technophiles remained a small minority as books failed to catch on with the public at large , thanks to their excessive cost and the failure of Ye Conservativves plan to ensure that every child in Britain would be able to read by the age of six ( normally because , by the age of six , nearly every child in Britain was dead of ye plague ) .
The Hardback truly came of age in the 19th century when a more enlightened and educated middle class ( and some uppity working class types ) clamoured for something heavy and absorbent to line the walls of their libraries , parlours and drawing rooms and keep the cold at bay until a six - year - old could be shoved up the chimney to find out why the fire would n't draw .
The advent of the mass - produced Paperback in the 1930s proved the catalyst for the Nazis , allowing them to hold big book - burning rallies - as The Paperback burnt so much better than The Hardback .
But despite its early flirtation with fascism , and despite being less weighty ( and thus useless as a doorstop or as an accurate missile to project across a classroom to wake Timson Minor during double Latin )
The Paperback proved more popular with the public as it was smaller , lighter and easier to dry out on the radiator after being dropped in the bath .
With sales plummeting over the decades , The Hardback desperately tried to adapt itself to modern life - hollowing itself out to offer aspiring spies a place hide their Walther PPKs or faking itself in plastic to give VHS pornography buffs a respectable place to hide their tapes on the living room shelves .
In desperation The Hardback swallowed its pride and turned to the fiction of Dan Brown and JK Rowling to reverse its ailing fortunes , but when even award - winning novelists ( that award being the Olympic Medal for Literature - designed , judged and awarded by one J. Archer ) such as Jeffrey Archer struggled to shift more than a few thousand in hardback , the publishing world realised the game was up and took a suicide pill ( believed by some to be several thousand copies of As A Dodo :
The Obituaries You 'd Like to See , the perfect Christmas gift for all the family , available now in all good book stores ) .
The Hardback Book will be pulped at St Naomi Campbell 's Church of the Remaindered Book .
The service will be conducted by the Right Reverend Mariella Frostrup and the congregation will sing Hymn 47 , Paperback Writer .
The Hardback is survived by The Paperback , The Audio Book , the e-Book and Dan Brown , JK Rowling and Jeffrey Archer .
Think Progress :
Later in the show , host Chris Wallace revealed that no conservative would willingly defend Gonzales on Fox .
“ By the way , we invited White House officials and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee to defend Attorney General Gonzales , ” said Wallace .
“ We had no takers . ”
Both the president and country are better served if the attorney general is a figure of competence .
Sadly , the current attorney general is not seen as any of those things .
I think it ’s a liability for the president .
More importantly , it ’s a liability for the United States of America .
On Fox News Sunday this morning , former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich ( R - GA ) refused to defend Attorney General Alberto Gonzales against accusations that he may have perjured himself before Congress .
“ It ’s very damaging …we badly need an attorney general who is above any question , ” said Gingrich .
He continued :
But lucky for Gonzales , the good folks over at the National Review will carry his water .
For fun , let 's go back to some of his testimony last week :
SCHUMER : I 'll let you speak in a minute , but this is serious , because you 're getting right close to the edge right here .
You just said there was just one program -- just one .
So the letter , which was , sort of , intended to deceive , but does n't directly do so , because there are other intelligence activities , gets you off the hook , but you just put yourself right back on here .
GONZALES : I clarified my statement two days later with the reporter .
SCHUMER : What did you say to the reporter ?
GONZALES : I did not speak directly to the reporter .
SCHUMER : Oh , wait a second -- you did not .
( LAUGHTER )
OK .
What did your spokesperson say to the reporter ?
GONZALES : I do n't know .
But I told the spokesperson to go back and clarify my statement ...
SCHUMER : Well , wait a minute , sir .
Sir , with all due respect -- and if I could have some order here , Mr. Chairman -- in all due respect , you 're just saying , " Well , it was clarified with the reporter , " and you do n't even know what he said .
You do n't even know what the clarification is .
Sir , how can you say that you should stay on as attorney general when we go through exercise like this , where you 're bobbing and weaving and ducking to avoid admitting that you deceived the committee ?
And now you do n't even know .
I 'll give you another chance :
You 're hanging your hat on the fact that you clarified the statement two days later .
You 're now telling us that is was a spokesperson who did it .
What did that spokesperson say ?
Tell me now , how do you clarify this ?
GONZALES : I do n't know , but I 'll find out and get back to you .
Q : Why does Hollywood care about student loans ?
A : It does n’t , but it does care about prosecuting students who trade movies online .
That explains why the Motion Picture Association of America might care about a press release issued last week praising , of all things , proposed legislation addressing higher education financing and access .
The bill would require colleges to come up with ways to help movie studios and record labels prevent trading in copyrighted works .
The plan would require colleges to “ develop a plan for offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property as well as a plan to explore technology - based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity . ”
It further would allow the secretary of education to offer grants to institutions “ to develop , implement , operate , improve , and disseminate programs of prevention , education , and cost - effective technological solutions , to reduce and eliminate the illegal downloading and distribution of intellectual property . ”
In the M.P.A.A. press release , Dan Glickman , the association ’s chairman and chief executive , said , “ Illegal downloading does n’t just hurt the motion picture and music industries , but it can also be harmful to universities as it puts their systems at risk for security purposes , takes up bandwidth , and slows systems that are designed for research and other educational purposes . ”
But that is not quite how universities see it .
While they generally support a separate provision in the bill that would require them to disclose their policies on file - sharing and to inform students of what is and is not legal , they do not want to be in the position of having to block certain online activities by their students – even though they say they do not want their on - campus networks clogged by students ’ illegally downloading copyrighted movies , television shows and music .
“ You have the federal government requiring a nonprofit educational institution to develop plans to help a for - profit industry to earn more revenue from their students , ” said Matt Owens , assistant director of federal relations at the Association of American Universities .
“ It makes no sense .
That ’s not what we ’re in the business of doing . ”
In a letter to George Miller , the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor , top officials of four universities criticized the fact that the legislation is aimed at “ colleges and universities — which industry leaders admit are responsible for only a small fraction of illegal file - sharing — but not other Internet service providers whose networks are associated with most of the problem . ”
Then there is the problem of whether efforts to block illegal file - sharing might also block legitimate use , said Lawrence Lessig , a professor at Stanford Law School and the founding director of its Center for Internet and Society .
“ The consequence of enforcement of these restrictions is to interfere with people ’s legitimate rights to use those technologies , ” Professor Lessig said .
Other provisions in the 700 - plus pages of the bill , which is summarized here , involve the subjects you would expect , including grants for needy students and regulation of the student loan industry .
The committee is expected to vote on it as early as Wednesday .
Hollywood execs panicked by the pending writer 's strike need look no further than the web to solve all their scripting problems .
Alex Perez , the writer - for - hire profiled on the hollywoodscabwriter.com humor site , offers up his writing talents in hopes of " helping Hollywood in its time of need . "
The goofy spoof videos on the site show a fresh - faced and grinning Perez , shamelessly flogging his wordsmith skills and promising to " save this industry if I have to write every film myself . "
The soundtracks are pure cheese , and the lame dialogue samples reveal the kinds of horrors that could pollute TV and movie screens should Hollywood 's real scribes trade in their lattes and laptops for strike - kitchen coffee and picket signs .
www.youtube.com/watch?v=&rel=1
" You need writers ? "
Perez asks in the badly lit and creatively titled Promo Video # 2 .
" I happen to be a damn good one .
But I 'm not gonna lie .
It 's gonna cost you .
A lot .
But you can't put a price on your audience 's happiness .
Fortunately , I can . "
Who 's really behind the parody site ?
YouTube user hollywoodscabwriter joined Oct. 20 and began posting the Alex Perez videos .
And the hollywoodscabwriter.com domain was registered that same day who knows when through GoDaddy.com to Brian McGinn .
Could it be the same Brian McGinn who worked as a ship technician on Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl ?
We 've got an e-mail in to find out .
As for the very real threat of a writers ' walkout ?
Variety reports that the Writers Guild of America could will strike as early as Monday , and various opportunities ( and opportunists ) are popping up on Craigslist Los Angeles .
The Los Angeles Times blogged Friday about a would - be writer ( who may or may not be real ) :
The alleged wannabe scab claims on his blog to be " getting some calls from independent producers with nothing of substance . "
GRASSE , France , July 15 ( Reuters ) —
The French police on Sunday were searching for a convicted killer who made a daring escape from Grasse prison in southeast France with the help of four masked men and a helicopter .
The well - planned breakout late Saturday took only five minutes and was the second time the killer , Pascal Payet , 43 , had used a helicopter to escape from jail .
Maurice Barate , a security official at the prison , said the breakout was carried out by four masked men who hijacked a helicopter at nearby Cannes and took the pilot hostage .
They landed on the prison roof at the start of the night shift and used heavy machinery to break open two doors and enter the isolation ward where Mr. Payet was held .

This morning on Fox News Sunday , Karl Rove -- who is quickly becoming the laughing stock of Washington -- appeared with Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( chair of the DCCC ) to talk politics .
When the discussion turned to Iraq , Van Hollen seized the opportunity to confront Rove for his failed attempt to blame the Democrats for pushing the White House into voting on the 2002 Iraq war invasion resolution .
Rove 's response ?
Why , it was all the fault of former Democratic Senator , Tom Daschle .
What ?
Yes , the truth finally comes out -- the tyrannical , warmongering Tom Daschle was out on the news shows in 2002 , beating the drums of war and eventually the Bush administration , with his boot to their throat , relented and let the Democrats have their war .
Van Hollen reads a statement from former White House Press Secretary , Ari Fleischer , who refutes Rove 's claims , but missed the opportunity to bring up Andrew Card , who not only refuted Rove 's claims , but used him as a punchline earlier this week .
Rove kept spinning , but eventually , host Chris Wallace put an end to the discussion .
Let 's hope Turdblossom stays out there making a fool of himself for as long as possible ...

Philly Rallies for Impeachment ; Gravel Backs H Res 333
REPORT ON PHILADELPHIA IMPEACHMENT TOWN HALL MEETING July 5 , 2007
By Jane Dugdale
The cavernous hall of First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia was full
Thursday evening as six speakers took to the stage to talk about
impeachment .
John Nichols , Washington Correspondent of The Nation , was the
first to gain a standing ovation after reminding the audience how many times
the constitution talks about impeachment ( six ) without ever mentioning
religion , elections , or corporations .
Journalist Dave Lindorff followed ,
focusing on the crime of the President ’s “ signing statements , ” when the
constitution explicitly directs the President to enforce the laws of
Congress .
Debra Sweet , national coordinator for World Ca n’t Wait , pointed
out that the Democratic leadership needs to be held accountable for not
fulfilling its responsibility to impeach this lawless Executive .
In answer
to a question about the absence of youth in the movement , she noted that
youth were prominent in the last two elections and really felt betrayed by
the electoral process that resulted in Bush being elected ( 2004 ) and the
Democratic leadership doing nothing about him ( 2006 ) .
She urged listeners
to wear orange , “ as the people at Guantanamo are forced to wear it ” to call
for the end of the Bush regime .
Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel followed , to much applause , as he urged
the audience to contact their representatives and demand action on the
impeachment motion submitted this spring and now co-sponsored by 12
Representatives .
Lastly , the Rev. Lennox Yearwood , CEO of the Hip Hop
Caucus , reminded listeners of Martin Luther King , Jr. ’s , speech on August
28 , 1963 , which ended the era of Jim Crow , and compared it to August 28 ,
2005 , when Katrina hit New Orleans and brought back Jim Crow .
The audience was attentive and grateful , asking many questions in the
discussion time , signing up for action notices , and taking information and
postcards to send to Congress .
Many stayed the whole three hours .
Various
press representatives were there .
Donations were generous and paid for the
expenses of the speakers with a small honorarium for each .
Organizers of
the event were gleeful at the success of the evening .
Several representatives of the Main Line Citizens for Impeachment were among
the audience , including Jane , Monique , Randi , David , John , Jeff , Freddy and
son David .
Freddy offered to help organize “ Honk to Impeach ” rallies each
Saturday morning in Bryn Mawr , starting Saturday , July 14 .

Put Option On America - Part 1
By Rand Clifford
07 December , 2007
Countercurrents.org
T he entire American political establishment is so rotten the stench wafts around the world .
Why is it that Americans seem among the least aware that the radical changes needed for America to regain its Constitution , and survive as a Republic , will never happen within our rotted - out system ?
All the tinkering and primping , lying , killing and pimping masquerading as hope are n’t touching the core problem .
The latest episode , with Hillary and Rudy leading the packs — the majority of Americans seem to believe it is something believable , actual hope for righting the ship .
Unfortunately , the same machine that delivered us a two - term president who never won an election is still delivering .
Neocon alpha reptiles still control foreign policy , many with dual citizenship , Israeli and American , apparently in that order of importance .
Michael Chertoff , head of the Department of Homeland Security , also has dual citizenship .
He was approved in a 98 - 0 vote in the U.S. Senate without any question of his Israeli roots .
Meanwhile , regarding CIA / Mossad ... former Italian President and Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga fired a truth missile ( 12-05 -07 ) with the declaration that the attacks of 9 - 11 were run by the CIA , and Mossad with Zionist aid , something he insists is commonly accepted by global intelligence agencies .
( 1 ) Cossiga was forced to resign in 1992 after admitting he helped set up the CIA ’s Operation Gladio , where a group of neo - fascist paramilitary operatives carried out false flag operations across Europe from the 1960s through the 1980s that were blamed on leftists .
An agent of Gladio , Vincenzo Vinciguerra , in the Italian parliamentary investigation of 2000 that revealed the attacks were being overseen by the U.S. intelligence apparatus , stated under oath : " You had to attack civilians , the people , women , children , innocent people , unknown people far removed from any political game .
The reason was quite simple — to force ... the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security . "
False flag terror has long been in the playbook of the CIA , as well as MOSSAD ( Israel ’s " CIA " ) .
So what about Hillary offering hope for Americans ?
Does it seem possible to have the lives of American people foremost in your heart from so deep in the pocket of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee — a certain euphemism for Political Action Committee ( AIPAC ) ?
And Rudy ?
Almost every one of his advisors is a member of AIPAC .
Both Hillary and Rudy are committed to The " War " ( criminal invasion and occupation of Iraq ) .
Both lean toward expanding the " War " to Iran , and beyond .
Both at least claim to believe the permanent " War On Terror " is not the putrid baloney it really is ; both support police state measures that " protect " us from terrorists , eschewing our Constitution and its guaranteed civil liberties .
In the rotten apple of American politics , two good seeds still resist the rot : Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich .
However , through all the rot they are not easy to find ....
Ultimately , what might awaken Americans into smelling the stench the rest of the world is gagging on ?
The truth about 9 - 11 could the best place to start .
Not necessarily that the truth will awaken a population incessantly hammered with consumerism ( have you got your " Xmas " shopping done ? ) , celebritneys ( Britney had a twisted childhood — and now she ’s pregnant again ! ) , and supremacy ( The American Way — kick their ass , take their gas ! ) ; a population under the spell of CorpoGov ’s propaganda arm , CorpoMedia ( mainstream media ) , and their wash of everything - they - want - us - to - believe - and - be - thinking - about , disguised as " news " .
However , it might disarm — at least enough for more truth to circulate — the embedded public denial that serves as one of the greatest allies of 9 - 11 perpetrators .
There are many reasons why , instead of looking at the evidence , people prefer to cower behind , " Oh !
They ’d never do that ! "
But the effect is one simple malignancy :
Those responsible for 9 - 11 are still in control of America , and they ’ve got our country chasing the dollar — facing a long , hard , potentially terminal slide as the rest of the world greases the skids and snickers about justice .
Vast wealth and power have bet on it : 9 - 11 , the ultimate put option on America .
Put options are contracts where profits can be made by betting that a stock will fall in value , whereas call options are a bet that a stock will rise in value .
9 -11 meant enormous profits for put options made in the days before by people with foreknowledge of the event .
United Airlines , American Airlines , reinsurance companies set to cover billions in losses ( Munich Re and the AXA Group ) , financial companies set to lose big ( Merril Lynch & Co. , Morgan Stanley , Bank of America ) — all of these companies had put options spectacularly higher than the norm in the week before 9 - 11 .
( 2 ) ( 3 ) Huge surges also showed in call options on stocks of companies set to gain from 9 - 11 , primarily weapons manufacturers such as Raytheon , but those put options served up the Really Big Profits .
Anyone still wondering why these stock traders have not been revealed do n’t seem to realize that these are Very Special people .
Anyone surprised that this obvious treachery never made CorpoMedia " news " remains unclear about CorpoMedia ’s function ; people like this are even likely to swallow such classic hairballs of Doublespeak as : Liberal Media , and , Islamofascism .
For those more aware , anytime you hear a politico hack up either of these hairballs , recognize them as the cat box dwellers they are , hold your nose , and vote the other way , while it still might matter .
What would seem overall more frightening :
That 9 - 11 was an inside job , a classic false flag operation ( as much of the world and even 100,000,000 Americans lean toward ) ; or , the " Official Story " which includes cascades of security breakdowns and breeches , culminating in 19 Arab boys with box cutters defeating America ’s security apparatus ( Arab boys that many of remain alive and well after their " suicide " missions ) ?
The " Official Story " of 9 - 11 has virtually nothing at all to do with the evidence .
Many excellent , highly reputable sites on the Internet have extensive inventories of facts regarding not only clear evidence of 9 - 11 as an inside job , but also regarding evidence frantically destroyed by the forces of Coverup .
Good places to start include : ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ....
The " Official Investigation " of 9 - 11 ( Kean commission ) was nothing more than a White House whitewash to alter evidence so it might somehow , through the most profound phony exegesis , somewhat fit into the " Official Story " .
Anything they could not distort to in any way fit , they simply omitted , such as the obvious , even admitted controlled demolition , or " pulling " of WTC7 .
The Official Investigation is in fact so packed with omission , the Kean Commission could more accurately be called the " Kean Omission " .
The Bottom Line is reliably revealing , something a look at the winners and losers of 9 - 11 supports .
The biggest winners include Big Oil , the Industrial Military Complex , Israel , the Feds ... and of course , W... " Lucky me , I hit the trifecta ! "
( 8 ) The biggest losers are We The People and our Constitution , Islam , world peace , American empathy , and future habitability of Earth .
Regardless of what CorpoGov said ... then said they did n’t say — with a wink and a shrug , Iraq had nothing to do with 9 - 11 .
So why have we invaded Iraq , killed over a million Iraqis while forever poisoning their environment with " depleted " uranium munitions , and fight for perpetual occupation to control their oil and use of their country as a forward military installation to gain control of more Middle Eastern oil ?
Has America been driven completely away from empathy and rule of law ?
Something Ron Paul recently rattled American polity with remains so apropos ; he said that when it comes to foreign policy , we need to consider what we do in terms of what would happen if somebody else did it to us .
It gets back to the old Golden Rule , thank you Dr. Paul .
So what about those " Conspiracy Theorist Nuts " and their " Wacky , Outlandish Theories " regarding 9 - 11 ?
Once again , look at who benefits .
The people who believe the evidence , and understand that the entire " Official Story " of 9- 11 is impossible — which includes many of our country ’s most educated and accomplished scholars and scientific experts ... they certainly do n’t benefit .
The " Nuts " , those people who believe what they see over what they ’re told , how could they benefit ?
Those trying to hide what really happened on 9 - 11 , that ’s where the benefits from the " Wacky , Outlandish Theories " fall .
9 -11 embedded American rule by fear .
The great mass of American people are being cowed , controlled and ruined by a tiny minority of hyper - wealthy corporatists that , unless Americans brave their way from this blackout of truth , decency , empathy and courage , will take America the rest of the way down .
Until the truth of 9 - 11 is widely revealed , and the perpetrators are brought to justice , playing CorpoGov ’s rigged election games and believing CorpoMedia spews anything but propaganda and misdirection while omitting everything Americans need to know would seem to well fit most definitions of insanity .
In Part 2 ... Exactly how did the most notorious crime in our history , the father of perpetual war around the world and destroyer of our Constitution and Republic , become such a " Do n’t Talk About It ! " ?
A crime never actually investigated , where as much evidence as possible was destroyed as quickly as possible .
What can The People do to break the grip of nurtured fear ?
If other peoples ’ resources are worth fighting and dying for while killing millions of innocent people , are n’t our Constitution , country , and own people worth fighting for ?

Pelosi takes heat for OK of farm bill / Legislation heavy on subsidies draws Bay Area activists ' fire
2007-07-21 04:00:00 PDT
Washington -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed off Friday on a five - year farm bill that would keep multibillion - dollar subsidies flowing to cotton , corn and a handful of other crops , deeply disappointing Bay Area food and environmental activists who had hoped that Congress might shift federal farm policy this year to combat obesity , air and water pollution and industrial farming .
Pelosi , a San Francisco Democrat , hailed as reform a bill that would grant subsidies to farmers earning up to $ 1 million -- five times more than the cap sought by the Bush administration -- while increasing actual payments to farmers .
The bill comes during the most prosperous era American agriculture has seen in decades as crop prices and farm income approach or set record highs .
" Bush seems to be taking a harder stance on millionaires than the Democratic Party , which is surprising , " said Kari Hamerschlag , policy director for the California Coalition for Food and Farming , a Watsonville group urging lawmakers to move money from crop subsidies to environmental and nutrition programs .
The bill , finished late Thursday night by the House Agriculture Committee , would add $ 1.6 billion for environmental and pest detection programs and research for California 's fruit , nut and vegetable crops .
It also would add money for farmers ' markets and to provide more fresh produce in school lunch programs .
Approval of the money is a breakthrough for the state 's specialty crop industry , which receives no direct subsidies .
But the bill leaves the big commodity programs intact for cotton , corn , wheat , rice , soybeans and a handful of other crops that have been subsidized since the Dust Bowl in the 1930s .
Last year , farmers received more than $ 21 billion in crop subsidies .
Average farm incomes are about 20 percent higher than the average U.S. household income .
The committee even threw in an export subsidy for tobacco .
If anything , " we 've actually increased the rates at which we support prices " for subsidized crops , said Daniel Sumner , a leading farm economist and director of the Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis .
" We 've really done nothing of a significant nature to change those programs .
... I think that 's a mistake for the country . "
Pelosi's prime motivation in supporting the current farm policy apparently is to preserve the re-election prospects of freshman Democrats in rural districts who toppled Republicans in November and helped secure Democrats their House majority and Pelosi the speakership .
Nine of the freshmen sit on the House Agriculture Committee .
Several said they feared any vote to reform farm programs would endanger their political prospects .
Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said the speaker was trying to " balance equities " between competing groups .
The Bay Area has become a hotbed of opposition to this year 's farm bill .
Food activists have teamed with environmentalists to form the most potent coalition in 75 years against the traditional farm lobby , one of the most powerful in Washington .
Subsidized commodity interests dominate the House and Senate agriculture committees .
Led by Michael Pollan , a professor at UC Berkeley , and Berkeley restaurateur Alice Waters , food activists have become a force against crop subsidies , pushing for what Pollan calls a food bill , not a farm bill .
The activists want more diverse and locally grown food as well as more fresh food in federal nutrition programs such as food stamps and school lunches .
They have tied the nation 's obesity epidemic to subsidies for corn and soybeans -- the source of high fructose corn syrup and vegetable oils widely used in processed foods .
Ken Cook , president and founder of the Environmental Working Group , said the activists are " shocked that this would be considered reform . "
House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson , a Democrat whose Minnesota district receives large corn subsidies , said Pelosi backs his bill and will use her power to make sure it passes the House next week .
Peterson called the $ 1 million payment limit a " huge change in direction " and warned that the House leadership would quash any attempt -- a rebellion has been promised by Rep. Ron Kind , D - Wis. -- to make any significant changes .
" This is not a deal just between me and the folks that represent these people , " Peterson said , referring to members representing subsidized farmers .
" The speaker is involved in this . "
Peterson dismissed critics outside the traditional farm belt .
" I know people on the outside can sit and complain about this , but frankly most of those people have no clue what they 're talking about , " Peterson said .
" Most people in the city have no concept of what 's going on here . "
Commodity groups ridiculed the idea that subsidies have anything to do with obesity .
" The farm bill did not require people to eat more than they should , " Daren Coppock , chief executive of the National Association of Wheat Growers , told a Washington conference this year .
" If the farm bill causes obesity , it also causes AIDS , global warming , the extinction of endangered species , bad grades in school and probably dancing . "
But the activists , backed by many agricultural economists , argue that the subsidies produce no public benefit .
If federal tax dollars are to be spent in the farm economy , they argue , the money should go to things that benefit the public as a whole .
" I think shifting subsidies into environmental programs ... is a much better way of supporting the goals that U.S. taxpayers and consumers have for our agriculture programs , " said Ann Tutwiler , a leading farm policy expert who is a managing director for the Hewlett Foundation .
The same goes for shifting money to nutrition , she said .
" Where the activist community is coming down is a better place for U.S. farm policy to be . "
Martha Noble , a senior policy analyst at the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition , said alternatives to crop subsidies include " conservation , research for organics and specialty crops -- fruits , vegetables , grasses , things that grow in a diversified food system -- certainly better nutrition , more attention to local foods and local markets . "
Activists groups have taken aim at payments for commodities for two reasons :
The money provides incentives to increase the use of pesticides and fertilizers and expand farm operations to capture more subsidies .
That leads to larger farms and monocultures of single grain crops such as corn and wheat over millions of acres in the Midwest .
The subsidies also raise land prices , winding up in the pockets of landowners , who may or may not be farmers , and making it difficult for younger farmers to get started .
Cattle ranchers who use grass pastures are at a disadvantage to large feed lots that use subsidized corn and other feed grains , Noble said , and places such as Iowa and Indiana that once grew apples and vegetables now grow mainly corn .
" We could have a much better agricultural system in this country , more diversity , more diverse food available in lots of different regions " without the subsidies , Noble said .
Rep .
Kind promised to lead a fight on the House floor , hoping to pick up many Democrats for his plan to change the bill .
" We anticipate large bipartisan support , " Kind said .
" I do n't think the farm bill is in final form by any stretch of the imagination .
The process is just starting . "

UAV
Two thousand unmanned aerial vehicles ply the skies over Afghanistan , Iraq , and other trouble spots , letting US troops spy on insurgents without risking life and limb .
Most are less than 3 feet long and dumb as rocks , their every move controlled by joysticks or preprogrammed GPS waypoints .
But they 're getting smarter — and more dangerous .
Advanced models take off and land without human intervention .
Others , equipped with Hellfire missiles , can incinerate enemy combatants ; one recent target was an al Qaeda operative who allegedly plotted the 2000 USS Cole bombing .
But with the tech becoming ever cheaper and easier to build , the US advantage can't hold for long .
Already , terrorist groups like Hezbollah are flying drones of their own .

Think your iPhone is the latest in technological sophistication ?
Guess again : Its operating system dates from 1969 .
In fact , everyone who uses a Mac , TiVo , Linux box , or any one of dozens of PDAs and smartphones is running a nearly 40 - year - old OS .
What gives ?
Like an especially hardy biological species , the various derivatives of Unix — known collectively as Un*x — evolved out of ultra - efficient code tuned for machines without a byte of spare memory .
And the platform only gets better and more adaptable with each new environment it conquers .
Think of Unix as a crocodile — a dinosaur , yes , but one with plenty of snap left in its jaws .
Utility Computing

You can , thanks to the growing field of utility computing .

It may not represent the future — plummeting costs will eventually make even supercomputing easily affordable — but for now , it 's a cheap and simple way to turn up the juice .

Before you pitch your new business , you 'd better know what they want to hear .
Here 's a handy script and table to help you hit the talking points that count .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has hired a high - powered Washington lawyer to represent him in investigations of mismanagement of the Justice Department .
George Terwilliger , a white - collar crime defense attorney and the Justice Department 's No. 2 in the early 1990s , last month was on the White House 's short list to replace Gonzales .
Now he 'll be Gonzales ' defender as federal investigators look into allegations that the former attorney general lied to lawmakers and illegally allowed politics to influence hiring and firing at the Justice Department .
In an interview Wednesday , Terwilliger said Gonzales maintains he did nothing wrong or illegal — and the fact he has hired an attorney should not signal any guilt .
" It would really be unfair to individuals who are smart enough to get themselves a lawyer to draw some inference that they need a lawyer because they did something wrong , " Terwilliger told The Associated Press .
" Nor has he been accused of wrongdoing .
Investigations are conducted to find the facts .
And the facts will show that Judge Gonzales acted honorably in all circumstances while holding positions of great responsibility and importance to maintaining the safety of the country . "
Gonzales resigned last month from the scandal - scarred Justice Department after months of criticism about his leadership and honesty .
President Bush has nominated retired federal judge Michael Mukasey to replace him .
Confirmation hearings for Mukasey begin next week in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee .

Vietnamese Government loses $ 8,000,000 to Football Bets
Sports gambling has become a huge problem in Vietnam , but this might be the worst case yet .
Various Government officials and civil servants had gambled aid funding on bets of mainly European Football matches .
The end losses ?
An estimated $ 8,197,485 in government funds .
Both President Tran Duc Luong and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai are expected to retire after Vietnam ’s 10 National Congress ends on Tuesday , October 30th .
( President Tran Duc Luong on the left and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on the right )
The whole scandal was revealed when a gambler named Bui Tien Dung , who was also a former part of the Ministry of Transport , confessed .
Another Transport Minister Dao Dinh
Binh resigned two weeks ago due to gambling problems as well .
Since then , a computer office log was found to have 200 Ministry of Transport employees waging government funds .
Mr. Dung even had $ 11,477,838 in savings from all of this before he was jailed .

From now on , I am only going to buy stock in companies that have the greatest disparity between the compensation of the CEO and the compensation of the workers .
Thanks to a little thing I call science , this strategy looks like a winner .
Yes , I will explain .
I came across two unrelated studies that I cleverly related .
In one study , researchers found that happiness makes people successful .
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051219090811.htm
In another study , researchers found that sad workers are the most productive .
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/06/010612065304.htm
To summarize the studies :
Happy = successful
Sad = productive
Now , if you were to describe the job of a CEO versus the job of a lower level worker , I think you might say the CEO needs to be successful ( as opposed to productive ) whereas the lower level worker needs to be productive ( as opposed to successful ) .
Ideally , everyone should be both successful and productive , but in terms of importance , you would prefer a successful CEO over one who has more meetings , or however else you would measure “ productivity ” in that job .
And a factory worker , for example , needs to be productive more than he needs to “ succeed , ” if success even has meaning in that sort of job .
So it follows from the science that grossly overpaying a CEO makes good sense .
It allows the CEO to be happy , which increases his odds of success , which is good for the stockholders .
And best of all , overpaying a CEO makes the workers sad , which makes them more productive , which is also good for the stockholders .
You often see stories in the press about CEOs who are apparently overpaid .
That used to annoy me .
Now I realize the genius of it .
Those overpaid CEOs are buying hookers and cocaine in a valiant effort to increase their happiness , and therefore their success , which lifts all boats .
And by “ all boats , ” I mean the boats of everyone but the workers , who need to remain sad or the whole system breaks down .
If you would like to make your loved ones or coworkers more productive , try sending them the Amazon.com link to my new book with a note that says it is terrific and you read the entire thing on the Dilbert Blog while getting paid to allegedly work .
Then toss in a " neener neener . "
That will make them a little bit sad , thus boosting their productivity .

Ron Paul : Republicans need Reagan 's courage
Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 15 , 2007 Print This Email This
Long - shot Republican candidate Ron Paul said the current slate of candidates need the " courage " of former President Ronald Reagan to be able to withdraw US troops from Iraq .
The Texas Congressman , who has become an internet favorite but does not register much support in polls , said the Middle East is too unstable a region in which to maintain an indefinite US military presence .
Paul compared the current " quagmire " in Iraq to military involvement in Lebanon in the early 1980s .
" We need the courage of a Ronald Reagan , " Paul said , explaining the former president initially vowed not to withdraw US Marines who were attacked in October 1983 in Beirut while serving as part of a multinational peacekeeping force .
Reagan withdrew the troops in February of the following year .
Paul outlined his initial oppositions to the war in Iraq and his warnings that the war would become a quagmire like Vietnam .
He said the war has shrunk the Republican base and touted his plan to end the war .
IN my job as this newspaper ’s resident beauty skeptic , I receive a lot of books about longevity with preposterous titles like “ Stop Aging , Start Living , ” “ The New Anti-Aging Revolution : Stopping the Clock ” and “ The Science of Staying Young . ”
These books contain some practical advice .
But at this stage of medical knowledge , you have about as much chance of thwarting time as you do in personally preventing an ice storm , so you can start your resolutions for the New Year right now by forgoing such books and saving about $ 24.95 ( for a hardcover ) apiece .
There is no way around the fact that every body  skin included  ages biologically over time , a process over which humans have forever grieved .

Still , many skin experts recommend practical steps to maintain skin as it ages and to mitigate external factors  like sun exposure and chronic stress  that could accelerate changes .
The American people no longer support the war in Iraq .
The war is being carried on by a stubborn president who , like Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon during the Vietnam War , does not want to lose .
But from the beginning this has been an ill - considered and poorly prosecuted war that , like the Vietnam War , has diminished respect for America .
We believe Mr. Bush would like to drag the war on long enough to hand it off to another president .
The war in Iraq reminds us of the tragedy of the Vietnam War .
Both wars began with false assertions by the president to the American people and the Congress .
Like Vietnam , the Iraq War has introduced a new vocabulary : " shock and awe , " " mission accomplished , " " the surge . "
Like Vietnam , we have destroyed cities in order to save them .
It is not a strategy for success .
The Bush administration has attempted to forestall ending the war by putting in more troops , but more troops will not solve the problem .
We have lost the hearts and minds of most of the Iraqi people , and victory no longer seems to be even a remote possibility .
It is time to end our occupation of Iraq , and bring our troops home .
This war has had only limited body counts .
There are reports that more than one million Iraqis have died in the war .
These reports cannot be corroborated because the US military does not make public the number of the Iraqi dead and injured .
There are also reports that some four million Iraqis have been displaced and are refugees either abroad or within their own country .
Iraqis with the resources to leave the country have left .
They are frightened .
They do n't trust the US , its allies or its mercenaries to protect them and their interests .
We know more about the body counts of American soldiers in Iraq .
Some 4,000 American soldiers have been killed in this war , about a third more than the number of people who died in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
And some 28,000 American soldiers have suffered debilitating injuries .
Many more have been affected by the trauma of war in ways that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives - ways that will have serious effects not only on their lives and the lives of their loved ones , but on society as a whole .
Due to woefully inadequate resources being provided , our injured soldiers are not receiving the medical treatment and mental health care that they deserve .
The invasion of Iraq was illegal from the start .
Not only was Congress lied to in order to secure its support for the invasion of Iraq , but the war lacked the support of the United Nations Security Council and thus was an aggressive war initiated on the false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction .
There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Nor has any assertion of a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda proven to be true .
In the end , democracy has not come to Iraq .
Its government is still being forced to bend to the will of the US administration .

What the war has accomplished is the undermining of US credibility throughout the world , the weakening of our military forces , and the erosion of our Bill of Rights .
Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz calculates that the war is costing American tax payers more than $ 1 trillion .
This amount could double if we continue the war .
Each minute we are spending $ 500,000 in Iraq .
Our losses are incalculable .
It is time to remove our military forces from Iraq .
We must ask ourselves whether continuing to pursue this war is benefiting the American people or weakening us .
We must ask whether continuing the war is benefiting the Iraqi people or inflicting greater suffering upon them .
We believe the answer to these inquiries is that both the American and Iraqi people would benefit by ending the US military presence in Iraq .
Moving forward is not complicated , but it will require courage .
Step one is to proceed with the rapid withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and hand over the responsibility for the security of Iraq to Iraqi forces .
Step two is to remove our military bases from Iraq and to turn Iraqi oil over to Iraqis .
Step three is to provide resources to the Iraqis to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed in the war .
Congress must act .
Although Congress never declared war , as required by the Constitution , they did give the president the authority to invade Iraq .
Congress must now withdraw that authority and cease its funding of the war .
It is not likely , however , that Congress will act unless the American people make their voices heard with unmistakable clarity .
That is the way the Vietnam War was brought to an end .
It is the way that the Iraq War will also be brought to an end .
The only question is whether it will be now , or whether the war will drag on , with all the suffering that implies , to an even more tragic , costly and degrading defeat .
We will be a better , stronger and more decent country to bring the troops home now .

While Americans were celebrating their independence from the British Empire with displays of fireworks and other patriotic observances , another anniversary was pointedly not being observed , or even much noted , in Israel : on that day in 1976 , a daring raid by Israeli commandos freed the hostages of Air France flight 139 , held by PFLP terrorists and members of the German " Revolutionary Cells , " at the Entebbe airport in Uganda .
The plane had been originally headed to Paris from Athens , but the hijackers diverted it to Benghazi , Libya , for refueling , and then on to Entebbe , where Idi Amin greeted the terrorists as friends and allies .
The raid , launched on the night of July 3 and carried out until the morning of July 4 , caught the world ’s attention as a heroic and entirely justified operation aimed at freeing innocent victims of terrorism .
Score one for Israel .
The effect of this incident on world opinion , especially within the U.S. and Britain , was to increase sympathy for the Israelis and paint a portrait of the Palestinians as violent brutes .
And that may very well have been the real motive behind the operation , according to secret documents recently released by the British government .
Among the cache of documents is a memo by David H. Colvin , then first secretary of the British embassy in Paris , who averred that a contact in the Euro - Arab Parliamentary Association had told him the “ hijack was the work of the PFLP [ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ] , with help from the Israeli secret service , the Shin Bet . ”
The operation , wrote Colvin , was " an unholy alliance " and “ was designed to torpedo the PLO ’s [ Palestine Liberation Organization ] standing in France and to prevent what they see as a growing rapprochement between the PLO and the Americans . "
Colvin detailed a very plausible scenario whereby Israel stood to benefit :
“ Their nightmare is that after the November elections , one will witness the imposition in the Middle East of a Pax Americana , which will be the advantage of the PLO ( who will gain international respectability and perhaps the right to establish a state on evacuated territories ) and to the disadvantage of the Refusal Front ( who will be squeezed right out in any overall peace settlement and will lose their raison d’être ) and Israel ( who will be forced to evacuate occupied territory ) . ”
Colvin went on to say that " the PFLP had attracted all sorts of wild elements , some of whom had been planted by the Israelis . "
The document cache also contains a report from another British official citing a reporter for the Liverpool Post , Leo Murray , whose inside sources confirmed the hijacking was all about internal Palestinian politics , at least from the PFLP ’s perspective .
From the Israeli perspective , however , the propagandistic effect of the Entebbe incident on Western opinion , particularly in the United States and France , was crucial .
The U.S. was seen as an unreliable partner who had to be manipulated into rejecting PLO proposals for an independent Palestinian state , and the French , who were in favor of some kind of equanimity in negotiating a solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , also needed to be educated as to the inherent inability of the Palestinians to make peace .
The Israeli response to the Colvin revelations has been outrage , disbelief , and the denigration of this account as an " anti-Semitic conspiracy theory . "
Yet it is n’t that hard to believe the Israelis would launch a false - flag operation in order to generate diplomatic and political blowback helpful to their cause  and it would n’t be the only example of covert Israeli aid to the more militant wing of the Palestinian movement in order to undercut the PLO .
Go here for the story on how the Israelis succored and funded Hamas in its early days as an Islamist irritant in Arafat ’s side .
And then there is the Lavon incident , in which the Israelis sent agents into Egypt , who then planted bombs in American and British facilities , including a USIA library and a British - owned movie theater : the idea was to pin the blame on the Muslim Brotherhood and show the Americans  who were tilting toward Egypt ’s rising leader , Gamal Abdel Nasser  that the Egyptians were unreliable allies .
The Entebbe narrative reiterated and dramatized the Israelis ’ insistence that they had the " right " to reach beyond their own borders in their " war on terrorism "  an early version , if you will , of the Bush Doctrine .
Yet the Colvin memo shows that this official story was and is just a cover for an act of supreme cynicism and ruthlessness that would cause Machiavelli to blush .
Three hostages , one Israeli soldier , 45 Ugandan soldiers , and six hijackers were killed in Operation Thunderbolt .
Particularly disturbing is the fact that the hijackers , once in Benghazi , separated out the Israeli and Jewish passengers from the rest , letting the Gentiles go and taking the remainder to Entebbe .
To think that this heinous act was carried out with the cooperation and collusion of Israeli intelligence may seem counterintuitive , yet this is precisely the sort of crazy decision too - clever - by - half government officials would make in pursuit of that formless concept known as " the national interest . "
This floating abstraction , of course , is whatever government officials say it is , and since ideology and ambition can make the most egregious acts seem necessary and even virtuous , no doubt the Shin Bet officials who colluded with the PFLP did so thinking they were serving Israel ’s cause .
In any case , the " divide and conquer " strategy has always been the linchpin of Israel ’s strategy for survival , and this is true right up to the present day , when a U.S. - Israeli " redirection , " as Seymour Hersh calls it , is behind a recent pro-Sunni tilt designed to exacerbate the Sunni -Shi’ite split in the Muslim world .
The idea is to unite America ’s traditional allies in the Middle East against Iran and the rising " Shia crescent . "
" By way of deception , thou shalt make war "  that ’s the motto of the Mossad , Israeli ’s main intelligence agency , and it doubtless inspires its various auxiliaries , such as Shin Bet .
Israel , a small country beset by legions of hostile neighbors , has relied not only on its military prowess  often likened to that of Sparta , another completely militarized , socialist state  but also on pure duplicity to achieve its goals .
In evaluating Israel ’s actions , and especially in trying to understand what is going on in the Middle East , it is best to always keep this in mind .
When it comes to that troubled region , the realization that events are not always what they seem is the beginning of wisdom .

Rarely seen except in the hands of certain fundamental evangelicals , the elusive " Crocoduck " has been fabled to be the theological deal - breaker Christians demand to prove evolution is legitimate .
Here Way of the Master describes the Crocoduck .
Origins
The crocoduck was conceptualized by former child - star turned evangelist Kirk Cameron and his associate Ray Comfort .
They argue that the simple fact that we cannot see such obvious inter-species evolution today is evidence against evolution .
Criticism
The primary issue with this argument is that no academic with a post - doctorate degree in any relevant life science has ever claimed that evolution takes place in such an immediately obvious manner ( that is , in a pseudo - Chimera - esque manner ) .
In fact , all evolutionary biologists agree that evolution in such a manner ( known as " genetic saltation " ) is so monumentally improbable that , for all intents and purposes , it is considered impossible .
Any person with an adequate understanding of evolution ( read : neither Comfort nor Cameron ) will know that evolution does not occur in " leaps and bounds " , as the crocoduck implies .
The above issues are compounded by the fact that the crocoduck is only accepted as a logical attempt to debunk evolution by Ray Comfort , Kirk Cameron and their associates .
It also brings up the logical question of having to find similar examples of saltation , say dolphigiraffes .
Following that logic , we would have to find an example of saltation between the crocoduck and a dolphigiraffe ( a crocoduckodolphigiraffe ) .
It soon becomes clear that the crocoduck is simply an irrelevant , never - ending strawman .
There is no reason evolution would require a crocoduck ( or similar organism ) for the theory to be valid .
Even IF genetic saltation of this magnitude DID occur , there is yet another basic error made .
Ducks did not descend from crocodiles and crocodiles did not descend from ducks , making such a union between the two species completely illogical .
In fact , if a crocoduck * was * found , it would be evidence against evolution as we understand it rather than in support of it .

If President Bush does n't make himself dictator it's only because he chooses not to do so , not because he lacks the means .
Indeed , we are all walking the streets today at the pleasure of the two gentlemen in the White House former Nixon counsel John Dean calls " co-presidents " - and whose regime , he warns , is " a dangerous threat to democracy . " -
( Read Dean 's book , " Worse Than Watergate " - , published by Warner ) .
In fact , though , if anyone is pulling the strings to create a police state , it is Vice President Cheney .
The former Halliburton CEO is tied closely both to those creating a private army and to those building massive new detention facilities .
As Charlie Savage wrote in The Boston Globe last November 26 , " Cheney bypassed acts of Congress as defense secretary in the first Bush administration .
And his office has been the driving force behind the current administration 's hoarding of secrets , its efforts to impose greater political control over career officials , and its defiance of a law requiring the government to obtain warrants when wiretapping Americans .
Cheney 's staff has also been behind President Bush 's record number of signing statements asserting his right to disregard laws . " -
A chief architect of the " New American Century " - dogma , Cheney is no believer in international covenants .
Rather , he thinks nuclear and biological warfare are " options , " - has no qualms about violating Geneva 's proscription of torture , and justifies first - strike invasions .
In short , Dick Cheney is a man who will stop at nothing .
In running any prison , or any prison state , the Warden has got to control the " three P's " - ---- policy , plant , and personnel --- and the Bush - Cheney White House is rapidly reaching that point with USA .
Concerning policy , our compliant Congress voted Mr. Bush unlimited power to arrest any person on his own say - so .
Passage of the Military Commissions bill only provides support " for what the executive branch has already been doing over the past five years , " - writes Tom Head , author of About .
Com : Civil Liberties .
Head calls it " a terrible bill and should offend anyone who cares about human rights , regardless of party affiliation . " -
As for personnel , Naomi Wolf in her book " The End of America " - ( Chelsea Green ) points to Blackwater USA , of Moycock , N.C. , as " the world 's largest private security force ( that ) works closely with Halliburton , and is available for action outside the scrutiny of Congress . " -
Wolf writes that , as of fall 2006 , Blackwater " was on track to train thirty - five thousand men over the following twelve months . " -
And she continues , " Blackwater 's business model plans increasingly to deploy its unaccountable private army in the U.S. --- in the aftermath of natural disasters , and also in cases of " - national emergency . ' " -
Bill Mathews , Executive Vice President of Blackwater USA says the 35,000 people trained by Blackwater " were ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEN ( mostly from the Navy ) " - and that his company 's " primary business is training the US Military , much the same as Lockheed Martin , General Dynamics , Northrup Grumman , SAIC or many other government service providers . " -
Mathews says Blackwater employs " approximately 2,000 people working overseas " - and " Not all of these people are doing security work . " -
He points out " Some are cooks , trainers , and construction workers . " -
He goes on to say : " Blackwater has never done any work for or with KBR .
We performed one job which lasted about 60 days for one of their subcontractors in 2004 , but never anything else .
We do n't know any of their management , staff or personnel .
We have never bid on one of their contracts .
To say that we " - work closely ' together is not even close to the truth . " -
Mathews continues , " Sherwood , I realize there are people who do n't like US veterans ( yes , we are ALL US veterans ) serving their country in this capacity .
We would die defending your right to criticize us " - but I do n't think it 's too much to ask that you at least do a little research before putting pen to paper . " -
( Author 's Note :
The charge that KBR " works closely " - with Halliburton appears in Ms. Wolf 's book , which was quoted verbatim from page 74 .
The author appreciates Blackwater 's response and has reprinted it in its entirety .
Nowhere in this article , however , is there any statement by the author , who is a veteran , that he does not like US veterans . )
Halliburton KBR subsidiary got a $ 385 million Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) contract to build new detention facilities , so there 's your physical plant or plants in development .
KBR 's announcement gave no details as to where the prisons would be built or when --- a stunning omission from customary public relations work .
In January of last year , when KBR announced it contract for " temporary detention facilities " --- each of which can hold 5,000 prisoners --- the rationale given was an " immigration emergency . "
Yet , as Margaret Kimberley noted on ZNet , " Thanks to the Patriot Act and the creation of " enemy combatants ' these detention centers can be used to lock up anyone for any reason for any length of time that Uncle Sam wants . "
Halliburton , of course , is beholden to Cheney .
He is no longer CEO but he is so tied to his former firm he lied to conceal its illegal acts .
Cheney told ABC's Sam Donaldson that none of its subsidiaries prior to the invasion did business with Iraq .
The firm 's Vice Chairman Donald Vaughn later conceded a subsidiary did do just that , Dean writes , and The Washington Post showed Halliburton sold more than $ 73 million in oil production parts and equipment to Saddam Hussein , making it the Number One offender .
Thus , Cheney covers for Halliburton .
Again , is it really possible Bush - Cheney would create a police state in America ?
The above essay is conjecture , but what are Americans supposed to think when the co-presidents have lowered a Stalinist Iron Curtain of secrecy around their operations and covered it from coast to coast with a web of lies ?
After having lied the nation into a war of aggression that has killed more than a million human beings , the co-presidents have zero credibility , so why should anyone believe the creation of a private army and secret detention facilities on U.S. soil do not present a clear and present danger to Americans ?
In Dec. , 2003 , U.S. News & World Report issued a special report on administration secrecy , concluding , the Bush - Cheney actions are " a reversal of a decades - long trend of openness in government " - and have " placed large amounts of information out of the reach of ordinary citizens , " - including consumer information that is " critical health and safety information potentially affecting millions of Americans . " -
So ask yourself , what kinds of governments revel in secrecy , make illegal wars , lie to their Legislatures and refuse to execute their laws , open their citizens ' mail , listen in to their phone conversations , prevent or harass their travels , ban foreign scholars from entering , torture prisoners , violate humanitarian , nuclear and germ warfare treaties , build detention camps and use private armies ?
You know the answer .
It ’s sold as happiness in a blister pack - a cure - all that has changed the way we think about wellbeing .
As Prozac reaches its 20th birthday , Anna Moore presents 20 things you need to know about the most widely used antidepressant in the world
1 : Depression has deepened
In 1971 , when LY110141 - the compound that became Prozac - was developed , depression was rarely discussed and antidepressants largely restricted to the psychiatric unit .
People went to their GPs with ' anxiety ' and ' nerves ' .
Tranquillisers such as Valium were a likely response .
Eli Lilly , the company behind Prozac , originally saw an entirely different future for its new drug .
It was first tested as a treatment for high blood pressure , which worked in some animals but not in humans .
Plan B was as an anti-obesity agent , but this did n't hold up either .
When tested on psychotic patients and those hospitalised with depression , LY110141 - by now named Fluoxetine - had no obvious benefit , with a number of patients getting worse .
Finally , Eli Lilly tested it on mild depressives .
Five recruits tried it ; all five cheered up .
By 1999 , it was providing Eli Lilly with more than 25 per cent of its $ 10 bn revenue .
Fluoxetine was handed to Interbrand , the world 's leading branding company ( Sony , Microsoft , Nikon , Nintendo ) for an identity .
The name Prozac was picked for its zap : it sounded positive , professional , quick , proey , zaccy .
It was marketed in an easy - to - prescribe ' one pill , one dose for all ' formula and came when the medical profession and media were awash with horror stories about Valium addiction .
Prozac hit a society that was in the mood for it .
National campaigns ( supported by Eli Lilly ) alerted GPs and the public to the dangers of depression .
Eli Lilly funded 8 m brochures ( Depression : What you need to know ) and 200,000 posters .
Previous antidepressants were highly toxic , lethal if overdosed on and had other nasty side - effects .
Prozac was pushed as entirely safe , to be doled out by anyone .
It was the wonder drug , the easy answer , an instant up , neurological eldorado .
When launch day dawned , patients were already asking for it by name .
Twenty years on , Prozac remains the most widely used antidepressant in history , prescribed to 54 m people worldwide , and many feel they owe their lives to it .
It is prescribed for depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , panic disorder , eating disorders and premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( formerly known as PMT ) .
In the UK , between 1991 and 2001 , antidepressant prescriptions rose from 9 m to 24 m a year .
Strangely , depression has reached epidemic levels .
Money and success is no defence : writers , royalty , rock stars , supermodels , actors , middle managers have all had it .
Studies suggest that in America , depression more than doubled between 1991 and 2001 .
In the UK , an estimated one in six people will experience it - and it costs more than £ 9bn annually in treatment , benefits and lost revenue .
Meanwhile , according to the World Health Organisation , depression is set to become second only to heart disease as the world 's leading disability by 2020 .
2 : Bio-babble has replaced psychobabble
Serotonin was not well known 20 years ago .
Now , if you ask the person sitting beside you what it is , he or she may tell you it is linked to happiness , that levels get low in depressed people ... that Prozac tops them up ... so does chocolate ... or aerobics ... maybe yoga ...
Except it is n't strictly true .
Or has been repeatedly challenged .
And is yet to be proven .
According to David Healy , professor of psychiatry at Cardiff University and author of Let Them Eat Prozac , it 's pure ' bio - babble ' which has replaced the psychobabble of the Sixties and Seventies .
Healy spent a decade studying the neurotransmitter serotonin in depressed people and found little evidence to support the theory of ' chemical imbalance ' .
' The idea was forwarded in the Sixties - and the man behind it , Dr George Ashcroft , later took it back , ' says Healy .
' Through the Seventies and Eighties , it was seen as a simplistic idea ; now it 's seen as very convenient - it sounds so neat .
There 's something in you that 's low that needs to be put right .
It makes you happier to take a drug . '
( Witness Brooke Shields , who described it as ' comforting ' to discover her depression was ' directly tied to a biochemical shift ' .
Or the writer Lauren Slater in Prozac Diaries describing Prozac as 'a drug with the precision of a scud missile , launched miles from its target only to land , with a proud flare , right on the enemy 's roof ' . )
Prozac is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ) .
Previous tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) worked on three neurotransmitters associated with mood ( serotonin , dopamine and noradrenaline ) whereas Prozac just concentrates on one : serotonin .
' The idea that it 's been a major step forward for Prozac to select serotonin only is just hypothesis , ' says Malcolm Lader , professor of clinical psychopharmacology at the Institute of Psychiatry .
' There 's no science behind it . '
The theory that emotions are governed by serotonin levels is highly simplistic and works just as well the other way around ( ie , our emotions , our stress levels alter our brain chemistry , so it 's at least a two - way street ) .
Other important factors that contribute to depression include life experience , family history , hormones and diet .
However , the oft - repeated ' chemical imbalance ' theory ( the fault is not in ourselves , but in our precious bodily fluids ) is promoted on depression websites owned by drug companies and in advertising .
And just like scuds , Prozac turned out to be less precise than originally supposed .
Experiences with it range from miraculous to mediocre .
The writer Zoe Heller found that within weeks of taking it , she stopped crying and could get out of bed .
Others describe it as a detached benevolence , or a comforting numbness .
It makes some people feel anxious , agitated and unable to sleep .
There are those who stop taking it , as they feel no effect at all .
Interestingly , reports gained through the Freedom of Information act revealed that in half the 47 trials used to approve the six leading antidepressants , the drugs failed to outperform the sugar pills .
When they did , it was by only two points on a 52 - point depression rating .
Frosties , anyone ?
3 : You never too young
Enter liquid Prozac in peppermint flavour .
In the US , a survey of drug companies found that between 1995 and 1999 , use of Prozac - like drugs for children aged seven to 12 increased by 151 per cent , and in those aged under six by 580 per cent .
In 2004 , children aged five and under were America 's fastest - growing segment of the non-adult population using antidepressants .
' Selective mutism ' ( fear of speaking in social situations ) is one affliction common in preschoolers and has been treated with Prozac .
In the UK , too , the trend has been upwards .
Between 1992 and 2001 , prescriptions of SSRIs for under - 18s increased tenfold - despite the fact that none has a licence for use in children .
In 2003 , the NHS warned against all SSRIs in under - 18s except Prozac , after studies showed they rarely performed better than a placebo , and came with disturbing side - effects .
In America , the SSRIs , including Prozac , now carry a ' black box ' warning that the drugs could increase suicidal behaviour in children .
It 's thought that prescriptions are falling in both countries as a result .
4 : Animals are in on it too
Romain Pizzi , specialist in zoo and wildlife medicine for the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons ( RCVS ) , remembers prescribing Prozac to Mercedes , Edinburgh Zoo 's polar bear .
' We ca n't say it 's " depression " [ the bear was suffering ] but it 's abnormal behaviour , a coping mechanism for animals held out of their natural habitat , ' says Pizzi .
' Polar bears wake from hibernation and travel long distances in search of food - their instinct is to roam .
Every spring , Mercedes would wake up ready for a massive migration and she 'd start swimming and pacing a particular route , wearing her fur and skin down as she rubbed it in the same place .
Large cats do the same , pacing , shaking their heads .
Antidepressants dampen down some of the behaviour and , hopefully , reduce the stress . '
Pet parrots are also on the receiving end of antidepressants because they are highly intelligent birds that self - mutilate if bored , while cats and dogs may suffer from stress or separation anxieties .
' A dog ca n't sit on the sofa and discuss his worries , but he can howl the house down or chase his tail or chew everything to pieces , ' says Mark Johnston , an RCVS specialist in small animals .
' Urinary marking is common in cats - it could be because he 's being beaten up by other cats or another cat is coming in through the cat - flap . '
If training and behaviour modification are unsuccessful , about one in 10 animal patients will be given antidepressants .
Reconcile is a newly launched beef - flavoured version of Prozac aimed at dogs .
' Drugs may sound drastic - but it could literally save their lives , ' says Johnston .
' If you 've got a dog that 's persistently aggressive , you wo n't put up with it for long .
The last option is euthanasia . '
5 : Pain is the new pleasure
Prozac 's high celebrity uptake helped make SSRIs the It - drug of the Nineties - the pharmaceutical Fendi bag .
Where once celebrities sought to hide their depression - Marilyn Monroe , Audrey Hepburn , Vivien Leigh - the Prozac era has helped wipe away the stigma .
Depression is part of the job description - celebrities are expected to suffer somehow , then preferably write about it in an autobiography ( Ulrika Jonsson , Kerry Katona , Gazza ) or talk about it ( Winona Ryder , Dame Kelly Holmes , Melinda Messenger , Johnny Depp , Gail Porter , most comedians and half the cast of EastEnders ) or be treated in Arizona clinics for addiction to antidepressants ( Robbie Williams ) .
Most usefully , their empty Prozac prescription bottles can be collected as pop art ( Debbie Harry ) .
Prozac has also featured in some tragic celebrity headlines .
Michael Hutchence was found to have taken the drug when he committed suicide .
Diego Cogolato murdered designer Ossie Clark while psychotic on a mix of Prozac and amphetamines .
Anna Nicole Smith died after what is thought to be an accidental overdose of prescription drugs - including Prozac .
Five months earlier her son Daniel had died after mixing two SSRI antidepressants with methadone .
Her dog , Sugarpie , was also on Prozac .
6 : Prozactly , prozacted , prozactive , prozaction
Prozac is now in the dictionary , no more a slavish noun but a fully fledged adjective with rights of its own .
According to the Cambridge Advanced Learner 's Dictionary , someone lively and excited may safely be described as ' on Prozac ' .
7 : Booked on Prozac
Elizabeth Wurtzel 's Prozac Nation placed the drug firmly on the literary map in 1994 .
At that point , Wurtzel was 26 and had everything her generation was supposed to want ( long legs , long hair , rich friends , glib friends , false friends , smart remarks and a loft apartment in Greenwich Village ) , but she 'd suffered depression for as long as she could remember ( she first attempted suicide at summer camp , aged 12 ) .
Her memoir starts with her parents ' unhappy marriage and leads to countless breakdowns , hit - and - miss lithium prescriptions and hopeless love affairs .
At the same time , though , Wurtzel gets into Harvard , wins a Rolling Stone college journalism award , works as an arts reporter , drives around England in a BMW and lives an impossibly cool rock 'n ' roll life of the sort only hallucinogens can provide .
The story ends on a high note with Wurtzel given a diagnosis of ' atypical depression ' treatable with a new drug called Prozac .
In the final pages , she feels safe in her skin , looking forward to each day - ' the black wave ' has gone .
The New York Times dubbed Wurtzel ' Sylvia Plath with the ego of Madonna ' , while NME described the book as having ' the same relevance and resonance as On The Road , Catch - 22 and Generation X ' .
A massive hit , it brought home the latest dead - end whinge of youth culture and showed that being young , cool and gifted in the Nineties could still leave you cold ; but worry not , there was now an answer - in green and cream capsule form .
Unfortunately , the story was hard to put down .
Seven years later , Wurtzel was still taking Prozac but also addicted to Ritalin , pornography and tweezing her leg hairs .
Now she wrote about them in a less gripping , less successful More , Now , Again .
By the time the film of Prozac Nation was made , starring Christina Ricci as Wurtzel and Jessica Lange as her mother , America 's love affair with Wurtzel was over and it went straight to DVD .
She is now a student at Yale Law School .
More memoirs followed , including Lauren Slater 's Prozac Diary ( 1998 ) , which starts when she takes the drug and is finally freed from her OCD , which had resulted in suicide attempts , self - mutilation and five hospitalisations .
After a decade on Prozac , she had a doctorate from Harvard , and was a writer , teacher and a wife .
A more recent addition was Brooke Shields 's Down Came the Rain , an account of her struggle with postnatal depression , in which she was saved not by Prozac , but Seroxat , another SSRI which followed like a pilot fish in Prozac 's unsleeping wake .
8 : Tom Cruise vs Brooke Shields
In May 2005 , Tom Cruise was promoting War of the Worlds and Shields was promoting Down Came the Rain .
Scientologists are vehemently opposed to all forms of psychiatry .
( According to L Ron Hubbard , psychiatrists are corrupt , barbaric and also members of a worldwide conspiracy bent on creating a government on behalf of Soviet Russia . )
On NBC's Today show , Cruise took this theory a stage further and launched a personal attack on Brooke Shields , calling her ' irresponsible ' for praising an antidepressant when vitamins and exercise would have cured her .
Papers and pundits debated before the anxious eyes of the world , polls polled ( ' Is Scientology killing Cruise 's career ? ' ; ' Should Cruise and Shields kiss and make up ? ' ) , Brooke Shields suggested Cruise stick to saving the world from aliens and let women with postnatal depression decide what treatment options are best for them .
Watching at home was Paula Fortunato , wife of Sumner Redstone , chairman of Viacom ( the enormous media company behind Paramount ) .
She told her husband that Cruise 's rant had turned female fans against him .
Three months later , Cruise was fired after 14 years with the studio .
' Paula , like women everywhere , had come to hate him , ' Redstone told Vanity Fair .
' The truth of the matter is I did listen to her .
His behaviour was entirely unacceptable to Paula and to the rest of the world .
He just did n't turn one woman off .
He turned off all women , and a lot of men . '
9 Vanilla Ice is ' crazy like Prozac '
Vanilla Ice's ' Prozac ' track featured in his strange 1998 comeback album Hard to Swallow , where he ditched his rap - for - teeny - boppers persona and came over all tattooed , pierced and head banging .
There was a slight confusion over the lyrics ( ' We gets crazy like Prozac / Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack ' ) , which seemed to be referring to a strong stimulant rather than a drug widely thought to be calming .
It was suggested that Vanilla Ice - who has been treated for both depression and attention deficit disorder - got his prescriptions muddled .
One interviewer tried to clarify things with the singer .
' It confused me a little because " Crazy like Ritalin " is closer to what you guys do .
You know , jumping around like you 're hopped up on stimulants . '
' Yeah , that would work too , ' agreed Vanilla Ice .
The interviewer persisted : ' To me , Prozac would mellow you out , and you 're certainly not mellow on this record . '
Vanilla
Ice replied , ' That 's what Prozac does for you , you get crazy and you need Prozac .
Crazy , like people on Prozac . '
So that clears that up .
10 : The ills are alive ...
Prozac musical influences are also hinted at by Prozac Ruin ( thought to be the best punk - rock band in Llanelli ) and Housewives on Prozac ( rock 'n ' roll mothers whose opuses include advice on fine dining : ' Eat Your Own Damn Spaghetti ' and the slightly antisocial composition ' I Only Wanna Pee Alone ' ) .
Prozac songs are in strong supply : ' Prozac Smile ' ( The Dead Stars on Holiday ) , ' Daddy's on Prozac ' ( Joseph Arthur ) ; ' All My Friends Are on Prozac ' ( Suffering and the Hideous Thieves ) and ' Prozac vs Heroin ' ( The Brian Jonestown Massacre ) .
Those of us with philosophical inclinations can reflect on the brevity of human existence with ' That Prozac Moment ' ( Mr T Experience ) .
11 : The Prozac diet plan
Prozac has long been rumoured to help weight loss .
Louise , 44 , from Kent , was prescribed it for depression , but stayed on it longer than was strictly necessary when she found it suppressed her appetite .
' It was a very mild cocaine sort of feeling , an amphetamine speedy thing , ' she says .
' I did n't get hungry and I was always doing stuff .
I lost nearly a stone .
My sister bought some online when she saw what it did to me . '
Brazilian Diet Pills , also widely available on the internet , contain fluoxetine , Prozac 's active ingredient .
In America , some doctors now prescribe Prozac to treat obesity - though it has n't been approved for this purpose .
The weight - loss company Nutrisystem also launched a diet programme , ' Phen - Pro ' - a combination of Phentermine and Prozac - despite Eli Lilly 's strong reservations .
In fact , trials have suggested that Prozac can result in an average , short - term weight loss of up to 7lb 4 oz in obese patients .
However , it has also been associated with weight gain after the initial loss of appetite wears off .
( Louise is now the weight she was before taking them . )
Weight gain on SSRIs is a popular topic in depression chatrooms .
12 : Less sex
Though it can take 10 years for a drug to win its licence , the actual controlled , scientific studies used in evidence often last just four to six weeks .
It 's not surprising , then , that the existence or extent of most side - effects surface only after drugs have been taken up and tested in their millions by the general public .
Sexual dysfunction has turned out to be one of Prozac 's hidden extras .
Sarah , a 36 - year - old stylist from London , who takes Prozac for panic attacks , has had a fairly typical experience .
' It has cured me and calmed me , but I have n't had an orgasm since the day I started , ' she says .
' I still want to cuddle , but beyond that , I feel no physical arousal at all .
Nothing .
It 's a trade - off .
My partner can't decide which me he prefers .
The neurotic , weeping basketcase who still enjoyed sex a few times a week or the calm and collected one that 's completely frigid . '
The implications go beyond mere sex .
According to Helen Fisher , anthropologist and author of Why We Love : The Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love , SSRIs could seriously impede our ability to fall and stay in love .
The bliss we feel when we 're loved up - that elation , exhilaration and slight insanity - are the result of high levels of dopamine .
SSRIs increase serotonin and curb dopamine .
The result is that anti-love feeling , a contented , non-discriminatory ' well , whatever ' .
Though initial tests put sexual dysfunction as present in fewer than 30 per cent of cases , the figure is now generally accepted to be more than 60 per cent , and a recent study put it at 98 per cent .
With 54 m people taking Prozac worldwide , that 's a lot of sexual dysfunction .
Symptoms include decreased or absent libido , delayed or absent orgasm , impotence or reduced semen volume in men and reduced vaginal lubrication in women .
13 : More sex
On the upside , Prozac is now offered to men suffering from premature ejaculation .
14 : Lives lost
Prozac has been persistently dogged by claims that it can trigger suicide - not just in depressives but also in healthy volunteers .
Some SSRI users have reported agitation and an inability to keep still , a preoccupation with violent , self - destructive fantasies and a feeling that ' death would be welcome ' .
In Germany , Prozac was initially refused a licence after trials resulted in 16 attempted suicides , two of which were successful .
The SSRIs have made hundreds of court appearances .
The first big case was in 1989 , when Joseph Wesbecker walked through the Standard Gravure printing plant in Louisville , Kentucky with an AK47 , killing eight employees , then himself .
Wesbecker had been on the newly licensed Prozac less than a month and had become increasingly agitated .
The families of those killed sued Eli Lilly but agreed to a secret settlement .
More followed .
After six days on Prozac , Patricia Williamson , 60 , killed herself in her bath in Texas while her husband ate breakfast downstairs .
Eli Lilly settled out of court .
Don Schell had been on Seroxat ( marketed as Paxil in America ) for 48 hours when he shot his wife , his daughter , his nine - month - old granddaughter and himself at his home in Wyoming .
Schell 's son - in - law was awarded $ 8 m by manufacturers SmithKline .
In the UK , Reginald Payne , a retired teacher from Cornwall , suffocated his wife then he jumped off a cliff after 11 days on Prozac .
His sons issued court proceedings against Eli Lilly .
In Losing a Child , Linda Hurcombe describes the impact of her 19 - year - old daughter Caitlin 's suicide .
Caitlin , from rural Shropshire , had asked her GP for Prozac , as she was feeling down ; she had also heard it could help her lose weight .
She had marked the subsequent days in her diary ' PZ Days ' .
David Healy , who has testified as an expert witness against both Eli Lilly and SmithKline , estimates SSRIs can produce suicidal thoughts in one in 500 users .
15 : Lives saved
According to most psychiatrists , the risk of not taking an antidepressant when suffering depression far outweighs any risks of taking them .
For many users , the drugs can restore , even save , lives .
Though depression appears to be on the increase , in this Prozac - enriched era the UK suicide rate - 8.5 deaths per 100,000 - is actually at its lowest level since records began .
Carmine Pariante , consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry , is sceptical of the claim that SSRIs carry a special suicide trigger .
' I remember having to be very vigilant in the first weeks of prescribing the old antidepressants , simply because before taking them , patients could be too low to commit suicide .
They were then given a lift and possibly had the energy to put a plan into action . '
The Institute of Psychiatry 's Malcolm Lader agrees it is hard to prove , calling it ' a small signal against a very noisy background ' .
Interestingly , there is also evidence that SSRIs lower non-suicide death rates in depressed patients .
A study from Finland published in the British Medical Journal found antidepressants could reduce incidents of strokes and heart attacks .
16 : Brushes with Prozac
The artist Stella Vine ( right ) named her 2004 exhibition , which featured such troubled subjects as Sylvia Plath and Courtney Love , after the drug .
Vine - the former stripper now famous for her vivid , haunted portraits of Princess Diana , Kate Moss and the heroin victim Rachel Whitear - has herself yo-yoed on Prozac , finding it has both enabled her to function but blunted her painting .
' I remember when I was working as a nightclub hostess , one of the girls showed me her writing and it was really incredible .
I asked why she had stopped and she said she started taking Prozac and could n't write any more , ' says Vine .
' I thought I 'd never make that trade - off . '
In 2001 , though , Vine did ask her GP for antidepressants .
' I 've always been a highs - and - lows person , but this time , I was very , very depressed , just about doing the basics , the whole world collapsing , and when I started on Prozac , there was an incredible rush , ' she recalls .
' I ate less , had more energy , I was speeding around the park with my dog , ecstatic to talk to the other dog walkers .
It breaks the cycle of sitting on the sofa thinking about suicide , but in a way , it 's a waste of time .
Nothing is being sorted out and healed . '
Vine describes herself on Prozac as a ' la - di - da , hazy version ' .
' I can paint the outline of a person , but I can't engage with any emotion in it , ' she says .
' The really good work takes place when I 'm not on Prozac .
It 's hard to describe , but it 's more vivid and intense , a heightened awareness .
I may have finished several undercoats and I get this great moment of absolute clarity .
Suddenly I know what will make the whole thing work .
That never happens on Prozac . '
Prozac 's effect on creativity has been much debated - usually with the starter question ' What if Van Gogh had taken Prozac ? '
Perhaps he'd have given up art and become a life coach .
Another possibility is that we'd now have more of his paintings .
17 : Dilute to taste
In 2004 , Prozac was discovered in our drinking water .
The Environment Agency said the drug was building up in British rivers and ground - water supplies , probably via the sewage system .
Some used it as evidence that Prozac was overprescribed .
The Lib Dems called it ' a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public ' .
The government 's Drinking Water Inspectorate said the quantities were too diluted to have an effect ( and poured themselves yet another glass , laughing maniacally through rolling eyeballs ) .
18 : Prozac by post
Chicago artist Michael Hernandez de Luna created the fake Prozac stamp and successfully mailed it through the US postal system .
Other de Luna stamps include an obese fast - food - fed Barbie doll and Monica Lewinsky 's stained blue dress .
19 : Enter Viagra
Pre-Prozac , drugs had names that were scientific and which referred to their compound .
Prozac 's branding and direct - to - consumer advertising , which has ultimately blurred ' ordinary life ' with ' treatable illness ' , proved a valuable lesson in drug pushing .
Enter Viagra , part medical treatment for sexual dysfunction , part lifestyle drug for sexual enhancement .
Within two weeks of Viagra going on sale in the US , doctors were writing 40,000 prescriptions a day .
20 Goodbye Prozac , hello Cymbalta
All good things come to an end , though , and in 2001 , Prozac lost its patent .
Eli Lilly lost $ 35 m of its market value in one day - and 90 per cent of its Prozac prescriptions in a single year .
Eli Lilly has now come back with Cymbalta , which it hopes will be the next Prozac .
This was approved by America 's Food & Drug Administration despite another very shaky start .
Traci Johnson , a healthy 19 - year - old college student , hung herself in the Eli Lilly laboratory while testing the drug at high doses , in return for $ 150 a day .
Cymbalta is a painkiller and antidepressant combined because , according to its logo , ' Depression Hurts ' .
Read all about it , carry out a self - assessment checklist and watch some inspiring real - life stories on www.cymbalta.com
The high celebrity uptake made it the It - drug of the Nineties .
And where once celebrities sought to hide their depression , Prozac helped wipe away the stigma
Prozac 's effect on creativity is much debated - often with the question ' What if Van Gogh had taken Prozac ? '
Perhaps he'd have given up and become a life coach .
Another possibility is we'd have more of his paintings .

Earlier this evening , I spotted a roach in my apartment .
The brazen bastard walked around like he owned the place , ignoring me even as I picked up my shoe and prepared to crush him .
Well , he 's gone , but of course roaches have friends , so it was on .
My wife hates bugs , and her problems become my problems .
She 's out of town , allowing me to take swift action without her needing to know about the roach I hunted and killed .
I headed out to Duane Reade to purchase roach poison , the kind the bastards carry back to their nests , thereby serving as my tools of destruction .
Poison in hand , I saw with disappointment a long line facing the register , at which a manager was helping a cashier with some sort of problem .
Good news for the roaches , whose death was briefly delayed .
Moments later , you too discovered the long line .
Unlike the rest of us , who suffered our disappointment silently , you loudly asked ( of whom I cannot say ) for permission to cut the line .
It turns out this is n't Mayberry , and a woman near the front of the line replied .
" No , " she said .
You then tried to hit on her in a ham - fisted fashion , asking if that was her " real hair . "
Eventually you moseyed to the back of the line , which had lengthened during your pathetic attempt at courtship .
( By the way , your focus on hair was especially amusing considering your long blond hair , two - day beard , and blazer .
You were sporting the " Kid Rock at the country club " look . )
Then our troubles began .
You commenced a barrage of annoying comments directed at the " No " woman , suggesting at one point that you would gladly be " a piece of trash crushed by [ her ] boot . "
This is America , and you 're entitled to your fantasies , even of a " crushing " nature .
But keep it together , son !
You were in public , speaking loudly to a stranger seven - or - so people ahead of you in a Duane Reade line .
Muttering to yourself " This is n't working ; she does n't like me at all , " while perhaps meant to be endearing in a cute , self - deprecating way , did not make up for the awkwardness you created .
People in line winced as you continued to embarrass yourself .
Eventually , the manager solved the cashier 's problem and opened a second register .
Things started moving , albeit slowly .
Your comments continued unchecked .
" Can we get married ?
I love you . "
Really , have some self - respect .
You went on at such length that I recalled those experiments showing that the larger the crowd , the less likely anyone is to help during a crisis .
After all , surely that other guy will confront the loudmouthed Kid Rock clone at Duane Reade --- why should I get involved ?
Was I in a psych experiment ?
If you turn out to be a graduate student of human behavior , please accept my apologies for this rant .
I could stand it no more .
The manager 's slowness had allowed you to subject the woman to one too many obnoxious utterances , and I turned to you and said , " I know this is New York , and people generally mind their own business , but could you give it a rest ? " " No , " you said .
" Are you gonna punch me and make me stop ? " " Probably not , " I replied .
I think we all would have bet good sums that I was n't going to punch you .
I certainly it was n't worth a night in jail and risk to my law license just to teach you some manners that Joe C neglected to share with you before shuffling off this mortal coil .
What would I tell my cellmates in the Tombs , " I 'm here ' cause I punched some pantywaist at Duane Reade ? "
I do n't think so .
I would have needed to cook up some more exciting story , which some jailhouse snitch would have repeated in hopes of a reduced sentence .
And it would have been just my luck that whatever nonsense I made up ( " I killed a clown in Union Square for looking funny at my cilantro . " ) would have actually happened last weekend , leading to my arraignment and unemployment .
Yes , yes , I 'd have gotten the indictment dismissed eventually when the real clown killer came to light , but that would n't get me my job back , would it ?
And my picture in thebelow the screaming headline " FANCYPANT $ LAWYER BRAINS MIME WITH BRIEFCASE " would have linked me with clown murder indelibly in the public mind , which is n't easy to live with .
Regardless , you do n't even know I have a law license , and for all you know I like fighting people at Duane Reade .
You could n't be sure , could you ?
So you quieted down for a while .
Then , as the woman headed for the door , her purchases in hand , you muttered all - too - loudly , " She 's hot , and I have a right to say so .
" Finally , something we can agree on .
She is hot , or at least cute ; I did n't get a good look at the front of her , what with her working so hard to avoid making eye contact with some idiot behind me in line .
Your legal reasoning skills , however , leave much to be desired .
Before you mail your application for a faculty post in First Amendment law at Columbia , consider this :
Her being attractive does not provide you with a license to harass and humiliate her .
Every time a woman hesitates before walking outside wearing something flattering , people like you are the cause .
I wonder if she considered whether her Duane Reade trip was all that urgent , if maybe she should n't walk out after midnight but should wait until tomorrow instead .
If she did , you and your ilk were part of her concern .
I for one enjoy seeing women walking the streets in attractive garb .
My personal taste aside , women --- like everyone else --- should be free to walk around without being bugged by morons .
So pull yourself together .
Leave the nice women alone , find your dignity , and stop making problems for the rest of us .
Sincerely Yours , A Man More Annoyed with You than with Roaches , Which Is Saying Something
Lawrence Ferlinghetti's poem " Underwear " begins , " I did n't get much sleep last night thinking about underwear . "
The recent statutes outlawing public display of undergarments passed by several Louisiana towns ( and being considered in Georgia , New Jersey , and Connecticut ) show that Mr. Ferlinghetti is not alone .
City officials are especially concerned about young men whose sagging trousers expose their boxers because , the lawmakers claim , the style originated in prison , where belts are not permitted .
The American Civil Liberties Union opposes such laws as violations of the First Amendment ; others object because the laws tend to single out young black men , a group already subjected to considerable cultural suspicion and state scrutiny ; and still others think dress codes are plain silly and unenforceable .
Whether or not those who wear sagging pants are celebrating crime and headed for trouble , one thing is certain : American teenagers love to bug their elders , and clothing has long been a great way to do that .
State attempts to control who wears what also have a long history .
Kings issued edicts to prevent the rising bourgeoisie from wearing the silks and furs only those of noble birth previously had the wealth to display .
( We all know how that turned out . )
In the 19th century , laws against cross-dressing spread across the US , as did rules prescribing dress at workplaces and schools .
Some mayors in the early 20th century tried to prohibit women wearing sports " knickerbockers " in public .
And it was only in 1993 that California prohibited employers from requiring female workers to wear dresses .
Recent images of Iranian fashion police humiliating men wearing jeans and T - shirts and hounding women deemed inappropriately dressed are chilling evidence that state regulation of dress remains a means of social control .
Despite strait - laced regulations , underwear as outerwear began well before Madonna made the display of a bra strap de rigueur rather than dreaded .
In the supposedly sexually repressed Victorian era , women could not avoid – and some surely enjoyed – displaying their ruffled drawers under their swaying hoop skirts .
Similarly , the rustling of silk petticoats was an everyday , yet suggestive , event .
In the 1920s , lingerie scenes in movies became commonplace .
Joan Crawford in 1928 's " Our Dancing Daughters " went further , ripping off her skirt to dance more freely in the " step-ins " – underpants similar to today 's shorts – she wore beneath her flapper fringe .
In the 1930s , body - hugging bias slips were often indistinguishable from the slinky dresses worn with or , as in Jean Harlow 's case , without them .
As consumer culture took off , bold ads and retail displays put underwear on newspaper pages and in shop windows .
We also " see " underwear on a daily basis , even if worn in ways that would n't trigger arrest and fines in Louisiana : lace - trimmed camisoles , corset tops , and the unavoidable thong .
And in some cases , even what you do n't see directly , you 're well aware is there : Consider , for example , push - up bras or the infamous visible panty line .
In this light , the recent antiunderwear statutes do appear discriminatory .
Several decades ago , my leggy teenage sister wore " hot pants " to Friday night services at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino , Calif .
A congregant complained .
Rabbi Harold Schulweis later told us he had replied , " You should look into her eyes , not at what she 's wearing . "
Those who support criminalizing fashion need to face the more challenging job of looking into the eyes of young people and dealing with the real problems the debates about these fashions raise : the sweatshops where they are made , the educational and career opportunities of the young men who wear them , and the conditions in prisons where the style supposedly originated .
Sagging pants are a goofy American fad ; the problems they represent are n't .
Officials should stop trying to pull up young men's pants and take time to listen to this youthful fashion statement .

Close to a third of women report not being turned on by sex .
The news has neuroscientists scanning women 's brains during masturbation , while pharmacorps scurry to develop drugs , skin patches and potions to notch up libidos .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Vancouver - based sex researcher Dr. Lori Brotto says low sex drive is n't caused by physiological wiring and plumbing problems , but by a psychological mind - body disconnect .
In other words , our minds too often have no clue what our vaginas are doing .
And Brotto's key weapon to bridge that gap is the ancient Eastern technique called mindfulness .
Buddhists have practiced this type of meditation for thousands of years and Western doctors have recently adapted it as a support treatment for patients with cancer , chronic pain , attention deficit disorders and anxiety but Brotto and her colleague Julia Heiman , director of the famed Kinsey Institute , are the first to use mindfulness for sexual disorders .
Turning off the background chatter
It starts with a raw egg .
In a group therapy session , her patients have to balance the egg on one end on a tabletop .
" That 's really difficult to do , " says Brotto , who opened The UBC Sexual Health Lab in 2005 .
" But even harder than that , especially for women , is learning to turn off the background chatter and focus on sexuality .
They 're always multi-tasking , even during sex .
The egg exercise introduces the concept of mindfulness : focusing all your attention to one task , being 100 per cent wakeful and attentive , in the present , but also relaxed . "
After her patients , ranging in age from 19 to 70 , master the egg balance , Brotto moves on to " body scan exercises " done in group therapy and in daily life .
" As distracting , annoying or otherwise irrelevant thoughts come up , you put them on a conveyor belt , notice them roll by and bring your senses back to the present moment , " she says .
After several weeks of training , Brotto shifts focus below the belt , first as a sort of ice - breaking get - to - know your vagina exercise .
" That means looking at and touching her genitals , not creating arousal , " reminds Brotto .
" Concentrate on the sensations and simultaneously note any distracting thoughts coming up , so that she stays focused on the present .
That 's actually a really difficult exercise to do .
A lot of women have n't even really looked at their genitals , so we often spend a fair bit of time on that . "
Lots of homework
The next stage involves a lot of homework : " reading a fantasy , watching erotica for a few minutes or using a vibrator which should pretty reliably bring about her arousal , " says Brotto who was introduced to sex research while studying the sexual lives of rats at UBC .
" Then the goal is to stop after a few minutes and do a mindfulness exercise .
By first exciting her body , she can then tune into her sexual sensations even more .
Then we talk about how to incorporate that with a partner when all of their relationship factors are at stake : worrying about performance , how your partner is reacting , all the cognitive stuff , like rationalizing the choice to have sex in the first place because he took the trash out , etc .
It is a gradual progression towards being more mindful in our sexual lives . "
Graduation day
The course actually begins and ends with a test .
In the " arousal room " at Brotto's lab , women are hooked up to a vaginal photoplethysmograph that monitors " vaginal pulse amplitude " while they watch erotic videos , interspliced with non-erotic footage to show baseline responses .
Initial tests almost always indicate that women with sexual arousal disorders " will genitally respond to erotic videos even if they report that they did n't feel turned on , " according to Brotto .
" It 's proof of the de-synchronicity between mind and body with many women . "
So far , 70 women have graduated from Brotto 's mindfulness program .
Post - mindfulness training , both the physiological and subjective tests scores -- measured through questionnaires -- improve for a significant majority of her patients .
But competitive types take note : there 's no such thing as an ideal or even an average score ; the tests are done to track post - therapy changes , so the goal is not to compare one patient with another .
" We spend far too much time worrying about whether we 're ' normal ' or good enough , " says Brotto .
" Mindfulness is about cutting out that kind of noise and tapping into what your body is doing . "
Brotto has 23 sexuality studies currently in the works and just received a five - year provincial grant to beef up her mindfulness program .
In 2008 , she 'll also start an online educational course for women in remote spots and plans to add male students to her programs since up to 34 per cent of men report sexual disorders .
" We 're such an eroto - phobic culture and it takes a lot of work to change our internalized attitudes about sexuality , " says Brotto , who hopes everyone puts sexual health on the 2008 resolution list .
" Sexuality is a quality of life issue , not this dirty , taboo thing .
Why do we have so many hang - ups about something we all value as important ?
Ultimately we all just want to love and be loved .
If people are sexually happier , they 'll be happier in general .
It 's the new anti-depressant . "

Tyee stories :
I 'm honoured you remember it !
That was some time ago .
How are you doing these days .
Good to see that you draw .
If you ever need pointers ... feel free .
By Will Grant
BBC News , Miami
Hero . Rebel . Revolutionary .
These are words one often hears in association with Ernesto Che Guevara .
Felix Rodriguez poses with Che shortly before Che was killed
Felix Rodriguez
One of those anti-Che voices in Miami belongs to Felix Rodriguez , a Cuban - born former CIA agent who was part of the mission of CIA operatives and Bolivian army forces that captured and killed Che Guevara in October 1967 .
Forty years on , how does he feel about the role he played in ending the life of one of the most iconic Latin American leaders of the 20th Century ?
I visited the ex-CIA man at his Miami home .
He was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the logo of the 2506 Association of the Veterans of the Bay of Pigs , another of his earlier military incursions against the Cuban government .
Pride
Mr Rodriguez was present at some of the most notorious events of US anti-communist involvement in Latin America during the Cold War , including training the Nicaraguan Contras and advising the Argentine military government during the 1980s .
It is a history of which Mr Rodriguez is fiercely proud .
Felix Rodriguez relayed the order to shoot Che Guevara
But it was his short time in Bolivia with Che Guevara that interested me .
Sitting by his pool , Felix Rodriguez showed me his Che scrapbook .
Inside were the yellowing and fragile pages of his log - book from October 1967 : the expenses of every day meticulously recorded , each one within the $ 14 daily allowance from the CIA ; a page from Che 's code book , supposedly designed by the Chinese government , with a fresh code for each different message .
Reader L A Heath sent this image of a Che poster in Havana
Your Che pictures Send us your images
And the most important item : a photograph of a captured , injured and bedraggled Che Guevara , standing next to the soldiers who had caught him and the 27 - year - old Felix Rodriguez , who had interrogated him .
Was n't that humiliating for Che ?
" No , I do n't think so .
Actually , I think he felt when the picture was taken that his life was going to be spared .
I think he felt that he was n't going to be shot , " Mr Rodriguez said .
Death warrant
According to Mr Rodriguez 's version of events , the atmosphere was so friendly that Che willingly agreed to the photograph and even laughed when Rodriguez said : " Watch the birdie , Comandante " .
Che Guevara came to Bolivia after trying to foment revolution in Africa
Felix Rodriguez received the order from the Bolivian military high command .
There was a simple code : 500 meant Che Guevara , 600 dead , 700 alive .
500 - 600 was the command .
Mr Rodriguez wanted confirmation on the crackly radio line .
It was repeated : 500 - 600 .
Mr Rodriguez broke the news to Che that there was to be no trial .
" Che turned white ... before saying : ' It 's better this way , I should have died in combat . ' "
Man v legend
Mr Rodriguez ordered the soldier who pulled the trigger to aim carefully , to remain consistent with the Bolivian government 's story that Che had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army .
But was n't Che entitled to a fair trial rather than such an ignominious death in La Higuera ?
" I could have tried to falsify the command to the troops , and got Che to Panama as the US government said they had wanted , " said Mr Rodriguez .
But he said it was a decision by the Bolivian presidency , and he had to let history run its course .
By killing Che Guevara the man , did n't Mr Rodriguez think he had simply helped create something much more powerful - Che Guevara the legend ?
Memories of Che Guevara abound in this corner of Bolivia
After Che was killed , there was some argument over who should have his pipe .
The iconic pipe belonging to the most famous guerrilla in the world .
What young soldier there on that day would n't want it ?
Felix Rodriguez says it was in his possession but , after being asked several times , he gave it to the soldier who had shot Che so that he would " remember his deed " .
So did Mr Rodriguez have any regrets about what happened in 1967 , I asked him .
Yes , he smiled .
" I would have kept that pipe . "

先月、 ぐるなび API がリリースされていました。 ぐるなびさんの持っている膨大なデータベース に
Web API を通して気軽にア クセスできるようになったのは、非常に喜ばしいし、その英断に感謝したいと 思います 。
しかし 、Web API 仕様書、特にエラー仕様を見てちょっとがっかりしました。 もう少し上手にデザインすれば、もっとよかったのに…、という思いです。
一度出してしまった API はそう簡単に変えられないと思いますが、 参考までに僕だったらどうするか、を書いてみます。
この仕様の一番の問題はエラーコードです。 以下は 2 - 2 のエラー仕様に記述されているサンプルです。
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < gnavi > < error > < code>602</code > </error > </gnavi >
タグが三 つ( gnavi , error , code ) 出てきます。 重要なのは code だけで、ここにエラーコードが入ります。 602 というコードは Invalid Shop Number を示します。 エラーコード一覧を見ると、現在五つのコードが定義されていることがわかり ます 。
よくない点を一言で言うと、エラーコードを再発明してしまっているということです。 たとえば
604 は " Internal Server Error " なんですが、 このフレーズに覚えがありませんか ? そう HTTP の 500 Internal Server Error と同じです。HTTP で 500 を返せばいいところを、 独自 XML 形式でしか も 604 という独自のエラーコードを再発明しています。
HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content - Type : application / xml < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?> < gnavi > < error > < code>604</code > </error > </gnavi>
本来はこうあるべきです。
HTTP /1.1 500 Internal Server Error Content - Type : text / plain ; charset=utf -8 処理中にエラーが発生しました。
なぜエラーコードの再発明は駄目なのでしょうか。それは専用のクライアントが必要になる
からです。単なる HTTP
クライアントではなく、ぐるなびのエラーコードを実 装した専用クライアントが必要になってしまうからです。専用クライアントが 必要なので、その分余計なコードが必要となって、障害が発生する確立も上り ます 。
参考までに、ぐるなび API のエラーコードを HTTP のステータスコードにマッピングしてみました。
gnavi エラーコード HTTP ステータスコー ド 600 NoShop 404 Not Found 601 Invalid Access 403 Forbiddden 602 Invalid Shop Number 400 Bad Request 603 Invalid Type 400 Bad Request 604 Internal Server Error 500 Internal Server Error
601 は通常は 401 Unauthorized にしたいところですが、 ぐるなび API は api key 方式を採用しているので 403 にしてみました。 また、この対応によ り
602 と 603 が 400 にまとめられてしまっていますが、 両者の違いは HTTP のレスポンスボディで記述すればいいでしょう。 もし、この二つを区別する理由が、エラーメッセージを出すためだけであれば、 メッセージそのものをプレーンテキストで返せばいいのです。
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Content - Type : text / plain ; charset=utf -8 指定された店舗の情報が存在しません。

“ Cavity quantum electrodynamics ” is a sub - field of quantum optics .
Speaking at the EPL symposium , “ Physics In Our Times ” held last week at the Fondation Del Duca de l’Institut de France , Paris Professor Serge Haroche from the Collège de France and the École Normale Supérieure in Paris , explained how he and his colleagues manipulate and control single atoms and single photons interacting in a cavity , which is a box made of highly reflecting walls .
By studying the behaviour of these atoms and photons in this protected environment , the physicists can illustrate fundamental aspects of quantum theory , such as state superpositions , complementarity and decoherence .
This research is related to the physics of quantum information , a new domain at the frontier of information science and physics that tries to harness the logic of the quantum world to realise tasks in communication and computing that classical devices cannot achieve .
“ During the 20th century , quantum physics has given us new technologies that have changed our lives – for example the computer , the laser and magnetic resonance imaging to name a few , ” explained Prof.
Haroche .
“ However , quantum laws have counterintuitive aspects that defy common sense .
This has led to a paradox : although we all take advantage of quantum physics , it remains very strange - even some of the scientists that developed the theory , such as Einstein , Schrödinger and de Broglie , were uneasy about its deep meaning , ” he said .
Prof .
Haroche and his team have recently succeeded in trapping a single photon in a box on the time scale of seconds and have detected this photon many times without destroying it .
The researchers have achieved this by sending atoms across the box and measuring the imprint left on the atoms by the photon .
This is a new kind of light detection called ‘ quantum non-demolition ’ , ” explained Prof.
Haroche .
“ Until now , single photons were always destroyed upon detection . ”
The result means that it is now possible repeatedly to extract information from the same photon .
This is important because the major part of all information we get from the universe come from light .
“ Developing a new way of ‘ seeing ’ could have applications in quantum science , ” said Prof.
Haroche .
“ A photon could share its information with an ensemble of atoms to build up an ‘ entangled state ’ of light or matter ” .
Attempting to manipulate and control quantum systems raises important questions about the transition between quantum and classical behaviour .
“ Fundamentally , the goal is to understand nature better , ” explained Prof. Haroche .
“ Applications , such as quantum communication machines , will certainly come but what they will be useful for is not yet clear .
This is why research is so exciting – unpredictable things keep happening all the time . ”
Prof .
Haroche ’s group is currently working with atoms and photons in cavities but related work is being done by other groups on trapped ions and cold atoms in optical potential wells , with superconducting junction or quantum dots in solid state devices .
“ Although the technologies may differ widely , the quantum and information science concepts used are the same , ” he explained .
“ We are therefore witnessing a kind of unification between different fields of research that is very promising . ”

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Dmitry Medvedev , named by Russian President Vladimir Putin as his preferred successor , said on Tuesday he wanted Putin to become prime minister under him , mapping out a route for the outgoing leader to retain influence .
But Putin did not say if he would take his long - time ally up on the job offer and some analysts said they believed the powerful Russian leader had still not finally decided what role he will take when he steps down next year .
Medvedev , a 42 - year - old first deputy prime minister and chairman of gas giant Gazprom is overwhelming favorite to win a March 2 presidential election after Putin this week endorsed him as his successor .
“ Expressing my readiness to stand as a candidate in the presidential election , I ask him ( Putin ) to agree to head the government of Russia after the election of the new president , ” Medvedev said in a brief televised address .
Medvedev is one of Putin ’s most loyal lieutenants who has no political powerbase of his own .
Choosing him as the Kremlin ’s candidate seemed calculated to allow Putin to continue to mould policy after he steps down .
In a country where most power is concentrated in the presidency , with the prime minister taking a junior role , some commentators say that dividing power between the two posts could create a risk of conflicts and instability .
Investment analysts welcomed the prospect of a Putin- Medvedev partnership as a guarantee of stability , at least in the short term .
“ On the face of it , that for investors represents a ‘ dream team ’ combination , ” said Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Uralsib bank .
Soon after Medvedev spoke , Putin gave a speech to a business lobby group but made no mention of the job offer .
“ I think at the moment it ( Medvedev ’s offer ) would be seen as an honest decision by a future presidential candidate who told people who he wants to work with , ” said a Kremlin source .
ELECTION PLOY ?
Analysts said the invitation to Putin to head the government could be just a ploy to help Medvedev stave off challenges from rival Kremlin clans and win the election by associating himself closely with the outgoing president .
“ It seems to me that Putin still has n’t decided on his next job , ” said Yevgeny Minchenko , director of the International Institute of Political Analysis in Moscow .

“ Plan A -- Putin really becomes prime minister .
Plan B -- this is pre-election technology that will allow Medvedev to win in the first round with Putin ’s support . ”
Putin is due to step down next year in line with a ban on heads of state serving three consecutive terms .
He served briefly as prime minister in 1999 before taking over the presidency from Boris Yeltsin .

In his television address , Medvedev said his guiding principle would be to continue Putin ’s policies .
Echoing his mentor , he was assertive about Russia ’s place in the world .
“ Russia is different now , much stronger and better - off , ” he said .
“ We are being respected and we are being listened to .
We are not being treated as schoolchildren . ”
He suggested some changes too , saying that the wealth from Russia ’s oil - fuelled boom should be spread more evenly and the social safety net strengthened -- a recognition of the widening gulf in Russia between rich and poor .
Medvedev , a softly - spoken former law professor from Putin ’s hometown of St Petersburg , received some weighty endorsements for his campaign on Tuesday .
Fellow First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov -- who had been tipped as a presidential contender -- gave his backing , as did Alexiy II , patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she “ believes she could work well with him ( Medvedev ) ” , Merkel ’s spokesman said .

Priest tells Fox : Democratic platform ' goes against Biblical teachings ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

The leading Republican candidates for the presidential nomination have all been campaigning heavily on their religious beliefs .
The Democrats have also touched on the importance of faith in their lives , but have not made it a campaign issue in the same way .
Father Jonathan Morris , a conservative Catholic priest who regularly offers comnmentary for Fox News , was asked on Fox & Friends why there is " less of a response " from Democrats when it comes to talking about God.
Morris first giggled and quipped , " Would you like me to give you the politically correct answer ? "
Morris then explained , " When you have a political platform , like the Democratic platform right now , that on major issues goes against Biblical teaching , okay -- about abortion , about homosexual marriage , other issues -- it 's very , a delicate issue .
Now , this is not judging any Democrat 's individual faith , but when their platform goes against Biblical teaching they know they have to be careful when they start getting into details . "
When asked whether the Republican platform also goes against Christian doctrine on issues like poverty , Morris replied somewhat cryptically , " There 's always a hierarchy of value .
When there 's no life that 's permitted , poverty is not an issue . "
Morris may have been trying to say that aborted fetuses do n't get the chance to be poor , so poverty does n't have to be addressed until after the abortion issue is resolved .

I do n't know what the weather is like where you live , but here in Austin , Texas , the heat and drought are the topic of 85 % of conversations ( that 's science ) .
As a native Texan , I usually roll my eyes when people lament about the heat .
One of my friends summed it up nicely : “ I 'm tired of hearing people talk about the weather .
It 's hot in the summer and cold in the winter .
Welcome to Earth . ”
But this year is different .
According to the Lower Colorado River Authority , a nonprofit public utility in Central Texas , the 10 months from October 2010 through July 2011 have been the driest for that period since 1895 , when the state began keeping rainfall records .
Without rain , temperatures hit record levels in June and July , which were the hottest months on record statewide .
As of August 5 , Austin hit 100 + degrees 52 times this summer .
Lowering Energy Use , the Lazy Way
As a result , the cost to cool our house is getting obscene .
We could dial the temp up to 80 degrees , put a kiddie pool in the living room , and buy some $ 72 over the course of a year , install a programmable thermostat when ours works fine , or purchase a new washing machine with energy - efficient motors and pumps .
If I needed new appliances , sure , I 'd check out energy - efficient models , but ours are all sufficient .
I know I could be doing more to
Seal up the house .
I 'm pretty sure we have money leaking through cracks around the doors and windows .
It 's simple enough to buy caulk and weather - stripping to seal cracks — in fact , we already have caulk left over from other projects .
According to Consumer Reports , sealing leaks can reduce energy costs by 15 to 30 %
Use heat - generating appliances at night .
I know this should be a no- brainer , but I like to bake , and because I work at home , I can bake whenever the mood strikes .
But obviously a hot oven in the heat of the day forces the AC to work harder to keep the house at a comfortable temperature .
The same goes for clothes dryers and dishwashers .
Use these at night when outside temps are cooler .
Go retro with a crock pot .
Speaking of ovens , there 's nothing that heats up our house faster than a preheating oven and a few pans on the stove top .
Slow cookers , on the other hand , use less energy and wo n't turn your kitchen into , well , an oven .
I think the crock pot often gets a bad rap thanks to the old way of slow cooking : bland recipes created from canned and prepackaged ingredients .
But the slow cooker is enjoying a quiet revival , and with it we 're seeing better recipes , such as this pulled - pork sandwich and these triple chocolate brownies .
Air - dry clothing .
I like this idea in theory .
J.D.'s wife Kris credits always allergy season .
But if you have the room to spare , you could dry clothing inside on hangers .
We 've enough space in our laundry room to hang quite a bit of clothing , so I 'll start air - drying more .
Turn on fans .
Fans make a room feel cooler , and the one in our living room quit working weeks ago .
We need to fix it .
Bluejay says it could save us $ 438 per year .
Unplug electronics .
I know , I know .
It should go without saying .
I seem to forget about phone chargers and camera battery chargers , though .
Because of this , they stay plugged in , sucking change from our bank account .
By using power strips , I could shut off electricity to these devices all at once .
Consumer Reports also found that you can save $ 25 to $ 75 each year just by putting your computer on standby .
Consider your light bulbs .
Bluejay says you can turn off lights you are n't using to save $ 274 a year ; turn off a single 100 - watt light bulb from running constantly to save $ 131 per year ; and replace ten 60 - watt light bulbs with compact fluorescents to save $ 123 per year ( upfront cost estimate : $ 32 ) .
Do n't cool an empty house .
If you have a programmable thermostat , program it !
We do n't have one , which means I have to make it a habit to raise the thermostat when I do leave the house .
Close off rooms you are n't occupying , as well .
Replace air filters monthly .
We 're pretty good at replacing our filter , but we could be more diligent .
Dirty filters restrict airflow , causing the AC system to run longer and use more energy .
I 've added a recurring task to my calendar to make sure the air filter gets replaced each month .
All of these tasks should add up to noticeable savings and do n't require much time or money .
( Fingers crossed that ceiling fan will be an easy fix ! )
Once I 've taken these steps , maybe I 'll be ready for more .
For now , it 's much too hot to think about new appliances , insulation , and replacing windows .
Besides , I 've got triple chocolate brownies to bake .
What are some other easy ways to take a bite out of your electricity use ?

In the past two weeks , THREAT LEVEL reporters have managed to draw the wrath of two different cultural tribes renown for their resolve and certitude : Apple fanatics , and Ron Paul enthusiasts .
Apple fans pummeled Kim for her story on the iPhone ’s controversial security model , while Ron Paul boosters went after Sarah for her piece on a recent spurt of deceptive spam promoting the Republican presidential candidate .
Some representatives from each group got vicious , resorting to personal smears , sometimes laced with misogyny .
In other words , just another day at the office ; smears and ad hominem attacks are an occupational hazard of journalism .
But having two backlashes at about the same time provides us a rare opportunity to compare the religious fervor of two net - savvy cults of true believers .

Research by the University at Albany shows that information conveyed by a kiss can have profound consequences for romantic relationships , and can even be a major factor in ending one .
In a recently published article , Susan M. Hughes , Marissa A. Harrison , and Gordon G. Gallup , Jr. reveal that many college students have found themselves attracted to someone , only to discover after they kissed them for the first time that they were no longer interested .
" In other words , " said Gallup , an evolutionary psychologist , " While many forces lead two people to connect romantically , the kiss , particularly the first kiss , can be a deal breaker . "
The UAlbany study also found sex differences in the importance and type of kissing .
Males tended to kiss as a means to an end -- to gain sexual favors or to reconcile .
In contrast , females kiss to establish and monitor the status of their relationship , and to assess and periodically update the level of commitment on the part of a partner .
In a sample of 1,041 college students , researchers found only five who had never experienced romantic kissing and more than 200 who estimated having kissed more than 20 partners .
According to the study , kissing between sexual or romantic partners occurs in more than 90 percent of human cultures .
Some non-human animals , such as common chimpanzees and bonobos , appear to engage in kissing - like behaviors as well .
Although kissing is a widespread practice among humans , few scientists have attempted to assess the adaptive significance of kissing behavior .
" Kissing is part of an evolved courtship ritual , " said Gallup .
" When two people kiss there is a rich and complicated exchange of information involving chemical , tactile , and postural cues .
This may activate evolved mechanisms that function to discourage reproduction among individuals who are genetically incompatible . "
According to the researchers , not only do females place more emphasis on kissing , but most would never engage in sex without kissing .
Females were more likely than males to insist on kissing before a sexual encounter , and more likely to emphasize the importance of kissing during and after sexual encounters as well .
By comparison , males said they would be happy to have sex without kissing , and far more males than females expressed a willingness to have sex with someone who was not a " good " kisser .
Males , however , were more likely than females to initiate open mouth kissing and kissing with tongue contact .
The researchers speculate that the exchange of saliva during kissing may have biological consequences in its own right .
Male saliva contains measurable amounts of the sex hormone testosterone which can affect libido .
The authors conclude that the study provides evidence that romantic kissing evolved as an adaptive courtship strategy that functions as a mate - assessment technique , a means of initiating sexual arousal and receptivity , and a way of maintaining a bonded relationship .
Full results are published in the August 2007 issue of the online journal Evolutionary Psychology [ Volume 5 ( 3 ) 2007 ] ,

Alternative Fact of the Day :
There is an alternative fact today , and it is a fact !
A group of researchers have identified two seismic events that they think provide the first evidence of a previously undetected form of matter passing through the Earth .
We can't prove that this was strange quark matter , but that is the only explanation that has been offered so far
Eugene Herrin
The so - called strange quark matter is so dense that a piece the size of a human cell would weigh a tonne .
The two events under study both took place in 1993 .
Other scientists are tantalised , saying that while these seismic disturbances are unlikely to have been caused by strange quark matter , they do not as yet have alternative explanations .
Out of the fireball
Strange quark matter could have arisen after the Big Bang , according to a theory by physicist Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , US .
The primordial fireball may have produced dense , heavy particles made of three types of quarks , which are fundamental particles .
Whereas so - called " up " and " down " quarks form protons and neutrons , the addition of " strange " quarks might result in a stable form of matter that could grow far more massive than ordinary atoms .
There is some evidence that strange quark matter does exist in the cosmos .
In April 2002 , two different teams of scientists reported that they had identified collapsed stars that might be composed of the ultra - dense material .
In 1984 , Harvard physicist and Nobel Laureate Sheldon Glashow suggested that physicists should team up with seismologists to search for traces of the strange matter that might have passed through the Earth at supersonic speed .
' Unassociated events '
He calculated that strange quark particles would dash through Earth with dramatic effect : a one - tonne spec would release the energy of a 50 - kilotonne nuclear bomb , spread along its entire path through the Earth .
In 1993 , Vidgor Teplitz , Eugene Herrin , David Anderson and Ileana Tibuleac , all of the Southern Methodist University in the US , began looking for such events .
They searched the world 's seismographic records for so - called " unassociated events " .
They looked at more than a million records collected by the US Geological Survey between 1990 to 1993 that were not associated with traditional seismic disturbances , such as earthquakes .
Previously , Herrin and Teplitz speculated that it would be possible to search for seismic events that might indicate passage of strange quark matter ( also known as nuclearites ) through the Earth because such events would have a distinct seismic signal - a straight line .
This seismic signature would be caused by the large ratio of the nuclearites speed to the speed of sound in the Earth .
It was estimated that the strange quark matter might pass through the earth at 400 km per second ( 250 miles per second ) , 40 times the speed of seismic waves .
Data collection halted
The team also determined that the minimum requirement for detection of a nuclearite would be detection of its signal by seven monitoring stations .
The researchers latest findings single out two seismic events with the linear pattern they were looking for .
In two cases , the arrival times and forms of seismic waves at nine far - flung stations pointed to linear bursts of energy .
The ruptures ripped through the planet at hundreds of kilometres per second rather than fracturing only near the surface , as typical earthquakes do .
One event occurred on 22 October 1993 , when , according to the researchers , something entered the Earth off Antarctica and left it south of India 0.73 of a second later .
The other occurred on 24 November 1993 , when an object entered south of Australia and exited the Earth near Antarctica 0.15 of a second later .
The first event was recorded at seven monitoring stations in India , Australia , Bolivia and Turkey , and the second event was recorded at nine monitoring stations in Australia and Bolivia .
" We can't prove that this was strange quark matter , but that is the only explanation that has been offered so far , " Herrin says .
Unfortunately , scientists may not be able to find any more events that suggest the passage of strange quark matter through the Earth .
In 1993 the US Geological Survey stopped collecting data from " unassociated events . "

Police have been given the go - ahead to use Taser stun guns against children .
The relaxing of restrictions on the use of the weapons comes despite warnings that they could trigger a heart attack in youngsters .
Until now , Tasers - which emit a 50,000 - volt electric shock - have been used only by specialist officers as a " non lethal " alternative to firearms .
Scroll down for more ...
However , they can now be used against all potentially violent offenders even if they are unarmed .
It is the decision not to ban their use against minors that is likely to raise serious concerns .
Home Office Police Minister Tony McNulty said medical assessments had confirmed the risk of death or serious injury from Tasers was " low " .
But he failed to mention Government advisers had also warned of a potential risk to children .
The Defence Scientific Advisory Council medical committee told the Home Office that not enough was known about the health risks of using the weapons against children .
Tasers work by firing metal barbs into the skin which then discharge an electrical charge which is designed to disable someone long enough to allow police to detain them safely .
The committee , which is made up of independent scientists and doctors , said that limited research suggested there was a risk children could suffer " a serious cardiac event " .
It recommended that officers should be " particularly vigilant " for any Taser - induced adverse response and said guidance should be amended to " identify children and adults of small stature " as being at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of Tasers .
The Government scientists were also asked to test whether the weapons could cause a miscarriage if used on a pregnant woman .
While not saying whether police would be allowed to Taser an expectant mother , the Home Office said the DSAC committee had " specifically asked " for computer simulations to be carried out to analyse the effect on " a pregnant female " .
Amnesty International claims Tasers have been responsible for 220 deaths in America since 2001 .
Many cities and police forces there have banned their use against minors .
Two years ago in Chicago a 14 - year - old boy went into cardiac arrest after being shot with one .
Medics had to use a defibrillator four times to resuscitate him .
Taser International , the American firm that makes the device , said tests on pigs suggested the weapons were safe .
The Association of Chief Police Officers , which issues guidance to forces on the use of weapons , said Tasers would be made " readily available " for " conflict management " at incidents of " violence and threats of violence of such severity that they will need force " .
Non-firearms officers in ten forces will be trained to use the weapons .
Every incident they are involved in will be assessed over a 12 - month trial period .
“ Once every hundred years media changes , ” boy - coder turned big - thinker Mark Zuckerberg declared today at the Facebook Social Advertising Event in New York City .
And it ’s true .
Look back over the last millennium or two , and you ’ll see that every century , like clockwork , there ’s been a big change in media .
Cave painting lasted a hundred years , and then there was smoke signaling , which also lasted a hundred years , and of course there was the hundred years of yodeling , and then there was the printing press , which was invented almost precisely 100 years ago , and so forth and so on up to the present day – the day that Facebook picked up the 100 - year torch and ran with it .
Quoth the Zuckster : “ The next hundred years will be different for advertising , and it starts today . ”
Yes , today is the first day of the rest of advertising ’s life .
I like the way that Zuckerberg considers “ media ” and “ advertising ” to be synonymous .
It cuts through the bullshit .
It simplifies .
Get over your MSM hangups , granddads .
Editorial is advertorial .
The medium is the message from our sponsor .
Marketing is conversational , says Zuckerberg , and advertising is social .
There is no intimacy that is not a branding opportunity , no friendship that ca n’t be monetized , no kiss that does n’t carry an exchange of value .
The cluetrain has reached its last stop , its terminus , the end of the line .
From the Facebook press release : “ Facebook ’s ad system serves Social Ads that combine social actions from your friends – such as a purchase of a product or review of a restaurant – with an advertiser ’s message . ”
The social graph , it turns out , is a platform for social graft .
The Fortune 500 is , natch , lining up .
Coke ’s in , big - time :
The Coca -Cola Company will feature its Sprite brand on a new Facebook Page and will invite users to add an application to their account called “ Sprite Sips . ”
People will be able to create , configure and interact with an animated Sprite Sips character .
For consumers in the United States , the experience can be enhanced by entering a PIN code found under the cap of every 20 oz .
bottle of Sprite to unlock special features and accessories .
The Sprite Sips character provides a means for interacting with friends on Facebook .
In addition , Sprite will create a new Facebook Page for Sprite Sips and will run a series of Social Ads that leverage Facebook ’s natural viral communications to spread the application across its user base .
Infect me .
I ’m yours .
Facebook , which distinguished itself by being the anti-MySpace , is now determined to out - MySpace MySpace .
It ’s a nifty system :
First you get your users to entrust their personal data to you , and then you not only sell that data to advertisers but you get the users to be the vector for the ads .
And what do the users get in return ?
An animated Sprite Sips character to interact with .
Real Life Unique Article Wizard Review
I figured it was time to update my stance on Unique Article Wizard , especially as so much has changed over the last 12 months in the SEO world – and I ’ve also been asked many times if I could run another review – so here goes :
Unique Article Wizard Vs Panda – My Case Study
Since Feb 2011 there ’s been a lot of discussion about how effective Unique Article Wizard is in light of the latest Panda updates .
Naturally we all want to know what ’s working and what is n’t , so hopefully I can help you make some decision about Unique Article Wizard with my latest case study .
So here ’s what I did and when I did it :
I had 20 UAW articles written by an outsourcing company who specialize in writing articles for Unique Article Wizard .
These articles ranged between 400 and 700 words long ( approx ) and 5 to 10 paragraphs – the main reason being that I wanted some variation in the articles to help avoid footprints .
I chose a site to promote that is in a health related niche , and was currently sitting at position 17 in the SERPs for my chosen keyword .
It was also at positions 23 and 36 for 2 other main keywords .
I had n’t touched the site in several months so there were no other factors that may interfere with the results of the Unique Article Wizard review .
I submitted all 20 articles to Unique Article Wizard over the space of 10 days ( so 2 a day ) , and included 2 links in the resource boxes .
One link pointed to my site home page using one of the 3 main keywords I was targeting ( I also included a couple of generic anchor texts like “ click here ” ) , and one link went to an internal page ( which I varied for each submission ) .
When I added the articles , each was submitted to between 173 and 411 sites .
The number of sites the article is submitted to is totally dependent on UAW as it simply picks all the sites within a particular category ( like “ health ” for example ) .
I set the UAW post rate to 30 per day .
I submitted the first of these articles to Unique Article Wizard on January 9th 2012 , and the last one on January 18th , then left it alone and got on with other work .
I basically forgot about the study for a little over a week but remembered to check my results on February 7th .
I checked my account in Unique Article Wizard , and all articles had completed posting .
They ’d been posted to between 173 and 411 different sites .
I checked my rankings , not expecting much change , especially so soon after the submissions , but surprisingly enough , the site had moved up to position 15 for the main keyword , and positions 21 and 33 for the other 2 .
Not bad for such a short space of time ( little over 2 weeks ) .
Without boring you with the weekly or even daily moves , my site now sits a position 6 for the main keyword ( up from 17 ) and 11 ( up from 23 ) and 16 ( up from 36 ) for the other keywords .
Not earth shattering I know , but significant none the less .
I ’m going to continue to use Unique Article Wizard as part of my link building arsenal , and push this site a little more with another batch of UAW submissions .
I think one of the reasons Unique Article Wizard is performing so well is that the UAW network has been significantly improved lately – whether by design by the owners , or simply because of the fact that a lot of the low quality ( OK , crap ) sites in there have been deindexed over the last 12 months I do n’t know for sure ( probably both ) , but whatever it was , it ’s on it ’s way back to full health again .
Below is my original Unique Article Wizard review from 2007 :
Holy Backlinks Batman – I ’m really pumped today – I just got my weekly email update from Unique Article Wizard with the stats showing the number of backlinks being generated by this article marketing automation tool .
If you ’re considering signing up for Unique Article Wizard , make sure you check out the last paragraph of this post for details of a special offer ……
The stats are basically a backlink check on Yahoo , showing me how many times the articles that I submitted using Unique Article Wizard are showing up in the Yahoo index – this in itself is a neat feature of UAW and not something you find in other article marketing software apps out ther .
Every week since I joined , my stats have been increasing , but today really blew me away – so I just had to share the news before I explode .
It ’s seems that around week 6 is the point of critical mass – I guess by this point , the article is widely spread all over the Net , and then starts to get picked up by ezine authors and other webmasters looking for content for their sites .
I ’ve picked out a selection of the articles I ’ve submitted to give you an idea of how well they are performing , and how the backlinks are increasing over time .
This is particularly important , as it makes it look a lot more natural in the eyes of the search engines .
An increase in links over time looks natural – a mass influx of links all at once and then nothing is not natural and easily detected – end result being your site either gets banned , or the links get discounted .
Anyway – here ’s my Unique Article Wizard stats :
Article Submission Date # Full Weeks Since Submitted # Unique Backlinks Showing in Yahoo 24 July 2007 8 1120 30 July 2007 7 1230 31 July 2007 7 1270 3 August 2007 7 710 4 August 2007 6 119 4 September 2007 2 223 4 September 2007 2 418 4 September 2007 2 358 5 September 2007 2 112 6 September 2007 2 86 10 September 2007 1 3
Pretty impressive huh !
I think so too .
But backlinks are no use if they do n’t bring a benefit to the table – and the benefit I ’ve been experiencing through this ever increasing wealth of links is targeted traffic .
The traffic to these sites is increasing at the same rate as the backlinks , and so is the revenue .
I currently have about 50 articles being promoted by Unique Article Wizard , which are generating some very decent traffic and a very comfortable income – all in as little as 8 weeks .
The extra income means I can now pay for some more authors to start writing more articles , and really start to ramp up the power of Unique Article Wizard and enhance my article marketing strategy .

Even before the Declaration of Independence , the phrase of “ No Taxation Without Representation ” echoed among the American colonists as they were struggling to shrug - off the rule imposed by England :
“ No taxation without representation ” was a slogan in the period 1763 - 1775 that summarized a primary grievance of the American colonists in the Thirteen colonies .
The colonists complained that taxes were imposed by Parliament without the consent of the colonists , which violated the traditional Rights of Englishmen dating back from the Magna Carta .
The point was that the colonies had no representation in Parliament ; the British responded that they were “ virtually ” represented .
The Americans said these “ virtual representatives ” knew nothing about America .
The Americans rejected the Stamp Act 1765 ( which was repealed ) , and in 1773 violently rejected the tax on imports at the Boston Tea Party .
When Great Britain began to crack down on the illegal activities performed by the colonists , the colonists formed militias and seized control of each colony , ousting the royal governors .
The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation ( the taxes were quite low ) , but always on the decision - making process by which taxes were decided in London , without representation for the colonists in British Parliament .
In February , 1775 , Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactory provided for the imperial defense and the upkeep of imperial officers .
The phrase “ No Taxation Without Representation ! ” was coined by Reverend Jonathan Mayhew in a sermon in Boston in 1750 .
By 1765 the term “ no taxation without representation ” was in use in Boston , but no one is sure who first used it .
Boston politician James
Otis was most famously associated with the term , “ taxation without representation is tyranny . ” [ 1 ]
By the 1760s the Americans came to believe they were being deprived of a historic right .
[ 2 ] LINK
The above statement which the American Colonists repeatedly alleged is now as germane today as it was in 1763 .
The American people no longer are “ represented ” by their government , but are ordered by a Congress and Presidency to part with their hard - earned money with virtually little or no actual representation .
Many will say that ’s not true , that our elected officials and Congress represent the people , but in today ’s society , it ’s apparent that our government only represents the wealthy , special interest groups , and above all , corporations - which have assumed an almost God - like influence in the governance of this nation .
The United States , contrary to what President Bush and the religious - right allege , is not a “ Christian Nation ” - and in fact was spelled - out by the United States Government when the Treaty of Tripoli was ratified by the United States on June 10 , 1797 :
Article 11 reads : “ As the Government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion ; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion , or tranquillity , of Mussulmen ; and , as the said States never entered into any war , or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation , it is declared by the parties , that no pretext arising from religious opinions , shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries . ”
LINK
Further , if we examine the Constitution and the history of when “ God ” appeared in our government , it was far after the Founding Fathers had passed from this earth .
The below represents a very short synopsis of God and the Constitution , and is extremely telling : ( Excerpts )
Please reread the Constitution , religion is only mentioned in exclusionary terms .
The words “ Jesus Christ , Christianity , Bible , and God ” are never mentioned .
The pledge ( of allegiance ) , written in 1892 did not have “ One nation under God ” until 1954 , and “ In God we trust ” did not appear until 1864 , well after the Founding Fathers had passed , and did not appear on all ( Currency ? ) until after 1957 .
LINK
Even more fascinating is that the “ Pledge of Allegiance ” was not written by the government , but was in fact an advertising tool to help a youth group sell flags :
The Pledge of Allegiance was written for the popular kid ’s magazine Youth ’s Companion by Christian Socialist author and Baptist minister Francis Bellamy on September 7 , 1892 .
The owners of Youth ’s Companion were selling flags to schools , and approached Bellamy to write the Pledge for their advertising campaign .
( Emphasis added . )
It was marketed as a way to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus arriving in the Americas and was first published on the following day .
Bellamy ’s original Pledge read as follows : I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands , one nation indivisible , with liberty and justice for all , and was seen by some as a call for national unity and wholeness after the divisive Civil War .
The pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point .
Bellamy designed it to be stated in 15 seconds .
He had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity but decided they were too controversial since many people still opposed equal rights for women and blacks .
Bellamy said that the purpose of the pledge was to teach obedience to the state as a virtue .[ citation needed ]

Is it true that familiarity breeds contempt ?
A psychology study published this year concludes that the answer is yes .
It seems we are inclined to interpret ambiguous information about someone optimistically , assuming we will get along .
We are usually let down , however , when we learn more .
A team of researchers , led by Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School , looked at online daters ’ opinions of people they were about to meet for the first time and compared those ratings with another group ’s post - date impressions .
Before the date , based on what little information the daters saw online , most participants rated their prospective dates between a 6 and a 10 on a 10 - point scale , with nobody giving a score below a 3 .
But post - date scores were lower , on average , and lots of people deemed their date a total dud .
Why ?
For starters , initial information is open to interpretation .
“ And people are so motivated to find somebody they like that they read things into the profiles , ” Norton says .
If a man writes that he likes the outdoors , his would - be mate imagines her perfect skiing companion , but when she learns more , she discovers “ the outdoors ” refers to nude beaches .
And “ once you see one dissimilarity , everything you learn afterward gets colored by that , ” Norton says .
The letdown from getting more information is n’t true just for romance .
In one experiment , the researchers showed college students different numbers of randomly selected traits and asked them to rate how much they ’d like the person described .
For the most part , the more traits participants saw , the less they said they would like the other person .
But another group of students had overwhelmingly said they would like people more after learning more about them .
Next Tuesday ( New Year 's Day ) at 8:30 PM EST , a group of fervent supporters of Ron Paul 's bid for the presidency of the United States are planning a virtual rally on World of Warcraft 's Whisperwind server .
According to the fourteen pages of planning for the event found in this Ron Paul website , players plan to create a guild ( presumably with a name designed to advertise their political affiliation ) , then march from Ironforge to Stormwind .
While I 'm sure Mr. Paul 's ubiquitous Internet support will manage to draw hundreds of supporters to this e-rally , this sort of thing is a far - too - tempting target for griefers as well .
If you want to show off your virtual political allegiances , I 'd recommend getting there before the local hooligans start spamming the chat channels and pelting people with snowballs .

Ex -VP Mondale accuses Cheney of power grab Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney has presided over an unprecedented power grab during his six years in the White House , former Vice President Walter Mondale wrote in a rare , scathing critique Sunday .
" The real question is why the president allows this to happen , " Mondale writes .
Mondale , the former number two to Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s , in an opinion piece appearing Sunday in the Washington Post newspaper , fingered Cheney as the chief transgressor in a White House guilty of " great excess " and " exceeding its authority . "
He wrote that since the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks , " Cheney set out to create a largely independent power center in the office of the vice president . "
" His was an unprecedented attempt not only to shape administration policy but , alarmingly , to limit the policy options sent to the president , " he wrote , calling the George W. Bush administration " seriously off track " in the unprecedented amount of power it has ceded to Cheney .
" Through his vast government experience , through the friends he had been able to place in key positions and through his considerable political skills , he ( Cheney ) has been increasingly able to determine the answers to questions put to the president -- because he has been able to determine the questions , " Mondale continued .
In particular , many of the policy positions Cheney has pushed through on handling terror suspects and the domestic use of intelligence " have proved offensive to the values of the constitution and have been embarrassingly overturned by the courts . "
Mondale also slammed " Cheney 's zealous embrace of secrecy " and his " near total aversion to the notion of accountability " to the public and Congress .
" I 've never seen a former member of the House of Representatives demonstrate such contempt for Congress and contempt for the will of Congress , " wrote Mondale in The Post .
" It 's almost as if he denies the legitimacy of an equal branch of government , " he added .
Excerpts from Mondale 's op - ed : # The Post 's recent series on Dick Cheney 's vice presidency certainly got my attention .
Having held that office myself over a quarter - century ago , I have more than a passing interest in its evolution from the backwater of American politics to the second most powerful position in our government .
Almost all of that evolution , under presidents and vice presidents of both parties , has been positive -- until now .
Under George W. Bush and Dick Cheney , it has gone seriously off track .
....
This all changed in 2001 , and especially after Sept. 11 , when Cheney set out to create a largely independent power center in the office of the vice president .
His was an unprecedented attempt not only to shape administration policy but , alarmingly , to limit the policy options sent to the president .
It is essential that a president know all the relevant facts and viable options before making decisions , yet Cheney has discarded the " honest broker " role he played as President Gerald Ford 's chief of staff .
Through his vast government experience , through the friends he had been able to place in key positions and through his considerable political skills , he has been increasingly able to determine the answers to questions put to the president -- because he has been able to determine the questions .
It was Cheney who persuaded President Bush to sign an order that denied access to any court by foreign terrorism suspects and Cheney who determined that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan and Iraq .
....
Whatever authority a vice president has is derived from the president under whom he serves .
There are no powers inherent in the office ; they must be delegated by the president .
Somehow , not only has Cheney been given vast authority by President Bush -- including , apparently , the entire intelligence portfolio -- but he also pursues his own agenda .
The real question is why the president allows this to happen .

Interpretation of Jesus Christ 's reported ability to walk on water is left to biblical scholars .
But scientists have figured out how so - called Jesus lizards are able to scurry across the surfaces of ponds and streams .
The findings improve understanding of the physics involved in walking in general and may have practical use in the development of walking robots .
The Jesus lizards , or basilisk lisards , accomplish the seemingly miraculous act of moving on top of water by generating forces with their feet that keep their bodies both above the surface and upright , according to Shi-Tong Tonia Hsieh .
Hsieh is a graduate student in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University in Massachusetts .
Hsieh and her advisor George Lauder detail the process in today 's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The finding challenges established rules for the mechanics of legged locomotion , which are mostly known from studies of how animals walk across solid surfaces in a laboratory setting , Hsieh said .
" But how do they run across dirt , gravel , or sand ?
Without knowing much more , we'd think there 's some sort of continuum in the strategy animals use to move across surfaces , " she said .
" We began to wonder about what happens on a squishy surface like water ? "
Robert Full , a professor of integrative biology at the University of California , Berkeley , and expert on animal locomotion , said the lack of answers to such questions is holding up the development of new technologies .
" It 's one of the major reasons we can't build effective legged robots , " he said .
Jesus Lizards
To find answers , Hsieh and Lauder turned to the basilisk lizard ( Basiliscus plumifrons ) , a skittish tree - dwelling species found in Central America .
When frightened by a predator 's approach the lizard will drop to the water and run across the surface .
The lizards range in size from less than 0.01 ounces ( 2 grams ) upon hatching to more than 7 ounces ( 200 grams ) as adults .
Throughout their size range , they can run across water on their hind limbs at about 5 feet ( 1.5 meters ) a second for a distance of approximately 15 feet ( 4.5 meters ) before they sink to all fours and swim .
The lizard is often called the Jesus Christ lizard in Central America because of its seeming ability to walk on water .
Most animals that attempt to walk — or run — across water immediately sink toward their supporting limb because water , unlike solid ground , offers little support or resistance .
" It 's as if you were not paying attention and thought you were putting your elbow on the table top and missed , " Hsieh said .
To understand how the Jesus lizards move across the surface of the water without tipping over , Hsieh and Lauder filmed them with a high - speed video camera as they ran across a water tank .
The water was sprinkled with tiny , reflective glass beads that sparkle when lit .
Using computer software , the researchers are able to overlay adjacent video frames to see how the beads move .
This allowed them to calculate the forces generated throughout the lizards ' stride .
The stride is divided into three phases : the slap , the stroke , and the recovery .
During the slap the foot moves primarily vertically downward .
During the stroke it moves primarily backward .
And during the recovery the foot moves up and out of the water , returning to the start position of the next step .
According to Hsieh , the lizards need to generate forces during these phases sufficient to overcome the challenges of staying on top of the water and upright .
" It sounds obvious — you can't run if you 're falling over — but it 's even a greater challenge for the lizards , because they are dealing with a squishy surface , " she said .
According to analysis of their video , the lizards generate force for support during the slap phase , in which the lizards ' foot plunges straight down , pushing water down and away from the foot while creating a pocket of air surrounding the foot .
The support force generated by the slap is sufficient to keep the lizards ' bodies above the water 's surface during the stroke phase in which they propel themselves forward by kicking their leg back through the water .
To stay upright , the lizards also create forces off to the sides called lateral reaction forces .
" If you trip and fall off to the right , you instinctively reach out and push off something , " Hsieh said .
" It 's the same thing with lizards , but they do it all with their feet .
When their body moves off to the right , they want to produce a force with their feet to push back left . "
To create these forces , the lizards push outward during the slap phase as they fall toward their supporting limb .
Then they pull toward their body during the stroke as their center of mass shifts away from the supporting limb .
The effect keeps the lizards upright as long as they are moving .
" Think of it as riding a bike .
The minute you stop pedaling and the bike comes to a halt , you will fall over .
If the lizards stop running , they will fall over .
What they need are forces to maintain stability while they are moving , " Hsieh said .
Earlier research conducted in Full 's lab at the University of California at Berkeley showed how legged insects generate lateral forces for stability while running on solid surfaces .
He said it is novel to see that these forces also play a pivotal role when running on water .
Broken Rule
According to Hsieh and Lauder , the mechanics of lizard water - running challenge a major established rule of legged locomotion known as the spring - mass model .
In the model , energy is stored in an animal 's limb during the start of the contact , or slap , phase and then released to help propel the animal forward .
" This does not occur during basilisk water - running , which suggests that the hindlimb no longer functions like a spring but instead acts more like a piston , limited to only generating force during a step , " Hsieh and Lauder conclude in their study .
Now that the researchers have shown how the mechanics of locomotion differ between walking on a solid surface and water , they hope to tease out the subtle differences of how locomotion works on various other types of surfaces .
" A moment I 've been dreading .
George brought his ne 're - do - well son around this morning and asked me to find the kid a job .
Not the political one who lives in Florida .
The one who hangs around here all the time looking shiftless .
This so - called kid is already almost 40 and has never had a real job .
Maybe I 'll call Kinsley over at The New Republic and see if they 'll hire him as a contributing editor or something .
That looks like easy work . "
-- from Ronald Reagan 's published diaries , May 17 , 1986 .
Another Republican ends up fed up with the GOP , adding Colorado to the list of states with high - profile switches from the GOP to the Democratic Party .
State Rep. Debbie Stafford , a longtime Republican known for her passionate arguments on behalf of abused animals and foster kids , ditched her party Thursday to join majority Democrats .
The Aurora lawmaker 's surprise move - announced as she stood with a dozen cheering Democrats - was the first time in 20 years that a state lawmaker switched parties .
Republican reaction ranged from flippant to seething , as the Democrats '
House majority climbed to 40 - 25 and Republicans were left with just five female lawmakers in the state Capitol .
" I am not leaving the Republican Party as much as the Republican Party left me , " Stafford said .
" I decided it was time to place myself , and my self - respect , ... with the Democratic Party .
From an email press release :
[ Stafford ] said , " Like many others in Colorado who want to balance the role of government , who want to protect business yet show compassion for those less fortunate , who want to stand up for citizens who have been lost in bureaucracy , I find that I am in the middle of the political spectrum .
Like many others in Colorado who want to balance the role of government , who want to protect business yet show compassion for those less fortunate , who want to stand up for citizens who have been lost in bureaucracy , I find that I am in the middle of the political spectrum . "
The " middle " , once again , is shown to be the Democratic Party , not whatever it is that Republicans have turned into ( theocrats , neocons , and corporate cons ) .
This seemed like a good time as any to see the state of party switching in the country .
Wikipedia has an imperfect list which I edited a bit for accuracy :
2004
US Rep. Rodney Alexander of Louisiana
Louisiana State Rep. Billy Montgomery
US Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas 2005
Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Diven ( defeated in 2006 ) 2006
Georgia Rep. Mickey Channell
Florida Rep. Will Kendrick
Maryland Sen. John Giannetti ( defeated )
Tennessee Sen. Don McLeary ( defeated )
Florida Rep. Sheri McInvale ( defeated ) 2007
Mississippi Sen. James Walley
Louisiana State Treasurer John Kennedy ( Sen. Landrieu 's likely 2008 foe )
Now check out the Dem list .
2005 Bucks County Pennsylvania County Commissioner Andy Warren
Kansas attorney Paul Morrison ( now Kansas Attorney General ) 2006 Former Reagan Navy Secretary James Webb ( now US Senator from Virginia )
Kansas GOP Party Chairman Mark Parkinson ( now Kansas Lt. Governor )
Oklahoma Sen. Nancy Riley ( was GOP whip )
Nebraska Auditor Kate Witek
Montana State Sen. Sam Kitzenberg
Washington Rep. Rodney
Tom ( now a state senator )
Connecticut Rep. Diana Urban
NBA star Charles Barkley , running for Alabama governor in 2010 2007 Louisiana State Sen. Walter Boasso
Illinois State Sen. Paul D. Froehlich
New York Assemblyman Mike Spano
Westchester NY District Attorney Janet DiFiore
Missouri Sen. Chris Koster
Hawaii State Sen. Michael Gabbard
Kentucky Rep. Milward Dedman
Kentucky Rep. Melvin B. Henley .
Texas State Rep. Kirk England
Colorado Rep. Debbie Stafford
It 's interesting that the GOP 's successes remain in the South , and even then , only the Deep South party switchers survived the voters after their party switches .
Meanwhile , Democrats are making gains in border states ( Missouri , Tennessee , Kentucky ) , as well as other traditionally Republican states ( Nebraska , Oklahoma , Kansas , and Colorado ) .
And that 's not including former Georgia Rep.
Bob Barr , who left the GOP for the Libertarian Party , and newly minted independents like ousted Sen. Lincoln Chafee , NY Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Tennessee State Sen. Michael Williams .
More than that , between 1980 and 2004 , Wikipedia lists 15 Republicans switching parties , and some of them are pretty lame ( like me being on that list ) .
On the other hand , during that same time frame , 67 Democrats switched parties to the GOP , including a healthy number of congressmen and senators .
Yet just six Democrats switched to the GOP in 2005 and 2006 , and only two of those survived the wrath of the voters .
Meanwhile , Democrats are making huge gains in picking up disaffected Republicans .
Times are really a'changing .
In just a few months SUMOtorrent managed to grow from 0 to 350,000 visitors a day , which makes it one of the most widely used BitTorrent sites .
Impressive statistics but how did they accomplish this , and what are their plans for the future ?
Let 's find out .
SUMOtorrent is currently ranked 1,052 on Alexa , which means that they are close to entering the list of 1000 most visited websites on the Internet .
In addition , SUMOtorrent is running a much needed – as well as one of the biggest , BitTorrent trackers .
This is pretty exceptional if you take into account that the site only had a dozen visitors 6 months ago when it just started .
We are glad that the administrator of SUMOtorrent agreed to answer some of our questions , so we can learn a bit more about his success story .
TorrentFreak :
How many visitors does SUMOTorrent have at the moment ?
SUMO : SUMOTorrent is now getting about 350 000 daily unique visitors , while SUMOTracker is now tracking 2 million peers , and is probably the largest public BitTorrent tracker hosted on a single server !
We recently launched a second public tracker that we hope will be used as much by BitTorrent users as the main tracker .
TorrentFreak :
What did you do to grow this fast ?
SUMO : I believe the reason why we grew so fast is experience , ideas and support of countless people !
TorrentFreak :
So , with all the traffic you ’re getting you must be driving a really expensive sports car now right ?
SUMO : I do n’t have a car but I advise you all to drive safely , put your safety belt on and respect speed limits .
Many webmasters do not communicate about money and torrents .
Truth is that , just like any other popular site with high traffic , torrents sites make an income with 4 zeros , SUMOTorrent included .
However , we ’re not rich : at the end of the month , with all our expenses ( hosting of 6 servers for SUMOTorrent / SUMOTracker ) , developers , partners , backup servers , services … we have actually just enough cash to purchase new servers next month .
Our partners could tell you that we often ask them for a delay to pay them every month :p
We also support various sites and donate to them when we have some extra cash ( Filesoup , IndianMP3 …)
TorrentFreak :
Are you running the site on your own or do you have a team of moderators helping you out ?
SUMO : We are running the site on our own and looking for moderators to help us removing the spam and fake torrents that get through our filters .
TorrentFreak : SUMOTorrent is one of the few BitTorrent sites that has their own tracker , do you think we need more public BitTorrent trackers ?
SUMO : Of course we do need more public BitTorrent trackers !
Many BitTorrent sites do not have their own tracker , and will tell you that it is to avoid legal troubles .
I believe this is only an excuse .
When you come to think about it , a public BitTorrent tracker generates a lot of traffic that cannot be monetized as it is not seen by anybody .
SUMOTracker costs about $ 500 per month and we feel like this money is well spent as we are doing it for the community !
TorrentFreak : The Pirate Bay announced that they are working on a new BitTorrent protocol , what is your take on this ?
SUMO : I have quite bad memories of the Suprnova / Exeem project , but I believe the SecureP2P project launched by PirateBay will be a great improvement to BitTorrent as it is based on experience of what is not working good in the current protocol and trying to improve it .
They have received dozens of suggestions from users all around the world , and I wish the best to them in this enterprise .
We have contacted the head of this project and will provide them with any resources they might need to achieve it .
SUMOTorrent will of course support the new protocol , promote it to our users and provide additional trackers on SUMOTracker for the new tracker protocol .
TorrentFreak : Can you tell us something about features you want to add to SUMOTorrent in the future ?
SUMO : We will add more languages and buy new servers to scale site architecture with our growth .
We will also work on content partnerships , and invite any filmmaker , music group or artist who is interested in sponsoring of his production and free distribution of his content through our site to contact us .
Just like PirateBay and Mininova , we would like to promote groups and help artists getting known through the power of peer - to - peer !
TorrentFreak :
Do you have a message for all the anti-piracy organizations out there ?
SUMO : Yes , take a look at the 100 first sites according to Alexa ranking !
P2P and BitTorrent websites are here to stay , and they are the major means of online content distribution nowadays .
This is a fact .
Instead of trying to block the highway that leads to your customers , you should put your strategy into question .
When the time will come that P2P sites will get better organized ( and this time is soon , you know it ) and ran by smart structures instead of simple individuals , you will understand you have missed the last opportunity you had to jump on the bandwagon of the digital revolution !
Meanwhile for all torrent users , we are happy to give you a free drive to where you want on www.sumotorrent.com :)
TorrentFreak :
Thanks SUMO and good luck in the future !

Here are 8 things you can do for the garden in December :
1 . Plant bulbs until the ground freezes or during a thaw .
2 . Put burlap on stakes for winter protection of broadleaf evergreens or shrubs like roses that you want to protect .
3 . Apply winter mulches to bulbs , perennials , strawberries or shrubs AFTER the ground freezes .
4. Divide spring and summer blooming clumping perennials ( Those that are fall bloomers can be divided in the spring or season opposite to bloom time . )
5 . Care for indoor plants – December is the lowest light intensity for house plants and would be happy with extra light .
6 . Start dropping hints for garden gifts you would like to receive during the holiday season .
About.com claims they know the top 15 gifts for gardeners .
7. Start writing to plant catalogue companies to request their 2008 catalogues .
The Dave ’s Garden site claims they are the “ most complete directory of gardening sources ” listing more than 6,122 gardening vendors that they rate either positively or negatively .
8 . Get out your Horticulture books and on freezing days , read and dream away .
If there are books that you want , you can buy them or take them out of your library to see if you want to own them .
Most libraries have inter-library loan so that you could even ask if they will get a book that you find interesting from the list at Amazon.com .
Then if you love the book , you can buy it .
Some of the great gardening book publishers are :
Timber Press
Sterling Publishing
Ortho Books
Rodale Books
Sunset Books
and the gardening books from DK Publishing Co .

Once food had been plentiful , but no longer .
In the early days of the colony , the amoebas had feasted on a rich supply of bacteria .
But as the generations passed and the population swelled , they had hunted out their food supply .
Now starvation threatens .
Their home⁠ — a scrap of deer dung which once provided all their needs⁠ — has become a trap which they must escape if they are to survive .
At last , one amoeba sends out a cry for help .
The starving amoeba begins to emit a chemical signal in the form of cyclic adenosine monophosphate , or cAMP .
Nearby individuals sprout new pseudopods and crawl toward the source .
They also begin to give off cAMP themselves , amplifying the call until the signal spreads to the far reaches of the colony .
Amoebas cannot concurrently detect and produce cAMP , so they alternate , and the cells trace out intricate spiral patterns as they surge forward in waves .
The amoebas pile on top of one another in growing numbers until so many of them have joined the heap that this pile of microscopic single - celled organisms becomes visible to the naked eye .
At first their behavior might seem odd ; to gather together in the face of starvation surely ought to end in cannibalism or death .
Not so , for they are capable of an extraordinary and rare transformation .
The amoebas set aside their lives as individuals and join ranks to form a new multicellular entity .
Not all the amoebas will survive this cooperative venture , however .
Some will sacrifice themselves to help the rest find a new life elsewhere .
These astonishing creatures are Dictyostelium discoideum , and they are a member of the slime mold family .
They are also known as social amoebas .
Aside from the novelty value of an organism that alternates between unicellular and multicellular existence , D. discoideum is highly useful in several areas of research .
Among other things , this organism offers a stellar opportunity to study cell communication , cell differentiation , and the evolution of altruism .
In response to the cAMP distress call , up to one hundred thousand of the amoebas assemble .
They first form a tower , which eventually topples over into an oblong blob about two millimeters long .
The identical amoebas within this pseudoplasmodium⁠ — or slug⁠ — begin to differentiate and take on specialized roles .
The slug begins to seek out light , leaving a slimy trail behind .
Some of the amoebas take on the difficult role of sentinel , or immune - like functions .
They circulate through the slug , hunting for pathogens .
If they find any , they will engulf them in a process similar to the feeding behavior they once displayed when in solitary form .
The pseudoplasmodium periodically sloughs off the sentinels ⁠ — and any pathogens they have engulfed⁠ — and abandons them in the trail of slime .
More cells will then be tapped to fill their place .
Dictyostelium discoideum slug
Once the slug finds a suitably sunny location , the unlucky cells at the “ head ” of the slug form a stalk for the others to climb .
These cells ⁠ — which make up roughly a fifth of the total population⁠ — will sacrifice themselves in order to provide a path up for their comrades .
The remaining cells then climb the stalk and collect on its tip , eventually resulting in a structure resembling a ping - pong ball balanced on top of a floppy wire .
This formation is known as a “ fruiting body . ”
They then form spores , which are carried away by wind or passing animals or insects .
Once carried to a suitable location , the amoebas emerge from spore form and begin the cycle again .
So long as all the amoebas which make up the slug are related , this impressive display of self - sacrifice on the part of the stalk cells makes sense .
Though they will perish in the act of creating the stalk , they will pass along their genetic legacy via their kin .
In fact , when the amoebas reproduce by division , they create an ever - increasing pool of genetically identical clones .
These clones suffer no genetic cost at all from sacrificing their lives for each other .
More familiar multicellular organisms pool resources in a similar way .
For example , in a human being , a liver cell fills a very different role from a lung or skin cell , but all of them harbor the same chromosomes .
The result is that the liver does n’t need to compete with the lungs concerning reproduction .
So long as the germ cells get lucky , all of the cells can be ( metaphorically ) content knowing they will pass on their genetic legacy .
However , when the cAMP call goes out , it is n’t only related amoebas that answer it .
Those of differing strains will come together to form a single slug .
If one strain could figure out a way to duck out of stalk and sentinel duty , it would be expected to reproduce faster than its nobler compatriots .
As is true with all organisms , some will evolve in such a way that they can⁠ — and will⁠ — benefit from the colony ’s resources without contributing anything back .
In theory , such “ leeches ” could potentially have a survival and reproductive advantage , thereby undermining the cooperative Dictyostelid lifestyle .
Such cheating does take place , but nonetheless D. discoideum has been around for millions of years with no signs of imminent extinction .
Thus the mechanisms for keeping cheating under control must be effective .
For one thing , the amoebas prefer to unite with kin .
The amoebas are able to recognize each other through molecular markers .
They mingle with other strains only when populations are low .
At such times , the ability to form a larger slug outweighs the risk of cooperating with strangers .
A typical amoeba
In addition , evidence suggests that some social amoebas have evolved to link reproductive genes with altruistic ones .
In the case of D. discoideum , researchers created a mutant strain of cells which are “ deaf ” to the chemical signal to become a self - sacrificing stalk cell .
They then watched to see if these cells would gain a reproductive advantage .
Just the opposite took place .
The “ cheater ” mutant cells did not join in stalk formation , yet they rarely made it up the stalk to become spores , and therefore they died out .
The traits of self - sacrifice and reproduction had become genetically entangled , it seems , allowing only the altruistic amoebas to produce offspring .
Finally , opportunities for cheating simply are n’t very common .
In the wild , these creatures spend much of their lives reproducing via division , and surrounding themselves with identical copies .
Outside of laboratory experiments , cases where social amoebas run across strangers to exploit are rare .
Cheater genes peter out once the cheaters run out of nobler amoebas to sponge off of .
When exploiting one ’s clone mates , greed does n’t pay .
In addition to studies of altruism , study of D. discoideum is shedding light on how cells communicate .
D. discoideum uses many of the same signaling processes found in all multicellular creatures .
But unlike fish or frogs , D. discoideum can be frozen , thawed , grown by the millions in a matter of days , and stored away for years if need be .
A website called DictyBase offers an impressive list of breakthroughs which can be credited to the social amoeba .
The consistency with which these amoebas act in the common good might inspire admiration in many .
Yet a more cynical observer might point out that the amoebas are moved not by love of family and friends , nor by moral scruples , but by the cold mechanics of natural selection .
Amoebas behave altruistically only because natural selection has led to a stable state in which self - sacrifice is the best way for them to pass on their genes .
But the end result is the same , regardless of the natural forces that have shaped it .
Altruism triumphs , and through their mutual selflessness the amoebas arrive at a new patch of bacteria - laden dung to call home .

Every year , the average American adult drinks the equivalent of 38 six - packs of beer , a dozen bottles of wine and two quarts of distilled spirits like gin , rum , single malt Scotch , or vodka that aspires to single malt status through the addition of flavors normally associated with yogurt or bubble bath .
We are by no means the most bibulous people : according to the World Health Organization , 39 other nations outdrink us , a list topped by Luxembourg , where residents manage to ingest roughly 284 bottles of beer and 88 bottles of wine annually , no doubt to salve the indignation of explaining that their country is n’t part of Belgium .
Yet even though we Americans drink less than some others , we can hold our own , especially now that the peak ethanol season is under way .
Liquor sales in December , according to hospitality trade groups , are usually a good 50 percent higher than in other months , and that ’s hardly a surprise .
December is a time of multicreedal spirituality and festivities , and alcohol has been a fixture of celebration and religious ritual since humans first learned to play and pray .
December is also cold , dark and miserable , a meteorological migraine begging for home remediation , and alcohol is perhaps humanity ’s oldest medicine .
Moreover , December is a time for family , and a taste for alcohol , it seems , is all in the family , the extended phylogenetic family of primates and other animals that make fruit a centerpiece of their diet .
Nothing broadcasts the presence of ripe , digestible fruit as effectively as the aroma of fermentation .
We ’re frugivores at our core .
Several of Bolivia 's nine regions want more autonomy
Santa Cruz , Beni and Pando - Bolivia 's richest regions - are angry at the reforms that include greater state control of the economy .
Another region , Tarija , is expected to follow suit .
Security forces are on alert ahead of rallies in the four provinces .
Mr Morales said the moves were " illegal " .
The regional protests coincide with a rally in La Paz , the president 's stronghold , where members of the Constitutional Assembly are due to deliver the new constitution to Mr Morales .
The constitutional reforms will be then put to a referendum later this year .
Deep splits
The provinces of Beni and Pando declared autonomy at the rallies after the wealthiest region , Santa Cruz , backed a statute on Thursday under which it would keep two - thirds of its tax revenues .
President Morales ' mostly supporters are gathering in La Paz
The autonomy charters will now be put to the local populations for approval .
Some 400 extra police have been sent to Santa Cruz , and the army has been told to prepare to protect public buildings .
The moves towards autonomy come after an assembly dominated by supporters of President Evo Morales adopted the new national charter article by article last weekend .
Mr Morales made rewriting the constitution a key part of his reform agenda to give the indigenous majority greater political power , but the issue has deepened regional and ethnic divisions in the country .
Indigenous rights
Low - lying Santa Cruz is the most prosperous part of South America 's poorest country , having major agricultural businesses and much of Bolivia 's oil and gas wealth .
Pro-autonomy supporters object to the new constitution , which would allow consecutive five - year presidential terms , increase indigenous rights and redistribute wealth to the poorer highland areas of Bolivia .
On Thursday , Mr Morales called for dialogue , but warned that the unity of Bolivia was inviolable .
" The unity of the country is untouchable , it is not up for discussion .
There is no referendum to be held on the country 's unity , " Mr Morales said .
There were frequent demonstrations - both for and against - during the debate over constitutional reforms , with protests sometimes turning violent .
Liberals on the Warpath The Democrats Get Hawkish
The American people may want to get rid of Bush , but they in no way want to risk losing the war on terror .
The consequences : America 's Democrats are seeking to position themselves as being more hawkish than the Republicans and Congress has just approved the biggest military budget ever .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush is expected to outline on Thursday a plan to freeze mortgage rates for five years for many U.S. homeowners facing sharp increases in their monthly payments , industry sources said on Wednesday .

Final details of the plan are still being worked out after a trade group that represents large mortgage investors presented its framework for implementing a broad rate freeze to the Treasury Department late on Tuesday , the sources said .
“ The president will make a statement on housing issues tomorrow afternoon , ” a senior administration official said , declining to elaborate on details .
The sources , who are familiar with details of the trade group ’s pitch , said the plan envisions covering subprime loans taken out between January 1 , 2005 , through the end of this past July , with rates that are due to reset over the coming 2 - 1 / 2 years .
An estimated 1.8 million U.S. homeowners who took out loans with low teaser rates face pricey loan resets next year alone , the Federal Reserve has said .
Officials fear half a million borrowers risk losing their homes .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has worked closely with the investor trade group - the American Securitization Forum - as well as mortgage servicers and lenders to hammer out a comprehensive plan to modify troubled loans .
On Wednesday morning , Paulson outlined to a closed - door meeting of Republican lawmakers his efforts to broker a rescue plan for troubled borrowers .
“ It was all broad - picture , ” said Ed Royce , a California lawmaker who sits on the House Financial Services Committee and who attended the briefing .
“ He was upbeat about the way those negotiations are going . ”
House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio said “ I think the proposal being outlined is a good one . ”
SPREADING FEARS
Rising defaults on U.S. subprime loans , aimed at borrowers with a spotty credit history , have spooked financial markets around the globe in recent months , tightening credit conditions and threatening to derail the U.S. economy .
Many sinking loans had been repackaged as securities and sold to investors , who are having a tough time getting a handle on the value of their assets .
The proposal to temporarily freeze mortgage rates is primarily aimed at borrowers who can afford their existing rates and who are current on their payments , but who would face default when the rate resets at a higher level .
Under the plan pitched by the ASF , distressed homeowners would be offered mortgage help according to their ability to pay .
Borrowers with strong credit would be encouraged to drop their existing loan and be shepherded to more affordable mortgages like those offered under the Federal Housing Administration .
In August , Bush expanded that government program so that it could reach an additional 240,000 troubled borrowers next year .
A second class of borrowers who simply do not have the resources to make mortgage payments would return to the rental market .
A third group of borrowers who have shown that they are a reasonable credit risk but who could not afford their homes with higher rates would qualify for “ fast - tracked ” loan modification and a five - year interest rate freeze .
Other existing borrowers who have struggled to keep up their loan payments could still qualify for the freeze , but would face more scrutiny before receiving any loan modification .
The backing of mortgage investors is important to the success of any rate freeze plan as it would give some cover to mortgage servicers and others in the industry who could face lawsuits from bondholders if they began to tinker with loans .

1.. Actually , I submitted the same story twice , not multiple times and as I 've explained this was because I screwed up the URL on the Reddit side and had to start again .
You can check for yourself how many times I submitted the story my looking at my Digg account submission history
You can also see that the two stories have different URLs , and that one story has just one digg .
That 's partly because I buried that story myself once I realized I had screwed up .
2..
Once I discovered that my account was banned I did two things : I emailed [ email protected ] asking why and I created a new account for myself .
So multiple here is 1 , and I only did that because Digg killed my regular account .

Over the past several days , there have been a number of rumors and lots of discussion about the issue of bandwidth caps and Comcast .
There have been a number of reports of users having reached some sort of bandwidth limit — reportedly 90 GB — and having their service cut off by America 's largest cable ISP .
Ars spoke to Comcast today in an attempt to find out what 's going on .
Surprisingly , Comcast 's Acceptable Use Policy , to which all of its subscribers must agree , is somewhat vague when it comes to bandwidth limits .
There are no hard numbers , just an admonition that Comcast 's high - speed Internet subscribers are not allowed to " restrict , inhibit , or otherwise interfere with the ability of any other person , regardless of intent , purpose or knowledge , to use or enjoy the Service , including ... generating levels of traffic sufficient to impede others ' ability to send or retrieve information . "
It 's only when that last factor comes into play that Comcast will take action , Charlie Douglas , Comcast 's director of corporate communications for online and voice services , told Ars.
Douglas also said that those customers are an extremely small minority .
" More than 99.99 % of our customers use the residential high - speed Internet service as intended , which includes downloading and sharing video , photos and other rich - media , " he told Ars .
Douglas said that Comcast customers whose Internet use causes issues for others on the network can expect a call from the company .
" [ Our ] policy is to proactively contact the customer via phone to work with them and address the issue , " he said .
In some cases , addressing the issue involves determining whether their PC has been compromised and is now part of a spam - and malware - spewing botnet .
If that is the case , Douglas says that Comcast will work with the customer to fix the problem .
In other cases , Comcast will suggest to the user that he or she move to a different Internet plan , often a " commercial - grade " product .
Those include Standard and Enhanced packages that offer much the same speeds as the consumer packages , but come with extra niceties such as 24/7 support , domain name services , and static IP addresses .
The Standard package starts at $ 95 per month and the Enhanced plan goes for $ 160 .
Douglas was careful to emphasize that bandwidth abusers are a very small minority of Comcast 's customers , reiterating that the issue is confined to less than 0.01 percent of the company 's subscribers .
" In fact , 95 percent of our users could increase their bandwidth usage a hundred - fold and still be in compliance , " he said .
When asked whether Comcast would be better off with a proactive policy that spells out the limits in advance , Douglas defended the company 's current stance .
" We think it 's a very proactive policy , " he argued .
" We actively monitor and look for patterns of repeated and consistent use with the goal of ensuring our customers have the best network possible . "
Most of the users contacted by Comcast ratchet their usage back significantly when they 're done , according to the company .
Although Comcast is at the forefront of recent discussion around the issue of bandwidth caps , the company is by no means the only ISP with a cap .
Much to the dismay of broadband users around the world , ISPs have begun turning to bandwidth caps in an attempt to cut down on the amount and type of traffic flowing through their networks .
Many of those have actually relaxed over the past few years : in 2002 , Canadian ISP Sympatico had a 5 GB bandwidth cap .
Users now indicate that the cap has been raised to 60 GB for many users , while some have an unlimited bandwidth allowance .
Comcast 's biggest problem may not be the fact that the bandwidth caps exist but that the company is n't transparent about how they work and at what level users will run into trouble .
The situation is magnified by the fact that there appears to be a strong overlap between two populations : those who have run afoul of the ISP 's limits and those who are likely to complain loudly when they feel they are being treated unfairly by their ISP .
It may very well be that a minute proportion of Comcast users are affected by the caps — although using Douglas ' 99.99 percent figure , that still works out to around 1,150 users based on Comcast 's 11.5 million subscribers as of the end of 2006 — and it 's great that Comcast calls users who are going overboard on bandwidth instead of merely pulling the plug once the mystery number is reached .
But it seems that Comcast and its users could be spared a lot of pain if that number was n't such a big mystery .

Most Americans have long ago now reached two conclusions about their government .
First , that George W. Bush is an incompetent president with , additionally , a temperament ill - suited to the job .
And second , that his grand project - the invasion of Iraq - was a major mistake .
Both these conclusions are absolutely incorrect .
But only by omission .
They are , in fact , quite accurate as far as they go - it 's just that they do n't go nearly far enough .
Bush is incompetent and Iraq is likely the greatest foreign policy blunder in two - plus centuries of American history .
But to say that - and particularly to say that alone - does not truly do justice to either disaster , Bush or his war .
The truth about this president and his motives for war are far , far uglier than the words ' incompetence ' or ' mistake ' imply .
But getting to that requires of American citizens several attributes which have been , shall we say , in something less than great abundance of late .
It requires historical background , factual knowledge , a motivation to understand , and the wisdom that results from the combination of all of these .
And it requires a substantial degree of courage to go where the facts lead .
Most Americans lack a large degree of each of these , let alone the requisite combination of all of them .
As such , this much reviled president is perceived as ' merely ' incompetent and error - prone .
Would that he and his actions were actually so benign .
It would be a much better world .
In fact , they are far more deeply pernicious than Americans are willing to let themselves understand .
One way to appreciate the extent of American ' ostriching ' is by doing a bit of comparative analysis .
It is a curious and telling fact that Europeans figured out Bush far before his own constituents did .
There are two reasons for that .
One is that they were less frightened than we were .
Not that they 're necessarily braver than Americans in general , but they 've had more experience of terrorism in the past , and we were just hit badly - they were n't .
Americans were therefore a fearful people in 2002 and 2003 , looking for leadership and reassurance .
But looking , as it would turn out , in all the wrong places .
The other thing is that Europeans have a more mature politics than Americans do - let 's just come right out and say it .
You can see it in their attitudes toward sexuality , drugs and crime .
You can see it in their wholesale rejection of nationalism and religion , humanity 's worst mythologies and twin curses , wherever they arise .
You can see it in their rejection of the juvenile selfishness that characterizes the American style of raw capitalism and obsessive consumption .
And you can see it , especially , in their foreign policies and attitudes toward war .
In large part because they so heavily and repeatedly paid the consequences of their own prior immaturity about war , their understanding and approach to it today are far more advanced than that of Americans .
It is not that Europeans are cowards or unreliable allies , as American neoconservatives love to paint them whenever the folks on the other side of the Pond get in the way of the raw exercise of American imperial power .
They are neither .
What they are , rather , is sober .
They understand that war is sometimes a necessary resort , but that it must always be the very last resort , and only ever contemplated when the alternative is considerably more horrible ( which is to say , given the horror of war , very rarely indeed ) .
They know this all to well , because they spent centuries living it up close and personal .
As someone once remarked , " Europeans know that anything could happen there , because everything has happened there " .
They have learned through the hard experiences of Flanders and Stalingrad and Normandy and Dresden and Dachau the stakes involved when the public is cavalier or even less than vigilant about holding back the dogs of war .
Americans have some sense of this after the twin disasters of Vietnam and Iraq , but both of these were fought elsewhere .
And , however ugly they were , by far and away the vast majority of the dying was done by brown people living on other shores .
Not pleasant , to be sure , but not catastrophic at home .
We have never experienced Berlin , 1945 .
Europeans also have a greater sense of history than Americans do - and , sadly , they'd be hard - pressed not to , of course - which gives them a larger wisdom about power and human nature .
They understand that the motivations for war by those who make it are not always quite , um , as advertised .
National leaders do not usually call upon their people to risk life and limb to advance the glory , wealth and power of those same kings or prime ministers , largely because damn few would .
Instead , wars must be packaged as necessary to the preserve the national honor , protect national security , or to bring the benefits of some political system or religion to other people .
Well before Europeans managed to stop fighting each other they were gaining an understanding of this principle .
Not for nothing has war long been referred to as the ' sport of kings ' on the continent .
And , as it turns out , people are generally not terribly interested in risking their lives , their health , their property , their families , their communities and their sanity so that a handful of elites can have a rollicking good time and maybe score some booty in the process .
Ironically , Americans have a rather similar database on which to draw .
I 'd be surprised if more than five or ten percent of Americans would agree with the proposition that any prior president ever lied the country into a foreign war ( though perhaps the number would be higher in the present context than it was before 2003 ) .
Indeed , I 'd be surprised if that many could even name the major foreign wars in the country 's history .
Those wars include the Mexican War , the Spanish - American War , World War I , World War II , Korea , Vietnam , the Gulf War and the present wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Of these nine , at least four - or nearly half - and possibly more involved known egregious lies on the part of the administrations conducting them .
And what is revealed when such lies are peeled away is that there was absolutely nothing necessary about these wars whatsoever .
For example , the deceits that were used to justify the invasion of Mexico and the theft of about one - third of its territory were so great that at least one congressman was motivated to denounce President Polk for conducting " the sheerest deception " in lying to the Congress and the country about the war .
Perhaps you 've heard of this fellow before .
Congressman Abraham Lincoln went on to bemoan the " fact that the United States Army , in marching to the Rio Grande , marched into a peaceful Mexican settlement , and frightened the inhabitants away from their homes and their growing crops " .
He further accused the president of fighting an unnecessary war and of violating the Constitution in doing so , though he nevertheless also voted to supply the Army during the war ( why does that ring familiar ? ) .
The Spanish - American
War was likely another instance of trumped up war .
After multiple investigations over the last century , it is still unclear whether the USS Maine sunk as a result of a mine or an accidental internal explosion , and that lack of clarity alone should have been enough to prevent the war .
What is completely clear , however , is that appetent imperialists and yellow journalists were hungry for the war , so much so that they succeeded in bringing it about , including ugly extended fighting in the Philippines against the anti-colonialist guerillas whom the Americans were supposed to be there liberating .
Indeed , so great was the manufactured pressure for war that President McKinley , who did n't want to fight it , was ultimately forced to do so .
Then there 's Vietnam , the lies surrounding which could fill a library .
Here , we have documentary evidence beyond question of these fabrications , supplied via the bravery of Daniel Ellsberg and his colleagues .
They risked their freedom and very lives to prove the degree to which the government was lying to the American public and Congress about its involvement in Nam , its involvement in surrounding countries , and its knowledge that the war was hopeless even while it was saying just the opposite .
Oh , and did I mention how it was the US government , not the evil communists , who walked out on a previously - negotiated international agreement to allow Vietnam to decide its own fate by ballots , not bullets , simply because it was clear that the American proxies would lose the vote ?
Or that the American government green - lighted the coup that resulted in the assassination of the President of South Vietnam , the country where we were fighting to preserve ' democracy ' ?
Or the Gulf of Tonkin ' incident ' - far weaker a casus belli than even the sinking of the Maine - that gave the pretext for the major escalation of the war ?
Hey , we 're just warming up here .
As McGeorge Bundy said , " Pleikus are streetcars " .
If you wait long enough , one will come along , and you can therefore use such an incident to justify your bombing escalation , your war , or whatever you want to do .
As for the Gulf War , it seems quite probable that Bush the Elder ( good lord , how do people from this reprobate family keep becoming president ? ) had his ambassador , April Glaspie , give Saddam a go - ahead to invade Kuwait , especially given that Saddam produced a tape recording of the conversation which has her saying just that .
Of course , the Bush folks just claimed that Saddam had doctored the tape , and there went that .
We do know for sure that evidence presented to the public and Congress about Saddam 's atrocities was bogus , even though the dictator had surely committed many such crimes in reality .
But the big lie about the Gulf War was the unspoken assumption that the United States was continuing its role as the friend of peace , freedom and democracy , fighting Saddam 's nasty aggressive dictatorship .
In reality , we had helped create Saddam , we had been silent if not complicit when he was committing his worst atrocities , and after the war we stood by and watched as he annihilated his own people whom we 'd set up like so many human bowling pins .
Most importantly , though , when he had invaded a neighboring country one decade before he committed the unforgivable sin of attacking Kuwait , the US government had actually encouraged him in that effort , armed him , and supplied him with satellite and other intelligence data .
That resulted in the Iraq - Iran War , one of the most brutal of the late - twentieth century .
To go to war in 1990 / 91 , therefore , out of moral indignation at the invasion of Kuwait , was a massive hypocritical lie .
Go figure , eh ?
Just as shocking is the fact that everything about the present war in Iraq has been a lie , as well .
We know that Bush planned to invade for domestic ( let alone personal psychological ) purposes well before he was even president , let alone before 9/11 .
We know that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 .
We know that the administration knew that Saddam was no threat .
We know that they lied repeatedly and egregiously about the evidence that he was .
We know that they lie like flea - ridden dogs to this day when they continually claim to be supporting the troops , but still can't even get them sufficient armor .
And on and on and on .
But absent a knowledge of this historical record , and absent sufficient courage to grapple with its implications , and absent the facts and costs of the current war in daily life , and absent a motivation to understand these things , Americans continue to vaguely disapprove of the war and the president who bequeathed it to us .
That is well , proper and necessary , but hardly sufficient .
This was not a ' mistake ' made by an ' incompetent ' president .
It was those things , to be sure , but leaving it at that would be like describing 9/11 in the history books as an airplane crash .
This was a king sporting .
This was a war trumped up with zero necessity .
This was a war of power and profit .
This was a war of immense deceits .
This is a disastrous war of epic proportions .
My guess is that Americans simply can't go there , just as many can't possibly entertain the thought that 9/11 might have been done by their government , or at least perhaps allowed to happen .
People can imagine that the war was a mistake , but not that they are such pathetic pawns of their own government that their lives and the lives of American military personnel are of zero consequence to political elites .
Or that those daddy - figures upon whom they rely for their precarious sense of security could in fact be vicious predators readily able to betray , ruin and destroy their own public for purposes of financial or power enrichment .
This is just too much for the psyche to handle .
This is something that happens in banana republics , or history books , right ? - not in contemporary democratic America .
And certainly not by those super - patriots of the Republican right , the ones who are so eternally vigilant about keeping us safe .
To truly understand the magnitude of what is at stake here , one has to resort to the greatest of violations of trust of which the human animal is capable , such as the molestations of daughters by their fathers , or of little boys by their priests , or the betrayal of comrades during wartime .
Such sickening transgressions are often too heinous to even contemplate , frequently blowing the psychological circuits of anyone subjected to them .
Sometimes the choice is between denial or death .
And so it is that Americans continue through their day , oblivious - by self design - to the magnitude of the evil that has been visited upon them .
But , ironically , this is not remedy at all .
Obliviousness to victimization by government is no excuse , especially in a democracy , and especially when other innocent people are much greater victims , to the tune of about a million in number .
To a very large extent , those who would ignore the crimes committed in their name - crimes they have the power to stop - become criminals themselves .

When freelance writer Wang Jian shops for toys for her 5 - year - old son , she 's happy to pay extra for Legos blocks and Japanese - brand train sets .
The reason , she and other parents say : Foreign brands enjoy a reputation for higher quality - a perception reinforced by the product scares of recent months .
" We pay close attention to the news about toy and food safety .
If I find a problem with a certain brand , I will just stop using it for sure , " said Wang , who writes for film magazines .
China may be Santa 's global workshop , but when it comes to buying playthings for their own children , Chinese families who can afford it opt for foreign - brand toys - even if they are made in China .
Quality and safety issues are drawing more attention as incomes rise and upwardly mobile Chinese grow more health conscious .
While virtually all toys on the market , whether foreign or domestic brands , are made in China , factories making foreign brands are assumed to abide by more rigorous standards to screen out lead paint and other harmful materials .
" I dare not buy cheap wooden toys or toys with paint , " said Lin Yan , a professor at Shanghai International Studies University , whose 7 - year - old daughter tested for elevated levels of lead in her blood .
Gordon Brown was urged last night to bring back genetically modified crops and usher in a new era of nuclear power as part of a wide - ranging package to tackle the burden of population growth and climate change .
Sir David King , the government 's chief science adviser , said GM technology was " crucial " for a green revolution capable of providing enough food for the global population , which is due to exceed 9 billion by 2050 .
He added that new nuclear power stations should be built to help meet carbon emission targets until alternative green energy sources become available .
King 's comments came in a valedictory speech at the Royal Society yesterday evening .
He is due to relinquish his post at the end of the year , making way for John Beddington , a biologist at Imperial College London .
The speech follows recent revelations in the Guardian that the government has given its backing to a fresh campaign by farmers and industry to introduce GM crops to Britain .
In September , the Guardian reported that ministers believed public concerns over GM had softened .
King 's stance on GM technology incensed green campaigners yesterday .
They claimed the crops had failed to make farming sustainable and had succeeded only in giving a handful of multinational companies greater control over global food production .
King urged the prime minister to back GM and nuclear energy to tackle the major challenges of the 21st century .
" By 2050 we will need to feed over 9 billion people on the planet .
We will , I believe , only do this with the assistance of a third green revolution , and GM technologies will be crucial in delivery of this , " he said .
" To date , the government has taken a broadly neutral approach to GM issues , with its priorities being to protect human health and the environment and provide choice for the consumer over whether or not to purchase GM food .
I believe that it 's now time to revisit this issue . "
The chief scientist , who was parachuted in by Tony Blair in 2000 and quickly became involved with tackling the foot and mouth crisis , has long advocated the use of GM and nuclear , but this is his first call for the government to act .
" It is now time to give the green light to nuclear energy .
While I have high hopes for new zero-emissions technologies in the future , efficient nuclear fission power stations are already available .
I am also hopeful that fusion power stations , without the problems of nuclear waste disposal , will emerge over the coming three or four decades , " he said .
In January 2004 , King was widely praised for attacking President George Bush 's failure to tackle climate change , which he described as a more serious threat than terrorism .
The comments in King 's parting speech were rejected by the green campaigner group Friends of the Earth , which said agricultural biotechnology was not the solution to environmental problems .
" Despite 30 years of research ... GM crops have failed to deliver the sustainable solutions that are urgently needed , " said Claire Oxborrow , a GM campaigner with the organisation .
" We need to urgently tackle the environmental challenges .
This requires investment in worldwide sustainable farming methods which meet local environmental and social needs , a reduction in meat and livestock production and a freeze on the rush to develop agrofuels . "
King also took the opportunity to criticise the poor level of scientific understanding among ministerial advisers and warned them not to cherry - pick scientific information before briefing ministers .

Timing Trials , or , the Trials of Timing : Experiments with Scripting and User - Interface Languages
By Brian W. Kernighan ( Bell Laboratories ) and Christopher J. Van Wyk ( Department of Mathematics and Computer Science ) .
This paper describes some basic experiments to see how fast various popular script - ing and user - interface languages run on a spectrum of representative tasks .
We found enormous variation in performance , depending on many factors , some uncontrollable and even unknowable .
There seems to be little hope of predicting performance in other than a most general way ; if there is a single clear conclusion , it is that no benchmark result should ever be taken at face value .
A few general principles hold :
Compiled code usually runs faster than interpreted code : the more a program has been “ compiled ” before it is executed , the faster it will run .
Memory - related issues and the effects of memory hierarchies are pervasive : how memory is managed , from hardware caches to garbage collection , can change runtimes dramatically .
Yet users have no direct control over most aspects of memory manage - ment .
The timing services provided by programs and operating systems are woefully inad- equate .
It is difficult to measure runtimes reliably and repeatably even for small , purely computational kernels , and it becomes significantly harder when a program does much I /O or graphics .
Although each language shines in some situations , there are visible and sometimes surprising deficiencies even in what should be mainstream applications .
We encountered bugs , size limitations , maladroit features , and total mysteries for every language .
Introduction
This paper describes experiments to compare the performance of scripting languages ( like Awk , Perl , and Tcl ) and interface - building languages ( like Tck / Tk , Java , and Visual Basic ) on a set of representative computational tasks .
We found this challenging , with more difficulties and fewer clear - cut results than we had expected .
The delays could remain a fact of life across the southern border for the next few years , border officials said , at least until new security technology and expanded entry stations are installed and until Americans get used to being checked and questioned like foreigners .
Last year 234 million travelers entered the United States through land border crossings from Mexico .
W. Ralph Basham , the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection , the agency that manages the borders , said longer waits had resulted from added security measures at border stations that in many cases were aging , outmoded and facing surging traffic .
Saying the new document checks were a “ security imperative , ” Mr. Basham called on border cities , which own many of the crossing bridges , to invest in expanding the entry points .
In the meantime , Mr. Basham said , “ A safer border is well worth the wait . ”
Wait times of up to three hours have also been reported over the past few months at crossings from eastern Canada .
Senator Bernard Sanders , independent of Vermont , who held a series of town meetings with border officials about the lines , said low staffing at border stations was the primary cause there .
The longer lines along the Mexico border have been especially unsettling here in El Paso , a humming border city long comfortable in its marriage to Ciudad Juárez , the bigger and rowdier Mexican metropolis on the other bank of the Rio Grande .
Lines of cars and pedestrians at sunrise on the four border bridges here are a routine for tens of thousands of people , including many United States citizens , coming from Mexico on their way to school , work and shopping .
“ International bridge wait times continue to escalate , causing frustration and concern in my district and across the nation , ” wrote El Paso ’s congressman , Representative Silvestre Reyes , a Democrat , in a letter this month to the House Committee on Homeland Security in which he called for a hearing on the matter .
Philosopher of rap Ice - T once reflected that " Pimpin ' ai n't easy . "
We here at Cracked are inclined to agree .
That 's why these historical men deserve special commendation for bringing the bling , bitches and beatdowns to their reigns , while laying a stiff backhand across the face of convention and scoring major amounts of tang in the process .
They were , quite simply , the pimpingest men of all time .

Have you ever had days or weeks when your calendar was filled seemingly to the brim with meetings ?
As an experienced software developer in a senior technical role , I find that I am being requested to attend more and more meetings , especially to provide advice or guidance to various teams and to participate in status meetings for various projects or groups I am involved with .
At the same time , however , I am still expected to develop software – design modules , produce documentation , and sometimes even code .
Trying to balance all the meetings with the time necessary to accomplish my development tasks can be quite challenging , so I want to share six strategies I use to manage my time .
1. Say No To Meeting Invites
The best strategy that I find the hardest to use is to turn down meeting invites .
Being asked to attend a meeting is often an acknowledgment that your input is valued , especially the more senior the other attendees .
Furthermore , meeting with senior technical or management people is often beneficial for your career , while repeatedly turning down such meetings is not .
This produces a natural inclination to want to attend meetings .
To combat this , I ask two questions to determine if the meeting is worth attending :
Can I reasonably expect to make a useful contribution at the meeting ?
In other words , will others benefit from me attending the meeting ?
Can I benefit from attending the meeting ?
If the answer to both of these questions is no then it becomes easier to decline the meeting invite .
Unfortunately , few meetings meet this criteria .
2. Leave Meetings That Do Not Deliver Value
If you are in a meeting that is not providing any value for you being there , then one option is to get up and leave .
Your ability to do this will depend on your role in the meeting and your corporate culture .
I have heard that at ThoughtWorks it is considered acceptable and normal for anyone to leave a meeting at any point if they do not feel it is worth their time to be there .
The organizations I have dealt with have not had such enlightened cultures , but I have used and have seen others use this strategy at times .
This strategy works best when you are an optional attendee .
3. Tentatively Accept , Then Choose When To Go
Regularly scheduled status meetings are a significant percentage of the meetings I am asked to attend .
This is especially an issue with being on multiple projects when each has one ( or more ) regular weekly or biweekly meetings .
The biggest problem with regularly scheduled meetings is that they consistently use up your time , week after week , and I find that they deliver limited benefit for the time spent .
One strategy I use is to only tentatively accept the invite for such meetings .
This gives me the freedom to choose not to attend , whereas accepting the meeting creates the expectation that I will attend every one .
This works especially well for formal meetings with published agendas and minutes .
If the agenda has items that are worth my time to attend , I will , otherwise I 'll just browse the minutes or talk briefly with someone else who attended .
4. Double Book Meetings
Double booking two meetings at the same time is another time - saving strategy .
With two meetings scheduled for the same or overlapping times , you can choose which to go to , with an excuse for missing the other that almost every manager will accept .
This works especially well when one of them is a regular status meeting that you can afford to skip .
Another option is to attend a portion of both meetings .
At the start of the first meeting if you point out your need to leave early , you can often get the agenda shuffled to talk about the issues requiring your attendance first .
You can then leave for the second meeting having derived most of the value from the first meeting in a shorter period of time .
If your organization uses a shared calendering application that allows you to see the availability of others when scheduling meetings then using the prior strategy of tentatively accepting meetings makes it easier to get double bookings , as others will schedule meetings for when you are tentatively available .
This in turn makes it easier to only tentatively accept their meeting , with the excuse that you may have another at the same time .
5. Penalize Projects For Meetings
A different strategy I use is to " penalize " projects for wasting my time in status meetings .
I accomplish this by allocating a fixed number of hours per week to each project .
If I only allocate four hours a week to a project , and the project manager wants me to attend a one hour status meeting each week , then that uses up 25 % of my time for that project .
I have at times emphasized this point .
When asked in a status meeting how long it will take me to finish a task , I 'll point out that I lost an hour due to the meeting , and thus have one less hour left in the following five business days to work on the task .
At this point you may be getting the impression that I think that status meetings are always a waste of time and do everything to avoid them .
Not at all .
Status meetings are useful for a variety of reasons , and I do attend a fair number of them .
Since I am expected to produce work outside of meetings , however , I do need to ensure that I have significant blocks of non-meeting time available .
6. Schedule Meetings With Myself
It seems ironic that one solution to too many meetings is to schedule more , but it works .
When I absolutely need to get a piece of work done , I 'll schedule a meeting just for myself to work on the task .
This strategy works best when your organization uses a shared calendering application such as Microsoft Outlook that allows you to see the availability of others when scheduling meetings .
Other people trying to schedule a meeting with you will see that your schedule is busy and change the meeting time to accommodate you .
If the topic is urgent , people may decide to meet anyways without you .
In order to make progress on significant work tasks , I sometimes schedule full - day meetings one or more days in a row .
The downside with doing this is that the next few days afterwards tend to completely fill up with meetings if I am not careful .
There are several variations of this strategy that I use as well .
When others want me to review a design or document with them in a few days and ask when I will be available , I tell them to schedule a meeting with me .
This ensures I 'll have a block of time available that day to meet and go through what they want reviewed , rather than waiting till that day and risk having it fill up with other meetings .
When I am waiting for others to do some tasks for me , and not seeing results for a significant period of time , then I will schedule a meeting with them which they will invariably accept .
When they come to the " meeting " , I review the tasks I am waiting for and then explain that the next hour ( or however long the meeting is ) is for them to work on these tasks .
My logic is hard to turn down : if they had the time to set aside to meet with me , then they have the time to do my tasks .
Too many meetings can sap your productivity and prevent you from achieving the state of flow when working on a design or coding task .
So a necessary component of managing your time is to manage your meetings .

Controversies over the classroom role of evolution in Texas and Florida could set a national precedent , say science education watchdogs .
Texas , where a former Bush appointee led the dismissal of a pro-evolution education official , and Florida , where evolution - friendly science standards are under attack , will both revise their science education standards in the next year .
Along with California , they 're the largest textbook markets in the nation .
If they want texts describing evolution as an unproven assumption , publishers will make them – and other states will buy the same books by default .
Is the Discovery Institute – the creationist think tank that promotes as science the theory of intelligent design , which posits a divine explanation for the origins of life – using Texas and Florida as an entry to the nation 's classrooms ?
I posed the question to Josh Rosenau of the National Center for Science Education , Florida Citizens for Science president Joe Wolf and Fordham Institute science education expert Lawrence Lerner .
Wrote Rosenau ,
The DI has a long history of involvement with the Texas standards process and with textbook adoption in Texas ....
Because of the size of the Texas textbook market , and because many other states follow their lead , publishers generally follow whatever direction Texas points them in .
... I have n't seen any evidence of the Discovery Institute getting involved [ in Florida ] .
The DI tends to be stealthier about their religious motives than the folks opposing the standards have been thus far .
My fear is that Florida will do something like happened in Kansas a couple years ago , with the Board of Education overruling the decisions made by the expert committee appointed to draft the new standards .
Wolf was n't quite so sure that growing public opposition to Florida 's proposed science standards is unrelated to the Discovery Institute .
We have seen what we think is some involvement of DI here in Florida , but it is all supposition on my part .
For example , Fred Cutting , an engineer from over in Pinellas , wrote a letter to the framers committee
( he is on that committee ) .
I personally do n’t think he wrote the letter himself or alone .
We have also had over the last year or so lectures about ID from people associated with DI .
But we have had no information that DI is involved in the letter writing campaigns to the state board .
It seems more like DOE , churches and maybe some Christian colleges are pushing this .
( Cutting 's letter to the framers committee – one of the two committees charged with drafting the state 's new science standards – was mentioned in this Christian Post article .
Wrote Cutting , a retired engineer who has taught intelligent design to high school students ,
" Students should learn why some scientists give scientific critiques of standard models of neo-Darwinian evolution . " )
Lawrence Lerner said Florida and Texas should certainly be seen as beachheads in the battle against intelligent design .
He wrote ,
The Dover case was a serious setback to creationists , ID or otherwise .
However , no one involved in science education ever thought the IDCs would go away on account of a single courthouse defeat .
Florida and
Texas represent two chances to get a Federal district court opinion that contradicts the Pennsylvania one , and the present and possible future makeup of the Supreme Court gives the creationists considerable encouragement to give it their best try .
It 's important to remember that the creationist controversy exists purely in the public / political realm and not the scientific realm .
That will continue to be the case until the unlikely day when a creationist , using creationist " scientific principles " ( of which there are none )
makes a genuine contribution to the life sciences .
The case Lerner referred to is Kitzmiller v. Dover , a 2005 decision in which a federal court judge designated intelligent design as religion , not science .
I asked Lerner whether he expects new lawsuits to be filed in Florida and Texas , and whether he thinks the curricula controversies are part of a plan .
He responded ,
Nothing much has happened yet .
In Florida , the public - comment period for the draft science standards has just closed .
I believe that the writing committee will have one more go at the draft in light of the comments this week .
They will submit their work to the Board of
Education quite soon .
The Board of Ed will then decide what is to be done with the final draft when it meets in January .
You can be sure that the creationists will be there in force and with a well - planned attack on the evolutionary content of the draft .
What happens after that is up to the Board , but you should bear in mind that its membership includes a number of creationists appointed by Jeb Bush .
In Texas , the science standards will not be up for revision until some time in 2008 – I 'm not sure of the exact date .
However , the Board of
Ed has sent a strong ( if covert ) signal in the firing of Ms. Comer , and the Department has made the remarkable statement that it must remain
" neutral " in the matter of creationism vs evolution .
The new state education chairman is a creationist , though he has disavowed intention to manipulate the science standards .
So what happens in Texas remains to be seen , and will doubtless be affected by what happens in Florida at an earlier date .
The public comment period for Florida 's new standards ends Friday .

IN the dressing room of an Atlantic City nightclub , furnished by the request of its current occupant with cheese steaks from the White House Sub Shop and a full array of Tastykake snacks , Jerry Seinfeld was explaining the stand - up comedy ritual of “ getting in the bubble ” : a state of mind that a performer seeks before show time , a few final moments of calm before the tumult of an unpredictable live audience .
And make no mistake .
When Mr. Seinfeld faces his crowd , he is usually thinking of the exchange in raw , physical terms : a competition to be won or lost .
“ I want to get ’em bad , ” he said .
Minutes later he emerged from the bubble and onto a stage at Resorts Atlantic City , to riff about the banalities of bachelorhood and marriage , Cinnabons and iPhones , burials and cremations , and relentlessly to mock an indiscreet heckler who had made the mistake of announcing that his nickname was Potato Head .
The hourlong routine was a crucial opportunity for Mr. Seinfeld to practice his act at a time when he feels , as he often does , that he ’s not performing enough .
“ No matter how many times you ’ve done it in the past , it ’s got to be polished or it goes away , ” he had said backstage .
“ The act just packs up and starts walking away . ”

This Boeing 727 is a work - in - progress home conversion , built by Bruce Campbell from Hillsboro , Oregon .
He maintains that anybody can do it , given desire , luck ( acquiring decommissioned plane ) and determination .
As he points out , this house gives
" A feeling of strength , security , capability and ergonomics that eclipses any other , almost as if you were in a home designed 50 years in the future .

Besides , he says , it 's a great toy .
On his site there is a million of pictures of the work - in - progress , both exterior and interior of jet - house , and FAQ , in which he elaborates on the cost of the project ( it 's possible to do it for under $ 100 K ) and a cool possibility to build a house out of wide - body 747 jet ( you would need a bigger yard for that )
2. Dream Plane - Boat
The " Cosmic Muffin " is the most unusual plane - boat , made out of the historic and rare aircraft - " Boeing 307 Stratoliner " ( 1937 )
Boeing 307 Stratoliner was originally owned by the aviation pioneer Howard Hughes .
He acquired the plane in 1939 as part of his purchase of TWA .
Many additional pictures of the original plane can be found here .
The other Boeing 307 , Pan Am Clipper “ Flying Cloud ” , was restored for the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution :
In 1969 the plane was converted into a boat " The Londonaire " , and was discovered by Jimmy Buffett , who actually wrote his first novel around it in 1997 .
Finally David R. Drimmer and his company PlaneBoats has extensively remodeled and rebuilt it .
They named it " the Cosmic Muffin " - a dream - boat from Jimmy Buffett ’s novel .
Today " Cosmic Muffin " is stationed in Fort Lauderdale and open to the public for scheduled visits .
Honorable Mentions
This site seems to mean business , but the non-professional look of the site and obviously photoshopped picture make one doubt their credibility :

Police : Gunman died of self - inflicted gunshot COLORADO SPRINGS 
The man who killed four people at a church and missionary training center died of a self - inflicted shotgun wound , police said Tuesday .
Matthew Murray , 24 , was struck multiple times by a security officer at New Life Church Sunday but died after firing a single shot at himself , the El Paso County Coroner 's Office concluded after an autopsy .
VIDEO : Autopsy results reveal suicide
The teenage sisters he killed at the church , Stephanie and Rachel Works , both were shot in the torso .
Murray shot and killed four people at a missionary center in Arvada and the church 80 miles away .
VICTIMS : Seven people caught in the crossfire Police said Tuesday he had been expelled from the center and harbored " discontent ' toward it .
Murray , who lived in Englewood , Colo. , and was the son of a neurologist , arrived at the church with an assault rifle , two pistols and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition .
He also wounded the sisters ' father and two other church members before Jeanne Assam , 42 , gunned him down , according to police documents filed in court .
The documents said it was Murray who earlier that day killed two staff members and wounded two others at the Youth With a Mission training school in Arvada , north of Denver .
Arvada Police Chief Don
Wick said homicide detectives are " investigating the reasons for his departure from the group " in 2002 .
Wick said forensics tests Monday afternoon matched a handgun found on Murray 's body with spent bullet shells at the missionary center murder scene .
" We believe that Matthew Murray is responsible for the crime , " Wick said .
Police from both cities , working jointly on the cases , said they believe Murray acted alone at each scene but are investigating whether anyone else was involved in planning the assaults .
The Associated Press reported that in court papers filed Monday , police said it appeared Murray " had been kicked out of the ( Youth With a Mission ) program three years prior and in the past few weeks had sent different forms of hate mail to the program and / or its director . "
Colorado Springs Police Sgt. Jeff Jensen , lead homicide investigator in the case , added that Murray " did express his discontent " with the missionary school .
In a written statement , the school said " issues with his health made it inappropriate " for Murray to finish his studies there .
The statement did not elaborate .
It also said that Stephanie , 18 , and Rachael , 16 , " were involved with a summer outreach " organized by the church and a Youth With a Mission ministry that rents office space at New Life 's sprawling campus on the north edge of Colorado Springs .
Murray 's father , Ronald Murray , is a Denver - area neurologist and multiple sclerosis researcher .
Two hours after the Colorado Springs shootings , Arvada police searched a home in Englewood , a suburb of Denver where Matthew Murray lived with his younger brother .
Assam has been hailed as a hero for saving hundreds of other lives .
The first gunshots outside " were so loud I thought he was inside , " Assam said .
" There was chaos " in the church as people fled from the shooting .
She said she went out into the hallway where Murray had entered the building .
" I took cover , waited for him to get closer , identified myself , engaged him and took him down . "
Assam previously worked as a police officer in Minneapolis from March 1993 to November 1997 .
Assam is among a dozen volunteer security guards at the church , senior pastor Brady Boyd said .
Boyd said they were a necessary precaution because of " the prominence of the church . "
New Life founder Ted Haggard was dismissed last year after a former male prostitute alleged he had a three - year , cash - for - sex relationship with him .
After the missionary school shooting , the church beefed up security further for Sunday 's service .

Doing the jobs Americans are n’t willing to do
Given the recent rhetoric in Republican circles about immigration policy , I found this story spectacularly amusing .
The California Republican Party has decided no American is qualified to take one of its most crucial positions — state deputy political director — and has hired a Canadian for the job through a coveted H - 1B visa , a program favored by Silicon Valley tech firms that is under fire for displacing skilled American workers .
Christopher Matthews , 35 , a Canadian citizen , has worked for the state GOP as a campaign consultant since 2004 .
But he recently was hired as full - time deputy political director , with responsibility for handling campaign operations and information technology for the country ’s largest state Republican Party operation , California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring confirmed in a telephone interview this week .
In the nation ’s most populous state — which has produced a roster of nationally known veteran political consultants — “ it ’s insulting but also embarrassing … to bring people from the outside who do n’t know the difference between Lodi and Lancaster … and who ca n’t even vote , ” said Karen Hanretty , a political commentator and former state GOP party spokeswoman .
Wait , it gets funnier .
Matthews was hired by Michael Kamburowski , the state GOP ’s chief operations officer , who is … wait for it … an Australian citizen .
“ There are talented Republicans in California , and the message that ( party chair ) Ron Nehring is sending is that there ’s no talent pool here , ” Hanretty said .
Just to be clear , I do n’t care who the California Republican Party hires .
I ’m sure these two guys are perfectly capable political professionals .
But given the GOP ’s immigration policy , and it ’s take on the H - 1B visa program , these hires are a little surprising , are n’t they ?
The hiring of two immigrants at top Republican Party posts has handed ammunition to critics who note that many Republicans have spoken critically about the impacts of waves of Mexican immigrants .
“ The hypocrisy is disgusting , ” said longtime Democratic Party activist Gloria Nieto , policy director at San Jose - based Services Immigration Rights and Education Network , or SIREN , an immigrant advocacy nonprofit organization .
Nieto argued that the party has painted Latinos “ as the brown menace . …
But it ’s perfectly OK to hire people from outside the country ?
What does it say about the Republican Party that they import their hired guns ? ”
As for the H - 1B visa program in specific , it ’s supposed to focus on “ specialized workers ” whose unique skills are unavailable in the American workforce .
According to Labor Department regulations , employers are supposed to make a good - faith effort to hire Americans , and then rely on “ specialized ” immigrants if necessary .
So , in other words , the California Republican Party is suggesting that in the largest state in the Union , there were no qualified people to serve as the state deputy political director .
Too funny .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Norway has drawn up plans to build the world ’s first shipping tunnel which would save time and money for vessels passing through a coastal area known for its dangerous seas .

Strong winds , high waves and powerful currents in the area of Stad on the southwest coast of Norway cause long delays while ships wait for calmer conditions .
A recent report from the Norwegian Coastal Administration recommended building the 1,700 - metre ( 5,577 feet ) tunnel and concluded that it would be cost effective .
The tunnel , estimated to cost around $ 310 million and take five years to build , would cut through a peninsula , saving ships the risky journey around the coastline .
The idea to build a shipping passage was first put forward long ago .
Some say the first sketch was made in 1870 , others say plans started around 1920 with the idea of building a canal through the peninsula .
But in the 1980s , the concept gained momentum and the government got involvement .
“ What ’s new is that we have managed to calculate the costs of waiting , ” coastal director Kirsti Slotsvik told Reuters .
She said the tunnel could also prevent loss of life .
Reduced stress for sailors , heightened quality of shipped products from reduced transport time and growth of tourism also weigh in favor of the tunnel , officials said .
The Coastal Administration has recommended a design that would provide flexibility for future growth in ship sizes .
The plan has been sent to the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal affairs , which could present it to parliament in 2009 at the earliest , an official said .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - A group of Chinese reporters came up with a novel idea to test how greedy local hospitals were -- pass off tea as urine samples and submit the drink for tests .
The results : six out of 10 hospitals in Hangzhou , the capital of the rich coastal province of Zhejiang , visited by the reporters over a two - day period this month concluded that the patients ’ urinal tracts were infected .
Five of the hospitals prescribed medication costing up to 400 yuan ( $ 50 ) , the online edition of the semi-official China News Service ( www.chinanews.com) said in a report seen on Wednesday .
Of the hospitals , four were state - owned .
“ It makes one shiver all over even though it ’s not cold , ” the China News Service said after its reporters and colleagues from Zhejiang Television tested the hospitals .
The Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper said in a commentary on Wednesday : “ Healthy people are diagnosed with diseases .
Small ailments are said to be serious problems .
Patients have become automatic teller machines for the hospitals . ”
The failure of health reforms and rising costs of medical care have sparked social discontent and become flashpoints for unrest in the world ’s most populous nation , where millions cannot afford to consult doctors or buy medicine .
Health Minister Gao Qiang has accused greedy hospitals of charging excessive fees and prescribing unnecessary and expensive medication .
Market reforms in the past two decades have cut off state subsidies to many hospitals and left the health care system in need of life support .
State media have reported patients committing suicide because they cannot afford exorbitant medical costs .
Video games that simulate the experiences of combat , space travel and car theft have achieved a startling level of fluidity and detail in recent years to create increasingly realistic virtual worlds .
When it comes to medicine , however , the graphics that doctors and surgeons have to work with are closer to the grainy , cartoonish images of the Atari generation than they are to the video games Assassin 's Creed or Grand Theft Auto .
The computing power required to render virtually realistic organs and soft tissue is still unavailable to most physicians ( except for a handful with access to supercomputers ) , but it 's coming , says Joseph Teran , an assistant mathematics professor at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Teran envisions a time within the next five years when medical professionals will be able to scan patients prior to procedures and create three - dimensional virtual images of their bodies , which they can store in computers and use for practice before performing the real surgeries .
Tissue , muscle and skin are elastic and behave like a spring , and their characteristics can be expressed using classical mathematical theory , Teran says .
To develop virtual models of patients , physicians must create geometric representations of their tissue and organs using either magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or computed tomography ( CT ) .
The information that these scanners currently provide , however , is in the form of numbers representing shades of gray , which are insufficient for creating accurate , real - color , three - dimensional renderings .
" It 's a data processing problem , because this information is not in the correct format , " Teran says .
He also estimates that it would now take as many as 20 professionals up to nine months to produce even a roughly accurate model of the human body .
The answer ?
Faster computers with improved software algorithms that can solve mathematical problems that have unknown elements and multiple independent variables .
Teran is confident that the technology will catch up with the demands placed on it , and that researchers must be ready for the day when this improved technology becomes available .
" Even if you do n't have eight - core processors now , you can use large computing clusters at universities to test your algorithms , " he says .
Some of his colleagues are even working with chipmaker Intel to make sure their software will work with future generations of Intel technology .
To date , virtual surgery models have been primarily used to create before and after images in reconstructive surgery procedures .
Other uses have been limited to simulating specific body parts , such as an organ , a cluster of muscles or a craniofacial malformation .
In reconstructive surgery , virtualization has been used to map movement disorders like those associated with cerebral palsy , allowing surgeons to , via a computer , rearrange a patient 's muscular skeletal model to de-emphasize weaker muscles and emphasize stronger ones before setting foot in an actual operating room .
Virtual surgery used in this manner has also been limited by technology , as most computers available to surgeons for this work can do little more than render relatively crude images of tissue , muscles and organs .
" It 's something that 's there but more at a limited scale , " Teran says .
As a graduate student , Teran worked with plastic surgeon Court Cutting at New York University Medical Center using computer graphic methods to develop statistical descriptions of three - dimensional images of craniofacial malformations and propose surgical methods for their correction .
Cutting uses CT scans of each patient and employs a computer to map those images onto the image of a normal skull .
Once the hardware and software are available , it could take up to 20 years for this technology to become widely used by cost conscious hospitals and health care systems .
But ultimately , Teran says , doctors will have access to the tools that will allow them to simulate abnormalities in any organ system based on computerized MRI and CT scans .
" Google cannot and will not censor the information which appears on its search engines .
What is and is n't proper internet content is for governments and courts to decide , not for us , " said Meir Brand , CEO of Google Israel Monday .
Brand spoke at a coference held by the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) in Herzliya , titled " Poisoning the Web – Hate on the Internet , " which included a special panel on Google 's refusal to censor anti-Semitic results that pop -up on its search engines .
Cyber Hatred Hamas kids ' website incites against Israel Ynetnews Days after Hamas TV show receives public censure for promoting hatred , ADL reports similar incitement on party 's website for children Hamas kids ' website incites against Israel
" The world 's governments are more preoccupied with pornography being available online than they are with racism and anti-Semitism , " said ADL director of internet operations , attorney Christopher Wolf , who took part in the panel .
Wolf brought as an example a website called Jew Watch , which presented itself as an online library for Jewish history , but in fact held anti-Semitic content .
The site was able to obtain the coveted first - on - the - list spot in Google 's search engine , spiking its readership accordingly .
Once Jew Watch 's true nature was exposed , tens of thousands of Google users signed a petition demanding the removal of the site from the search results .
Google chose instead to add an annex to the site 's link , explaining its nature .
The world , said the ADL is turning a blind eye to online racism , when alongside websites like Jew Watch , the world wide web is filled with so - called charity sites belonging to white - supremacy groups , Nazi memorabilia websites and online computer games which allow their users to kill the Jewish leader of their choice .
The internet , stressed Brand , can not be blamed for the existence of racism : " Google mirrors the real world , including some of its uglier images , like racism .
I 'm an Israeli Jew and my family survived the Holocaust .
This is n't an easy topic for me , but removing results form our webpage will not solve the problem . "
The Huygens Atmosphere Structure Instrument ( HASI ) scored a first in 2005 by measuring the electrical conductivity of Titan ’s atmosphere .
The results hint at a new way to investigate the subsurface layers of Titan and could provide insight into whether or not Titan has a subsurface ocean .
The Permittivity , Waves and Altimetry ( PWA ) sensor on Huygens detected an extremely low frequency ( ELF ) radio wave during the descent .
It was oscillating very slowly for a radio wave , just 36 times a second , and increased slightly in frequency as the probe reached lower altitudes .

If the PWA team confirms that the signal is a natural phenomenon and not an artefact of the way the instrument worked , they will have discovered a powerful new way to probe not just the atmosphere of Titan but its subsurface as well .
The only other world on which ELF waves were detected before was Earth .
They are reflected by both the surface of the Earth and its ionosphere , the rarefied region of the atmosphere where most particles are electrically charged .
This turns the atmosphere into a giant ‘ sound box ’ where certain frequencies of ELF waves resonate and are reinforced , whilst other die away .
On Titan , however , the surface is a poor reflector because of its low conductivity and so these waves penetrate the interior .
“ The wave could have been reflected by the liquid - ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia predicted by theoretical models , ” says Fernando Simões , CETP / IPSL - CNRS , France , and a member of the PWA team .

If Simões is right , successful modelling of how ELF waves resonate on Titan could lend support to the ocean ’s existence and tell scientists about the depth at which it sits .
Understanding the resonance however , is difficult .
Above about 100 kilometres altitude on Earth , the ionosphere provides the upper reflecting layer of the resonating cavity .
At Titan , PWA revealed that things are more complicated .
Apart from the ionosphere , at a much higher altitude of about 1200 kilometres , Huygens found a layer of ionized particles consisting of electrons , at 63 kilometres .
“ This does not match any previous prediction for Titan , ” says Simões .
To some extent , it splits Titan ’s atmosphere into two resonating chambers .
With so much at stake , the PWA team are checking to make sure the detection is real and not an artefact generated by the spacecraft .
They have already ruled out electrical interference from the instrument itself .
Two small arms , one on either side of Huygens , create an antenna and the team ’s next goal is to investigate whether the arms could have oscillated during the descent .
Simões and colleagues are building a special chamber to hold a replica of the instrument at the low temperature of Titan ’s atmosphere , between 100 - 200 degrees Kelvin ( about - 173 to - 73 °C ) , in order to check whether the antenna resonates at 36 hertz .
If it does , it probably means that the signal is an artefact .
If it does not , confidence in the signal ’s reality will increase and the investigation of the atmosphere and subsurface can begin .

But perhaps the biggest mystery is what generated the ELF wave in the first place .
On Earth , they are initiated by lightning strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate , releasing the ELF waves .
The PWA was designed to search for ELF waves on Titan while a microphone on Huygens kept an ear out for thunder – a sure sign of lightning .
Cassini has also been watching for lightning using its cameras .
However , Huygens suggests that there is no lightning , or very little .
“ If there is lightning on Titan , it is significantly less than the amount of lightning that Earth experiences , ” says Simões .
So what generated Titan ’s ELF ?
No one is quite sure yet .
“ It might be generated by an interaction with Saturn ’s magnetosphere or related to Titan ’s intrinsic fields , ” suggests Simões .
“ Titan is proving to be an intriguing environment . ”
One thing is certain : there is plenty to investigate .
“ The measurement of atmospheric electricity is something really new and exciting , ” says Jean - Pierre Lebreton , ESA Huygens Project Scientist .
“ We could send similar instruments to study atmospheric electricity on other celestial bodies , in particular Venus , Mars , and the giant planets , ” adds Simões .

" They shall make an ark of acacia wood , " God commanded Moses in the Book of Exodus , after delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt .
And so the Israelites built an ark , or chest , gilding it inside and out .
And into this chest Moses placed stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments , as given to him on Mount Sinai .
Thus the ark “ was worshipped by the Israelites as the embodiment of God Himself , ” writes Graham Hancock in The Sign and the Seal .
" Biblical and other archaic sources speak of the Ark blazing with fire and light ... stopping rivers , blasting whole armies . "
( Steven Spielberg 's 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark provides a special - effects approximation . )
According to the First Book of Kings , King Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem to house the ark .
It was venerated there during Solomon 's reign ( c. 970-930 B.C. ) and beyond .
Then it vanished .
Much of Jewish tradition holds that it disappeared before or while the Babylonians sacked the temple in Jerusalem in 586 B.C .
But through the centuries , Ethiopian Christians have claimed that the ark rests in a chapel in the small town of Aksum , in their country 's northern highlands .
It arrived nearly 3,000 years ago , they say , and has been guarded by a succession of virgin monks who , once anointed , are forbidden to set foot outside the chapel grounds until they die .
One of the first things that caught my eye in Addis Ababa , the country 's capital , was an enormous concrete pillar topped by a giant red star — the sort of monument to communism still visible in Pyongyang .
The North Koreans built this one as a gift for the Derg , the Marxist regime that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1991 ( the country is now governed by an elected parliament and prime minister ) .
In a campaign that Derg officials named the Red Terror , they slaughtered their political enemies — estimates range from several thousand to more than a million people .
The most prominent of their victims was Emperor Haile Selassie , whose death , under circumstances that remain contested , was announced in 1975 .
He was the last emperor of Ethiopia — and , he claimed , the 225th monarch , descended from Menelik , the ruler believed responsible for Ethiopia 's possession of the ark of the covenant in the tenth century B.C .
The story is told in the Kebra Negast ( Glory of the Kings ) , Ethiopia 's chronicle of its royal line : the Queen of Sheba , one of its first rulers , traveled to Jerusalem to partake of King Solomon 's wisdom ; on her way home , she bore Solomon 's son , Menelik .
Later Menelik went to visit his father , and on his return journey was accompanied by the firstborn sons of some Israelite nobles — who , unbeknown to Menelik , stole the ark and carried it with them to Ethiopia .
When Menelik learned of the theft , he reasoned that since the ark 's frightful powers had n't destroyed his retinue , it must be God 's will that it remain with him .
Many historians — including Richard Pankhurst , a British - born scholar who has lived in Ethiopia for almost 50 years — date the Kebra Negast manuscript to the 14th century A.D.
It was written , they say , to validate the claim by Menelik 's descendants that their right to rule was God - given , based on an unbroken succession from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba .
But the Ethiopian faithful say the chronicles were copied from a fourth - century Coptic manuscript that was , in turn , based on a far earlier account .
This lineage remained so important to them that it was written into Selassie 's two imperial constitutions , in 1931 and 1955 .
Before leaving Addis Ababa for Aksum , I went to the offices of His Holiness Abuna Paulos , patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church , which has some 40 million adherents worldwide , to ask about Ethiopia 's claim to have the ark of the covenant .
Paulos holds a PhD in theology from Princeton University , and before he was installed as patriarch , in 1992 , he was a parish priest in Manhattan .
Gripping a golden staff , wearing a golden icon depicting the Madonna cradling an infant Jesus , and seated on what looked like a golden throne , he oozed power and patronage .
" We 've had 1,000 years of Judaism , followed by 2,000 years of Christianity , and that 's why our religion is rooted in the Old Testament , " he told me .
" We follow the same dietary laws as Judaism , as set out in Leviticus , " meaning that his followers keep kosher , even though they are Christians .
" Parents circumcise their baby boys as a religious duty , we often give Old Testament names to our boys and many villagers in the countryside still hold Saturday sacred as the Sabbath . "
Is this tradition linked to the church 's claim to hold the ark , which Ethiopians call Tabota Seyen , or the Ark of Zion ?
" It 's no claim , it 's the truth , " Paulos answered .
" Queen Sheba visited King Solomon in Jerusalem three thousand years ago , and the son she bore him , Menelik , at age 20 visited Jerusalem , from where he brought the ark of the covenant back to Aksum .
It 's been in Ethiopia ever since . "
I asked if the ark in Ethiopia resembles the one described in the Bible : almost four feet long , just over two feet high and wide , surmounted by two winged cherubs facing each other across its heavy lid , forming the " mercy seat , " or footstool for the throne of God.
Paulos shrugged .
" Can you believe that even though I 'm head of the Ethiopian church , I 'm still forbidden from seeing it ? " he said .
" The guardian of the ark is the only person on earth who has that peerless honor . "
He also mentioned that the ark had not been held continuously at Aksum since Menelik 's time , adding that some monks hid it for 400 years to keep it out of invaders ' hands .
Their monastery still stood , he said , on an island in Lake Tana .
It was about 200 miles northwest , on the way to Aksum .
Ethiopia is landlocked , but Lake Tana is an inland sea : it covers 1,400 square miles and is the source of the Blue Nile , which weaves its muddy way 3,245 miles through Ethiopia , Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean .
At the outlet where the water begins its journey , fishermen drop lines from primitive papyrus boats like those the Egyptians used in the pharaohs ' days .
I glimpsed them through an eerie dawn mist as I boarded a powerboat headed for Tana Kirkos , the island of the ark .
Slowly the boatman threaded his way through a maze of tree - covered islands so dense that he began to wonder aloud whether we were lost .
When , after two hours , we suddenly confronted a rock wall about 30 yards high and more than 100 yards long , he cried , " Tana Kirkos " with obvious relief .
A fish eagle circled and squawked as a barefoot monk clad in a patched yellow robe scurried down a pathway cut into the rock and peered into our boat .
" He 's making sure there are no women aboard , " my translator said .
The monk introduced himself as Abba , or Father , Haile Mikael .
" There are 125 monks on the island , and many are novices , " he said .
" Women have been banned for centuries because the sight of them might fire the young monks ' passions . "
Another monk , Abba Gebre Maryam , joined us .
He , too , wore a patched yellow robe , plus a white pillbox turban .
A rough - hewn wooden cross hung from his neck , and he carried a silver staff topped by a cross .
In response to my questioning , he elaborated on what Abuna Paulos had told me :
" The ark came here from Aksum for safekeeping from enemies well before Jesus was born because our people followed the Jewish religion then , " he said .
" But when King Ezana ruled in Aksum 1,600 years ago , he took the ark back to Aksum . "
Ezana 's kingdom extended across the Red Sea into the Arabian peninsula ; he converted to Christianity around A.D. 330 and became hugely influential in spreading the faith .
Then Abba Gebre added : " The baby Jesus and Mary spent ten days here during their long exile from Israel . "
It was after King Herod ordered the death of all boys under the age of 2 in Bethlehem , he said .
" Would you like to see the place where they often sat ? "
I followed him up a wooded path and onto a ridge where a pair of young monks were standing by a small shrine , their eyes closed in prayer .
Abba Gebre pointed to the shrine .
" That 's where Jesus and Mary sat each day while they were here . "
" What proof do you have that they came here ? " I asked .
He looked at me with what appeared to be tender sympathy and said : " We do n't need proof because it 's a fact .
The monks here have passed this down for centuries . "
Later , Andrew Wearring , a religious scholar at the University of Sydney , told me that " the journey by Jesus , Mary and Joseph is mentioned in only a few lines in the Book of Matthew — and he gives scant detail , though he does state they fled into Egypt . "
Like its former parent institution the Orthodox Coptic Church , the Ethiopian Orthodox faith holds that the family spent four years in western Egypt , Wearring said , in the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta , before returning home .
But western Egypt is over 1,000 miles northwest of Lake Tana .
Could Jesus , Mary and Joseph have traveled to Tana Kirkos ?
There 's no way to know .
On the way back to the boat , we passed small log huts with conical thatched roofs — the monks ' cells .
Abba Gebre entered one and pulled from the shadows an ancient bronze tray set on a stand .
He said Menelik brought it from Jerusalem to Aksum along with the ark .
" The Jerusalem temple priests used this tray to collect and stir the sacrificial animals ' blood , " Abba Gebre went on .
When I checked later with Pankhurst , the historian said the tray , which he had seen on an earlier visit , was probably associated with Judaic rituals in Ethiopia 's pre-Christian era .
Lake Tana , he said , was a stronghold of Judaism .
Finally , Abba Gebre led me to an old church built from wood and rock in the traditional Ethiopian style , circular with a narrow walkway hugging the outer wall .
Inside was the mak 'das , or holy of holies — an inner sanctum shielded by brocade curtains and open only to senior priests .
" That 's where we keep our tabots , " he said .
The tabots ( pronounced " TA - bots " ) are replicas of the tablets in the ark , and every church in Ethiopia has a set , kept in its own holy of holies .
" It 's the tabots that consecrate a church , and without them it's as holy as a donkey 's stable , " Abba Gebre said .
Every January 19 , on Timkat , or the Feast of the Epiphany , the tabots from churches all over Ethiopia are paraded through the streets .
" The most sacred ceremony occurs at Gonder , " he went on , naming a city in the highlands just north of Lake Tana .
" To understand our deep reverence for the ark , you should go there . "
Gonder ( pop. 160,000 ) spreads across a series of hills and valleys more than 7,000 feet above sea level .
On the advice of a friendly cleric , I sought out Archbishop Andreas , the local leader of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church .
As Andreas ushered me into a simple room in his office , I saw that he had the spindly frame and sunken cheeks of an ascetic .
Despite his high position , he was dressed like a monk , in a worn yellow robe , and he held a simple cross carved from wood .
I asked if he knew of any evidence that the ark had come to Ethiopia with Menelik .
" These stories were handed down through the generations by our church leaders , and we believe them to be historical facts , " he told me in a whisper .
" That 's why we keep tabots in every church in Ethiopia . "
At noon the next day , Andreas , in a black robe and black turban , emerged from a church on a slope above Gonder and into a crowd of several hundred people .
A dozen priests , deacons and acolytes — clad in brocade robes in maroon , ivory , gold and blue — joined him to form a protective huddle around a bearded priest wearing a scarlet robe and a golden turban .
On his head the priest carried the tabots , wrapped in ebony velvet embroidered in gold .
Catching sight of the sacred bundle , hundreds of women in the crowd began ululating — making a singsong wail with their tongues — as many Ethiopian women do at moments of intense emotion .
As the clerics began to walk down a rocky pathway toward a piazza at the center of town ( a legacy of Italy 's occupation of Ethiopia in the 1930s ) , they were hemmed in by perhaps 1,000 more chanting and ululating devotees .
At the piazza , the procession joined clerics carrying tabots from seven other churches .
Together they set off farther downhill , with the trailing throng swelling into the thousands , with thousands more lining the road .
About five miles later , the priests stopped beside a pool of murky water in a park .
All afternoon and through the night , the priests chanted hymns before the tabots , surrounded by worshipers .
Then , prompted by glimmers of light sneaking into the morning sky , Archbishop Andreas led the clerics to celebrate the baptism of Jesus by playfully splashing one another with the pool 's water .
The Timkat celebrations were to continue for three more days with prayers and masses , after which the tabots would be returned to the churches where they were kept .
I was more eager than ever to locate the original ark , so I headed for Aksum , about 200 miles northeast .
Just outside Gonder , my car passed Wolleka village , where a mud -hut synagogue bore a Star of David on the roof — a relic of Jewish life in the region that endured for as long as four millennia , until the 1990s .
That was when the last of the Bet Israel Jews ( also known as the Falasha , the Amharic word for " stranger " ) were evacuated to Israel in the face of persecution by the Derg .
The road degenerated into a rutted , rocky pathway that twisted around the hillsides , and our SUV struggled to exceed ten miles per hour .
I reached Aksum in darkness and shared the hotel dining room with United Nations peacekeepers from Uruguay and Jordan who told me they were monitoring a stretch of the Ethiopia - Eritrea border about an hour 's drive away .
The latest U.N. bulletin , they said , described the area as " volatile and tense . "
The next day was hot and dusty .
Except for the occasional camel and its driver , Aksum 's streets were nearly empty .
We were n't far from the Denakil Desert , which extends eastward into Eritrea and Djibouti .
By chance , in the lobby of my hotel I met Alem Abbay , an Aksum native who was on vacation from Frostburg State University in Maryland , where he teaches African history .
Abbay took me to a stone tablet about eight feet high and covered in inscriptions in three languages —
Greek ; Geez , the ancient language of Ethiopia ; and Sabaean , from across the Red Sea in southern Yemen , the true birthplace , some scholars believe , of the Queen of Sheba .
" King Ezana erected this stone tablet early in the fourth century , while still a pagan ruler , " Abbay told me .
His finger traced the strange - looking alphabets carved into the rock 16 centuries ago .
" Here , the king praises the god of war after a victory over a rebel people . "
But sometime in the following decade Ezana was converted to Christianity .
Abbay led me to another stone tablet covered with inscriptions in the same three languages .
" By now King Ezana is thanking ' the Lord of Heaven ' for success in a military expedition into nearby Sudan , " he said .
" We know he meant Jesus because archaeological digs have turned up coins during Ezana 's reign that feature the Cross of Christ around this time . "
Before that , they bore the pagan symbols of the sun and moon .
As we walked on , we passed a large reservoir , its surface covered with green scum .
" According to tradition , it 's Queen Sheba 's bath , " Abbay said .
" Some believe there 's an ancient curse on its waters . "
Ahead was a towering stele , or column , 79 feet high and said to weigh 500 tons .
Like other fallen and standing steles nearby , it was carved from a single slab of granite , perhaps as early as the first or second century A.D. Legend has it that the ark of the covenant 's supreme power sliced it out of the rock and set it into place .
On our way to the chapel where the ark is said to be kept , we passed Sheba 's bath again and saw about 50 people in white shawls crouched near the water .
A boy had drowned there shortly before , and his parents and other relatives were waiting for the body to surface .
" They say it will take one to two days , " Abbay said .
" They know this because many other boys have drowned here while swimming .
They believe the curse has struck again . "
Abbay and I made our way toward the office of the Neburq -ed , Aksum 's high priest , who works out of a tin shed at a seminary close by the ark chapel .
As the church administrator in Aksum , he would be able to tell us more about the guardian of the ark .
" We 've had the guardian tradition from the beginning , " the high priest told us .
" He prays constantly by the ark , day and night , burning incense before it and paying tribute to God .
Only he can see it ; all others are forbidden to lay eyes on it or even go close to it . "
Over the centuries , a few Western travelers have claimed to have seen it ; their descriptions are of tablets like those described in the Book of Exodus .
But the Ethiopians say that is inconceivable — the visitors must have been shown fakes .
I asked how the guardian is chosen .
" By Aksum 's senior priests and the present guardian , " he said .
I told him I 'd heard that in the mid-20th century a chosen guardian had run away , terrified , and had to be hauled back to Aksum .
The Neburq - ed smiled , but did not answer .
Instead , he pointed to a grassy slope studded with broken stone blocks — the remains of Zion Maryam cathedral , Ethiopia 's oldest church , founded in the fourth century A.D. " It held the ark , but Arab invaders destroyed it , " he said , adding that priests had hidden the ark from the invaders .
Now that I had come this far , I asked if we could meet the guardian of the ark .
The Neburq - ed said no : " He is usually not accessible to ordinary people , just religious leaders . "
The next day I tried again , led by a friendly priest to the gate of the ark chapel , which is about the size of a typical suburban house and surrounded by a high iron fence .
" Wait here , " he said , and he climbed the steps leading to the chapel entrance , where he called out softly to the guardian .
A few minutes later he scurried back , smiling .
A few feet from where I stood , through the iron bars , a monk who looked to be in his late 50s peered around the chapel wall .
" It 's the guardian , " the priest whispered .
He wore an olive - colored robe , dark pillbox turban and sandals .
He glanced warily at me with deep - set eyes .
Through the bars he held out a wooden cross painted yellow , touching my forehead with it in a blessing and pausing as I kissed the top and bottom in the traditional way .
I asked his name .
" I'm the guardian of the ark , " he said , with the priest translating .
" I have no other name . "
I told him I had come from the other side of the world to speak with him about the ark .
" I can't tell you anything about it , " he said .
" No king or patriarch or bishop or ruler can ever see it , only me .
This has been our tradition since Menelik brought the ark here more than 3,000 years ago . "
We peered at each other for a few moments .
I asked a few more questions , but to each he remained as silent as an apparition .
Then he was gone .
" You 're lucky , because he refuses most requests to see him , " the priest said .
But I felt only a little lucky .
There was so much more I wanted to know :
Does the ark look the way it is described in the Bible ?
Has the guardian ever seen a sign of its power ?
Is he content to devote his life to the ark , never able to leave the compound ?
On my last night in Aksum , I walked down the chapel road , now deserted , and sat for a long time staring at the chapel , which shone like silver in the moonlight .
Was the guardian chanting ancient incantations while bathing the chapel in the sanctifying reek of incense ?
Was he on his knees before the ark ?
Was he as alone as I felt ?
Was the ark really there ?
Of course I had no way of answering any of these questions .
Had I tried to slip inside in the darkness to sneak a look , I 'm sure the guardian would have raised the alarm .
And I was also held back by the fear that the ark would harm me if I dared defile it with my presence .
In the final moments of my search , I could not judge whether the ark of the covenant truly rested inside this nondescript chapel .
Perhaps Menelik 's traveling companions did take it and spirit it home to Ethiopia .
Perhaps its origins here stem from a tale spun by Aksumite priests in ancient times to awe their congregations and consolidate their authority .
But the reality of the ark , like a vision in the moonlight , floated just beyond my grasp , and so the millennia - old mystery remained .
As the devotion of the worshipers at Timkat and the monks at Tana Kirkos came back to me in the shimmering light , I decided that simply being in the presence of this eternal mystery was a fitting ending to my quest .

Fuqing ( pronounced foo - CHING ) is at the top of the list this year for refused shipments of seafood from China , with 43 rejections through November , according to records kept by the United States Food and Drug Administration .
All of those rejections involved the use of illegal veterinary drugs .
By comparison , Thailand , also a major exporter of seafood to the United States , had only two refusals related to illegal veterinary drugs .
China as a whole had 210 refusals for illegal drugs .
“ For 50 years , ” said Wang Wu , a professor at Shanghai Fisheries University , “ we ’ve blindly emphasized economic growth .
The only pursuit has been G.D.P. , and now we can see that the water turns dirty and the seafood gets dangerous .
Every year , there are food safety and environmental pollution accidents . ”
Environmental problems plaguing seafood would appear to be a bad omen for the industry .
But with fish stocks in the oceans steadily declining and global demand for seafood soaring , farmed seafood , or aquaculture , is the future .
And no country does more of it than China , which produced about 115 billion pounds of seafood last year .
China produces about 70 percent of the farmed fish in the world , harvested at thousands of giant factory - style farms that extend along the entire eastern seaboard of the country .
Farmers mass - produce seafood just offshore , but mostly on land , and in lakes , ponds , rivers and reservoirs , or in huge rectangular fish ponds dug into the earth .
“ They ’ll be a major supplier not just to the U.S. , but to the world , ” said Richard Stavis , the chairman of Stavis Seafoods , an American company that imports Chinese catfish , tilapia and frog legs .
China began emerging as a seafood power in the 1990s as rapid economic growth became the top priority in the country .
But environmental experts say that headlong pursuit of higher gross domestic product has devastated Chinese water quality and endangered the country ’s food supply .
In Guangdong Province in southern China , fish contaminated with toxic chemicals like DDT are already creating health problems .
Not your father 's ISP
Some ISPs simply discourage end users from offering WiFi connections to neighbors ; most explicitly rule it out in their terms of service .
But a small Canadian ISP called Wireless Nomad actually requires it .
Nomad does things a little differently .
The company is subscriber - owned , volunteer - run , and open - source friendly .
It offers a neutral Internet connection with no bandwidth caps or throttling , and it makes a point of creating wireless access points at the end of each DSL connection that can be used , for free , by the public .
Bell Canada this is not .
Cofounders Steve Wilton ( L ) and Damien Fox ( R )
" People like to share , " says Nomad co-founder Damien Fox when we talk about the company 's history .
And if WiMAX radios run cheap enough , the members of Wireless Nomad could eventually blanket much of Toronto with high - speed ‘ Net access .
The operation has been tough to keep running , and Fox admits that " if we knew then what we knew now ... we probably would n't have done it because it was too crazy . "
But Fox and cofounder Steve Wilton have kept Wireless Nomad up for two years already , and they hope to see the subscriber - owned model take off in more communities in Canada and the US .
Here 's how they did it ( and keep on doing it ) at a lower price than Bell Canada 's own DSL offerings .
What has mandatory line - sharing done for you lately ?
We recently profiled Copowi , a startup ISP in the US that claims to guarantee network neutrality to subscribers .
While Copowi has visions of offering service across the US , Wireless Nomad 's ambitions have been more modest .
The company has been operating since 2005 in Toronto , where Damien and some friends started the service in a Toronto condo .
It 's fitting that a former EFF summer intern would help launch a service without bandwidth caps or traffic shaping , but it 's all made possible by government regulation .
Canada has mandatory access requirements for telephone lines that require a line owner to lease out access at wholesale rates for competitors who want to resell service .
In the US , such requirements initially led to competition in the DSL space , but the line - sharing rules were eventually scrapped .
In 2005 , a California ISP called Brand X lost an important court case in which it argued that cable companies ought to share their lines , and later that year the FCC reclassified DSL in order to exempt it too from the line - sharing requirements altogether .
Once that happened , telecoms were free to resell services if they liked , but it was no longer required , and rates could be prohibitively expensive for any ISP that hoped to compete on cost ( an issue that Copowi currently faces ) .
In Canada , despite opposition from line owners , mandatory access provisions persist and make it simpler for resellers to enter the market .
According to Fox , Toronto alone has more than 100 DSL resellers , making Wireless Nomad only one among many small ISPs .
And it is small , with only 100 or so subscribers , but it can still offer DSL at a competitive price .
More importantly , it can offer DSL on its own terms .
Toronto downtown coverage map
Here 's how it works : every new subscriber gets a DSL connection that Wireless Nomad purchases through a wholesaler ( which in turn purchases service from Bell Canada and others ) .
All subscribers are asked to stick a wireless router on the DSL line , but these routers have been tricked out with OpenWRT , and subscribers use Chillispot to control access .
The idea is to make free Internet hotspots available to WiFi users all over the city , but not to do so in such a way that a subscriber 's home Internet connection is degraded .
Anyone wanting to access the wireless link needs to set up a free account and can then surf the ‘ Net at a throttled speed of 64 K bps ( obviously , this does not apply to wireless accounts created by the subscriber , who has access to the full speed of the connection ) .
Sure , this is pretty slow , but when total strangers offer you free connections over their own home connection , it 's hard to complain too much .
In the last two years , more than 5,000 accounts have been created , a good indication that the free service really is being used .
ANN ARBOR , Mich .--- Antibacterial soaps show no health benefits over plain soaps and , in fact , may render some common antibiotics less effective , says a University of Michigan public health professor .
In the first known comprehensive analysis of whether antibacterial soaps work better than plain soaps , Allison Aiello of the U - M School of Public Health and her team found that washing hands with an antibacterial soap was no more effective in preventing infectious illness than plain soap .
Moreover , antibacterial soaps at formulations sold to the public do not remove any more bacteria from the hands during washing than plain soaps .
Because of the way the main active ingredient --- triclosan --- in many antibacterial soaps reacts in the cells , it may cause some bacteria to become resistant to commonly used drugs such as amoxicillin , the researchers say .
These changes have not been detected at the population level , but e-coli bacteria bugs adapted in lab experiments showed resistance when exposed to as much as 0.1 percent wt / vol triclosan soap .
" What we are saying is that these e-coli could survive in the concentrations that we use in our ( consumer formulated ) antibacterial soaps , " Aiello said .
" What it means for consumers is that we need to be aware of what 's in the products .
The soaps containing triclosan used in the community setting are no more effective than plain soap at preventing infectious illness symptoms , as well as reducing bacteria on the hands . "
The study , " Consumer Antibacterial Soaps : Effective or Just Risky " " appears in the August edition of Clinical Infectious Diseases .
The team looked at 27 studies conducted between 1980 and 2006 , and found that soaps containing triclosan within the range of concentrations commonly used in the community setting ( 0.1 to 0.45 percent wt / vol ) were no more effective than plain soaps .
Triclosan is used in higher concentrations in hospitals and other clinical settings , and may be more effective at reducing illness and bacteria .
Triclosan works by targeting a biochemical pathway in the bacteria that allows the bacteria to keep its cell wall intact .
Because of the way triclosan kills the bacteria , mutations can happen at the targeted site .
Aiello says a mutation could mean that the triclosan can no longer get to the target site to kill the bacteria because the bacteria and the pathway have changed form .
The analysis concludes that government regulators should evaluate antibacterial product claims and advertising , and further studies are encouraged .
The FDA does not formally regulate the levels of triclosan used in consumer products .
Other antiseptic products on the market contain different active ingredients , such as the alcohol in hand sanitizers or the bleach in some antibacterial household cleaners .
Aiello's team did not study those products and those ingredients are not at issue .

Heat Rising in Bali US Pressured to Support Emissions Cuts
Pressure is mounting on the US to take a leading role in efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions .
As world climate change experts continute to discuss a new emissions reduction treaty in Bali , a Senate committee approved a plan to cut emissions in the US .
Hoshiyar Zebari expressed his country 's opposition to a Turkish incursion
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari an ethnic Kurd himself , said his government was against any breach of Iraqi sovereignty .
He called for talks with Ankara to solve the issue .
Turkey accuses Kurdish separatists of staging attacks from inside Iraq .
It has often warned Baghdad that it is prepared to take military action .
Turkey has not commented on the figure of 140,000 quoted by Mr Zebari .
If the figure is accurate , Turkey would have nearly as many soldiers along its border with Iraq as the 155,000 troops which the US has in the country .
In Washington , White House spokesman Tony Snow said the US shared Turkey 's concerns but that it was " important , we think , to recognise the territorial sovereignty of Iraq " .
Mr Zebari said he understood Turkey 's " legitimate security concerns " , but said the best way to address them was by reviving the tripartite military and security commission , which involves Iraq , Turkey and the US .
Turkey has been fighting the left - wing PKK Kurdish guerrillas since 1984 , in a war which has claimed up to 30,000 lives .
There has been an upsurge in fighting in recent months , with the Turkish army claiming it has killed 110 rebels since the start of the year and losing in turn 67 soldiers in clashes with the PKK .
The government of the Islamist - rooted AK Party has been under pressure from the military to take action against Kurdish guerrillas in Iraq .
There have been a series of reports of a build - up of Turkish troops along the border in recent weeks .
Last week , Turkey 's Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the government and the military had agreed detailed plans on how a cross - border offensive might be carried out .
BBC regional analyst Stephanie Irvine says the current build - up of troops at the border may herald action or may be designed merely to show Washington and Baghdad that Ankara is running out of patience with their failure to deal with the Turkish separatist rebels in northern Iraq .
Turkey is in the middle of an election campaign , with parliamentary polls due to take place on 22 July .
Nationalist parties are expected to perform well on the back of the wave of popular clamour for action against Kurdish separatists .

This Backgrounder provides a detailed picture of the number and socio-economic status of the nation ’s immigrant or foreign - born population , both legal and illegal .
The data was collected by the Census Bureau in March 2007 .
Among the report ’s findings :
The nation ’s immigrant population ( legal and illegal ) reached a record of 37.9 million in 2007 .
Immigrants account for one in eight U.S. residents , the highest level in 80 years .
In 1970 it was one in 21 ; in 1980 it was one in 16 ; and in 1990 it was one in 13
Overall , nearly one in three immigrants is an illegal alien .
Half of Mexican and Central American immigrants and one - third of South American immigrants are illegal .
Since 2000 , 10.3 million immigrants have arrived — the highest seven - year period of immigration in U.S. history .
More than half of post -2000 arrivals ( 5.6 million ) are estimated to be illegal aliens .
The largest increases in immigrants were in California , Florida , Texas , New Jersey , Illinois , Arizona , Virginia , Maryland , Washington , Georgia , North Carolina , and Pennsylvania .
Of adult immigrants , 31 percent have not completed high school , compared to 8 percent of natives .
Since 2000 , immigration increased the number of workers without a high school diploma by 14 percent , and all other workers by 3 percent .
The share of immigrants and natives who are college graduates is about the same .
Immigrants were once much more likely than natives to be college graduates .
The proportion of immigrant - headed households using at least one major welfare program is 33 percent , compared to 19 percent for native households .
The poverty rate for immigrants and their U.S. - born children ( under 18 ) is 17 percent , nearly 50 percent higher than the rate for natives and their children .
34 percent of immigrants lack health insurance , compared to 13 percent of natives .
Immigrants and their U.S. - born children account for 71 percent of the increase in the uninsured since 1989 .
Immigrants make significant progress over time .
But even those who have been here for 20 years are more likely to be in poverty , lack insurance , or use welfare than are natives .
The primary reason for the high rates of immigrant poverty , lack of health insurance , and welfare use is their low education levels , not their legal status or an unwillingness to work .
Of immigrant households , 82 percent have at least one worker compared to 73 percent of native households .
There is a worker present in 78 percent of immigrant households using at least one welfare program .
Immigration accounts for virtually all of the national increase in public school enrollment over the last two decades .
In 2007 , there were 10.8 million school - age children from immigrant families in the United States .
Immigrants and natives have similar rates of entrepreneurship — 13 percent of natives and 11 percent of immigrants are self - employed .
Recent immigration has had no significant impact on the nation ’s age structure .
Without the 10.3 million post -2000 immigrants , the average age in America would be virtually unchanged at 36.5 years .
Data Source and Methods
Data Source .
The data for this Backgrounder comes from the March 2007 Current Population Survey ( CPS ) collected by the Census Bureau .
The March data , which is also called the Annual Social and Economic Supplement , is one of the best sources of information on the foreign - born .
1
The foreign - born are defined as persons living in the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth .
2
In this report the terms foreign - born and immigrant are used synonymously .
We also use the terms illegal immigrant and illegal alien synonymously .
The CPS does not include persons in " group quarters , " such as prisons and nursing homes .
The March CPS found 37.3 million immigrants in the country .
Data collected in 2006 indicates that 613,000 immigrants live in group quarters , for a total foreign - born population of 37.9 million in March 2007.3
The immigrant population in the 2007 CPS included an estimated 11.3 million illegal aliens and roughly one million persons on long - term temporary visas , mainly students and guest workers .
4
The CPS is such a valuable source of information because unlike the decennial Census or the American Community Survey , it includes detailed questions on things like welfare use and health insurance coverage .
Recent Trends in Immigration
Figure 1 reports the number of immigrants living in the United States based on the CPS collected in March of each year from 1995 through 2007 .
Again , the CPS does not include persons in group quarters .
The figure shows that between March 1995 and March 2000 , the foreign - born population grew by 5.7 million , or about 1.1 million a year .
5
The figure also shows that between 2000 and 2007 the immigrant population grew 7.3 million , or 1.04 million a year .
These two numbers are the same statistically .
It would appear that the growth in the foreign - born during the economic expansion in the second half of the 1990s was about the same as in the period from 2000 to 2007.6
The seeming large growth from 2006 to 2007 ( 1.6 million ) should be interpreted with caution .
While the growth in the last year is statistically significant , one or even two years of data are not necessarily a trend .
What Figure 1 does show is that the growth from 1995 to 2007 in the foreign - born has been very high despite changes in the economy over this time period .
Deaths and Out-Migration .
When growth in the foreign - born population is discussed , it must be remembered that all children born in the United States to immigrants are by definition natives .
The sole reason for the dramatic increase in the foreign - born population is new immigration .
Moreover , the increase over time represents a net figure and does not reflect the level of new immigration .
New arrivals are offset by deaths and out - migration .
Given the age , sex , and other demographic characteristics of the immigrant population , it is likely that there are about 7,500 deaths per million immigrants each year .
This number does not change much from year to year , but it does increase gradually over time as the immigrant population grows .
As a result , there were roughly 100,000 more deaths a year among immigrants in 2007 than in 1995 because the overall population is 13 million larger .
This means that a slower net increase in the immigrant population may not indicate a falling level of new immigration .
In addition to deaths , new arrivals also are offset by return migration .
There is an ongoing debate about the size of return migration , but the Census Bureau has estimated that some 280,000 immigrants living here return home each year .
7
In total , deaths and return migration equal between 500,000 and 600,000 a year .
It should also be remembered that like any survey , there exists sampling variability in the CPS .
The margin of error , using a 90 - percent confidence interval , for the foreign - born is between 640,000 and 700,000 for data from 1995 to 2001 and between 520,000 and 555,000 for 2002 through 2007 data .
( The survey was redesigned in 2002 , so the size of the statistical error changed . )
Thus , one could say that in 2007 the immigrant population was 37.3 million plus or minus 552,000 and the growth from 2006 to 2007 was statistically significant .
However , because of sampling error , even seemingly large year - to - year changes may not be meaningful .
When looking for trends , it is much better to compare differences over several years .
When we do so , we find that the growth has been dramatic .
Flow of New Immigrants .
Another way to examine trends in immigration is to look at responses to the year of arrival question .
The CPS asks individuals when they came to America to stay .
The 2007 CPS indicates that 10.3 million immigrants ( legal and illegal ) settled in the United States between January 2000 and March 2007 .
This implies that slightly less than 1.5 million arrived annually in the United States in the last seven years .
Of course , some of the immigrants who arrived in 2000 through 2006 would have died or returned home by 2007 , so the actual level of new arrivals is somewhat higher .
Some share of the foreign - born population is also missed by the Census Bureau .
Prior research indicates that 5.2 percent of immigrants are missed in the CPS.8
So the actual level of new immigration is probably closer to 1.6 million a year .
In comparison to the 1990s , the current level seems very similar .
The 2000 CPS showed that 8.9 million immigrants ( legal and illegal ) settled in the country from 1993 to 2000.9
This compares to the 10.3 million who settled in the country from 2000 to 2007 .
The last seven years match or exceed any seven - year period of immigration in American history .
A Peak After 2000 ?
It is reasonable to wonder how the flow of immigrants has been affected by the downturn in the economy and the 9/11 attacks .
There is some evidence that immigration may have dipped after 2001 .
However , it is very difficult to say because Census Bureau data , including the CPS , are not designed to measure year - to - year changes in the flow of new immigrants .
For those interested in a detailed analysis of this issue , please see a CIS study published in December 2005.10
It makes far more sense to compare differences over several years .
From a policy perspective , the year of entry question in the 2007 CPS indicates that immigration to the United States continues at record levels .
Figure 1 also shows that when we examine 12 consecutive years of the March CPS , the growth in the immigrant population has been remarkably steady , averaging about one million a year for over a decade .
Illegal Immigrants
Illegals in the CPS .
It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey .
While the CPS does not ask the foreign - born if they are legal residents of the United States , the Urban Institute , the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , former INS , the Pew Hispanic Center , and the Census Bureau have all used socio- demographic characteristics in the data to estimate the size of the illegal - alien population .
We follow this same approach .11 Our preliminary estimates for the March 2007 CPS indicate that there were between 11 and 11.5 million illegal aliens included in the survey , with 11.3 million as our best estimate .
It must be remembered that this estimate only includes illegal aliens captured by the March CPS , not those missed by the survey .
By design , this estimate is consistent with those prepared by the Census Bureau , DHS , Urban Institute , and Pew Hispanic Center .12
Our estimate for the number of illegals included in the 2000 CPS is 7.3 million .
This means that the illegal - alien population in the CPS grew by four million between 2000 and 2007 .
Figure 1 , which compares CPS to CPS , shows a total increase in the immigrant population ( both legal and illegal ) of 7.3 million from 2000 to 2007 .
This means that growth in the illegal immigrant population accounted for at least half of the growth in the total immigrant population .
We also estimate that 5.6 million of the 10.3 million immigrants in the March 2007 CPS who indicated that they arrived in 2000 or later are illegal aliens .
We estimate that 57 percent of the illegal alien population comes from Mexico , 11 percent is from Central America , 9 percent is from East Asia , 8 percent is from South America , and Europe and the Caribbean account for 4 percent .
Of all immigrants from Mexico , 55 percent are illegal ; for Central Americans it is 47 percent ; and it is 33 percent for South Americans .
Again these figures do not adjust for undercount of the legal or illegal populations in the CPS .
If we did make this adjustment , it would mean that an even larger share of all immigrants from these regions are illegal because the undercount of illegal immigrants is much larger than the undercount of legal immigrants .
Although these estimates are consistent with other research findings , including those produced by the federal government , it should be obvious that there is no definitive means of determining whether a respondent in the survey is an illegal alien with 100 percent certainty .
Illegals as a Share of Growth .
The fact that illegals account for at least half of the overall growth in the immigrant population may seem surprising to some , especially since illegal aliens account for 30 percent of the total foreign - born population .
There are several reasons for this .
First , prior to the mid-1970s , there was little illegal immigration to the United States , thus older immigrants who entered at that time and are still here are almost all legal residents .
Because long - time residents are almost entirely legal immigrants , they are older on average than illegal immigrants .
Therefore they account for most of the deaths among the foreign - born .
Moreover , the United States has conducted broad amnesties for illegal aliens in the past and also each year grants tens of thousands of illegal aliens legal status as part of the normal " legal " immigration process .
For example , 2.6 million illegals were given green cards ( permanent residency ) in the late 1980s and early 1990s as part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act ( IRCA ) .
The immigration service also estimated that during just the 1990s , 1.5 million illegal aliens received green cards , not including IRCA.13
Because there is this constant movement out of illegal status to legal status , the size of the existing legal population is much bigger than the existing illegal population .
Finally , it must be remembered that although the number of illegal aliens entering and remaining in the country is now enormous , the level of legal immigration is also very high , adding to a very large legal immigrant population .
Historical Perspective
While immigration has played an important role in American history , the level of immigration and the size of the immigrant population has varied considerably .
Figure 2 shows the number of immigrants living in the United States over the course of the last 100 years .
The figures 1900 to 2000 are from the decennial census .
A question on whether a respondent was foreign - born was not included in the CPS on a regular basis until the mid-1990s , so the decennial census is the only historical data source for the size of the immigrant population prior to that date .
In order to make the CPS comparable to decennial census data , it is necessary to include persons in group quarters such as prisons and nursing homes , which are not part of the CPS .
Data collected in 2006 indicate that 614,000 immigrants lived in institutions .
Adding this to the 37.3 million found in the 2007 CPS creates a total immigrant population 37.9 million in March 2007 , assuming no immigrants ( legal or illegal ) are missed by the survey .
14
Figure 2 shows that the 37.9 million immigrants residing in the United States in 2007 is by far the most ever recorded .
Even during the great wave of immigration at the turn of the 19th century , the immigrant population was much less than half what it is today .
The figure shows that after growing in the early part of this century , the immigrant population stabilized at around 10 or 11 million for about four decades .
In the mid-1960s , changes in immigration law and other factors caused the annual level of legal immigration to rise steadily , from about 300,000 a year in the 1960s to nearly a million today .
The latest data indicates that this rapid growth has continued into the first decade of the 21st century , adding 6.8 million in the last seven years .
This is slightly lower than the 7.2 million growth found in Figure 1 , which compared the 2000 CPS to the 2007 CPS .
The foreign - born population ’s growth rate in every decade since 1970 has been higher than at any other time in history , surpassing the 31 percent increase between 1900 and 1910 .
Unlike in the past , the growth in the immigrant population now accounts for a large share of the increase in the size of the U.S. population .
Even during the first decade of the last century , the 3.2 million increase in the size of the immigrant population accounted for only 20 percent of the total increase in the U.S. population .
In contrast , the 11.3 million increase in the immigrant population from 1990 to 2000 accounted for 35 percent of U.S. population growth in the 1990s .
And the 6.8 million increase in the size of the immigrant population in the last seven years equals 34 percent of U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2007.15
It should noted that the 34 percent does not represent the full impact on population growth in the United States because it includes deaths .
Net immigration is the way one measures the impact of immigration on population growth , not the net increase in the size of the immigrant population .
To measure the full impact of immigration on population growth it also would be necessary to include births to immigrants .
Population growth is measured by taking the number of births minus the number of deaths and then adding net immigration ( the difference between people coming and going ) .
The U.S. population is growing by 2.9 million a year according to the Census Bureau .
16
The growth in the foreign - born reflects deaths as well as net immigration .
Thus , using growth in the foreign - born to measure immigration ’s impact on population would be double counting immigrant deaths .
For this reason , net immigration is used when estimating the impact of immigration on population growth .
As already discussed , annual net immigration is 1.25 million or 1.15 million , depending on how it is calculated .
When this is added to the 950,000 births to immigrants each year , the total impact of immigrations is equal about three - fourths of U.S .
population growth .
Immigration now accounts for such a large percentage of population because the fertility of natives was much higher in the early 1900s , during the last great wave of immigration .
As a result , the U.S. population grew regardless of immigration .
Today , natives have only about two children on average , with the result that without immigration the U.S. population would very slowly move to stabilization .
17
Also , in contrast to the past , a higher percentage of today ’s immigrants remain in the United States rather than returning home .
Because so many immigrants in the early 20th century eventually returned to their home countries , immigration at that time did not add permanently to the overall size of the U.S. population in the way that it does today .
18
Immigrants as a Share of the Population .
While the number of immigrants and the growth rate of the immigrant population are higher now than at any other time in the last 100 years , Figure 2 shows that the foreign - born percentage of the population was higher in the first few decades of the 1900s , reaching 14.7 percent of the total U.S. population in 1910 .
As a result of World War I and changes in immigration law in the early 1920s , the level of immigration fell significantly .
The 1920 census was the last time the percentage of immigrants was higher than it is today .
In terms of the impact of immigrants on the United States , both the percentage of the population made up of immigrants and the number of immigrants are clearly important .
The ability to assimilate and incorporate immigrants is partly dependent on the relative sizes of the native and immigrant populations .
On the other hand , absolute numbers also clearly matter .
A large number of immigrants can create the critical mass necessary to foster linguistic and cultural isolation .
Whether the immigrants in question represent 10 percent or 30 percent of a city or state ’s population may not be so important ; it ’s the raw numbers that may be the most meaningful .
And the current numbers are approaching triple what they were in 1910.19 Moreover , absent a change in policy , the number and immigrant - share of the population will continue to increase rapidly for the foreseeable future .
State Numbers
Number of Immigrants by State .
Table 1 ranks the states by the size of their immigrant populations .
It also shows the number of immigrants who reported arriving in 2000 or later .
California clearly has the largest immigrant population ; New York , the state with next largest number of immigrants , has fewer than half as many .
Table 1 shows how concentrated the immigrant population is :
Only a few states represent the majority of the foreign - born population .
In 2007 , the nearly 10 million immigrants in California account for 27 percent of the nation ’s total immigrant population , followed by New York with 11 percent , Florida and Texas with 10 percent each , and New Jersey with 5 percent .
These five states account for 61 percent of the nation ’s total foreign - born population , but only 32 percent of the native - born population .
The table also shows evidence that the immigrant population is becoming more dispersed .
Table 1 indicates that although the top - five states account for 61 percent of the total immigrant population , only 54 percent of post - 2000 arrivals went to these states .
Share of State That Is Immigrant .
Table 1 also shows the share of each state ’s population that is foreign - born .
While many states with a large number of immigrants are also states where their percentage is high , there are some differences .
Because of their relatively small total populations several states with high percentages of immigrants , such as Hawaii and Nevada , rank lower in terms of number of immigrants .
It is very likely that the impact of immigration will be significant in these states even though the size of the immigrant population is much smaller than in a state like California .
Growth in the Immigrant Population by State .
Table 2 compares the number of immigrants in 1995 , 2000 , and 2007 for each state .
20
It also shows the share of the population that was foreign - born in each of these years .
As already discussed , immigrants tend to be concentrated .
However , Table 2 also shows that this has become less the case over time .
In 1995 , the top - five states accounted for 69 percent of the total foreign - born population , in 2000 these same states accounted for 66 percent of the foreign - born and this had dropped to 61 percent by 2007 .
Or looked at in a different way , these five states accounted for 69 percent of the total immigrant population in 1995 , but only 48 percent of the growth in the immigrant population between 1995 and 2007 occurred in these five states .
The increasing dispersion of immigrants can be exaggerated ; in 2007 the top - 10 states of settlement accounted for 75 percent of immigrants , these same states accounted for 80 in 1995 .
A change to be sure , but not a huge change .
Table 2 also shows different patterns for different states .
In New York , for example , the number of immigrants increased 585,000 between 1995 and 2000 , but in the seven years after 2000 it grew by 262,000 .
New Jersey , which is right next to New York , is quite different .
The numerical increase in that state was larger between 2000 and 2007 than between 1995 and 2000 .
The same holds true for Texas .
Perhaps the most dramatic increases can be found in Georgia and North Carolina , where the immigrant population increased three and half times between 1995 and 2007 .
The key point to take from Table 2 is that there is no one pattern that reflects the entire country .
The pace and scale varies by state and by time period as well .
Table 3 shows the 32 states plus the District of Columbia , where the growth was statistically significant between 2000 and 2007 .
Region and Country of Origin
Sending Regions .
Table 4 shows the distribution of immigrants by region of the world , with Mexico and Canada broken out separately .
Mexico accounts for 31.3 percent of all immigrants , with 11.7 million immigrants living in United States , more than the number of immigrants from any other region of the world .
Immigrants from Latin America ( Mexico , Central and South America , and the Caribbean ) account for the majority of immigrants , with 54.6 percent of the foreign - born coming from these areas .
East Asia / Southeast Asia also makes up a significant share of the total , accounting for 17.6 percent of immigrants .
This is similar to the combined total for Europe and the Middle East .
The importance of the Western Hemisphere , excluding Canada , is even more striking when we look at recent arrivals .
Of those who arrived from 2000 to 2007 , 58.7 percent are from Latin America .
Top Sending Countries .
Table 5 ranks the top - 25 immigrant - sending countries by the number of immigrants as of March 2007 .
Mexico is , of course , the largest sending country , accounting for almost six times as many immigrants as the next largest country , China , which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong .
As is clear from Table 4 , Latin American and Caribbean countries dominate the list of immigrant - sending countries , accounting for almost half of the top - 25 countries .
One of the striking things about contemporary immigration is that there has been a significant decline in the diversity of immigrants : Mexico accounts for 31 percent of all immigrants in 2007 , up from 28 percent in 2000 , 22 percent in 1990 , and 16 percent in 1980 .
The top sending country in 1970 was Italy , which accounted for only 10 percent of the foreign - born .
Race and Ethnicity of Immigrants .
Figure 3 reports the race of natives and immigrants .
Hispanics are treated as a separate category in the figure , so the percentages for whites , blacks , Asians , and others are for non-Hispanics .
Race categories are for persons who gave only one race .
Multi-racial , non-Hispanic individuals are included with Native - Americans / American Indian .
The figure shows that the race of immigrants and natives differs a good deal .
A much larger share of immigrants are Hispanic and Asian , and a smaller share is white and black , than is true of the native - born population .
Figure 3 also shows this is especially true if the U.S. - born young children of immigrants are excluded .
Selected Characteristics
Educational Attainment .
Immigrants now comprise 15.8 percent of the nation ’s total workforce 18 years of age and older .
21
This is somewhat higher than the 12.6 percent of the total U.S. immigrant population because , in comparison to natives , a slightly higher percentage of immigrants are of working age .
The top of Table 6 reports the educational attainment of adult ( 18 and older ) immigrants and natives in the workforce .
In 2007 , about 29 percent of immigrants 18 and over in the labor force had not graduated from high school .
The table also reports the education of adult immigrants in the labor force who arrived from 2000 to 2007 .
For post -2000 immigrants in the workforce , 35.5 percent had not completed high school .
In comparison , slightly less than 8 percent of natives in the workforce lacked a high school education .
This difference in the educational attainment of immigrants and natives has enormous implications for the social and economic integration of immigrants into American society .
There is no single better predictor of economic success in modern America than one ’s education level .
As we will see , the fact that so many adult immigrants have little education means that their income , poverty rates , welfare use , and other measures of economic attainment lag far behind natives .
The table also shows that a slightly higher share of natives have a bachelor ’s degree than immigrants , and the share with a post - graduate degree is almost identical for the two groups .
The large number of immigrants with low levels of education means that immigration policy has dramatically increased the supply of workers with less than a high school degree , while increasing other educational categories more moderately .
This is important because it is an indication of which American workers face the most job competition from foreign workers .
While immigrants comprise almost 16 percent of the total adult workforce , they comprise more than 40 percent of adults in the labor force who have not completed high school .
Figure 4 shows how recently arrived immigrants have increased the supply of different types of workers .
It reports the number of immigrants who arrived in 2000 or later divided by the number of natives and pre-2000 immigrants .
Thus the figure shows that immigrants since 2000 increased the supply of dropouts in the workforce by 14.4 percent , compared to between 2 to 4 percent in other educational categories .
This means that any effect immigration may have on the wages or job opportunities of natives will disproportionately affect less - educated workers , who are already the lowest paid workers .
Immigrant and Native Income .
Given the large proportion of immigrants with few years of schooling , it is not surprising that the income figures reported at the bottom of Table 6 show that , as a group , immigrants have lower median incomes than natives .
22
The annual median earnings of immigrants who work full - time and year - round is only about 77 percent that of natives .
And for the most recent immigrants , median earning are only 61 percent that of natives .
Another way to think about immigrant and native earnings is to examine the share of immigrants and natives who have very low incomes .
If we look at the 10 percent of full - time , year - round workers with the lowest earnings , we find that 17 percent of immigrants , but only 9 percent of natives fall into the lowest - income decile .
Household Income .
Another way to think about the relative position of immigrants compared to natives is to look at household income .
The median household income for immigrant - headed households is $ 43,933 , which is 89 percent that of the $ 49,201 for native households .
In addition to having lower incomes , immigrant households are 28 percent larger on average than native households — 3.1 persons versus 2.4 persons .
As a result , the per capita household median income of immigrants is only 70 percent that of natives — $ 14,126 versus $ 20,247 .
This is important not only as a measure of their relative socio- economic standing , but also because it has significant fiscal implications .
Lower household income means that in general immigrant households are likely to pay somewhat less in taxes than native households .
Larger household size means that in general immigrant households will use somewhat more in services than will native households .
Since households are the primary basis on which taxes are assessed and benefits distributed in the United States , the lower income and larger size of immigrant households has important fiscal implications .
23
Age of Immigrants Table 6 also shows that , in 2007 , the average age of an immigrant was 40.5 years compared to 35.9 years for the average native .
The fact that immigrants have a higher average age reminds us that although immigrants may arrive relatively young , they age over time like everyone else .
The belief that immigration will help fix the problem of an aging society is misplaced .
Of course , those who argue that immigration fundamentally changes the age structure generally have in mind new arrivals .
Table 6 shows that recently arrived immigrants are somewhat younger than natives — 29.4 years compared to 35.9 years .
But the overall impact on the age structure of American society is still small .
One simple way to measure the impact of immigration is to calculate the average age in the United States with and without recent immigrants .
If all 10.3 million immigrants who arrived in 2000 or later are removed from the data , the average age in the United States would be 36.7 years .
Including post -2000 immigrants does lower the average age , but only to 36.4 years .
Thus , immigration over the last seven years , which has been numerically the highest in American history , had a very modest impact on the aging of American society .
It could be argued that this meager benefit to the age structure might take more than just seven years of high immigration .
In a September 2005 study , the Center for Immigration Studies examined the impact of immigration on the aging of American society as well as the Social Security system .
Consistent with other research , we found that immigration has only a small impact on the problem of an aging society now and in the future .
While immigrants do tend to arrive relatively young , and have higher fertility rates than natives , immigrants age just like everyone else , and the differences with natives are not large enough to fundamentally alter the nation ’s age structure .
After looking at the impact of different levels of immigration over the next century , a Census Bureau report stated in 2000 that immigration is a " highly inefficient " means for increasing the percentage of the population who are of working - age in the long run .
24
Our detailed look at the full impact of immigration on the nation ’s age structure is available online .
25
Recently the Center for Immigration Studies completed a series of population projections examining the impact of different levels of immigration on the size and aging of American society .
We found that although the current level of immigration will add 105 million to the U.S. population by 2060 , it has only a small impact on the share of the population that will be of working age .
26
There is a clear consensus among demographers , the people who study human populations , that immigration has only a small impact on the aging of society .
A simple analysis of the CPS confirms this conclusion .
Immigrant Progress Over Time .
The income figures in Table 6 only consider those in the workforce , and the table groups all immigrants together .
Table 7 shows the economic progress of immigrants over time .
The first part of the table examines poverty figures .
27 Poverty is a good measure because it examines the economic position of those in and out of the workforce .
Earnings figures on the other hand are only for those in the workforce .
Moreover , poverty controls for the number of people in a family .
Table 7 reports the share of immigrants in poverty or who have incomes that place them in or near poverty .
In / near poverty is defined as less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold .
The 200 percent of poverty threshold is a good benchmark because under that amount people generally do not pay federal income tax and typically begin to be eligible for means - tested programs .
Those with income above this amount can be seen as middle class or even upper class , while those with incomes below this amount can be viewed as the low - income population .
Table 7 shows that it takes a very long time for immigrants to close the economic gap with natives .
In 2007 , the table shows that the poverty rate of immigrants matches that of natives after being here for about 26 to 27 years .
28 As for the share in or near poverty , it takes about 28 to 32 years for immigrants to match natives .
Because it takes immigrants so long to match the rates of natives , they are much older by that time than is the average native - born American .
This is shown in the third column of Table 7 .
Immigrants who arrived 26 to 27 years ago are 48 years old on average in 2007 , 11 years older than is the average native .
As a result , immigrants will tend to have lower lifetime earnings and income than natives .
A very similar pattern exists when we examine the annual median earnings of full - time , year - round workers .
It takes immigrants 28 to 32 years to match the earnings of natives at which time they are in their late 40s , a good deal older than is the average full - time , native - born , year - round worker .
It was once argued that it took 12 to 14 years for immigrants to close the economic gap with natives .
29 Table 7 shows this is no longer the case , at least with regard to poverty , near poverty , or earnings .
Other measures of socio-economic status also show the great difficulty immigrants have in closing the gap with natives .
For example , immigrants are much more likely to lack health insurance than natives , even immigrants who have been in the country for many years .
Figure 5 shows the share of immigrant households using welfare , living in or near poverty and without health insurance .
Figure 5 shows that welfare use and lack of health insurance is very common , even among well - established immigrants .
It should be noted that there is no way to know whether today ’s immigrants will take the same number of years to close the gap with natives , or even if they ever will .
But given the education of recently arrived immigrants , it is not reasonable to expect that their income or rates of poverty , un-insurance , and welfare use will converge with natives any time soon .
We do know that unskilled immigrants never come close to closing the gap with natives even when they have lived in the United States for many years .30 Coming to live in a new country is never easy , so the slow progress of immigrants could still be viewed as satisfactory depending on one ’s point of view .
What is clear is that the problem of poverty , low income , welfare use , and lack of health insurance is not something confined to only new arrivals .
What is also clear is that immigrants once closed the gap with natives much more quickly .
Of course , we could change immigration policy and allow fewer immigrants into the country who have little formal education .
If we did that , then immigrants who arrive in the future would almost certainly have incomes that match those of natives from the time they arrive in the United States or soon thereafter .
Occupational Distribution .
Table 8 shows the occupational concentration of immigrants and natives .
The occupational categories are ranked based on native unemployment rates , which are shown in the first column .
The table shows several important facts about U.S. immigration .
First , there are millions of native - born Americans employed in occupations that have high concentrations of immigrants .
While immigrants certainly are concentrated in particular occupations , it ’s simply not correct to say that immigrants only do jobs natives do n’t want .
The occupational categories of farming / fishing / forestry , construction , building cleaning / maintenance , and food service and preparation currently employ 16.5 million native - born Americans .
The second interesting finding in Table 8 is that in the occupations just listed there are nearly 1.8 million unemployed natives .
Moreover , native unemployment averages 10 percent in these occupations .
Perhaps the labor is not where employers wanted , or there is some other reason businesses find these unemployed natives unacceptable in some way , but on its face Table 8 indicates that there is quite a lot of unutilized labor of this kind in the United States .
It 's also worth considering that the correlation between native unemployment rates and the share of an occupation that is comprised of immigrants is .80 .
The square of a correlation , in this case .63 , can be interpreted to mean that the presence of immigrants in an occupation explains 63 percent of the variation in native unemployment rates across occupations .
Of course , a correlation does not prove that immigration adversely impacts the employment prospects of natives .
It would be a mistake to think that every job taken by an immigrant is a job lost by a native .
Many factors impact unemployment rates across occupations .
But it would also be a mistake to assume that dramatically increasing the number of workers in these occupations as a result of immigration policy has no impact on the employment prospects of some natives .
Given the large number of natives employed in these immigrant - heavy occupations , it would be incorrect to argue that immigrants only do jobs American do n’t want .
Self Employment .
Table 9 examines the self - employment rates of immigrants and natives .
The table shows that immigrants and natives exhibit remarkably similar levels of entrepreneurship .
The table shows that 11.3 percent of immigrants and 12.6 percent of natives are self - employed .
Turning to self - employment income reported at the bottom of Table 9 , we see that the average self - employment income ( revenue minus expenses ) for both immigrants and natives is virtually identical .
While immigrants overall are not more entrepreneurial than natives , immigrants from such countries as Korea , Iran , Italy , and Vietnam are significantly more likely than natives to be self - employed .
But , overall entrepreneurship is neither lacking nor a distinguishing characteristic of the nation ’s immigrants .
If one removed immigrants from the data , the overall rate of self - employment in the United States would be about the same .
Poverty , Welfare , and the Uninsured
Poverty Among Immigrants and Natives .
The first column in Table 10 reports the poverty rate for immigrants by country and the second column shows the figures when their U.S. - born children under age 18 are included .
Based on the March 2007 CPS , 15.2 percent of immigrants compared to 11.4 percent of natives lived in poverty in 2006.31 ( Poverty statistics are based on annual income in the calendar year prior to the survey and reflect family size ) .
The higher incidence of poverty among immigrants as a group has increased the overall size of the population living in poverty .
Immigrants accounted for about one in six persons living in poverty .
The percentage is larger if the native - born children ( under age 18 ) of immigrants , are counted with their parents .
In some reports these children are counted with natives .
But it makes more sense to include these children with their immigrant parents because the poverty rate of minor children reflects their parents ’ income .
32 Table 10 shows that the rate for immigrants and their young U.S. - born children was 16.9 percent compared to the 11.4 percent for natives and their young children .
The data by country indicate that there is an enormous variation in poverty rates among immigrants from different countries .
For example , the 31.2 percent poverty rate for immigrants from the Dominican Republic and their young U.S. - born children is many times the rates associated with immigrants from countries such as Canada , India , and the Philippines .
Of the 36.5 million people in the United States living in poverty , 3.5 million ( 9.5 percent ) are the U.S. - born children ( under 18 ) of immigrant fathers .
The poverty rate for the U.S. - born children of immigrant fathers is 22.6 percent compared to 16 percent for the children of natives .
Among persons under age 18 living in poverty , 27.1 percent are either immigrants or the young children of immigrant fathers .
Overall , there are 8.4 million immigrants and their young U.S. - born children living in poverty and they account for 23 percent of total poverty population .
In or Near Poverty .
In addition to poverty , Table 10 also reports the percentage of immigrants and natives living in or near poverty , with near poverty defined as income less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold .
As already discussed , those with incomes under 200 percent of poverty generally do not pay federal income tax and often qualify for means - tested programs .
As is the case with poverty , near poverty is much more common among immigrants than it is for natives .
Table 10 shows that 40.1 percent of immigrants compared to 28 percent of natives live in or near poverty .
If the U.S. - born children of immigrants are included with their immigrant parents , the rate associated with immigrants would be 43.3 percent .
Among the young children of immigrants ( under 18 ) , 53.6 percent live in or near poverty , in contrast to 35.2 percent of the children of natives .
In total , 21.5 million immigrants and their young children live in or near poverty .
As a share of persons in or near poverty , immigrants and their young children account for 23.7 percent .
Without Health Insurance .
Table 11 reports the percentage of immigrants and natives who were uninsured for all of 2006 .
( The CPS asks about health insurance in the calendar year prior to the survey . )
The table shows that lack of health insurance is a significant problem for immigrants from many different countries .
Overall , 33.8 percent of the foreign - born lack insurance compared to 13 percent of natives .33 Immigrants now account for 26.8 percent of all uninsured persons in the United States .
This compares to their 12.6 percent of the total population .
If the young ( under 18 ) U.S. - born children of immigrants are included with their parents , the share without health insurance is 29.9 percent .
The share of children who are uninsured is lower than for their parents mainly because the U.S. - born children of immigrants are eligible for Medicaid , the health insurance program for the poor .
Thus the inclusion of the U.S. - born children pulls down the rate for immigrants slightly .
In total , there are 14.9 million uninsured immigrants and their young U.S. - born children in the country , accounting for 31.7 percent of all persons without health insurance .
This is roughly double their share of the total population , which is 16.7 percent .
Of young children ( under 18 ) without health insurance , 38.1 percent ( 3.3 million ) are immigrants or the young U.S. - born children of an immigrant father .
Recently there has been a debate over extending SCHIP , which is a form of Medicaid , to more young children with incomes below 200 percent of poverty .
Currently , 43 percent of low - income uninsured children ( under 18 ) are immigrants or the U.S. - born children of immigrant fathers .
While not generally acknowledged , immigration is at the center of the current SCHIP debate .
The low rate of insurance coverage associated with immigrants is primarily explained by their much lower levels of education .
Because of the limited value of their labor in an economy that increasingly demands educated workers , many immigrants hold jobs that do not offer health insurance , and their low incomes make it very difficult for them to purchase insurance on their own .
A larger uninsured population cannot help but strain the resources of those who provide services to the uninsured already here .
Moreover , Americans with insurance have to pay higher premiums as healthcare providers pass along some of the costs of treating the uninsured to paying customers .
Taxpayers are also affected as federal , state , and local governments struggle to provide care to the growing ranks of the uninsured .
There can be no doubt that , by dramatically increasing the size of the uninsured population , our immigration policy has wide - ranging effects on the nation ’s entire healthcare system .
One study found that after controlling for such factors as education , age , and race , uninsured immigrants impose somewhat lower costs than uninsured natives .
However , when the authors simply compared uninsured immigrants to uninsured natives the cost differences were not statistically significant .
In other words , when using the actual traits that immigrants have , the costs that uninsured immigrants create were the same as uninsured natives .
34
Of course , even if there was a difference in the costs uninsured immigrants create when compared to uninsured native , it would have to be enormous to offset the fact that immigrants are two - and one - half times more likely to be uninsured than native - born Americans .
Immigration Accounts for Growth in Uninsured .
According to the Census Bureau , since 1989 the population without health insurance has grown by 14.62 million and stood at 47 million in 2006 .
Much of this growth has been driven by immigration .
To understand the impact of immigration , we can remove from the CPS immigrants who lack health insurance and arrived after 1989 .
In the March 2007 CPS there were 9.21 million immigrants who arrived in 1990 or later who did not have health insurance .
This is equal to 62.9 percent of the growth in the uninsured population .
Moreover , there were 1.12 million children born to post -1990 immigrants who also lacked insurance , meaning that new immigrants and their U.S. - born children accounted for 71 percent of the growth in the uninsured population .
Uninsured or on Medicaid .
The 2007 CPS shows that 17.7 percent of immigrants and their U.S. - born children under 18 are on Medicaid , compared to 11.9 percent of natives and their children .35
Of immigrants and their young children ( under 18 ) , 47.4 percent either have no insurance or have it provided to them through the Medicaid system compared to 25 percent for natives and their children .
Welfare Use .
As the Census Bureau does in its publications , we report welfare use based on whether the head of the household is immigrant or native .
36
With regard to immigrant households , this means we are mainly reporting welfare use for immigrants and their U.S. - born children who live with them and comparing them to natives and their children .
Table 12 shows the percentage of immigrant - and native - headed households in which at least one member of the household uses one or more welfare programs .
Cash assistance includes Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) , state administered general assistance , and Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) , which is for low - income elderly and disabled persons .
Food assistance includes food stamps , free school lunch , and the Women Infants and Children nutrition program ( WIC ) .
Housing assistance includes subsidized and government - owned housing .
Medicaid , the health insurance program for those with low incomes , is also included .
The left side of Table 12 shows the share of all immigrant and native households using different types of welfare .
The table indicates that even after the 1996 welfare reforms , which curtailed eligibility for some immigrants , immigrant households ’ use of the welfare system remains higher than that of natives for most programs and most entering cohorts .
Use of cash tends to be quite similar for immigrant and native households .
Thus if by " welfare " one only means cash assistance programs , then immigrant use is roughly the same as that of natives .
Of course , there is the question of whether native use of welfare is the proper yardstick by which to measure immigrants .
Some may reasonably argue that because immigration is supposed to benefit the United States , our admission criteria should , with the exception of refugees , select only those immigrants who are self - sufficient .
Table 12 shows that welfare use , even of cash programs , is not at or near zero .
Table 12 shows that use of food assistance is significantly higher for immigrant households than native households — 19.4 percent versus 10.4 percent .
The same is true for Medicaid : 24.4 percent of immigrant households have one or more persons using the program compared to 14.7 percent of native households .
From the point of view of taxpayers , immigrant use of Medicaid is the most problematic because that program costs more than the combined total for the other programs listed .
As was the case with lower income and higher poverty rates , the higher welfare use rates by immigrant households are at least partly explained by the large proportion of immigrants with few years of schooling .
Less - educated people tend to have lower incomes .
Therefore , it is not surprising that immigrant use of the welfare system is significantly higher than that of natives .
While immigrants ’ use of some welfare programs is higher than it is for natives , Table 12 shows that most households , immigrant or native , do not use the welfare system .
On the other hand , even though most people in the country do not use the welfare system , the programs listed in Table 12 cost the government some $ 600 billion annually .
Use of the EITC and ACTC .
In addition to welfare programs , Table 12 reports the share of households in which at least one worker is eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and the Additional Child Tax Credit ( ACTC ) .
37 Workers receiving the EITC generally pay no federal income tax and instead receive cash assistance from the government based on their earnings and family size .
The ACTC works in the same fashion , except that to receive it , one must have at least one dependent child .
The IRS will process the EITC and ACTC automatically for persons who file a return and qualify .
Even illegal aliens sometimes receive the EITC and ACTC .
This is especially true of the ACTC because the IRS has determined that illegals are allowed to receive it , even if they do not have a valid Social Security number .
To receive the EITC one must have a valid Social Security number .
With an annual cost of over $ 35 billion for the EITC and $ 14 billion for the ACTC , the two programs constitute the nation ’s largest means - tested cash assistance program for low - income workers .
Table 12 shows 17.8 percent of native - headed households have enough dependents and low enough income to qualify for the EITC and 10.9 percent have low enough incomes to receive the ACTC .
This compares to 31.1 and 22.5 percent of immigrant households .
For both programs , about twice the share of immigrant households are eligible as are native households .
The figures for the EITC and ACTC probably overstate receipt of the programs for both immigrants and natives because they are imputed by the Census Bureau based on income and family size .
This is in contrast to the welfare programs listed , which are based on self - reporting by survey respondents .
38
Given the education level of so many immigrants , it is not surprising that a large share work but that their incomes are low enough to qualify for the EITC .
It important to understand the high rate of EITC and ACTC eligibility does not reflect a lack of work on the part of immigrants .
In fact , one must work to be eligible for them .
Use of the EITC and ACTC mainly reflects a lack of education and resulting low incomes , coupled with the presence of dependents .
Welfare Use by Country .
While on the whole immigrant households have higher welfare use rates , this is not true for immigrants from all countries .
Table 13 shows that immigrants from some countries have lower welfare use rates than natives .
From the list of countries in Table 13 , it is also clear that refugee - sending countries , such as the former USSR and Cuba , tend to use the welfare system a good deal .
On the other hand , Mexican and Dominican households have welfare use rates that are much higher than natives — even higher than the former USSR and Cuba — and virtually none of these immigrants are refugees .
In fact , if one excludes the primary refugee - sending countries , as shown in the bottom portion of Table 13 , the share of immigrant households using a welfare program remains virtually unchanged at 32.6 percent .39
Refugees are simply not a large enough share of the foreign - born , nor are their rates high enough , to explain the level of welfare use by immigrant households .
Welfare Use Among Working Households .
The bottom of Table 13 makes a number of different comparison between immigrant and native households .
One of the most important is to compare welfare use among households with at least one worker .
The table shows that 31.1 percent of immigrant households with at least one working person still use the welfare system .
This compares to 16.4 percent of native households with at least one worker .
In particular , food assistance programs and Medicaid are often given to working families .
This is an important point to understand .
Most immigrant households have at least one worker .
We estimate that 82 percent of immigrant households have at least one worker compared to 73 percent of native households .
But this in no way means they will not use the welfare system because that system is increasingly designed to provide assistance to low - income workers with children , a description of immigrant families given their education levels and relatively high fertility .
In fact , a worker is present in 78 percent of immigrant households using at least one welfare program .
For native households it ’s 62 percent .
Most immigrants work , but this does not make them self - sufficient .
Educational Attainment
Education Level of Immigrants .
The statistics reviewed thus far indicate that a larger share of immigrants than natives have low incomes , lack health insurance , and access means - tested programs .
As already mentioned , one of the primary reasons for this situation is that many immigrants have relatively few years of schooling .
Table 14 reports the share of immigrants and natives ages 25 to 64 who have less than a high school education and the share who have at least a bachelor ’s degree by country .
( The overall figures do not exactly match those in Table 6 because in that table the percentages are for only those in the labor force . )
The big difference between the education level of the two groups is found at the bottom end of the education distribution .
In 2005 , 30.6 percent of immigrants ages 25 to 64 lacked a high school diploma , compared to less than 8.4 percent of natives .
At the top end , natives now have a slight advantage in terms of having at least a bachelor ’s degree .
Historically , immigrants enjoyed a significant advantage in terms of having a college education .
In 1970 , for example , 18 percent of immigrants ( 25 to 64 ) had at least a college degree compared to 12 percent of natives .40 But as Table 14 shows this is no longer the case , with 29.1 percent of immigrants and 31.1 percent of natives having at least a college degree .
41
Because education is now so important to economic success , the large share of immigrants with relatively little education has enormous implications for their economic and social integration into American society .
Table 14 shows that there is great variation in the education level of immigrants by country .
As we have seen , there is also great variation in the poverty , welfare use , and health insurance coverage rates by country .
Comparing the education levels found in Table 14 with prior tables shows that , in general , countries with the lowest levels of education are also the ones with highest rates of poverty , welfare use , and lack of health insurance .
Importance of Education .
To see just how important education is to economic success , Table 15 reports income , welfare use , poverty , and health insurance rates for immigrants and natives by education level .
Turning first to annual earnings of year - round , full - time workers , the median earnings of these immigrant workers is 77 percent that of natives .
But Table 15 shows that the median annual earnings of immigrants without a high school degree who work full - time , year - round is 87 percent that of natives with the same education .
For those with only a high school degree and no additional schooling , immigrants earn 84 percent of what natives earn .
Immigrants with some college earn 94 percent of what natives with the same education earn , and those with at least a college degree earn 98 percent of what natives earn .
Overall , the differences by education are much less than is the overall difference .
This means that a large share of the difference in the median earnings of natives and immigrants is explained by the low educational attainment of many immigrants .
Table 15 also shows that for welfare use , poverty , and health insurance rates , immigrants tend to do somewhat worse than natives with the same education .
But more importantly , the table indicates that how well immigrants do is heavily dependent on their education level .
This is consistent both with common sense and a very large body of research .
The current immigration system allows most legal immigrants into the country through family re-unification channels primarily based on whether they have a relative here .
This fact , coupled with widespread tolerance of illegal immigration , means the foreign - born population as a whole is much less educated than the native - born population .
Given the nature of the modern American economy and the existence of a well - developed welfare state , it seems unavoidable that less - educated immigrants will tend to have lower incomes , make heavier use of means - tested programs , and be more likely to lack health insurance than natives .
Characteristics by State
In this section we examine the demographic characteristics of immigrants by state .
Since the sample is much smaller than for the nation as the whole , the results should be interpreted with caution , especially for the smaller states .
Household Characteristics by State .
Table 16 reports the median income and average household size of immigrant and native households for top immigrant - receiving states .
42
In most , but not all , states immigrant households have significantly lower median incomes than do native households .
But perhaps most importantly , immigrant households are significantly larger on average .
As a result , the per-person median household income is much less for immigrant households than native households in every state .
For example , immigrant households in Illinois have a median income that roughly matches those of native households , but the average immigrant household in that state is one - third larger .
Thus , as the last column in Table 16 shows , the per-person median income of native households in the state is 33 percent higher than that of immigrant households .
Lower household income coupled with larger household size means that the typical immigrant household is likely to pay somewhat less in taxes and use somewhat more in services than the typical native household because households are the primary basis on which taxes are assessed and benefits are distributed .
Of course , payroll tax payments reflect income and number of dependents , and the net fiscal effects also reflect use of social services .
As we have seen , immigrant households do tend to use more in welfare and other means - tested programs than native households .
But , reflecting their age structure , immigrant households use relatively less in Social Security and Medicare , the health insurance for those over 65 .
While both welfare and retirement programs are very costly , there is a very important difference between the two sets of programs .
Use of Medicare and Social Security is nearly universal among those who live to old age , including immigrants .
Lack of health insurance or welfare use is not universal .
Put a different way , all people grow old , but not all people use the welfare system .
As a policy matter , there is no way to select immigrants who will not grow old , but by selecting more educated immigrants we could significantly reduce use of means - tested programs by immigrants in the future if we wish to do so .
School - Age Population .
In the last few years , a good deal of attention has been focused on the dramatic increase in enrollment experienced by many school districts across the country .
All observers agree that this growth has strained the resources of many school districts .
While it has been suggested that this increase is the result of the children of baby boomers reaching school age , the so called " baby boom echo , " it is clear from the CPS that immigration policy accounts for the dramatic increase in school enrollment .
Table 17 shows that there are 10.8 million school - age children of immigrants ( ages 5 to 17 ) in the United States , accounting for 20.2 percent of the total school - age population .
43
While fewer than one - fourth ( 2.7 million ) of these children are immigrants themselves , the use of public education by the U.S. - born children of immigrants is a direct consequence of their parents having been allowed into the country .
The children of immigrants account for such a large percentage of the school - age population because a higher proportion of immigrant women are in their childbearing years , and immigrants tend to have somewhat larger families than natives .
In addition , the effect of immigration on public schools will be even larger in the coming years because 22.6 percent of children approaching school age have immigrant mothers .
Table 17 also shows that immigration has significantly increased the school - age population in all of the top immigrant - receiving states .
Of course , a dramatic increase in enrollment may not create a problem for public education if tax revenue increases proportionately .
But as we have seen , immigrants themselves and immigrant households generally have lower incomes than natives , so their tax contributions are unlikely to entirely offset the costs they impose on schools .
This is especially true because of the higher costs associated with teaching children whose first language is not English .
Citizenship and Educational Attainment by State .
Table 18 reports the citizenship , education level , and poverty rates for immigrants .
The table shows citizenship rates vary a great deal by state , with Arizona and North Carolina having the lowest rate and New York and Massachusetts having the highest .
The table shows that in every state the share of adult immigrants without a high school education is significantly higher than that of natives .
The largest gap is found in western states such as California , Arizona , and Colorado , where four to eight times as many immigrants as natives are high school dropouts .
This huge gap has enormous implications for the social and economic integration of immigrants because there is no better predictor of one ’s economic and social status in modern America than education .
( Click here to see a larger version of Table 18 )
Poverty and Near Poverty by State .
The two columns after citizenship and educational attainment in Table 18 report the percentage and number of immigrants and their U.S. - born children ( under age 18 ) who live in poverty compared to natives and their children .
While the foreign - born tend to have higher poverty rates in the top - receiving states , in Massachusetts , Illinois , Virginia , Maryland , and Georgia the difference with natives is not that large .
In contrast , immigrants and their children tend to have much higher rates of poverty in North Carolina , Texas , Colorado , and Arizona .
Turning to the share in or near poverty we see a somewhat different pattern .
( Near poverty is defined as having an income below 200 percent of the poverty threshold . )
With the exception of Maryland , immigrants and their young children have much higher rates of poverty / near poverty than natives in every major immigrant state .
As already discussed , those with incomes below this amount usually do not pay income taxes , and they typically become eligible for means - tested programs .
As a share of all persons in or near poverty , immigrants and their children account for more than one - half of the poor and near poor in California and roughly one - third in New York , New Jersey , Florida , Texas , and Arizona .
Welfare Use by State .
Table 19 shows the percentage of immigrant - and native - headed households using at least one welfare program .
( Programs included are TANF , SSI , general assistance , food stamps , WIC , free school lunch , public / rent - subsidized housing , and Medicaid . )
Nationally , 32.7 percent of immigrant households use a welfare program compared to 19.4 percent of natives .
As we saw in Table 12 , the biggest difference in program use is for Medicaid and food assistance programs .
For state governments , Medicaid is a particular concern because between one - third to one - half of the program ’s costs are typically borne by state taxpayers .
The biggest difference in overall welfare use is found in Texas , California , Arizona , Massachusetts , and Georgia .
As a result of their higher use rates , immigrant households account for a very significant percentage of the those using the welfare system .
In California , almost half of households using a welfare program are headed by immigrants , and in New York , Florida , Texas , New Jersey , and Arizona immigrant households account for between a quarter and one - third of households using the welfare system .
Health Insurance Coverage .
Table 20 shows the share of immigrants and their children without health insurance by state .
In the nation as a whole , 30 percent of immigrants and their children ( under 18 ) are uninsured , compared to 13 percent of natives and their children .
The difference between immigrant and native insurance coverage rates can only be described as enormous in many states .
In states such as Colorado , Arizona , North Carolina , and Virginia the rate of uninsurance among immigrants and their children is triple that of natives .
In almost every other state shown in Table 20 , the uninsurance rate is double or nearly double that of natives .
The impact of immigration on the healthcare system as a whole can also be seen when we consider the share of immigrants and their minor children who are either uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid shown in the last columns of Table 20 .
The 2007 CPS shows that 17.4 percent of immigrants and their children are on Medicaid , compared to 12 percent of natives and their children .
When we combine the share on Medicaid with the share without health insurance , we find that in the nation as a whole 47.4 percent of immigrants and their children ( under 18 ) are either uninsured or on Medicaid .
In comparison , 25 percent of natives and their young children are uninsured or on Medicaid .
In Arizona and Texas , more than 60 percent of immigrants and their young children are uninsured or on Medicaid .
In Colorado , North Carolina , Georgia , and California half or more of immigrants and their children are uninsured or on Medicaid .
The impact of immigration on the healthcare system in these states and the nation is clearly enormous .
Size of the Poverty , Uninsured , and School - Age Populations .
Figure 6 shows the percentage of the nation ’s total population comprised of immigrants alone and immigrants plus their U.S. - born children under age 18.44
The figure also shows the share of the poverty population , uninsured population , and school - age population that is either immigrants or their children .
Overall , immigrants and their children are 16.7 percent of the total population , but comprise 23 percent of the poverty population , 31.7 percent of the uninsured , and 20.2 percent of the school - age population .
Figure 6 makes clear that an appreciation of immigration ’s impact is necessary to understand poverty , health insurance , or the situation of the nation ’s public schools .
Figure 7 shows some of the same statistics by each state for immigrants and their U.S. - born children under age 18.45
As a share of all persons in poverty , immigrants and their children account for more than one - half of the poor in California , and roughly one - third in New York , Colorado , Texas , Florida , and Arizona .
The impact of immigration on the overall size of the uninsured population is even larger .
In California immigrants and their U.S. - born children under 18 are 57.5 percent of the uninsured , and they are almost half of the uninsured in New Jersey .
They also represent a third or more of the uninsured in Arizona , Texas , Florida , Virginia , Maryland , and Colorado .

Illegal Immigration
Illegal Population Overall .
So far we have examined the size , growth , and characteristics of the nation ’s total foreign - born population .
As discussed in the methods section of this report , the foreign - born population in the CPS includes both legal and illegal immigrants .
We estimate that of the 37.3 million immigrants , 11.3 million are illegal aliens .
It must also be remembered that these figures are only for those in the CPS , not those missed by the survey .
Our estimates indicate that illegal aliens comprise 3.8 percent of the nation ’s total population and 30.4 percent of the total immigrant population .
Estimates prepared by other researchers often adjust for undercount in Census Bureau data .
While there is debate about the number missed , most research indicates that roughly 10 percent of the illegals are not counted in the CPS.46
Thus , the " true " size of the illegal population could be 12.4 million ( 11.3 million plus 1.1 million for undercount ) .
If the undercount is larger , then the total illegal alien population is larger .
One of the most important characteristics of illegal immigrants is the very large share with little formal education .
We estimate that 57 percent of adult illegal immigrants ( 25 to 64 years of age ) have not completed high school , 24 percent have only a high school degree , and only 19 percent have education beyond high school .
As already discussed , this is critically important because education is so important to socio-economic status in the modern American economy .
Illegals by State .
Below we examine the demographic characteristics of illegal aliens by state .
Since the sample size is much smaller for individual states than for the nation as a whole , the results should be interpreted with caution , especially for the smaller states .
In addition to issues associated with sample size , it also should be remembered that the identification of illegals in the survey contains some error .
Table 21 reports our best estimates for the number of illegals by state in the CPS .
( It should be noted that even if the undercount is 10 percent nationally , as many researchers think , this may not be uniform across states . )
Table 21 shows that California has by far the largest illegal population , followed by Texas , Florida , Arizona , and New York .
However , with the exception of Texas and Arizona , these states do not rank at the top in terms of the illegal share of the total foreign - born .
In Arizona , North Carolina , Georgia , and Texas , illegals account for half or more of the total immigrant population .
Employment of Illegal Immigrants .
Table 21 also shows the number of illegals holding a job in each state .
In total , nearly 6.9 million illegals currently work in the United States out of a total illegal - alien population in the CPS for 11.3 million .
47
The table also shows the number of less - educated natives ages 18 to 64 years of age not holding a job .
This includes those who are unemployed , which means they are looking for work , as well as those who are not working and say they are not looking for work .
Less - educated is defined as either having not completed high school or having a high school education , but no additional schooling .
Native - born teenagers ( 15 to 17 ) not holding a job are also shown .
It is often suggested that there are simply no Americans to fill jobs taken by illegals .
To examine this question it is necessary to look at the number of teenagers and natives with little education who are not working .
This makes sense because illegal aliens are overwhelmingly less - educated .
Therefore , it is less - educated natives who might face job competition from illegals .
Table 21 indicates that there are 22.3 million less - educated native - born adults ( 18 to 64 ) and 10.1 million native - born teenagers ( 15 to 17 ) not holding a job .
Roughly half of these adults and one - third of the teenagers live in the top states of illegal - immigrant settlement listed in Table 21 .
In addition to the millions of less - educated natives living in states with large illegal populations , the millions of adults living in low - immigration states could represent a source of labor for employers in high - illegal - immigrant states if given an incentive to move , such as higher pay .
Table 21 indicates that there would seem to be a very large pool of potential workers who might be employed if there were fewer illegal aliens in the country .
For a variety of reasons many people not working do not wish to work and no incentive could induce them to hold a job .
But if only one in four less - educated adults natives and one in seven native - born teenagers currently not working took a job , it would equal the entire number of illegal aliens currently holding jobs .
48
We do know that the share of less - educated adults and teenagers working used to be higher , but it has declined significantly in recent years .
49
Illegals ’ Income by State .
Table 22 shows the average income and size for households headed by illegal immigrants .
We use average income and not median income because at the household level it is not possible to calculate median income figures due to sample size in most states .
50
Not surprisingly , Table 22 shows that the mean income of illegal households is much smaller than the mean income of native households .
At the same time these households are much larger on average than native households .
In most states , illegals have household incomes that are between 25 and 50 percent less than native households .
At the same time , illegal alien households are at least 40 percent larger than native households in most states .
As already discussed , lower household income coupled with larger household size means that , on average , illegal - alien households will pay less in taxes and use more in services than native households because households are the primary basis on which taxes are assessed and benefits distributed in the United States .
Even assuming that illegals pay all the taxes they are supposed to , it is difficult , given their average household income and size , for illegals not to create a significant fiscal drain .
But again , it must be pointed out that this situation arises because of the education level of illegals and not because they do not work .
The vast majority of working - age illegals work .
In fact , we estimate that 92 percent of illegal - alien households have at least one person working .
This compares to 73 percent of native - headed households .
But because of their education levels , a very large share of illegal households have low incomes , and very low per capita household income .
Illegals and the School - Age Population .
One advantage of not adjusting for undercount is that it is possible to see what share of those in poverty , without health insurance , or in public schools are illegal immigrants in the CPS .
If we had adjusted upward for those illegal missed in the CPS , then figures would no longer match the survey , which is the primary source for government statistics on things like poverty or the uninsured .
Not adjusting makes it possible to estimate what share of the poverty or uninsured populations , as shown in official government publications , are illegal immigrants .
51 Table 23 reports the estimated number and share of the school - age population in the United States that is comprised of illegal immigrants .
Overall illegals account for 1.5 million school - age children or 2.8 percent of all 5 to 17 year olds .
This is smaller than the 3.8 percent illegals represent of the nation ’s total population because immigrants , including illegal aliens , generally come to the United States after age 17 , so there are relatively fewer illegals under age 18 .
Table 23 also shows that school - age illegal aliens plus the U.S. - born children of illegal aliens comprise 6.2 percent ( 3.3 million ) of the total school - age population .
52 Since per-student expenditure in the United States is very roughly $ 10,000 a year , it is likely that $ 15 billion annually goes to educate illegal aliens in public schools .
The total cost for educating illegal aliens and the U.S. - born children of illegal aliens likely comes to over $ 30 billion a year .
In states such as New Jersey , Texas , Arizona , Florida , and California illegal immigrants comprise significantly more than the national average .
Thus the impact of illegal immigration in some parts of the country is much larger .
Poverty Among Illegals .
Table 24 reports the share of illegals and their U.S. - born children ( under 18 ) who live in poverty or live in or near poverty , with near poverty defined as less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold .
Not surprisingly , Table 24 shows that illegals tend to have a very high rate of poverty and near poverty .
Recall from Table 10 that roughly one in nine natives lives in poverty , this compares to one in five illegal aliens .
Nationally , about 6.5 percent of those in poverty are illegal aliens , compared to their 3.8 percent share of the total population .
Illegals and their U.S. - born children account for 9.4 percent of all persons in poverty .
Illegal aliens clearly have low incomes , and the low income population in the United States is clearly larger because of immigration .
Nonetheless , illegal immigration accounts for only a modest share of the national total of persons in poverty .
Table 24 also shows poverty for illegals by state .
Poverty among illegals is the highest in states like Texas and Colorado .
In states such as California , Arizona , Texas , and Colorado illegals and their U.S. - born children account for roughly a fifth of the those in poverty .
The same general pattern holds when we consider those in or near poverty , which is shown on the right - hand side of Table 24 .
Rates for illegals tend to be dramatically higher than those of natives .
In just about every state , the majority of illegals and their minor children live in or near poverty .
And illegal immigrants account for a large share of the overall low - income population .
However , its is worth noting that of all immigrants and their children who live in or near poverty , only about 41 percent are illegal aliens or the young children of illegal aliens .
Most low - income immigrants are not illegal aliens .
Welfare Among Illegals by State .
Table 25 shows the share of households headed by illegal aliens using various welfare programs .
It shows that a large share of illegal alien households use the food assistance programs ( food stamps , WIC , and free lunch ) and Medicaid .
But use of cash assistance ( TANF , State General Assistance , and SSI ) is generally very low .
It should also be added that the share of households headed by illegals in public or rent subsidized housing is virtually zero .
It must be remembered that , in general , illegals cannot use the welfare system themselves .
But their U.S. - born children can be enrolled in Medicaid and receive food assistance .
Table 25 reflects the fact that a very large share of illegals have low incomes and as a result their children can enroll in means - tested programs .
This is important for a number of reasons , not the least of which because it means that efforts to bar illegals from using welfare programs will be ineffective .
Their U.S. - citizen children will continue to enjoy the same welfare eligibility as any other American citizen .
Or put a different way , as long as illegals are allowed to stay in the country , their children will continue to access the welfare system at very high rates , at least for some programs .
It should also be noted that this situation is not caused by an unwillingness to work on the part of illegals .
In fact , as already mentioned more than 90 percent of illegal households have at least one worker , much higher than the rate for native households .
Rather , with 57 percent of adult illegals lacking even a high school degree , their average incomes in the modern economy will be very low .
The American welfare system is geared toward helping low - income workers , especially those with children .
Since a very large share of illegals work , have low income , and have children , most of whom were born here , it should be no surprise that many illegal households use the welfare system .
Use of means - tested programs by illegal workers is important because it indicates that the desire of employers to have access to large number of unskilled immigrant workers creates significant costs to taxpayers .
This does not mean that the overall effort to help low - income workers is dsiplaced .
But it does raise the question of why we have an immigration policy that adds so many unskilled workers to the country .
Health Insurance Among Illegals by State .
Table 26 reports the share of illegals and their minor children without health insurance coverage .
Not surprisingly , most illegals are uninsured .
Nationally , we estimate that 64 percent of illegals lack health insurance ; this compares to about 13 percent of natives .
Illegals also account for a large share of the total uninsured population .
Nationally , 15.4 percent of all uninsured persons in the United States are estimated to be illegal aliens .
This compares to their 3.8 percent share of the nation ’s total population .
In some states the impact is much larger .
In Arizona , nearly one - third of the uninsured are illegal aliens ; in California more than one - fourth are illegals ; and in New Jersey , Texas , and Maryland , a fifth of the uninsured are illegal immigrants .
Table 26 indicates that when their U.S. - born children ( under 18 ) are included , the share without health insurance is lower than when illegals are considered alone .
This is in contrast to the poverty figures , which showed that poverty is higher when the U.S. - born minor children of illegals are included .
This is because poverty is always more common among children , while lack of insurance is more common among adults .
Nationally , 56 percent of illegals and their minor children are uninsured .
In general , lack of health insurance among the U.S. - born children of illegals is lower than for their parents because , unlike their parents , the U.S. - born children of illegals can enroll in Medicaid .
Most of the children in illegal - alien households are U.S. - born , and this is the main reason that the figures for Medicaid use for illegal - alien households shown in Table 26 are high .
Illegals and their children account for 17.6 percent of the total uninsured population in the United States .
In Arizona , 37 percent of the uninsured are illegals or the U.S. - born children ( under age 18 ) of illegals ; in California , it ’s 31 percent ; in Texas it ’s 25 percent ; and in New Jersey it ’s 23 percent .
In Maryland , Colorado , and Florida it ’s 20 percent or more .
The large number of illegals without insurance , and the impact this creates for taxpayers , indicates that the desire of some businesses to have access to large numbers of unskilled immigrant workers creates significant problems for the health care system and taxpayers .
Characteristics of Unskilled Legal Immigrants .
Illegal immigration is one of the most contentious issues of our time .
Many in Congress , and a number of presidential candidates , have all argued for giving legal status to illegal immigrants as well as increased levels of legal immigration .
Since illegal aliens are overwhelmingly unskilled , we can gain some insight into the possible effects of legalization by looking at the economic situation of unskilled legal immigrants .
Figure 9 reports the estimated welfare use and poverty rates of legal immigrants who have not completed high school .
It should be noted that if we have overestimated welfare use for households headed by illegal aliens , then legal immigrants , particular the unskilled , must have even higher welfare use rates than reported here .
This would mean that legalization would be even more costly because the difference between what illegals currently use and what they would use once legalized is even larger than we have estimated .
This has to be the case mathematically because immigrant households accessing the welfare system can only be either legal immigrants or illegal aliens and we simply take the welfare use rates for the foreign - born as reported in the CPS .
We do not impute welfare use or change the share using welfare for the foreign - born in any way .
Figure 9 shows that unskilled legal immigrants make extensive use of the welfare system .
In fact , our estimate is that more than half ( 56 percent ) of households headed by unskilled legal immigrants use at least one major welfare program .
Their use of welfare programs is much higher than that of illegal aliens for every type of program .
In contrast to welfare use , the share of unskilled legal immigrants and their children living in or near poverty is very similar to illegal aliens and their children .
One area where unskilled legal immigrants are much better off than illegal aliens is in health insurance coverage .
But this is partly due to the fact that such a large share of unskilled legal immigrants and their children use Medicaid , which is very costly to taxpayers .
Figure 9 indicates that legalization will not solve the problems of welfare use or low income associated with illegal immigration .
In fact , legalization will increase use of welfare programs .
Whether this is a better or worse situation depends on one ’s point of view .
Of course , not all illegal aliens are unskilled .
We estimate 57 percent of illegal immigrants ( 18 to 64 year of age ) lack a high school education .
Those with more education can be expected to do better than unskilled legal immigrants .
On the other hand , legal unskilled immigrants in the CPS have lived in the United States significantly longer than the average illegal immigrant , the majority of whom have lived here for less than 10 years .
Over time income rises with greater workforce experience .
The estimates for unskilled legal immigrants reflect this fact .
Thus , unskilled legal immigrants in the CPS have higher incomes than would be expected for legalized unskilled illegal aliens , at least at the onset of any amnesty .
Legal Status No Guarantee of Success .
Figure 9 makes clear that immigrants who have legal status , but little education , generally have low incomes and make heavy use of welfare programs .
If we decide to legalize illegal immigrants , we should at least understand that it will not result in dramatically lower welfare use or poverty for most illegal aliens .
This does not mean legalization is necessarily a bad idea .
But it does mean that those who advocate such a policy need to acknowledge this problem and not argue that legalization will save taxpayers money or result in a vast improvement in the income of illegal aliens .
Legalized illegals will still be overwhelmingly uneducated and this fact has enormous implications for their income , welfare use , health insurance coverage , and the effect on American taxpayers .
Conclusion
The latest data collected by the Census Bureau shows that the last seven years have been the highest period of immigration in American history .
Immigration continues to be the subject of intense national debate .
The roughly 1.5 million immigrants arriving each year ( 1.6 million if you count those missed by the Census Bureau ) have a very significant effect on many areas of American life .
Immigrants and their young children ( under 18 ) now account for one - fifth of the school - age population , one - fourth of those in poverty , and nearly one - third of those without health insurance , creating enormous challenges for the nation ’s schools , healthcare system , and physical infrastructure .
The low educational attainment of many immigrants , 31 percent of whom have not completed high school , is the primary reason so many live in poverty , use welfare programs , or lack health insurance , not their legal status or an unwillingness to work .
A central question for immigration policy is whether we should allow in so many people with little education — increasing job competition for the poorest American workers and the population needing government assistance .
Setting aside the lower socio-economic status of immigrants , no nation has ever attempted to incorporate nearly 38 million newcomers into its society .
Whatever one thinks of contemporary immigration , it is critically important to understand that its effect on America represents a choice .
Selection criteria can be altered , as can the total number of people allowed into the country legally .
Moreover , the level of resources devoted to reducing illegal immigration can also be reduced or increased .
With illegal aliens accounting for nearly one in three immigrants , their effect on the nation by themselves is now very large .
The goal of this Backgrounder has been to provide information about the impact of immigration on American society to better inform the policy discussion about what kind of immigration policy should be adopted in the future .
Absent a change in policy , 15 million additional legal and illegal immigrants will likely arrive in the next 10 years .
Thus immigration ’s impact will continue to grow if current trends continue .
End Notes
1 The survey is considered such an accurate source of information on the foreign - born because , unlike the decennial census , each household in the CPS receives an in - person interview from a Census Bureau employee .
It also includes an extra - large sample of minorities .
The 207,000 persons in the survey , 25,000 of whom are foreign - born , are weighted to reflect the actual size of the total U.S. population .
However , it must be remembered that some percentage of the foreign - born ( especially illegal aliens ) are missed by government surveys of this kind , thus the actual size of this population is almost certainly larger .
Of course , this was also true in past years .
2 This includes naturalized American citizens , legal permanent residents ( green card holders ) , illegal aliens , and people on long - term temporary visas such as students or guest workers , who responded to the CPS .
It does not include those born abroad of American parents or those born in outlying territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico .
3 The 2006 American Community Survey ( ACS ) collected in 2006 includes persons in group quarters .
While it does not have the detail of the CPS , it does distinguish the foreign - born .
4 The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) estimate of illegal immigrants can be found at www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ill_pe_2006.pdf .
Table 2 in the report includes an estimate of non-immigrants and illegals in the American Community Survey ( ACS ) .
The population totals and coverage ratio of the ACS and CPS are very similar .
5 Figure 1 reports the number of immigrants living in the country from 1995 through 2007 from the March CPS .
The data for 1995 to 1999 was originally weighted based on the results of the 1990 ensus carried forward .
This was also true for the March 2000 and 2001 CPS .
After the 2000 Census , which was conducted in April , the Census Bureau re-weighted the March 2000 and 2001 CPSs based on the results from the 2000 Census .
This had the effect of increasing the size of the foreign - born population in the March 2000 CPS by 5.659 percent .
While the Census Bureau has not re-weighted the 1995 through 1999 CPSs , it is very reasonable to assume that the undercount was similar in those years .
If we adjust the 1995 through 1999 March CPSs by the same amount it produces the results found in Figure 1 .
6 If the original weights ( based on the 1990 census ) are used for the 1996 through 2000 data , then the foreign - born grew from 23 million in 1995 to 28.38 million in 2000 — 5.38 million .
This is less than the 5.7 million growth reported for this time period shown in Figure 1 .
7 Unlike deaths , out - migration may or may not rise with the size of the immigrant population .
Also , unlike deaths , it can fluctuate from year to year .
While the potential pool of return migrants obviously grows as the immigrant population grows , this does not necessarily mean that more will choose to go home , or in the case of illegals , be forced to do so .
Put simply , out - migration usually is voluntary and can fluctuate ; deaths on the other hand are not voluntary and therefore occur at a predictable rate .
This does not mean that out - migration cannot be estimated .
See Census Bureau publication www.census.gov/population/documentation twps0051/twps0051.pdf .
In a recent report we estimated that between 2000 and 2005 new immigrant arrivals averaged 1.6 million a year and out - migration was 350,000 .
The 1.6 million figure assumes a 5.2 percent ( roughly 100,000 ) undercount among recent arrivals .
The Center for Immigration Studies report is entitled " 100 Million More : Projecting the Impact of Immigration On the U.S. Population , 2007 to 2060 " and can be found at www.cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/2007/back707.html.
The Census Bureau ’s 280,000 out - migration figure assumes no immigrants are missed by the Census Bureau .
8 The Pew Hispanic Center assumes a 5.2 percent undercount of the total foreign - born population in the 2005 CPS .
See Figure 3 , page 4 , in their March 2006 estimate of the illegal population , http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/61.pdf.
Pew bases its 5.2 percent estimate on work done by Passel , Van Hook , and Bean .
Their paper is entitled " Narrative Profile with Adjoining Tables of Unauthorized Migrants and Other Immigrants , Based on Census 2000 : Characteristics and Methods , " which was done for Sabre Systems as part of a contract with the Census Bureau .
9 In order to preserve anonymity , the Census Bureau groups several different years of arrival together in the public use CPS .
In the March 2000 CPS , for example , those who arrived in 1992 and 1993 are grouped together .
We split the 1992 - 93 group by dividing it in two , so we can compare the seven - year period prior to 2000 with the last seven years .
( Even if the 1992 - 1993 group is not split it still shows that fewer than 10 million immigrants arrived from 1992 to 2000 . )
The 2001 CPS shows that 9.7 million immigrants arrived from 1994 to 2001 .
Thus the last seven years match or exceed the number of new immigrant in any seven - year period .
Immigration during the great wave of immigration 100 years ago showed a level well below 10.3 million for any seven - year period .
10 The report , " Immigrants at Mid-Decade : A Snapshot of American ’s Foreign - Born Population in 2005 , " can be found at www.cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/2005/back1405.pdf.
Pages 2 through 4 and endnotes 6 through 14 explain why estimating individual year flows of immigrants is so difficult .
11 To distinguish legal and illegal immigrants in the survey , this report uses citizenship status , year of arrival in the United States , age , country of birth , educational attainment , sex , receipt of welfare programs , receipt of Social Security , veteran status , and marital status .
We use these variables to assign probabilities to each respondent .
Those individuals who have a cumulative probability of 1 or higher are assumed to be illegal aliens .
The probabilities are assigned so that both the total number of illegal aliens and the characteristics of the illegal population closely match other research in the field , particularly the estimates developed by the Department of Homeland Security / legacy INS , the Urban Institute , and the Pew Hispanic Center .
This method is based on some very well - established facts about the characteristics of the illegal population .
For example , it is well known that illegal aliens are disproportionately male , unmarried , under age 40 , have few years of schooling , etc .
Thus , we assign probabilities to these and other factors in order to select the likely illegal population .
In some cases , we assume that there is no probability that an individual is an illegal alien .
12 The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) estimate of 11.6 million illegal immigrants in January 2006 can be found at : www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ill_pe_2006.pdf.
That estimate includes an adjustment for those missed in Census Bureau data .
The Pew Hispanic Center has estimated an 11.5 to 12 million illegal immigrant population as of March 2006 based on the CPS .
This includes an adjustment for those missed by the survey .
The Pew report can be found athttp://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=61 .
The Urban Institute also has made estimates by legal status .
Urban estimates that in March of 2002 , 8.3 million illegal aliens were counted in the CPS , with an additional one million being missed .
Urban ’s estimates based on the March 2002 CPS can be found at : http://www.urban.org/publications/1000587.html .
Older studies by the INS and Census Bureau are also available .

NOVEMBER 1--Meet Paul Schum .
The Kentucky man , a Catholic school principal , is facing a prostitution charge after Louisville police found him dressed like a woman and loitering in an alley Tuesday night .
According to a criminal citation , a copy of which you 'll find here , Schum , 50 , was wearing fishnet stockings , fake breasts , and ' all black leather ' when officers discovered him ' loitering in high drug trafficking and prostitution area . '
The citation notes that Schum , who heads Bethlehem High School , had ' no reason for why he was in alley ... dressed up in women 's leather other than for prostitution . '
Schum , now on paid leave from his school post , is due in court on November 27 to answer a misdemeanor charge of loitering for the intent of prostitution .

A poll of 2,500 Brit workers has confirmed what most of us already knew : the Xmas holiday starts tonight at 5 pm as a third of the UK 's workforce will " mentally switch off " in advance of next week 's pre-Yule skive .
That 's according to Teletext holidays , which estimates that nine million people will from Monday fill their working hours with gossip , extended and undoubtedly robust lunches , Christmas shopping and general faffing about until Friday .
Nearly a quarter of workers " plan to go out on up to ten work nights during December , a fifth have up to five long lunches scheduled and nearly half said coming into work hungover during the festive build up was perfectly acceptable " , as the Telegraph puts it .
Those who are n't sloshed or buying prezzies may well still be in bed or throwing a sickie .
Almost a third of those polled admitted they plan to come into work late at least once next week and a fifth ' fessed up to planning a full day off with pub flu .
We tried to conduct a Reg straw poll to confirm the above findings , but the sales department has been lodged in the nearest wine bar since 11 am , the Strategy Boutique emailed in to say it was " redefining the pro-somnia paradigm " ( i.e. still in bed ) , and members of the editorial team nipped out an hour ago " for a news meeting " and are believed to be exchanging Xmas gifts ( beer , in pint glasses ) in Vulture Central local The Scribe and Strumpet . ®

Women do not tip over during pregnancy because their spines are built differently from men’s – and have been ever since our ancestors began walking upright .
The difference allows a pregnant woman to lean backward to counterbalance the weight of her developing fetus .
One problem with bipedalism is that the growing fetus sticks out to the front , shifting the mother ’s centre of mass forward of her hip joint , creating a tendency to tip over .
Pregnant quadrupeds do not have this problem , because the mother ’s centre of mass remains between her front and hind limbs throughout pregnancy .

“ Were a pregnant chimpanzee to stand upright , she would experience a similar problem , ” says Katherine Whitcome , a biological anthropologist at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , US .
Whitcome and her colleagues studied 19 women as they progressed through pregnancy .
Bipedal adaptations
They found that the women corrected for their growing imbalance by bending backward in the lower part of their spine .
Detailed anatomical measurements showed that the vertebrae of the lower back are more wedge - shaped in women than in men , which makes this bending easier .
The interlocking bony projections that align each vertebra with its neighbours are also relatively larger in women , Whitcome found .
This provides added support to prevent the vertebrae from slipping sideways , as they otherwise might because of the sharper bend in the spine .
Chimpanzees , which are mostly quadrupedal , do not show these vertebral adaptations .
However , when the researchers looked at the two known fossil spines of Australopithecus africanus , an ancestral human that lived 2 to 3 million years ago , they saw that one – believed to be a female – did have the wedge - shaped vertebrae and larger interlocking projections seen in modern women , while the other – believed to be a male – did not .
Later benefit
This suggests that even in Australopithecus , the stresses of pregnancy had caused evolution to favour these spinal changes .
“ I would imagine that Australopithecus women were uncomfortable during pregnancy in the same way that modern women often are , ” says Karen Rosenberg , a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Delaware , US .
The same spinal adaptations that served Australopithecus females – and still serve modern women – during pregnancy , most likely proved just as useful after birth , Rosenberg adds .
After all , a woman carrying a baby in her arms may be even more front - heavy than one whose baby is still within .

They are visions of a unique family of worlds on the other side of the solar system : a moon with lakes of liquid methane : a tiny , rocky world with geysers of water that are being sprayed into space and a strange mottled moon that has been splattered with dark , organic - rich gunk , like a comedian who has been hit by a custard pie .
These bizarre sets of images were released last week as Nasa , and the European Space Agency , Esa , prepare to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the launch of their Cassini - Huygens probe to Saturn .
Blasted into space on 15 October , 1997 , the probe took seven years to reach Saturn .
Since then , the robot spacecraft has been delivering stunning photographs of the ringed planet and its fantastic family of moons .
' The launch was the start of one of space exploration 's great adventures and we did n't really know what we would find , ' said Professor Andrew Coates , of University College London , who heads one of the UK teams involved in Cassini .
' Now we are reaping the rewards of nearly 20 years ' work on the mission and the science continues to be amazing . '
The mission 's most spectacular moment occurred in December 2004 , when its tiny Huygens probe separated from its mother craft , Cassini , and headed towards Saturn 's main satellite , Titan , the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere .
Several weeks later , it parachuted down to a landing on its surface and returned close - up images of this weird , distant world .
Huygens stopped working after only a few hours , as expected , but Cassini has continued to survey Saturn and its moons - with startling results .
In the case of Iapetus , it has helped solve - or at least partly solve - a 300 - year - old scientific mystery .
Astronomers had noted the little moon darkened and lightened as it moved round Saturn but could n't work out why .
Now Cassini has helped provide the answer .
Dark , organic - rich material is splattering the face of Iapetus as it orbits Saturn , like a car whose windscreen is sprayed with water from other cars on a rainy day .
' Dusty material spiralling in from outer moons [ of Saturn ] hits Iapetus head - on , and causes the forward - facing side of Iapetus to look different than the rest of the moon , ' said Tilmann Denk , a Cassini team member based at the Free University , Berlin .
Which moon is responsible for imposing this indignity on Iapetus remains unknown , however .
In addition , Cassini radar images have shown that both poles of Titan are pitted with hydrocarbon lakes , one of them larger than Lake Superior , Earth 's largest freshwater lake .
' This is our version of mapping Alaska , Canada , Greenland , Scandinavia and northern Russia , ' said Rosaly Lopes , of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena .
' It 's like mapping these regions of Earth for the first time . '
Titan 's north pole is currently gripped by winter .
And quite a winter it is , with temperatures dropping to - 180C and a rain of methane and ethane drizzling down , filling the moon 's lakes and seas .
These liquids also carve meandering rivers and channels on the moon 's surface .
Finally , last week Nasa and Esa revealed images from Cassini which confirmed that jets of fine , icy particles are spraying from Saturn 's moon Enceladus and originate from a hot ' tiger stripe ' fracture that straddles the moon 's south polar region .
The discovery raises the prospect of liquid water existing on Enceladus , and possibly life .
' These are findings with tremendously exciting implications , ' said Carolyn Porco , of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado .
' Do the jets derive from near - surface liquid water or not ?
And if not , then how far down is the liquid water that we all suspect resides within this moon ? '
A new method to grow rice could save hundreds of billions of cubic meters of water while increasing food security , according to a study by the World Wildlife Foundation published today .
( read full report here PDF )
With a focus on India â€ “ a country which faces a major water crisis , yet has the worldâ€™s largest rice cultivated area â€ “ the study found that the system of rice intensification ( SRI ) method has helped increase yields by over 30 % â€ ” four to five tonnes per hectare instead of three tonnes per hectare , while using 40 % less water than conventional methods .
Rice is the main source of directly consumed calories for about half the worldâ€™s population and 90 per cent of it is produced and consumed in Asia .
Contrary to popular belief , rice is not an aquatic plant and the main reason it is submerged in water is for controlling weeds .
The system is based on eight principles which are different to conventional rice cultivation .
They include developing nutrient - rich and un-flooded nurseries instead of flooded ones ; ensuring wider spacing between rice seedlings ; preferring composts or manure to synthetic fertilizers ; and managing water carefully to avoid that the plantsâ€™ roots are not saturated .
The method was initially developed in the 1980s in Madagascar and has been demonstrated to be effective in 28 countries .
â€ œAlthough the system of rice intensification has shown its advantages , the scale of its use leaves much to be desired , â€ said Dr Biksham Gujja , Senior Policy Adviser at WWF International .
“ It is time to start large - scale pro grammes to support a method that could make a lasting global impact with far - reaching benefits to people and nature.â€ 
The report suggests that major rice - producing countries â€ ” such as India , China and Indonesia â€ ” convert at least 25 % of their current rice cultivation to the new system by 2025 .
This would not only massively reduce the use of water but also help ensure food security .
In addition , this will reduce significant amount of methane emissions .
SRI fields do not emit methane as is the case with the more conventional system of growing rice .
For example , if the SRI method was applied to 20 million hectares of land under rice cultivation in India , the country could meet its food grain objectives of 220 million tonnes of grain by 2012 instead of 2050 .
Authorities in the Indian state of Tripura have already committed to move in that direction .
â€ œOur farmers proved that the system of rice intensification improves productivity and we will convert at least 40 % of our rice cultivation using this method over the next five years , â€ said Manik Sarkar , Chief Minister of Tripura State .
â€ œWe urge this as a model for rice cultivation elsewhere as it represents one hope for the water crisis affecting so many billions of people.â€ 
Demand for a water - intensive crop such as rice is expected to increase by 38 % by 2040 , deepening the water crisis during the same time .
However , less than 6 % of rice is traded internationally and savings in water have potential for mitigating domestic water conflicts , especially in poor , rural areas where water is scarce .
Already 1.2 billion people have no access to adequate water for drinking and hygiene .
WWF is focusing on sustainable agriculture efforts for cotton , sugar and rice , some of the most consuming crops for which alternative techniques can result in a strong yield and water savings .
Until this week , Mr Pereira 's voice was drowned by the roar of jet engines .
The people of the villages around the airport have been campaigning for years against the threat of expansion , but no one in power has listened .
Both the government and the airports operator BAA appear determined to evict the living and raise the dead .
Heathrow is already the busiest international airport on earth .
The new runway and the terminal and approach roads it needs would demolish around 1,200 homes ; one primary school will be flattened ; six others will be permanently blighted by noise .
Separated from the rest of Heathrow , this would , in effect , be a second airport .
The government hopes to have the new airport built " as soon as practicable " on the grounds that it will " generate the largest direct net economic benefits of any new runway " .
The Times reveals that BAA has been allowed to influence the tests that will determine whether or not the runway would breach the legal limits for pollution and noise .
The government has also given the company the results of its air pollution studies , while withholding them from the public .
It seems pretty obvious that this scheme could go ahead only if the government is prepared to rip up both its agreements with the public and the European Union 's pollution laws .
When Heathrow 's fifth terminal was approved , a planning condition capped the number of flights using the airport at 480,000 a year .
The new runway would raise them to 720,000 .
BAA also wants to end the " alternation agreement " that regulates flights at Heathrow 's existing runways : planes leaving the airport currently switch directions at 3 pm in order to give the people of west London a break from the noise .
If the policy changes , the airport could take a further 72,000 flights a year .
The government has promised that the area of land subject to noise levels that the World Health Organisation defines as causing " serious annoyance " ( 57 decibels or more ) will not increase .
But its own forecasts suggest the new runway will expand this zone by at least 12 % .
This is almost certainly an underestimate , which is perhaps why it has refused to publish maps of the flight paths to and from a third runway .
A consortium of local authorities has drawn up its own maps .
They show a massive northern expansion of the noise zone , sweeping over much of London and the counties to the west of Heathrow .
The airlines say that they will make their planes quieter in order to meet the government 's promise .
But they also say they will make them more efficient to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , and the method favoured by some of them is to swap the current engine design for " open rotor " turbines , which are much noisier .
They can't have it both ways .
Already the planes and their associated traffic have been breaching the European Union 's limits for nitrogen dioxide pollution , which suggests that current airport activities are unlawful ( remember that when you hear ministers fulminating about our illegal protest ) .
Now we are expected to believe that air pollutants can be reduced to a level below the legal limits while the number of flights almost doubles .
It looks as though our civil servants will be busy with what they call " statistical interpretations of the target " .
The rest of us call it lying .
Camping in the fields north of the airport over the past week , I found that I fell asleep promptly at 11 , when the flights mostly ceased , and woke - despite my wax ear plugs - promptly at six , when they resumed .
My throat swelled and my eyes itched , and I am sure that my headache was not just the result of a few too many bottles of Pitfield 's Eco Warrior .
Even if we were to put climate change to one side , who can honestly claim that new runways , for all their economic benefits , improve the quality of our lives ?
A pall of skull - scraping misery hangs over the catchment area of every major airport .
But the business plan cannot be faulted : the more hellish our lives become , the more we seek to escape from them .
Of course we can not put climate change to one side .
In a previous article I showed that , depending on whether you believe the government 's figures or those produced by academic researchers , by 2050 the greenhouse gases produced by the UK's air passengers will equate to between 91 % and 258 % of the carbon dioxide the government says the whole economy should be producing .
Its airport expansion plans , in conjunction with those of other nations , will cause runaway climate change even if we were to spend the rest of our lives shivering in the dark .
So much for the economic benefits of new runways .
The people seeking to prevent this expansion know that when the government supports a development , explaining your objections at its public inquiries is about as much use as shaking your fist at the sky .
An elaborate theatre of consultation and democracy is designed only to hide the fact that the decision has already been made .
So what else do the critics of direct action expect us to do ?
How else do they suggest we drag this issue out of the shadows and thrust it to the front of the public mind ?
We did not get everything right .
The media strategy was hopeless : sympathetic journalists were excluded , while unsympathetic journalists went undercover and stayed in the camp for as long as they wanted .
But in other respects it was better organised , more democratic and more disciplined than any I have seen before .
It drew on the protests of the 1990s but introduced two new elements : much better logistics and a model of popular democracy imported from Latin America .
All the facilities that 1,500 people would need - including running water , sanitation , hot food twice a day , banks of computers and walkie - talkies , stage lighting , sound systems , even a cinema - were set up in a few hours on unfamiliar ground , in the teeth of police blockades .
A system of affinity groups and neighbourhoods , feeding their decisions upwards to general meetings , permitted a genuine participatory democracy of the kind that you will never encounter in British public life .
The actions themselves were disciplined and remained non-violent , even when the police got heavy .
I left the camp on Sunday evening convinced that a new political movement has been born .
We have n't prevented runaway climate change by camping beside Heathrow and by surrounding the offices of BAA , and nor did we expect to do so .
But we have made it harder for Alf Pereira and the other invisible people to be swept aside , and harder for the government to forget that its plan for perpetual growth in corporate utopia is also a plan for the destruction of life on earth .

Wasp venom in wine and grape juice appears to have caused several cases of severe allergic reactions in people , according to a group of Spanish doctors .
They suspect that the venom came from wasps accidentally crushed along with the grapes at the first stage of winemaking .
Alicia Armentia of the Rio Hortega Hospital in Valladolid , Spain , and her colleagues treated five people who had developed severe allergic reactions after drinking either wine or grape juice .
Three of the patients had facial flushing and swollen lips , while another experienced asthma - like symptoms .
The fifth patient developed anaphylaxis , a whole - body allergic reaction that can cause death as a result of constricted airways .
Armentia and her colleagues successfully treated all of these patients , but they remained baffled over the cause of the allergic responses .
A battery of tests on the patients ruled out the most likely suspects , such as egg white , which is sometimes added to wine to clarify it and reduce harshness , and grape extract .
More elaborate analysis of the patients ’ blood revealed antibodies suggesting a recent bee or wasp sting .
However , none of the patients reported being stung .

Grapes of wrath
So the doctors looked for allergic responses to red and white grape juice , along with a newly pressed wine and three aged wines , all from different vineyards .
Both types of juice and the freshly made wine all triggered reactions in blood samples taken from the patients .
Further chemical tests provided strong evidence that this was due to trace amounts of venom from yellow - jacket wasps – not from bees – in the beverages .
“ It ’s likely the insects fell into the grape juice when the grapes were pressed , ” says Armentia .
Wasps abound on grapes in late summer , explains Lee Townsend , an entomologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington , Kentucky , US .
“ They will come to anything that ’s overripe , because they ’re running out of food by this time of year , ” he says .
Armentia suspects the aged wines did not produce an allergic reaction in the blood tests because any venom proteins they might have contained would have degraded as the wine matured .
Even a few weeks ’ ageing probably breaks down the venom enough that the risk of a dangerous allergic reaction is minuscule - but if they want to be on the safe side , people with bee and wasp allergies may want to avoid drinking freshly made wine , she adds .

Caracas , November 28 , 2007
( venezuelanalysis.com ) - Neighbors , friends and family members of young worker
and supporter of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , José Anibal Oliveros Yépez ,
who was murdered by a radical opposition group in the regional city of Valencia
on Monday , have express profound rage and indignation at what occurred
explaining that his body was spat on and kicked by his killers , " as if he were
and animal . "
Oliveres , 19 years old , was
on his way to work driving a truck of state owned " socialist " housing company
Petrocasa when he encountered opposition groups blocking the road in protest
against proposed constitutional reforms .
When he tried to convince them to let
him pass he was shot several times and died before he could be rescued .
Radio YVKE Mundial reported
that the opposition protesters came from Cuidad Alianza , a middle class suburb
in Valencia
and blocked a highway to impede workers from Petrocasa from passing to the
poorer neighborhood of Araguita , where they were
working to construct housing for the poor .
However , the report noted many of
the neighbors from Cuidad Alianza also rejected the violent behavior of some of
the opposition groups .
A resident from
Cuidad Alianza who did not want to be named told Radio YVKE Mundial that the opposition groups had blocked the road to
Araguita from three o'clock in the morning and were patrolling the neighborhood
" with guns in hand . "
Alexander Borges , friend and
workmate of Oliveros explained to VTV that they tried to rescue Oliveros , but
were prevented by the protestors who threatened to kill them .
" There were four of us ,
trying to carry our friend to the community , but they surrounded us throwing
bottles .
I took the opportunity to move him [ Oliveros ] because they were going
to hit him with a bottle in the face and I moved him so it did not hit him in
the face .
He had one bullet in the leg , a man from the local community was
going to carry him , but in this moment they shot him twice in the back and this
is when he fell to the ground . "
" We pleaded with them for the
life of our friend that was lying bloody on the ground , to please allow us the
opportunity to pick him up and they responded that now they were coming for us ,
that they were coming for me , " Borges added .
Borges explained that two
other people came to help rescue Oliveros , but that the opposition supporters
threw rocks and bottles at them screaming , " Come and pick up your dead , now we
are coming for you . "
Dixon Viloria , also a friend
of Oliveros and a witness said that after they killed him , " they mal - treated
him , kicked him , stripped off his clothes , hit him and screamed ‘ pick up your
dead chicken !' as if he was an animal . "
Beltran Chavez , from Araguita
said that neighbors from Cuidad Alianza had shot at workers from Petrocasa
earlier when they tried to pass through to construction sites in Araguita .
He
said the same group of protesters had previously set alight to a truck from
Petrocasa and physically and verbally attacked a group of women from Araguita .
" How can a group of people be
better armed than the state and municipal police , " he asked .
He added that
thanks to the municipal and state police the four people that participated in
the act were captured . "
National Assembly Deputy
Francisco Ameliach and the Mayor of Guacara , José Manuel Flores , who visited
the neighborhood to pay their respects to the Oliveros ' family , reported that
opposition groups in Ciudad Alianza that claim to represent " civil society "
have marked the houses of Chavez supporters , or those they believe to be Chavez
supporters , with red paint and " have said they are going to kill them . "
Vice president Jorge
Rodriguez confirmed that the Oliveros ' killer had been identified and arrested
and has confessed to the crime , reportedly saying that all " Chavistas " should
be killed , as well as three other people also linked to his death .
Rodrgiuez
said that simultaneously coordinated opposition protests of small groups had
blocked other highways with burning objects in Valencia
and Maracay .
In
total 80 people were arrested .
Rodriguez has also asked the
Venezuelan Episcopal Conference to explain what they know about a meeting held
by the opposition in the Diocesan Insitute in Maracay where the violent protests are
alleged to have been planned .
Rodriguez said he has witness
testimony of people who were invited to the meeting in the Diocesan Institute
to " pray for peace " however ; when they arrived they found the meeting was
planning the protest in Ciudad Alianza that resulted in the death of Oliveros .
Rodriguez said the Catholic
hierarchy should remember the commandments not to lie and not to kill and said
the Church should explain to the Venezuelan people why their buildings are
being used to plan these types of protests .
Friends and family of Oliveros
also condemned Venezuelan and international media reporting of his death ,
particularly opposition private TV channel Globovision , which they say tried to
portray Oliveros as insane , and some international media that have tried to
obscure the events leading to Oliveros death , some even claiming that Oliveros
was an opposition supporter attacked by a " pro-Chavez mob . "
Gladys Yépez , mother of
Oliveros demanded justice for her only son and President Hugo Chavez has
responded saying the murderer of Oliveros should face the " full weight of the
law . "
All Voting Systems by ES&S Completely Decertified ; DRE Touch - Screens from Sequoia Banned ; Optical - Scan Paper Systems by Hart InterCivic Banned ; All Systems by Diebold / Premier Conditionally ALLOWED for Use !
SoS Admits Federal Certification Process , Now Overseen by Former CO SoS on Behalf of EAC , ' Has Been Very Weak to Date ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon
12/17/2007 , 3:37 pm PT
Colorado's Republican Secretary of State , Mike Coffman , has announced that a number of Colorado 's e-voting machines have failed state certification testings , and will not be allowed for use in the 2008 election cycle .
The announcements came at a news conference in Denver which completely just minutes ago .
Describing the state 's testing of four major voting machine companies previously certified in the state , Coffman explained to reporters at the presser that there were " over 3000 tests on each vendor [ 's systems ] , and over 40,000 pages documenting the tests . "
" This has been an extensive process , " he said , after detailing several remarkable findings from each of the systems testing .
For example , test results showed that paper - based optical - scan systems made by Hart InterCivic " could not accurately count ballots . "
While Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) systems made by ES&S , the world 's largest supplier of voting systems , could be disabled by " denial of service " attacks at the polling place with a device as simple as a magnet .
" If you were to put a magnet in close proximity or inside the port , " Coffman said at the press conference today , " that would , in fact , disable that particular voting machines and it would have to be literally reprogrammed ... to bring in back into circulation for that election . "
While virtually all of the systems tested were found to have major vulnerabilities , a number of them were " conditionally certified " for use as long as new security mitigation requirements are met .
Notably , both op - scan systems and DREs made by Diebold ( now known as Premier ) were given conditional certification for use , despite Diebold systems having been banned in several states previously , including California , Ohio and Florida , due to a long list of critical vulnerabilities .
A summary of the decertified and conditionally certified systems follow ( links to more information on each , at the end of this article ) :
All voting systems made by Election Systems & Software , Inc. ( ES&S ) , both paper - based optical - scan and DREs , were completely decertified .
Their op - scan systems tested , according to Coffman , " both failed because of an inability to determine if the devices work correctly and an inability to complete the testing threshold of 10,000 ballots due to vendor programming errors . "
Their ubiqutous , and fatally flawed iVotronic DRE system " failed because it is easily disabled by voters activating the device interface , and the system lacks an audit trail to detect security violations . "

And finally , both optical - scan and DRE voting systems made by Diebold / Premier were conditionally certified for use in Colorado .
Coffman 's announcement comes today , months after the state had hoped to have the results available , due to sluggish participation by the voting machine companies , many of whom delayed supplying required information , such as voting system source code , as requested by the Secretary of State 's office .
All of Colorado 's electronic voting systems were decertified just prior to the November 2006 election when a state judge ruled , in a lawsuit brought by state voters , that testing and certification procedures for e-voting systems in the Centennial State were inadequate , largely non-existent , and in violation of state law .
As the judge 's decertification order came just prior to that years ' elections , the systems were allowed for use , but decertified immediately thereafter .
The state was forced to begin the certification process from scratch thereafter ...
" I had to strictly follow the law along with the court order , " Coffman said in a statement [ PDF ] released this afternoon summarizing the findings .
" If I ’m too lenient in determining what passes then I risk having the state taken to court by activists groups who will ask for an injunction on the use of electronic voting machines for the 2008 election , and if I exceed the requirements of state law and the court order , then I will be sued by the vendors who manufacture and sell the equipment . "
The vendors will have 30 days to appeal Coffman 's decisions .
During the 2006 trial , brought against Coffman 's predecessor , Gigi Dennis , it was revealed that the man overseeing the process of certification for the state , John Gardner , had no formal computer science training , in violation of state law .
His testing procedure at the time amounted largely to opening the boxes , making certain documentation was present , turning the machines on and off , and stamping them as " certified . "
Incredibly , as detailed recently [ PDF ] by the Colorado Stateman 's Chris Bragg , Gardner still remains in place , overseeing the state 's certification procedures .
Most of the systems decertified today were originally brought into the state by Colorado 's former Republican Sec. of State Donetta Davidson , who left the post when appointed by George W. Bush to the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission ( EAC ) .
She now chairs the EAC , the Executive Branch agency responsible for overseeing federal voting system certification for the entire country .
In reply to a question from a reporter at this afternoon 's presser , Coffman admitted that " the federal certification process has been very weak to date . "
Coffman is the latest Secretary of State to announce decertification of e-voting systems after extensive testing .
He 's also one of the rare Republicans to do so .
Last Friday , Ohio's Democratic SoS , Jennifer Brunner announced the results of a major bi-partisan , independent study of the state 's e-voting systems , by both corporate and academic teams of computer scientists and security experts .
The results included a recommended ban on all DRE voting systems in the Buckeye State after each of the tested systems was found to be easily vulnerable to manipulation .
Brunner was subsequently attacked by the Ohio Republican Party , with claims unsubstantiated claims that she " cooked up " the report with " left- wing activist academics " .
In late August , the Democratic SoS in California , Debra Bowen , announced that DRE voting systems made by Sequoia and Diebold would be banned for use , other than one per polling place to marginally meet federal disability voting standards .
She also mandated that 100 % of the so - called " paper trails " from those DRE systems would have to be hand - counted after any election in which they were used .
Earlier in the year , after prodding by Florida 's new Republican governor , Charlie Crist and Election Integrity advocates in the state , the Republican - majority legislature agreed to ban DRE voting systems in the Sunshine State .
Their Republican SoS , Kurt Browning , an ardent DRE supporter , reluctantly agreed to support the state 's DRE ban .

OLPC XO - 1 Mass Production has started
India is the latest of the countries where the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) experiment has started .
Children from the village of Khairat were given the opportunity to learn how to use the XO laptop .
During the last year XO was distributed to children from Arahuay in Peru , Ban Samkha in Thailand , Cardal in Uruguay and Galadima in Nigeria .
The OLPC team are , in their reports on the startup of the trials , delighted with how the laptop has improved access to information and ability to carry out educational activities .
Thailand 's
The Nation has praised the project , describing the children as " enthusiastic " and keen to attend school with their laptops .
Recent good news for the project sees Uruguay having ordered 100,000 of the machines which are to be given to children aged six to twelve .
Should all go according to plan a further 300,000 machines will be purchased by 2009 to give one to every child in the country .
As the first to order , Uruguay chose the OLPC XO laptop over its rival from Intel , the Classmate PC .
In parallel with the delivery of the laptops network connectivity will be provided to schools involved in the project .
The remainder of this article is based on Carla G. Munroy 's Khairat Chronicle , which is available from the OLPC Wiki .
Additional sources are listed at the end .
OLPC in Galima ( Nigeria ) showing children with their lime green XO laptops .
India team
The latest version of the OLPC machine , the XO laptop .
The Mumbai team ( OLPC - India )
In setting up the first pilot of the project in India , Carla and the OLPC team worked with Navi Mumbai telecommunications specialists - referred to as the Mumbai Team - who located the school for the XO laptop trial and established a relationship with the staff , students and community of Khairat school .
Liaising with a local who sponsors schools in the area , Mr. Iyer , Carla 's chronicle states , " it turned out that they struck a gold mine in terms of kindness and pro-activity of the teacher , children , and community . "
According to the Khairat Chronicle report the Mumbai team was in two parts , but with little to separate them .
A strategic team , working for OLPC - India in general and getting the project off the ground , started up in July , with the team 's Mr. Joshi visiting the village with Carla 's group on a number of times .
He attended parent 's meetings and acted as an advocate for the OLPC project , stressing villagers ' involvement and explaining the role of Carla 's team .
Amit joined the team in September , bringing a technical background on the Linux operating system .
He was introduced to the educational aspects of the project and assisted greatly with the technical aspects and community - building efforts .
On the whole , the Mumbai team were based in Navi Mumbai .
The OLPC team
In India from Late September , Carla was working on the educational side of the project , helping out as needed on technical issues and relations with the community .
Carla was joined by Arjun and Manu early in October , working with Amit from the Mumbai team setting up the network infrastructure and testing it .
Work on Marathi fonts was also carried out with Amit .
After a little over two weeks during which the children were given their XO laptops and introduced to them the OLPC team left , providing long - distance support to the Mumbai Team and the Khairat community .
Khairat
Houses in Khairat
Khairat is a small village with around 200 people , placed near Mumbai in Maharashtra state .
Carla described houses in the villages as " spacious and minimalist in their furniture . "
A section of each of the 20 or so house is set aside for cattle , only an outside door is present on each house , and cooking is done with a wood - fired stove .
In most cases a partial second roof or attic is where people will sleep .
The town school
Schoolhouse
Children go to school 5 days in week , from Monday to Friday , from 10.30 AM to 5.30 PM and they attend also on Saturdays from 8.30 AM to 10.00 AM .
The students are from 5 to 10 years old .
Khairat school ( Vastishala Khairat - Dhangarvada ) is a one - room schoolhouse , it is years old .
The land to build it was donated by a villager .
Carla was told that she used to go and help the construction workers with the building of the school .
She also came to help organize the digging of the hole for grounding the server .
The building itself was sponsored by a villager who has a lot of land in the area .
He also supports , on a continual basis , with other items the school needs .
The day before I arrived to Khairat , our Mumbai team had come to school to meet the teacher and also to leave five XOs .
I came for my first time to Khairat school on a Wednesday .
I loved it .
The children , the teacher , and the villagers were shy with me , but still I sat among the children to work in groups on the five laptops we had with us .
We spoke with the teacher mainly through Amit 's translations
We talked about the timeframe for my visit and the OLPC educational approach in general .
He showed me all the things he had already worked on in a couple of sessions he had had with our Mumbai team in their Navi Mumbai offices .
It was excellent groundwork .
On Thursday , we came to school in the afternoon with all the XOs , one for each child .
And on Friday , morning , with the help of many young villagers , we handed out the XOs to them .
Amit was the master of ceremonies in Marathi , and it took like two hours from the time we started until every child had a laptop .
Each child had to come to the front , and Amit would ask something adequate for their grade level , like tell me the ABC's or the Marathi numbers .
They all answered correctly right away .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
Children collaborate and learn together
The schoolhouse has three cabinets .
The one with glass panes is where the children keep their textbooks , and it also contains reading books that children can grab to read .
On the top shelf , there is a statue of Ganesha , to whom children bring some fresh flowers .
In one corner is the water bucket , glasses , and dishes .
On the other , is the raw rice bucket and the server cardboard box that sometimes is a desktop for the teacher and other times a table to drink milky , sugary Indian tea .
This arrangement is recent though , because he volunteered his desk for setting up the server .
A broad black strip is painted horizontally across all the walls , on which varied learning stuff is colorfully sketched with colored chalk , such as the Marathi and English alphabets , the water cycle , Mahatma Gandhi 's face , the numbers in Marathi .
Hanging from the ceiling , there 's a fan and a few light - bulbs , which are rarely used because the sunlight that comes in through the door and the three grated windows is enough .
The workplace
The first girl to arrive to school early in the morning sweeps the floor .
The second girl to arrive helps her remove things from the corners .
Other children help by taking out and placing at the entrance two small palm trees they keep inside when the school is closed .
The older girls go to the village well for water to refill the water bucket and have water to drink during the day .
They also count the rations of rice to be cooked for lunch and take it to the person who will cook it .
Three rows are made with mats on the floor .
The floor is the seat where the students sit , the surface on which they write , the boundless space they can use to adopt any position they find comfortable as well as to work in pairs or groups , and a classmate — or the teacher — can come and sit next to anyone to help .
The school is multilevel .
Children from first to fourth standard take classes in the same classroom with the same teacher .
Sometimes they all listen to the same explanation or work on the same assignment , but the teacher usually assigns different tasks to each level , and when the younger ones get stuck and he is busy working with other students , children from third and fourth standard help the first and second standard ones .
They learn so much by always being in touch with the ' basics ' and previously learned facts , knowledge , or skills , and by teaching others , they reinforce their knowledge .
With the XO , they help each other by explaining or by pointing a finger at the screen or keyboard or by checking the work done .
And it 's not necessarily the older ones who help the younger , nor age or grade level what determines how they group together .
You can also see children by themselves , focused on their work , oblivious to what is going on around them , even to what the teacher is saying or doing — and in this case it is perfectly alright to not pay attention to the teacher .
Although the teacher conducts the activities and is the leader and most knowledgeable one in the room , there reigns an atmosphere of independent work and independent grouping and consultations .
The smaller ones are natural scouts and keep on exploring the laptops on their own , and when they find something interesting or need some help , they go to others to show them their findings or be helped out .
Marathi
Marathi alphabet ( on the wall )
The people in the village speak Marathi .
The teacher speaks some English too .
The children and the villagers talk to me in Marathi .
Carla keep the communication channel open by smiling , which is easy and effective .
Amit helps a lot by translating .
Regarding the XOs , the children tell me in Marathi what they want to do or what they can't do as they point their finger here and there .
I in turn get across to them by showing and doing on the XOs , or by pointing to objects on the screen and keys on the keyboard , and by simultaneously saying and repeating names and actions in English , or in my few words of Marathi that they and Amit have been teaching me .
I rely a lot on their goodwill and the context .
Even when English and Marathi are so different , even when the keyboard is in English , even when the interface is in English , even when we do n't speak each other 's language , and even when they are so new to computers , the XO is so user - friendly that I can manage to get across to them , to show them how to do something with it .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
The teacher
Teacher working on XO
The teacher is a very proactive person .
He loves learning and is very committed to OLPC .
Everyday he comes with a new idea or a new discovery of how the XOs could foster children 's learning in a more fun way .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
He is fascinated with the laptop and devotes a lot of quality time to the XO within class and after class .
He does small XO activities with the children and guides them through the different phases or lets them find their way on their own , depending ....
He also looks after his students ' laptops .
If there 's a problem with one , he reports it immediately .
He helps get them charged , and the children with no electricity at home get higher priority charging their laptops in class .
( Some go to their neighbors to charge their laptop . )
The teacher also keeps a detailed Journal in a Write file of all the important events since OLPC came to school .
He made his student list on the laptop and was appalled when he lost it because we had n't backed it up on the server .
Our fault .

Older children , teenagers , and villagers
Older children helping student
The first day , which was a Friday , when we were giving a laptop to each child , several children that go to another school farther away because they are older came to Khairat school to help .
They helped register the XO serial numbers with the names of the children , ordering them by groups , and handing out the XOs .
Afterwards , they also helped look over and try out the laptops with the children .
They keep on coming , especially during holidays and Saturdays , but once in a while , some have come even on regular school days .
They pay attention when we work with the teacher and especially when we look into Turtle or eToys .
They even participate during the problem solving part of the activity , which helps understand or reinforce understanding .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
The students
In the student list they are around 22 students , though the first weeks I never saw more than 18 .
Maybe some days some do n't come .
The teacher says that some children that used to miss school often are not missing a single day now .
Though four children still miss school .
Some children who are too shy to talk to the class or to people come often to school , and even if I do n't understand them much , they like to work with me , and they help each other a lot .
We have 11 girls and 11 boys registered .
The girls in 3rd and 4th are the ones who help the 1st and 2nd students a lot .

Harihar taking photos of his book Sarasvati is being called for help Sameera using XO to recording herself singing
The youngest children are always exploring the XOs and are getting very good at it .
There are two siblings , one in 1st standard , who is 5 years old and his sister in 3rd standard .
They both are really good with the laptop .
She helps her classmates because she grasps things fast .
And he likes to do things on his own .
Nevertheless , he also likes people explaining to him how to do new things , but it 's got to be him doing the clicking and key punching .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
Teacher session
Teacher and student
The plan was to just work with the teacher .
However , as soon as he got his students back in school , the teacher started working with them and teaching them how to write their names in English and how to do several other things on the laptops .
Around noon or 1 p. m. , one or two of the students asked for permission to go have lunch .
Even after the teacher told them they could all go home , they stayed all the time we were around .
If their laptops ran out of charge , the children would work with other classmates while theirs were charging or they would sit close to the power outlets to keep on working .
We would work in the mornings before class started or while the children were busy doing something , also on Saturdays , after school .
And one Sunday , the teacher came to the Navi Mumbai offices to work on everything related to the Internet , because at school the connection was super - slow , back then .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
The work with the teacher was on how to best use laptops as a tool to “ learn learning ” by expressing , constructing , designing , modeling , imagining , creating , critiquing , debugging , collaborating with the children , carrying out hands - on activities and project based work , retrieving specific data from the Internet , and publishing content and collaborative production of content on Wiki pages shared on the Internet .
We also went into XO software activity potentials and into applying learning in educational projects that raise children 's awareness about their environment , in a local and global context .
And throughout , we worked on integration of the curricula with the software learning activities , by children and teacher .

Because one of the Third World 's main problems is education , a Wikinews reporter has asked Carla about this question :
Przykuta :
What do you think about education system in India ?
Carla G. Monroy :
The educational system in India is similar to those of many other countries I 've been in .
There are many issues that we have to work on .
However , we can be part of that evolving learning environment .
P : Zana Brisks " Born into Brothels " film show that children have problem with their education , cause their mothers are prostitutes , but they take photos and they want to be photographers .
Do you think that collaboration between OLPC , Kids with Cameras ( children from Zana Briks documentary ) and Wikimedia Foundation ( I think about Wikimedia Commons ) is possible ?
CGM : I have n't seen the documentary .
However , the collaboration between children , the laptops ( which have an integrated camera ) , and some Wiki- solution for sharing content is doable .
P : Media do n't want write about 3rd World 's problems ( too often ) .
How can we change this situation ?
Is it possible ?
CGM : Today , we do n't need the traditional media to document for us .
Each child , teacher , villager , ... with a laptop and connectivity could be a Journalist by posting on a blog , wiki , YouTube , ... just like you ;)
Parents ' meetings
Oct 3 . Mr. Joshi came to Khairat school and organized a small impromptu parents ' meeting .
Few parents came because of such short notice .
Basically , the idea was to explain the project to them and to invite them to take part in the learning of their children .
The teacher explained the potential of the XOs in class and of all the relevant stuff that was now at their children 's fingertips for them to learn or do , to which they had no opportunity before .
When the meeting came to an end , a few of the children 's relatives stayed behind , among them an older sister and a father to see what it was all about .
Though this father had been there the whole morning working with his children , his daughter taught him how to do different things .
The father caught on so fast that he moved over to sit with his son to help him out , which lasted a long time .
When they wanted to do something new , they would ask the sister again to help or whoever was around .
And they continued learning all together .
This father kept on coming , once in a while , in the afternoons to work with his children or with the teacher to learn how to do different things on the laptop .
He also volunteered some land space for the CowPower project ( Arjun ’s alternative design ) .

We had a parents ' meeting [ October 2nd ] one Monday evening .
We had scheduled it for 7 p. m. , but due to a meeting we had at Navi Mumbai we arrived late .
It was already dark , and some parents were waiting for us with flashlights and cell - phones to illuminate our walk down the path .
At the school , there was no other source of light that evening , and everything was pretty dark .
The meeting , however , was wonderful .
The attendance was impressive ( even the teacher said so ) .
Most parents , grandparents , siblings , and other children , even Mr. Deepak , were there , except for Garima , Kamala , and Vinod ’s and Sanjey ’s parents , who had just left because for them it was a long walk in the dark to get to their village and home ) .
Mr. Joshi lead the meeting as representative of our Mumbai Team .

Grounding the server
One Saturday was devoted to ground the server .
It became a community event .
We came with two electricians from Navi Mumbai and the metal plates .
They had started a hole on one side of the school but it was too small , so they started another one in front of it .
The men of the village took turns to dig the hole .
People gathered around to watch , chat , and enjoy the day in each other ’s company .
Children were playing and carrying dirt from one side to another just for fun , and they brought a couple of plants from ‘ somewhere ’ to plant in the first hole .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
After the grounding was done and the electrician had also fixed the wall outlet , the server was turned on .
All the children sat around the server and the villagers that had helped stood at the back , waiting to see what would happen next .
The Linux server started its activity on the black screen and white fonts quickly flashed in one by one and scrolled up .
Everybody patiently waiting .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
XO with Internet connection
We opened and switched on two XOs and they wirelessly connected to the Internet .
With one we explored the OLPC Wiki page , and everybody was very happy to see a photo of Khairat school ’s cymbal on the screen .
Then the teacher looked into some other links and translated for the children and the people around .
Then the Internet signal became too slow .
That was when we realized we needed another Internet solution , since the cell - phone signal was too slow .
— Carla G. Monroy , OLPC Wiki
Every child at school
Since those children were officially registered at Khairat school , we thought they should get their XOs , whether they came to school or not .
However , a little bit of pushing would do them no harm , and it would do them a lot of good if we managed to get them to come to school and discover the joy of working with the OLPC approach .
So we made a plan to invite their parents to our parents ' meeting on Monday .
So first thing Monday , the team split up ( Arjun and Amit went to Mumbai to look for parts and Manu and I went to Khairat school ) .
We picked up the teacher on our way , as usual , and on the way we ran into Deepak , a wise and rich neighbor from that village with some influence on his neighbors .
He went with us to look for them .
After a little while of going down the dirt road , we saw some children running and playing in the field , and the teacher said , there they are .
But by the time we got to their home , nobody was around .
So now I had a better idea of what the teacher meant about the parents and having to chase the children .
We looked for their neighbors , we went inside the houses that were open , but nobody was around .
After a while , one of the older sisters showed up , carrying water on her head , with some of the younger children .
We were told that their mother was doing the laundry , so we went across the fields and walked into the river and upstream until we found her with one of the girls .
The teacher invited them to come to the meeting , and then we walked from there to school .

This article mentions the Wikimedia Foundation , one of its projects , or people related to it .
Wikinews is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation .
Chris Benoit , performing for the Coalition troops at Camp Victory in Baghdad , Iraq
Wikinews has learned through an investigation that anonymous edits on the Wikipedia article Chris Benoit were added about the death of his wife Nancy Benoit 14 hours before police entered the Benoit home to find the former professional World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) Canadian wrestler and his family dead .
An anonymous edit from IP address 69.120.111.23 using the Internet service provider Optimum Online was made at 04:01 UTC on Chris Benoit 's Wikipedia article .
On a paragraph about an earlier fight : " However , Chris Benoit was replaced … due to personal issues , … " , the anonymous editor added " stemming from the death of his wife Nancy . "
The edit was reversed just under one hour later with the comment : " Need a reliable source .
Saying that his wife died is a pretty big statement , you need to back it up with something . "
Then just one hour later after the first edit reversion , another anonymous edit by 125.63.148.173 using unwiredAustralia.com.au , a wireless Internet service provider , was made adding about the aforementioned personal issues : " which according to several pro wrestling websites is attributed to the passing of Benoit 's wife , Nancy . "
That edit was reverted just under 20 minutes later , with the comment : " Saying ' several pro wrestling websites ' is still not reliable information . "
Further investigation shows that the IP address used to make the first edit is located in Connecticut , but the IP address is not linked to any computers or servers used by the WWE , but according to Cary Bass , Volunteer Coordinator for the Wikimedia Foundation , the IP address matches a location in Stamford , Connecticut where the WWE headquarters is located .
Bass also informed the local authorities in Atlanta about the unusual edits , but it is not known if the edits were investigated by the police .
The second edit was made by a computer in Australia from a wireless network .
" It did n't become apparent until someone put the pieces together and realized that the comment was made by someone who apparently knew about the murders , " added Bass .
Fayette County Sheriff deputy Lt. Tommy
Pope stated that police found the family at about 2:30 p.m. ET , which is 18:30 UTC , on Monday when the WWE called police and asked them to do a " welfare check " after employees of WWE received calls and text messages from Chris Benoit .
Early Sunday , Benoit sent repeated text messages that read " My physical address is 130 Green Meadow Lane , Fayetteville Georgia . 30215 . "
Another text message reportedly said " The dogs are in the enclosed pool area .
Garage side door is open . "
The messages were sent around 4:00 a.m. ET .
Earlier , on Saturday afternoon , Chris Benoit placed a series of calls that explained why he missed his flight to Houston .
The stories he told were mostly about his wife and son being sick with food poisoning and vomiting .
Although , in one call he said that he and Nancy were at the hospital to be with Daniel who was hospitalized .
Throughout he insisted that he would attend that live event in Houston .
When he missed the live event on Sunday , and the WWE could n't get hold of him , they contacted authorities .
Police say that Benoit strangled his wife on Friday , smothered his son on late Friday or early Saturday , and then hanged himself inside his weight room on Sunday or Monday .
The Wikinews investigation is unable to conclude whether the anonymous editors had inside information about the death of Nancy Benoit .
This is not the first time Benoit 's article has been edited to show false or unsourced information , as the article 's edit history indicates a long history of promotional spam and vandalism .
Around the time of the edits , the article contained a hidden warning to editors of the section mentioned , warning against adding rumours and speculations .
For the time being , Benoit 's article has been protected in an attempt to stop the addition of fraudulent information .

On its face , if President Bush is totally unapologetic and says I continue to maintain that as a war - time President I can do anything I want — I do n’t need to consult any other branches — that is an impeachable offense .
It ’s more dangerous than Clinton ’s lying under oath because it jeopardizes our democratic dispensation and civil liberties for the ages .

“ Under Dick Cheney , the office of the vice president has been transformed from a tiny acorn into an unprecedented giant oak .
In grasping and exercising presidential powers , Cheney has dulled political accountability and concocted theories for evading the law and Constitution that would have embarrassed King George III .
The most recent invention we know of is the vice president ’s insistence that an executive order governing the handling of classified information in the executive branch does not reach his office because he also serves as president of the Senate .
In other words , the vice president is a unique legislative - executive creature standing above and beyond the Constitution .
The House judiciary committee should commence an impeachment inquiry .
As Alexander Hamilton advised in the Federalist Papers , an impeachable offense is a political crime against the nation .
Cheney ’s multiple crimes against the Constitution clearly qualify . ”

As much as I ’d love a brain - computer interface for controlling game characters or avatars in virtual worlds , there are still a few years until they ’ll be able to analyze our body ’s every move and translate them in real time to machines .
In the meantime , there are other options .
Small and cheap sensors have promise for new machine interfaces that monitor your entire body .
I ’ve played games with floor - pads as controllers , like Dance Dance Revolution .
I ’ll be frank : it sucks .
I ’ve also had a go with Playstation ’s EyeToy .
It sucked too .
The reason they suck is the limited freedom they provide .
In essence , they ’re still stuck in the prison - like dimension of finite button - pushing :
The dance - pads are basically just a joystick you jump on , with the same monotonous button combinations as a typical handheld controller .
Similarly , the EyeToy has extremely limited understanding of what it ’s looking at and thus it basically has to split video input into sectors , where motion in a certain sector basically equals a push of a button .
This gives the EyeToy ’s entertainment value an eerie resemblance to the satisfaction I get from wiping my laptop screen clean .
We Need More Flexible Controls
What I ’m looking forward to are interfaces that give you more dynamic control .
When I first heard of the Nintendo Wii ’s motion - controller ( Wiimote ) I got excited because I envisioned , for example , sword fighting where the slashes of the sword were not pre-determined “ action sequences ” , but real time actions performed by the user swinging the stick .
Unfortunately , while the controller hardware certainly opens up this option — the software implementation is harder and thus the Wii games are still somewhat stuck in the same button - pushing dimension .
But that ’s not to say things are n’t moving along .
Nintendo made a major splash in the non-conventional controller department , and we ’re seeing the effects of this reverberate throughout the commercial world .
Portable media devices like the iPod are also giving wearable machine R&D a kick in the ass ( something like a head - mounted display suddenly has obvious commercial potential for watching movies on your iPod ) .
And then of course , there ’s the constant ongoing research at MIT .
The MIT Whole - Body Sensor Suit
In collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories , they ’ve produced a new kind of suit that can capture the motions of your entire body — and you do n’t need a studio or lab environment to use it .
It even works for people driving or playing ping - pong .
A New Scientist article discusses the suit , explaining how it uses ultra-sonic beeps , gyroscopes and accelerometers :
Several sensors measuring about 2.5 centimetres on each side are attached to a person ’s legs and arms .
The sensors detect movement in two different ways : accelerometers and gyroscopes measure motion , but ultrasonic beeps are also emitted .
Tiny microphones mounted on the torso pick up these beeps , allowing a laptop computer , carried in a backpack , to calculate the distance to the sensor .
The system is similar to , albeit much simpler than , bats ’ ultrasonic echolocation , and together with the motion sensors provides a more accurate overall picture of body movement .
The small backpack also holds the batteries that power the system .
Originally designed to allow MIT students to give Clippy a virtual beating , the system could be utilized for various purposes .
A New Scientist article mentions the potential for making animated movies more realistic and help doctors analyze movements of patients undergoing physical therapy .
The following video was uploaded by the wonderful people at CSAIL , explaining the system and showing it in use .
This is awesome .
Is there anything more to this ?
Yes .
The price .
The NS article quotes Rolf Adelsberger from ETH on that :
The suit was made from off - the - shelf components and is much cheaper than similar systems used in the past .
Currently , it costs about $ 3,000 — but Adelsberger imagines that the price could go down to a few hundred dollars if mass - produced .
Combining Almost - On - the - Market Technologies for the Ultimate Control Suit
What I find very interesting is the prospect of integrating some of these new groundbreaking machine interfaces .
Especially for immersive , 3D environments .
For example , the MIT suit is excellent work — but complemented with a head - mounted display ?
Oh man , that ’s a winning combination right there .
But there ’s still something missing … oh yeah , I ca n’t really use the MIT suit to walk around inside a virtual world :
If I can see and use my entire body , an attempt to make my avatar duck the fiery breath of a dragon would probably leave me with one foot in my cat ’s food - plate and the other on the cat .
So , its use is limited to an immobile , vitruvian sphere , if you will .
No worries , let ’s combine the suit with Project Epoc from Emotiv — a non-invasive brain - computer interface where the system detects user intentions .
Ah - hah , now we ’re getting somewhere :
Using the suit to detect limb motions , a HMD for visuals and the Epoc headgear to track intentions to walk - forward , backwards or turn , we ’ve got ourselves a damn nifty setup .
Additionally , it would n’t be bad if the Epoc headgear detects facial expressions like the Emotiv team claims ( they have n’t released new information for a while , I ’m waiting for some answers in the mail ) .
The only thing that ’d be missing would be force - feedback , but I ’m not aware of any plans to make a commercial product of out of those .
Can you imagine the potential such a suit would give , say , teleconferencing ?
gaming ?
virtual world communities ?
learning Tai Chi ? cybersex ?
Hot stuff .
And here we are , born about 50 years too early .
Waiting for these devices to debut one at a time .
Then waiting for the prices to come down .
Then waiting for someone to combine all the systems into one .
Finally , waiting for the price to come down on the combined system .
Well , I ’m being pessimistic .
Technology is really improving and at an ever increasing rate .
Hell , we were using black and white laptops 15 years ago .
But just in case immersive virtual reality technologies take a while to show up on our doorstep — we ’re making headway in life - extension technologies as well , so no worries .

In the spirit of his generation — the one that brought us extreme sports , and made a mini celebrity out of a blogger who traded a paper clip for a house , and a mega celebrity out of a socialite who went on reality TV to move from job to job in “ The Simple Life ” — Mr. Aiken has begun a most unusual search .
He will try a different job every week for a year .
Depending on your point of view , his extreme job hunt either typifies or parodies his age group .
It all began at the dinner table last year , a few months after Mr. Aiken graduated from Capilano College in North Vancouver , British Columbia , with a degree in business administration .
The son was telling the father ( who took a job as an accountant 30 years ago in the Aiken family ’s hometown of Port Moody , British Columbia ) about wanting to find work about which he was passionate .
“ My father looked at me , ” Mr. Aiken recalled , “ and said , ‘ I ’ve been around 60 years and I ’ve yet to find something I ’m passionate about except your mother . ’ ”
Sobered by that thought , Mr. Aiken hatched his plan to work at 52 jobs in a year and to chronicle the search on a Web site , oneweekjob.com .
He would take no salary for the work , but would encourage his “ employers ” to make a donation to charity .
He spread the word through a mass e-mail message to friends and family and eventually through word of Web .
When offers came in that were far from home , he found a sponsor ( nicejob.ca , a job search Web site ) to pay for his travel , and he slept on the couches of “ co- workers ” and blog readers .
As traffic to his Web site increased , he started taking along his best friend , a filmmaker , to create videos for the site .
The 20 - somethings who turn to One Week Job find in Mr. Aiken “ an ideal of the unstable life , ” says Penelope Trunk , the author of “ The Brazen Careerist ” ( Business Plus , 2007 ) , who blogs and lectures on the transformation of the workplace .
“ He sends the message ‘ job - hopping is O.K. , ’ ‘ moving around is O.K . ’ ”
That is a comforting message , she says , because while Gen Y talks of seeking passion and embracing what is new , that is just brave cover for a less comfortable truth .
“ The reality is they might prefer one job that would last forever and end with retirement , but that kind of job does n’t exist anymore , ” Ms. Trunk says .
“ The alternative , the instability , terrifies them .
Sean Aiken is an example of how uncertainty and constant change can be O.K . ”
It 's not been a good year for God.
Richard Dawkins ’s The God Delusion and Christopher Hitchens ’s God is Not Great have been riding high in the international bestseller lists , while in the US Sam Harris has addressed his Letter to a Christian Nation and Daniel Dennett ’s Breaking the Spell has explored the question of how to explain the irrationality of religious belief .
Michel Onfray ’s
In Defence of Atheism has added a distinctively French tone to the assault , and AC Grayling ’s latest collection of elegant English essays is Against All Gods .
It ’s not surprising that cultural commentators have identified a cultural wave , and given it a label : “ The New Atheism ” .
Then there has been the rush of responses .
Alastair McGrath ’s The Dawkins Delusion and John Cornwell ’s Darwin ’s Angel have replied to Dawkins in particular , and John Humphrys has followed up his radio interviews of religious leaders with a book , In God We Doubt , which is subtitled Confessions of a Failed Atheist ( he ca n’t bring himself to accept religious belief but he thinks it would be nice to be able to do so ) .
My intention here is to stand back a little from this parade of views and counterviews and ask about its implications for the humanist movement .
What can we , as humanists in Britain now , learn from the debate around the New Atheism ?
We should begin by recognising that the “ New Atheism ” is not really new .
Its distinctive themes – religion as the enemy of science , of progress and of an enlightened morality – are in a direct line of descent from the 18th - century enlightenment and 19th - century rationalism .
The “ new ” movement is better seen as a revival , a reassertion of the values of rational thought and vigorous argument .
It has struck people as new because it has given new life to old disagreements and debates and done so with great panache and style .
But we need to beware of fighting old battles in a world which has moved on .
What kick - started the New Atheism was , of course , the attack on the Twin Towers .
That event , and subsequent acts of Islamist - inspired terrorism , reminded the world of the terrible deeds that can be performed in the name of religious fanaticism , especially if it is reinforced by dreams of immediate rewards in paradise .
How to combat Islamist fanaticism is obviously a pressing question .
At the same time , it would be foolish to let our attitudes to all religions and all religious believers be coloured by a small set of specific outrages .
A second development which no doubt reinforced the New Atheism was the resurgence of creationism , on a small scale in the UK and on a scarily large scale in the US .
In the States it ’s linked with the religious right and the malign influence of Christian fundamentalists on politics and government .
Unsurprisingly , it ’s in the US that the New Atheism seems to be taking shape as a cultural movement , not just a publishing success .
Dawkins has launched the “ Out ” campaign , encouraging American atheists to “ come out ” .
The success of these developments is sufficient evidence that they respond to a real need , and they reflect the extent to which American atheists have felt beleaguered .
In some parts of the US it takes courage to come out as an atheist .
But let ’s be honest – in Britain today , for most of us , it ’s a doddle .
This points to the danger of over - generalising about religion and about religious believers .
By far the commonest criticism directed against the New Atheists is that they do over - generalise , and I think that the criticism is justified .
To avoid being guilty of the same mistake myself , I ’ll focus only on the two bestsellers , Dawkins and Hitchens , because their books have done most to generate the larger movement .
They are quite explicit in their desire to generalise about religion .
Dawkins says : “ I do everything in my power to warn people against faith itself , not just against so - called ‘ extremist ’ faith .
The teachings of ‘ moderate ’ religion , though not extremist in themselves , are an open invitation to extremism . ”
And Hitchens is even more frank : his subtitle is “ religion poisons everything ” .
That really is too simple .
In the “ religion ” that Dawkins and Hitchens relentlessly attack I simply do not recognise the many good , sensitive , intelligent and sometimes wonderful religious people I know .
Of course the generalisations are not just crude prejudices , they are considered and they are defended , and we should examine the reasons Dawkins and Hitchens give .
For Dawkins the problem is that all religious believers are committed to faith rather than reason .
He is rightly appalled by the resurgence of creationism , by the fact that many people still reject neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory because it is incompatible with a literal reading of the first chapter of Genesis .
He knows perfectly well that the vast majority of Christians and other religious believers in Britain ( though , worryingly , not in the US ) are not creationists , but he thinks that , just by accepting the idea of “ faith ” , they have sold out .
He says : “ Fundamentalist religion is hell - bent on ruining the scientific education of young minds .
Non-fundamentalist , ‘ sensible ’ religion may not be doing that , but it is making the world safe for fundamentalism by teaching children ... that unquestioning faith is a virtue . ”
So for him the difference between the so - called moderate , sensible religious believers and the fundamentalists is a minor one .
He thinks that the real divide is between science and religion , because science is based on reason and religion is a matter of faith .
In other words it ’s religion as such that is the problem .
Is that right ?
We need to be aware of the ambiguities of the word “ faith ” .
In some cases faith is no more or less than a set of overarching beliefs with which people make sense of the world .
All religions are faiths in the first sense , and so is humanism , though most of us would prefer not to use the word because of its other connotations .
There ’s no necessary opposition between faith in this sense and reason .
But faith can also refer to our readiness to accept beliefs on grounds which are not conclusive .
This covers a range of cases , from a hunch which you think will be confirmed , to a well - founded expectation based on past experience .
A creationist website links to a video clip of Dawkins saying that he has “ faith ” that fossils will be found to fill gaps in the fossil record .
He did n’t mean faith in the creationists ’ sense of believing it without evidence , but it ’s a perfectly legitimate sense of the word – a belief backed by previous experience , for which further confirmation is sought .
And though it ’s not the creationists ’ sense of the word , there are plenty of religious believers who would say that they have faith in this sense .
They ca n’t prove that there ’s a god , so their commitment goes beyond the evidence , but it ’s not unsupported .
Faith is also a way of describing a commitment to a belief which has no rational basis .
Are there religious believers with this sort of unmediated belief ?
Yes , I ’m sure there are , though I suspect that they often play on the ambiguity between that version of faith and the more everyday manner in which we say that we have faith in a person , that we trust them .
I ’m thinking of the evangelical Christians who say things like “ How can I doubt God , since he has saved me , I have this special relationship with him and I trust him with everything in my life . ”
But the general point is that faith means different things for different religious believers , and from the fact that they claim to have faith you ca n’t infer that they are all irrationalists who believe things on “ blind faith ” without any evidence and have therefore sold the pass to the creationists .
Take the case of the many people who both hold a religious belief and accept evolutionary theory .
They value scientific method , they accept the scientific evidence , and they say that the origin of species through natural selection just is the process by which God has created all living things .
The question they then have to answer is : if we ’ve got the scientific account , why do we also need a belief in divine creation ?
They would probably say something like this : the theory of evolution explains how living things have come into existence , but it does n’t explain why there existed , in the first place , a universe suited to lead to the evolution of life .
Many Christians these days are keen on the so - called “ fine - tuning argument ” : that if the basic physical constants had been just slightly different , the Big Bang would not have led to the emergence of galaxies and suns and planets , including at least one planet with the right conditions for the evolution of life .
The initial conditions had to be “ just right ” , and God is the best explanation of why they were .
Dawkins has an excellent reply to this argument .
He argues that whatever the explanation of the initial conditions may be , God is not a good explanation , because the existence of a hugely powerful intelligence who knew all the physical constants and scientific laws is even more difficult to explain than the things it is supposed to account for .
The essential point is one about “ simplicity ” .
Philosophers like Richard Swinburne argue that the best explanation is the most economical one , and explaining the universe by divine intention is the preferred explanation because it is the simplest .
Dawkins rightly points out that this is a confusion .
The explanation in terms of a divine creator may be simply stated , but the entity which is supposed to do the explaining is a highly complex entity , not a “ simple ” one .
I agree with Dawkins .
The argument fails .
But it is still an argument .
As so often , deciding whether an argument succeeds is a matter of judgement – of faith , if you like , in the second sense .
But a mistaken argument is still an argument , still an appeal to reason and evidence .
For a great many religious believers , belief in a god is like that – faith , but not “ blind faith ” .
Dawkins also thinks that it is blind faith that leads to crazy acts of religious fanaticism .
“ Even mild and moderate religion , ” he says , “ helps to provide the climate of faith in which extremism naturally flourishes . ”
He ’s thinking , obviously , of suicide bombers and Islamist terrorists , not to mention Christian extremists who murder abortionists , Hindus who slaughter Muslims , and all the rest of the fanatics .
It was the killing of 3,000 people in the World Trade Centre that was the initial spur for the New Atheism , and for Dawkins it demonstrated that it is not extremism , but religion as such , that is the problem .
That ’s also Hitchens ’s view , and I turn to him now .
His reason for generalising about all religion , for claiming that religion poisons everything , is primarily an appeal to the historical record .
He has no difficulty compiling an appalling catalogue of all the terrible things done in the name of religion .
The Old Testament is full of justifications for massacre and slavery .
The Koran contains incitements to intolerance and the spreading of Islam by force .
In the modern world , in the name of religion , rival groups have been slaughtering one another in the Middle East , Northern Ireland , Yugoslavia , the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere .
People ’s lives are blighted by repressive religious views and practices concerning abortion , contraception , masturbation and genital mutilation .
And the length of the list demonstrates , for Hitchens , that religion poisons everything .
But it 's a selective list , and it ’s not enough to justify the generalisation , since it invites the response : “ What about all the good things done in the name of religion ?
What about all the religious believers who have stood up against political repression , who have worked for peace and tolerance , who have campaigned for justice and against slavery and poverty , and have devoted themselves to improving the lot of their fellow human beings ? ”
Hitchens ’s answer is that if people do these things , it ’s not really their religion that motivates them – “ this is a compliment to humanism , not to religion ” .
The classic example is Martin Luther King , whom Hitchens rightly admires .
King was a committed Christian who used the language of the Old Testament , the language of the “ promised land ” , to inspire the Civil Rights movement .
Hitchens says that this is mere metaphor .
Although King uses the image of Moses leading his people out of Egypt , there is nothing equivalent to Moses ’s exhortation to massacre the other tribes in the land which God had promised to the people of Israel .
King preached non-violence , and did not advocate revenge against white racists .
Therefore , Hitchens infers , he was not a real Christian : “ When Dr King took a stand ... he did so as a profound humanist and nobody could ever use his name to justify oppression or cruelty ... his legacy has very little to do with his professed theology .
...
In no real as opposed to nominal sense , then , was he a Christian . ”
The circularity in Hitchens ’s argument is obvious .
Religion poisons everything .
What about the good things done in the name of religion ?
If they ’re really good , that just shows that they ’re not really religious .
The same circular argument appears in Hitchens ’s discussion of the atrocities generated by secular creeds .
He says of totalitarian societies that because their leaders are regarded as infallible , such states are theocracies and therefore essentially religious .
So the counter - examples simply confirm , for Hitchens , that it ’s religion that poisons everything .
Hitchens ’s appeal to the historical record is what I call the “ headcount ” argument – “ Your lot have killed more people than our lot . ”
It gets us nowhere .
The fact is that human beings are capable of doing terrible things and they are capable of doing wonderful things .
This is true of religious believers , it ’s true of atheists , and it should n’t surprise us .
Religion – here I agree with another of Hitchens ’s persistent themes – is a human creation .
It is , I suggest , a mirror which humanity holds up to itself and in which it sees itself reflected .
Human beings attribute to their gods all their own human qualities – cruelty , revenge and hatred , but also love and compassion and mercy .
That ’s why you can find a justification for anything , good or bad , in religion .
For Dawkins and for Hitchens that is part of the problem .
Religious believers cannot avoid cherry - picking .
They select from their sacred texts whatever fits their prior agenda .
The homophobes pick out the texts from Leviticus or the Koran which order the killing of gays ; their opponents say that this is incompatible with the idea of a god of compassion and tolerance .
The warmongers and jihadists pick out the injunctions to slaughter ; the peacemakers appeal to the contrary texts .
Religions are deeply contradictory , and the application of them will always be selective .
But that is precisely why we should not lump all religious believers together .
Humanism is more than atheism , it is about putting humanist beliefs and values into practice and trying to make the world a better place .
And that is impossible unless we ’re prepared to cooperate with others who share those values , including those for whom the values are inseparable from a religious commitment .
It goes deeper than that .
For many humanists , religious believers are also friends , lovers , colleagues , neighbours , spouses and partners .
The attitude that religion poisons everything is unlikely to be an auspicious basis for such relationships .
We really do need something a bit more nuanced .
And this brings me to my practical conclusion .
If we are serious about our humanist values , we should look for all those who share them , and work with them .
If , according to Hitchens , that means that such people are really humanists after all , then call them that if you wish , but accept that they may also be committed Christians or Muslims or Hindus or Buddhists or whatever .
The labels do n’t matter .
If Christians are happy to defend science against the idiocies of creationism , let ’s work with them .
When the news broke that state schools in this country were teaching creationism as science , Dawkins and Richard Harries , then Bishop of Oxford , issued a joint statement of criticism .
Dawkins has been accused of inconsistency in doing so but it does n’t matter , it was the right thing to do and it was highly effective .
After the most recent attempted suicide bombings in Britain , national newspapers carried a full - page advertisement by Muslim organisations condemning the bombings and dissociating themselves from them .
What are we supposed to say ?
“ You ’re just as bad ” ?
That would be madness .
They need our encouragement , and we need their help .
We have problems enough in the world .
The threats of climate change , global poverty , war and repression and intolerance can never be countered unless we are prepared to work together on the basis of a shared humanity .
Simplistic generalisations about religion do n’t help .
In Dawkins ’s terminology , that means working with the “ moderates ” to counter the “ extremists ” , but it ’s actually more complicated than that .
Some of our allies against creationism may be deeply prejudiced against gays .
Some of the best people working to combat global poverty may be Catholic anti-abortionists .
Some of the Muslim allies we need to counter Islamist violence may have deeply sexist attitudes to women .
It all demonstrates what a deeply contradictory phenomenon religion is .
But we know that .
And if religion is so contradictory , that ’s probably because human beings are a deeply contradictory species .

ED#70 : NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra/GTX/ GTS /GT
Gossip
What a day !
On November 20 , Marcus and I flew over to Singapore to attend an NVIDIA press briefing .
What begun as a well - planned day turned into a mini- disaster when we were told to disembark from the plane .
Apparently , technicians discovered at the last minute that there was a problem with one of the emergency doors .
Worse , the replacement aircraft would only be here three hours later .
When the passengers heard that , quite a few of us broke off and started racing to the transfers desk , ala Amazing Race !
The confusing signage at KLIA caused more than a few of us to almost crash into each other .
In fact , I had to leap over someone else 's trolley to avoid just such a crash !
Unfortunately , the other flights were also full , and so we ended up arriving in Singapore two hours late .
To compound the start of a disastrous day , we discovered that the NVIDIA press briefing was not about a new GeForce 8800 card that many had been hoping for .
Instead , it was about the new Enthusiast System Architecture ( ESA ) and upcoming NVIDIA motherboard chipsets .
ESA is a new open standard on monitor and controlling computer components that NVIDIA is actively supporting .
Initially , it will be used to monitor things like PSU voltage lines , fan speeds , etc. but NVIDIA is hoping it will eventually evolve into something much more significant like a Smart PC where everything is automatically controlled by components that support ESA .
We can't talk about the new NVIDIA chipsets yet , because that 's still under NDA .
And there was absolute no sign of any new NVIDIA graphics card .
However , the event did give us a great opportunity to meet up with our friends from OCWorkbench and VR - Zone , as well as the great folks from NVIDIA .
Anyway , we always get the best stuff during informal chit-chat .
We wo n't reveal who said what or when , but here are some juicy tidbits for you guys to chew on :
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS
There will be a refresh of the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 640MB .
However , it wo n't be based on the G92 , but an improved version of the G80 GPU .
The new NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS will have a soft launch on December 3 , 2007 with market availability only two weeks later , from December 17 onwards .
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT
Supply issues with the GeForce 8800 GT cards ( and their inflated prices ) will end by early December .
The 256MB GeForce 8800 GT actually had a soft launch two weeks ago , but the first cards will only be available by the end of this month , or early December .
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTX & Ultra
There wo n't be any refresh of these two models , at least not in 2007 .
One of their built - in feature will differentiate them from the other models when the new NVIDIA chipsets are launched .
This will keep them desirable , at least to enthusiasts with deep pockets .
The G80 variant used in the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra is known internally as the G80 + .

We also look at the question of whether the impact of Hurricane Katrina may have hidden the real peak in world oil production .
We find that if an adjustment is made for hurricane impacts , the peak month of production seems to be December 2005 on a crude and condensate basis , and September 2005 on an all liquids basis .
The higher adjusted peaks , and greater declines since the adjusted peaks , further suggest that we may be post - peak .
In this post , we use a graphical approach for analyzing oil production since 2001 .
This analysis shows that more and more countries are showing declining oil production , and that this decline in production is not being offset by increases in production elsewhere .
If this pattern continues , this analysis suggests that we may already be past the peak in world oil production .
In this post , I collaborate with Matt Mushalik from Sydney , Australia .
Matt is a civil engineer , town and regional planner , peak oil advisor , and member of ASPO Australia .
Most of the ideas in the post are Matt's .
I have added a little to the analysis , particularly in the area of the Katrina impact .
What Does Figure 1 Show ?
One way of analyzing crude oil production is in terms of how much production has increased or decreased in recent years .
To get a visual picture of this , Matt has prepared graphs of what he calls incremental crude oil production for various groupings of countries .
Figure 1 shows incremental crude oil production for January 2001 - June 2007 using EIA data .
The data used in Figure 1 is developed as follows :
(1) For each country , Matt finds the minimum monthly production in the period 2001 - June 2007 and subtracts this minimum from each monthly production to arrive at an incremental production relative to the minimum .
For example , for the United States , the incremental oil production is the area in dark red on Figure 2 .
The data used in the analysis is EIA " crude plus condensate " data .
(2) Note that the amount in the " base " is determined by the minimum , and not the first month .
If the first month were used , this would result in positive and negative areas which cannot be stacked to give a useful production profile .
Also note that when the bases plus the incremental amounts are stacked , as in Exhibit 1 or 2 , in total we get back to the full amount of crude for the appropriate grouping .
(3) For each country , the size of the area on the graph is proportional to the variation in production for the period under consideration .
This is a measure for the size of the impact changes have had on the overall production profile , both positive and negative .
The US , for example , had only a decline of around 600 thousand bpd , if one excludes the impact of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
The big drop in production after Katrina causes the US layer to be much " thicker " .
(4) Matt then sorts countries into following groups , from bottom to top in the graph :
( a) US ( Figure 2 , shown above )
( b) " Post Peak " grouping : Indonesia , Egypt , Syria , Gabon , Argentina , Colombia , Australia , Oman , Yemen , Denmark
( c) North Sea : UK and Norway

What Can We Learn From the Graphs ?
( Matt and Gail )
This is a repeat of Figure 1 , so you do n't have to scroll up :
If a person looks at the black line , and the production beneath the black line , one thing that stands out is the extent of the decline since early 2005 .
Production for this group of countries is now about 3.8 million barrels a day lower than it was in May 2005 .
This decline equates to a decline of about 1.8 million bpd per year for these countries .
One reason for the large decline is the increasing number of countries that are now post peak , including the countries in the Peak 8/2005 and the Peak 9/2006 groups .
This annual decline of 1.8 million bpd can be broken down to about .6 million bpd annual decline relating to the countries Nigeria , Iraq , and Saudi Arabia ( combined ) , and about 1.2 million bpd for other countries below the black line .
One might argue that the production of Nigeria , Iraq , and Saudi Arabia ( Figure 8 ) is not necessarily in long - term decline , so should not be below the black line .
Since the production for these countries has recently declined , it is shown in this group .
What is offsetting this decline in oil production below the black line ?
Figure 9 shows a graph of the increases in production for all of the growing countries ( the countries above the black line in Figure 1 ) .
This group of countries has been increasing its production by an average of about 1.2 million bpd a year .
While this is good , it is not enough to keep up with the decline in production of about 1.8 million bpd per year of the declining group of countries .
Clearly , if the mismatch between increases and declines continues , a long - term decline in world crude oil production can be expected .
If this happens , world oil production is past its peak .
If a person looks only at the group of countries that are currently level or declining , the overall rate of decrease in production has recently been 4 % per year .
This suggests that some day , world production may decrease by something in the range of 4 % per year , once there is little new production being added .
If there are many offshore wells ( which tend to have high decline rates ) , or if there are above ground issues ( like hoarding ) , the decline rate could be much higher than this .
Where is there a possibility for change ?
One possible change is in the countries shown in Figure 8 - Iraq , Saudi Arabia , and Nigeria .
If their production can be increased , it could eliminate the recent 0.6 million bpd per year decline , and possibly even increase production .
At this point , there is no evidence of this happening , however .
Another possible change is in China and Russia .
These are the countries with the greatest oil production in the growing group .
Many are forecasting that their production will begin to decline in the next few years .
If this happens , the mismatch between countries with increases and decreases will be worse , leading to more of an overall decline .
Another issue is whether the Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan can continue to grow at the rate they have in the recent past .
The capacity of the BTC pipeline ( 1 million bpd ) and of other infrastructure are limiting factors in bringing oil to the market .
Thus it is not clear their high rate of growth in the past can continue very long into the future .
Impact of Hurricane Katrina ( and Rita ) ( Matt and Gail )
The graphs of EIA oil production we are used to looking at are distorted by the impact of Hurricane Katrina ( August 23 , 2005 ) and Hurricane Rita ( September 2005 ) .
Figure 2 above indicates that these hurricanes clearly had an impact on US crude oil production .
What happens if we make an adjustment for this impact ?
Figure 10 shows an estimate of the extent of the impact of these hurricanes .
Since it is not possible to distinguish which hurricane , we call this the Hurricane Katrina adjustment .
The adjustment shown on Figure 10 applies to crude and condensate .
It is also possible to use a similar approach to calculate an adjustment to all liquids .
With these adjustments , one can then approximate what world oil production would have looked like , in the absence of the hurricanes .
The revised graphs are shown in Figure 11 .
The numeric amounts corresponding to the production amounts used in Figure 11 are shown in Figure 12 .
With these adjustments , the peak moves to late 2005 , on both a " crude and condensate " and an " all liquids " basis .
On a crude and condensate basis , the peak was December 2005 , so perhaps Kenneth Deffeyes was correct after all .
On an all liquids basis , the peak month appears to be September 2005 .
With these adjusted peaks , the June 2007 crude amount is 1.90 million bpd below peak and the all liquids is 1.37 million bpd below peak .
These adjustments make a stronger case that ( apart from the hurricanes ) production in late 2005 was the true peak , and we are now on a declining slope .
What Should We Do Now ? ( Matt )
One of the things we need to do now is monitor the data , and confirm the 2005 peak in world oil production .
We cannot know whether this peak was a geological peak per se , or whether there were other factors , such as geopolitical feed back loops involved .
Besides confirming the 2005 peak , it is time ( and past time ) for governments to take action .
I strongly recommend that governments set aside oil and gas fields for the sole purpose of serving as an energy input into all those projects which are required to :
(A) Mitigate the impact of peak oil ( e.g. rail development )
( B) De-carbonize our economies ( e.g. renewable energy systems )
If this is not done immediately , all these projects may get stuck in diesel shortages .
In the worst case scenario , peak oil may damage our economy and financial system to such an extent that we no longer have the strength to decommission and replace our coal fired power plants .
The result of all of this could be a different planet Earth ( 2 - 3 degree Celsius warming , sea level rises , and crop failures , as warned by NASA climatologist James Hansen ) .
Hansen writes in his latest paper Global Warming : East - West Connections :
The Earth ’s history provides a sobering perspective on prospects for climate change .
The Earth ’s climate is sensitive to changes in climate forcings , human - made forcings now overwhelm natural climate forcings , and the climate system is dangerously close to tipping points that could have disastrous consequences .
Atmospheric composition is now near the limits that must not be exceeded if we wish to maintain a planet resembling the one on which civilization developed , with the equable climate of the Holocene .
How urgent action on global warming is will be seen when the summary IPCC report comes out in November .
Tim Flannery , author of the book " The Weathermakers " and Australian of the year , informed us about new data presented in this report in an interview with the Australian public broadcaster ABC TV :
TIM FLANNERY : .....
We thought we'd be at that threshold within about a decade , we thought we had that much time .
But the new data indicates that in about mid 2005 we crossed that threshold .
So as of mid 2005 , there was about 455 parts per million of what 's called carbon dioxide equivalent .
And that 's a figure that 's gathered by taking the potential of all of the 30 greenhouse gases and converting them into carbon dioxide potential , so we call it CO2 equivalent .
So 2005 seemed to have been the tipping point year both on peak oil and global warming .
To close on a more positive note , here is an example from the Australian city of Perth how to prepare for peak oil .
The mass transit authority Transperth has built a rail line on the median strip of 2 freeways .
Park &
Ride facilities as well as bus interchanges at stations allow long distance commuters access to the rail line from low density suburbs .
Perth has also introduced TravelSmart , individualized marketing , bringing together various modes of transport including car pooling and cycling .
According to Landscaping Sydney , professional landscaping your property can pay dividends , especially if it is done by a professional .
Not only will it increase the sales potential and value of your home , if done properly , landscape design can save a great deal on the costs of water , fertilizer and losing plants .
How ?
A professional can ensure your plants are suited to the area and that they are in a position in the garden that suits them best .
Placing shade - lovers in a dry , sunny position and sun lovers in the shade is a recipe for plant loss .
And it happens more often than you may imagine simply because we purchase plants that appeal to us in looks , not to suit the garden we have .
Choosing the right plants in vital .
Some of us also tend to stick plants in the garden wherever there is a spare space and we do n’t think about their watering needs .
Some plants will rot away if they get too much water while others thrive on it .
Put the two close together and one of them is not going to survive .
The same applies when it comes to fertilisers .
Some plants prefer one type while other plants do n’t like any or not so much .
Australian natives especially , do n’t thrive if they have a lot of fertiliser , so if they are planted with anything that is known as a gross feeder – that is , it likes a lot of fertiliser – then one of the two is not going to thrive and indeed , is likely to die off completely .
Landscape design can also be environmentally friendly when the whole property is designed to retain natural rainwater by placing garden beds in a location to catch the run-off , by terracing and by planting water lovers in damp spots .
Automated watering systems that have sensors to indicate when watering is needed can save on the use and cost of water .

Box office analysts Media By Numbers say the $ 4bn figure outclasses summer ticket sales of $ 3.95 bn ( £ 1.95 bn ) set in 2004 .
Their estimates suggest that this summer 's box office returns will stand at $ 4.15 bn ( £ 2.05 bn ) by the time the season officially ends on 3 September .
But they added that actual summer ticket sales are expected to be about 606 m , only the sixth - best in modern times .
The best season in recent times was in 2002 , when 653.4 m cinema tickets were sold .
" Whether it be sequels , originals , comedies or action movies , this particular mix of films brought in audiences in a record - breaking way , " said Paul Dergarabedian , Media By Numbers president , referring to the summer 's cinematic offerings .

When Facebook Apps Go Wrong
I had been an avid Facebook user for over an year , but I ’ve been reconsidering after the launch of Facebook Apps .
The days when all Facebook offered was Photos , Groups , Events , Notes , and Posted Items were simple times .
Today we ’ve got over 450 + photo , 400 + music , 450 + video , 1000 + gaming , and 1000 + sports applications .
And that ’s nothing , as of now , Facebook is less than 200 short of reaching 10,000 pointless applications !
Do n’t get me wrong , there are plenty of useful apps , but for the most part the majority of these tools are useless .
Having to deal with hundreds of application invitations every time I login has become quite painful .
For example , why on earth would anyone need a Top Friends list or a Super Wall when Facebook already has a fully functioning friends list and wall ?
Facebook seriously needs to implement an option to allow users to opt - out or block some of these applications .
IMAGES REMOVED
The next most horrendous part is how long it ’s starting to take to load some people ’s profiles and how lengthy they have become .
Just to give everyone an glimpse of how bad Facebook can get , take a look at four images provided above .
I created temporary Facebook Profile and added the first 20 pages of the most popular Apps .
The page was in fact so long that I could n’t even generate a single screen shot .
Fortunately I have n’t run into anyone ’s profile that was this bad , but it is definitely going in that direction .
Facebook should maybe consider placing a limit on the amount of applications a user can have active at a time .
Hopefully the folks over at Facebook will spend time fixing up the mess they made by launching Facebook Applications instead of wasting resources on other projects like Facebook Ads .

New liquids capacity with first oil in each year as estimated from Petroleum Review megaproject reports ( last available estimate in each case ) , and interim estimates from Wikipedia table as of December 10th , 2007 .
Error bars on Petroleum Review figures are as documented in Is the Decline of Base Production Accelerating .
The Wikipedia Oil Megaprojects task force ( Khebab , Ace , and I ) has been busy over the last few weeks .
With some assistance from helpful strangers , we have been ploughing through press releases and annual reports , adding projects to the Wikipedia page on Oil Megaprojects .
I introduced this project two weeks ago , and today I want to give an interim progress report .
As of now , we 've reached about 350 citations used in collating the information .
I have mainly been working on the past - the years 2003 - 2006 - while the years from 2007 onwards have mainly been handled by Ace and Khebab ( though there is some crossover both ways ) .
The 2003 -2006 projects , of which there are currently 108 , depend on about 140 citations .
In attempting to assure completeness and quality of the list , I have reviewed the 2003 - 2006 annual reports , and / or all press releases , for the following companies :
Anadarko
Apache
BHP Billiton
BP
Chevron
ConocoPhillips
Deer Creek
Encana
Eni
ExxonMobil
Hess
Kerr-McGee
Kuwait Oil Company
OPEC upstream investment plans
Petrobras
Repsol
Saudi Aramco
Shell
Talisman
Total
Unocal
I still have on my list to work through these companies :
Woodside
Nelson
Statoil
Tanganyika
Yukos
Nexen
Naftiran
ADCO
ADNOC
Santos
Husky
CNR
Pemex
Gazprom
QP
Sasol
Petronas
Norsk Hydro
Petrodar
Lukoil
AED
Devon
Murphy
Marathon
AWE
Rosneft
NMNG
NIOC
PDVSA
Coogee
El Paso
CNOOC
Reliance
OMV
PDO
Surgutneftegaz
First Calgary
Maersk Oil
Hoang Long Joint
Sinopec
Cairn
Dominion
Barrett
Premier
Burlington
Sonatrech
Petrofac
Korean National Oil Company
PetroCanada
Although the second list may look much bigger than the first , it 's not as bad as it seems .
I 've generally gone after the largest companies first ( eg I 've done all the majors and OPEC 's project list ) .
Also , most projects involve 2 - 6 companies , so a lot of projects turn up early incompany 's portfolio .
At this stage , each new company I look at only adds an average of one smallish project to the list .
I doubt there are many very large ( over 100 kbd ) projects left to find .
Nonetheless , it should be clear that all conclusions from this data are preliminary and may need to be revised as the exercise continues .
So far , it is producing pretty big revisions to our idea of new capacity added in recent years .
Here 's the evolution of 2003 , for example :
New oil liquids capacity with first oil in 2003 as estimated from Petroleum Review MegaProject report in Jan 2004 , and estimate from Wikipedia table as of November 24th , 2007 , and as of December 10th , 2007 .
The revisions for 2004 are not quite as dramatic , but still significant :
New oil liquids capacity with first oil in 2004 as estimated from Petroleum Review MegaProject report in Jan 2004 , and estimate from Wikipedia table as of November 25th , 2007 , and as of December 10th , 2007 .
Overall , the situation across 2003 to 2008 looks like this :
New liquids capacity with first oil in each year as estimated from Petroleum Review megaproject reports ( last available estimate in each case ) , and interim estimates from Wikipedia table as of December 10th , 2007 .
Error bars on Petroleum Review figures are as documented in Is the Decline of Base Production Accelerating .
As you can see , all years have been revised up , but to varying degrees .
The overall trend of rising new capacity is intact , but it 's somewhat less pronounced .
I put the error bars that I computed in Is the Decline of Base Production Accelerating ?
They were based on the variance of estimates within the different Megaproject reports .
Clearly that understated the sampling issues with those reports ; the Wikipedia table estimates are mostly outside those error bars , and will likely grow further .
It 's worth stressing that the above graph is peak capacity of projects , but tabulated by the year they first deliver any oil ( at least for the Wikipedia totals - it's not quite clear what procedure Petroleum Review used to get totals ) .
We really would like to see what it looked like when convoluted with an estimate of the composite production ramp - up .
We 'll get to that , but I do n't have a reasonable sample of projects on which to base such an exercise yet .
The wave of oil in 2008 is a prominent feature of the tables at present , and I 'm sure will give great comfort to late - peakists .
It 's perhaps a bit premature to put too much store in it yet .
The years 2007 , and especially 2008 are different from 2003 - 2006 in several important ways .
One is that they 've been largely compiled by different people , and the process might be at different stages of completeness .
The other is that 2008 project schedules could still incorporate a certain amount of hope likely to be dashed by the usual complications that enter into all project schedules as they make contact with the real world .
So some fraction of 2008 projects , and a much smaller fraction of 2007 projects , will get delayed .
The past is less subject to unexpected delays ...
Here 's the split of the current estimates of new capacity between OPEC and Non-OPEC :
New liquids capacity with first oil in each year : interim estimates from Wikipedia table as of December 10th , 2007 split between OPEC and the rest of the world .
Note that Angola joined OPEC in January 2007 , so Angola projects are accounted as non-OPEC in 2003 - 2006 , but as OPEC after that .
One could tell a story about how OPEC was slower to respond to higher prices , but is now starting to engage in a lot more capacity expansion projects .
Whether this impression will survive completion of the lists is unclear .
Also , the fact that Angola joined OPEC in Jan 2007 exaggerates the apparent effect slightly .
Finally , for the 2003 - 2006 projects in the Wikipedia tables , I repeated an exercise I did for the 2006 - 2010 projects in the 2007 Petroleum Review Megaproject report .
That is , I sorted all the projects by size , and then calculated the cumulative capacity from the largest down to each project .
Essentially this gives the effect of cutting off project tabulation at each size .
Here are the those two curves :
New liquids capacity with first oil in each year , cumulative capacity by size of lower project cutoff .
Petroleum Review estimates are for 2007 - 2010 projects .
Wikipedia interim estimates from Wikipedia table as of December 10th , 2007 for years 2003 to 2006 .
The two curves are not tabulating the same projects .
The fact that the two curves extrapolate to different points on the axis is not meaningful : they are not attempting to tabulate the same projects , so there is no reason to expect them to asymptote to the same point on the Y - axis .
However , the fact that they approach it at the same slope is pretty intriguing and seems worthy of further exploration as the data becomes more complete .
One caution : I started my compilation with the largest companies , which might well have produced a bias to tabulating larger projects over smaller ones .
Finally , this stuff is a lot of work , so I 'd like to repeat my appeal : the more folks in the TOD community head over to the Wikipage and help , the faster we 'll know what 's really going on here .
Taking part in a televised debate can be a make - it - or - break - it moment for any presidential candidate .
But what if you ’re not allowed to debate at all ?
A diabolical Catch - 22
As many of you are aware , not all candidates are allowed to debate in a given broadcast debate .
This has been a problem for years .
During the last presidential election both the Libertarian and Green party candidates were actually arrested trying to get into a debate they had been explicitly banned from !
Most candidates are excluded from the debate simply because the Media ( big M ) deems them minor / unknown / unpopular candidates .
Well , of course they ’re unknown ; they ’re not allowed to debate on national TV !!
Bit of a Catch - 22 , would n’t you say ?
A most insidious and foul Catch - 22 , I would say .
Here ’s why :
We supposedly live in a democracy .
It ’s not really a democracy , it ’s a republic ( that ’s a story for another day ) , but we like to pretend that the people really have a say .
The hidden reality is that the bosses of the major television stations are making decisions that define the course of our nation , and they ’re doing it from private boardrooms sequestered on the 100th floor of a skyscraper , and there ’s nothing any of us can do about it because they are n’t elected or accountable to anybody but the company ’s shareholders — ya know … other rich people .
Why should the CEO of CNN have such power ?
Why should he ( and it ’s almost certainly a he ) determine who will and wo n’t be the next president of the United States before the people ever get a chance to vote in a primary ?
Is n’t that censorship ?
Is n’t that more like an oligarchy than a democracy ?
Why do we let them get away with it ?
Well , until recently most people did n’t even know about the problem .
And we did n’t have the power to make a difference anyway .
But things are changing .
Social Media saves the day
Social Media has finally offered regular people like you and me a voice .
Sites like Digg , while not perfect , have enabled users to vote ( you know , like a democracy ) on what stories they think are worthy .
Two candidates , Ron Paul and Mike Gravel , owe most of their young supporters to the users of two social media sites : Digg and Reddit .
Without those two sites neither candidate had a hope in hell of cracking the oligarchy and getting significant , objective coverage by the mainstream media ( MSM ) .
Why does the media censor and ostracize certain candidates ?
The candidates that find themselves locked out of televised debates tend to have a few things in common :
They tend to be unpopular or unknown ( but that is not always the case ) .
Their campaigns are usually poorly funded ( maybe because it ’s hard to raise funds if you get no coverage ) and sometimes they have views that are contrary to the political mainstream .
But sometimes the political mainstream is very much at odds with the desires of the voting public .
A perfect example is the continued prohibition of cannabis ( you know : “ marijuana ” ) , an issue on which the politicians are most definitely out of step with most of America , which favors medicinal pot by an astonishing 78 % margin .
Net candidate Mike Gravel recently came out in support of legalizing cannabis , which he says should be for sale in liquor stores .
For a mainstream , “ media - approved ” candidate , such a position would be political suicide .
Why ?
Perhaps the media has been shaping our political landscape for such a long time nobody can even remember a time when they were n’t .
Perhaps there are certain forces at work behind the scenes that determine what is considered politically acceptable and what is considered “ extremist . ”
It ’s hard not to see the media as a controlling , suppressing force when they blatantly censor certain candidates .
Ron Paul ’s performance in the recent Republican debate at the Reagan Library was hailed by many observers , but when it came time to review the field and do some analysis ABC News made a curious omission : Ron Paul .
He was n’t even available as an option for viewers to vote for .
He was n’t mentioned anywhere in David Chalain ’s analysis .
If not for a web uprising ( involving Digg and Reddit ) Ron Paul would probably still be excluded .
When ABC finally backed down ( after deleting a storm of comments asking , “ Where ’s Ron ? ” )
Ron Paul ran away with a landslide victory in the online poll .
The numbers are incredible ( and no doubt skewed by a reaction to the censorship ) .
Paul clearly has a massive groundswell of public support ….
but in the corporate realm he has apparently earned only hand - waving dismissal and contempt .
What are we supposed to think of this ?
When there are 10 candidates at a debate and viewers are only allowed to vote for 9 of them is that not censorship ?
Is that not electioneering by a major corporation ?
And when they back down and include the suppressed candidate and he wins the poll , how do they respond ?
They write an article in which they find people to scratch their heads and say , “ who knows how this Ron Paul got popular .
Must be sumthin ’ to do with them internets . ”
Then they conclude he has no chance of winning and that this is just an exercise in teenage rebellion ( or something ) and wave their hands , content that they will never have to talk about him again .
Democratic candidate Mike Gravel has experienced the exact same treatment , but on the other side of the aisle .
Gravel and Paul are both painted as “ extremists ” within their respective parties , so we ’d can conclude that Paul is a right - wing extremist and Gravel is a left - wing extremist , right ?
Not quite .
Both candidates are populists , espousing “ common sense ” positions that many average Americans hold , but which are not endorsed by many mainstream politicians .
Both are opposed to the Iraq War ( and always were ) , both question Prohibition , both are wary of a pre-emptive strike against Iran and both are suspicious of the corporate media that excludes them from debates .
In short , they have a lot in common with the public they are trying to represent .
Meanwhile , the Media ’s favorite Republican candidate , Rudy Giuliani , goes around saying fascist shit like this :
We see only the oppressive side of authority .
Maybe it comes out of our history and our background .
What we do n’t see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want , be anything they can be .
Freedom is about authority .
Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do . [
Interruption by someone in the audience . ]
You have free speech so I can be heard .
Is that what most Americans believe ?
Was n’t America founded by overthrowing the “ lawful authority ” of the British ?
And this “ Freedom is about authority ” stuff sounds like a parody of George Orwell ’s 1984 … but Rudy was being serious !
“ You have free speech so I can be heard ” ?!!
Saturday Night Live could n’t parody Rudy any better than he does himself .
Which candidate is really an “ extremist ” ?
Which candidate is fundamentally out - of - line with the thinking of mainstream America ?
Well , maybe America really does want fascism instead of freedom , but the noise on the internet would seem to indicate otherwise .
Media Control and Manipulation
It seems like ancient history now , but it was actually the recent past when the mainstream media controlled every avenue of information and expression in this country .
Nowadays we can talk about these things and send our message out to a wide audience , but as recently as 12 years ago it simply was not possible for a middle class person to route around the MSM .
Suddenly most people can afford machines that are more powerful than a printing press , and allow common people to talk to each other without the Media ’s filter .
That ’s why the Media is so upset about blogging and social media — they ’re so used to having an absolute stranglehold over the conversation in this country .
The Media is used to controlling :
what information citizens receive
what information citizens are allowed to share with one another on the national stage
discussion and framing of issues in mainstream press
which issues receive national coverage ( and which are ignored )
who gets to talk about the issues in the press ( and who does n’t )
how political actors are portrayed ( villain or hero or neutral )
Social Media smashes that control grid and puts power in the hands of the many , rather than the few .
This is a recent development so the full ramifications are not yet clear , but one thing we are finding out is that the Media has been using their incredible power to highlight certain candidates and suppress others .
The media has a paternalist streak that is really out of place in this day and age .
The Washington Post thinks they know best and they are n’t afraid to tell you that they already know Gravel & Paul are not going to be elected , so why do n’t we just eject them from the debates already ?
The Democratic debate in South Carolina featured eight candidates , while 10 crammed into the GOP debate in California last Thursday .
Voters trying to sort out their presidential choices are n’t helped by debates cluttered with the likes of Mike Gravel ( hint : he ’s a former senator from Alaska ) on the Democratic side and Ron Paul ( hint : he ’s a libertarian House member from Texas ) among the Republicans .
Thank goodness for our dear corporate masters .
If they did n’t come in any set things straight we ’d have to learn somebody ’s name and what they stand for .
MY GOD !
The very idea exhausts me .
Sarcasm aside , this sort of thing has been going on for generations .
That ’s why an editorial like the one above does n’t seem odd to them ; this is standard operating procedure !
The Media has identified the candidates they do n’t like ( the ones that are n’t easily bought / co - opted ) and now they ’ve decided to tell you , Dear Voter , than you need n’t concern yourself with these troublesome miscreants .
Big Media will make things simple for you by excluding them .
… But wait a minute .
Is n’t this a democracy ?
Do n’t the voters decide who is voted off the proverbial island ?
Well , now you know better .
That is not the way America works .
America is run by a ruling class of oligarchs no different than the ones who control Russia .
The difference is the American media freely admits that oligarchs run Russia , but they would sooner give their mansions to the poor than admit America is the same .
The exact reverse scenario plays out in Russia where the Russian ( government / oligarch - controlled ) media is free to disparage America and mock its corrupt institutions , while speaking ill of Russia is a good way to get your broadcasting license revoked .
The awful truth is that America has long been controlled by the rich , just like most nations throughout history .
They have remade American society and government to suit themselves and they have grown very comfortable on their throne .
What is an Oligarchy ?
Stephen Fleischman , himself a former mainstream media man , tackles the reality of the Oligarchy in an article for Counterpunch :
My dictionary says an oligarchy is a form of government where most or all political power effectively rests with a small segment of the society .
As Wikipedia , the popular online encyclopedia , puts it , “ Oligarchies are often controlled by a few powerful families whose children are raised and mentored to be heirs of the power of the oligarchy , often at some sort of expense to those governed . ”
Does that sound like the administration of George W. Bush ?
Why , yes it does !
That must be a weird coincidence .
… right ?
I wish I could tell you more about the Oligarchy , but it operates in secret and prefers that most citizens do not even know it exists .
In fact , by using the mainstream media the Oligarchy is able to program us so that even if we are provided with irrefutable evidence of the existence of said Oligarchy , many will still deny it and disbelieve it .
You ’re probably wondering “ How ? ! ”
Have you ever been called a “ conspiracy theorist ? ”
Well , it tends to end any meaningful discussion of the facts and immediately puts the onus on the accused to defend himself from the charge leveled at him .
The Media has a few “ magic words ” like this at their disposal .
It ’s amazing how effective they can be .
Nobody wants to be called a conspiracy theorist … but is n’t that just an ad hominem attack ?
It ’s no different than calling someone a poopy - head .
I suspect there may be more to it than that .
In a future post I ’ll look into how the Oligarchy exploits its control of the media for fun and profit .
What should we do about it ?
At a certain point we in the ‘ net community need to stand up and say , “ To hell with you guys .
We ’re hosting our own debate and we ’ll invite everybody ! ”
We ju
st need to set up a website with a group of people dedicated to hosting the cyber - debate ; we ’ll get some buzz going and then what candidate will say “ no ” to a chance to get his / her message out to such an elusive audience ?
The media ca n’t be trusted to define , design and delineate the ground rules for our national debate .
Candidates are having trouble getting their message across because of the media ’s filter .
It ’s time to cut out the middle man .
VIETNAM REDUX ….
Are we really going to be forced to seriously debate George Bush ’s Rambo - esque notion that we could have won in Vietnam if only we ’d stuck it out a little longer ?
Let ’s check out what ’s happening on the left and the right .
On the right : the Weekly Standard has posted not one , not two , but three separate pieces — two by idiot savant David Gelernter — that have been hauled up from the archives .
Verdict : you bet your ass we could have won in Vietnam .
National Review also has three pieces on the same theme , and Peter Rodman ’s pretty clearly wins the Wingnut History award for the day .
He ’s not content merely to suggest that the United States could have won in Vietnam — a trope that ’s common enough on the right — but claims that this is practically a “ consensus ” among military historians .
That ’s chutzpah !
Move along boys , nothing left to argue about here .
And on the left ?
Nothing at the New Republic .
Nothing at the Nation .
Nothing at the American Prospect .
There are two possibilities here .
The first , and happier one , is that lefties and the rest of the mainstream are simply going to ignore the frothing on the right and allow them to burble meaninglessly among themselves about this .
The rest of us will decline the invitation to get distracted and instead spend our time on actual adult issues .
The second , less happy notion , is that the right is , as usual , merely reacting faster than the left .
Liberals will respond , they ’ll just do it several days or a week too late , thus not only looking lame , but actually extending the lifespan of this trumped up “ controversy . ”
All things considered — and I say this with some sadness — the left really needs to react .
The president has spoken , after all .
But if that ’s the case , ca n’t we react a little faster ?
And would n’t it be nice if Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama responded immediately with a serious speech taking on the president ’s fantasies ?
Or am I just having fantasies of my own ?
DIGG THIS
President Bush is disdained by seven in ten Americans .
That 's bad enough , but only one in five Americans believe Congress is doing a good job .
Most of us believe our government is the best one money can buy , and that it benefits those who spend the most to buy it .
We are right .
Campaign finance laws wo n't fix the problem by limiting political speech .
Busting the occasional crooked Senator or Representative is n't making the underlying problem any better .
Electing new crooks wo n't repair government .
Is there any hope for putting government back on the right track ?
Yes , we can put the people in charge .
Although politicians always pay lip service to the people being sovereign , their actions speak louder than their words .
If the people were in charge , the drug wars would be ended , personal accounts for Social Security and medical savings would exist , the war in Iraq would be over , the income tax would end and other taxes would be lower .
But the people are n't in charge and Congress is n't about to pass any sort of National Initiative legislation that would put the people in charge .
Why should they , since they know it will mean the end of their ability to pass out goodies to the people who buy influence ?
The solution is to use the Bill of Rights to let the people decide !
The First Amendment guarantees the people the right to petition their government to resolve grievances and to freely assemble — that 's exactly what an election is .
The Ninth and Tenth Amendments reserve any power not delegated to the central government by the Constitution to the states and the people .
Using those rights the people can enact Legislation — a Constitutional Amendment and a Federal Statute as a package called the National Initiative — by a majority vote of the people eligible to vote in the United States .
Once about sixty million of us vote in a fair election on a measure that has a Ratification provision similar to that used to ratify the United States Constitution , the National Initiative will become the law of the land .
The National Initiative creates the machinery to enable the people to act as a legislative body adding a fourth branch of government while leaving the first three in place , essentially adding a fourth check to our three existing checks and balances .
You can vote today to empower yourself at www.ni4d.us
Check it out .
I am running for President to draw attention to this way of solving the problems that have made our government dysfunctional , led to a stifling federal bureaucracy , oppressive taxes and foreign wars .
Whether you agree or disagree , you must admit that this is at minimum a creative way to break the partisan gridlock funded by special interests in search of special privilege .
Let the people decide !

All thirteen subpoenaed congressmembers refuse to provide documents , testimony in bribery case
A subpoena - happy Congress is n't happy about receiving subpoenas of their own .
Acting on advice of the House general counsel , all 13 members of Congress who have been subpoenaed for documents and testimony by the lawyer for a man accused of bribing jailed former Congressman Rep .
Duke Cunningham will refuse to comply .
The subpoenas were issued for " documents and testimony " by the lawyer for Brent Wilkes , a defense contractor named in Cunningham 's case .
Cunningham pled guilty and is serving eight years in prison .
Five lawmakers received subpoenas for documents and testimony : House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton ( D - MO ) , House Intelligence Chairman Silvestre Reyes ( D - TX ) ; Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) ; House Defense Appropriations Chairman John Murtha ( D - PA ) ; and ranking House Appropriations Republican Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) .
Other members were served subpoenas requesting only testimony .
Among them were : House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , erstwhile House Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R- IL ) , Rep. Joe Knollenberg ( R - MI ) , Rep. Peter Hoekstra ( R - MI ) ; Rep. Darrell Issa ( R- CA ) , Rep John Doolittle ( R - CA ) , Rep. Jerry Weller ( R - IL ) , and Rep. Norm Dicks ( D - WA ) .
A spokesman for for Rep .
Hunter told RAW STORY by email Tuesday that Hunter had been advised by House General Counsel that the subpoena was " inconsistent with the precedents and privileges of the House . "
Hunter is the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee and a candidate for president .
" Congressman Hunter intends to continue consulting with House Counsel on this matter and will proceed according to their judgment , " Kasper said .
Calls to Wilkes ' lawyer , Mark Geragos , were not returned .
Geragos has represented myriad high - profile clients , among them Michael Jackson and former Rep. Gary Condit ( D - CA ) .
What the documents entail is a mystery .
According to Roll Call , " the Members could not respond because it was unclear what the subpoenas are seeking . "
Wilkes heads to court in October for bribery and conspiracy charges .
He stands accused of doling out hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash , gifts and favors , including meals , travel , boat trips and antiques -- as well as the services of prostitutes -- to Cunningham .
Among the items he lavished Cunningham included : $ 525,000 to pay off a mortgage , $ 100,000 in cash , two fiberglass - hulled Sea - Doo Speedster watercraft , an inflatable jet dock , trips to Las Vegas ; Coeur D'Alene , Idaho ; Key Largo , Fla , use of a corporate jet , GPS navigational system for yacht , a hotel suite in Hawaii and the use of two prostitutes .

I realized this the other day , and dub it Bram's Law
The easier a piece of software is to write , the worse it 's implemented in practice .
Why ?
Easy software projects can be done by almost any random person , so they are .
It 's possible to try to nudge your way into being the standard for an easy thing based on technical merit , but that 's rather like trying to become a hollywood star based on talent and hard work .
You 're much better off trading it all in for a good dose of luck .
This is why HTTP is a mess while transaction engines are rock solid .
Almost any programmer can do a mediocre but workable job of extending HTTP , ( and boy , have they , ) but most people can't write a transaction engine which even functions .
The result is that very few transaction engines are written , almost all of them by very good programmers , and the few which are n't up to par tend to be really bad and hardly get used .
HTTP , on the other hand , has all kinds of random people hacking on it , as a result of which Python has a ' fully http 1.1 compliant ' http library which raises assertion failures during normal operation .
Remember this next time you 're cursing some ubiquitous but awful third party library and thinking of writing a replacement .
With enough coal , even a large diamond is unlikely to be the first thing picked up .
Save your efforts for more difficult problems where you can make a difference .
The simple problems will continue to be dealt with incompetently .
It sucks , but we 'll waste a lot less time if we learn to accept this fact .
This is the first stable release since 4.20 ( more than a year ago ) , and the first major release since 4.00 almost two years ago .
Dozens of development releases led up to this .
Major new features since 4.00 include the Zenmap cross- platform GUI , 2nd Generation OS Detection , the Nmap Scripting Engine , a rewritten host discovery system , performance optimization , advanced traceroute functionality , TCP and IP options support , and and nearly 1,500 new version detection signatures .
More than 300 other improvements were made as well .
ABOUT NMAP :
Nmap ( “ Network Mapper ” ) is a free and open source ( license ) utility for network exploration or security auditing .
Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory , managing service upgrade schedules , and monitoring host or service uptime .
Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network , what services ( application name and version ) those hosts are offering , what operating systems ( and OS versions ) they are running , what type of packet filters / firewalls are in use , and dozens of other characteristics .
It was designed to rapidly scan large networks , but works fine against single hosts .
Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems , and both console and graphical versions are available .
Nmap downloads and documentation are available from Insecure .
Org/nmap /.
Nmap has been named “ Security Product of the Year ” by Linux Journal , Info World , LinuxQuestions .
Org , and Codetalker Digest .
It has also been praised in hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles , from Wired , the BBC , and Heise to Securityfocus and Linux Weekly News .
At least five movies have featured Nmap , including The Bourne Ultimatum , The Matrix Reloaded , The Listening , Battle Royale , and , uhh , HaXXXor : No Longer Floppy ( NSFW ) .
Screens shots of Nmap in all of these movies are available on our news page .
Nmap has become quite the movie star !
As free software , we do n't have any sort of advertising budget .
So please spread the word that Nmap 4.50 is now available !
CHANGES :
Nmap has undergone hundreds of important changes since our last major release ( 4.00 in January 2006 ) and we recommend that all current users upgrade .
The Nmap Changelog describes 320 improvements since 4.00 in more than 1,500 lines .
Here are the highlights :
Zenmap graphical front - end and results viewer Zenmap is a cross-platform ( tested on Linux , Windows , Mac OS X ) GUI which supports all Nmap options .
It allows easier browsing , searching , sorting , and saving of Nmap results .
Zenmap replaces the venerable but dated NmapFE , which was the default Nmap GUI for more than 8 years .
View screenshots and ( limited ) documentation at the new Zenmap page .
Zenmap is included with most of the Nmap 4.50 packages on the Nmap download page .
2nd Generation OS Detection Nmap revolutionized OS detection when the feature was first released in October 1998 , and it served us well for more than 9 years as the database grew to 1,684 fingerprints .
The new 2nd generation system incorporates everything we learned during those years and has proven itself more effective and accurate .
The new database has 1,085 signatures , ranging from the 2 Wire 11701HG wireless ADSL modem to the ZyXEL ZyWall 2 Plus firewall .
In addition to more than 500 general purpose OS fingerprints , it contains 94 switches , 92 printers , 81 WAPs , 63 broadband routers , 31 firewalls , 19 VoIP phones , 16 webcams , 8 cell phones , and more .
We currently only have fingerprints for 1 ATM machine and 2 game consoles .
The new system is extensively documented .
Nmap Scripting Engine Nmap has been praised for many things , but not extensibility .
The Nmap Scripting Engine helps change that by allowing users to write ( and share ) simple scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks .
Those scripts are then executed in parallel with the speed and efficiency you expect from Nmap .
Users can rely on the growing and diverse set of scripts distributed with Nmap , or write their own to meet custom needs .
Nmap 4.50 includes 40 scripts ranging from simple ( showHTMLTitle , ripeQuery ) to more complex ( netbios - smb - os - discovery , SQLInject , bruteTelnet ) .
An NSE library system ( NSELib ) allows common functions and extensions to be written in Lua or C. NSE can efficiently handle normal TCP or UDP sockets , or read and write raw packets using Libpcap .
The system and API are extensively documented .
You can try NSE ( along with other features ) out by adding the - A option to your Nmap command - line .
Performance and accuracy improvements
We have made a number of improvements to enhance Nmap performance and accuracy .
Not only were the host discovery and OS detection systems completely replaced , but we improved the port scanning algorithms in the process .
We also optimized the configure scripts and removed a lot of dead code to improve compile times and reduce the distribution size .
Despite all the changes in two years and 42 releases since version 4.00 , the bzip2 - compressed Nmap source tarball has only grown from 2 megabytes to 3 megabytes .
Even in these days where gigabytes of ram and a terabyte of hard drive space are common on personal computers , we keep Nmap lean so it continues to function well on more limited devices such as One Laptop Per Child machines ( Nmap developers purchased at least 3 already for testing ) and PDAs .
Another performance boost came from ignoring certain rate - limited ICMP error messages in cases such as SYN scan where the ICMP error means the same as the lack of any response does anyway .
Version detection enhancements
The Nmap version detection system has continued to flourish .
It allows Nmap to determine the service listening on a port using protocol communication rather than making assumptions based on port number .
In addition to the service name , the system can also often deduce other information such as application name , version number , device type , operating system , and more .
The DB has grown more than 40 % since 4.00 to 4,542 signatures representing 449 services .
The service protocols with the most signatures are http ( 1,473 ) , telnet ( 459 ) , ftp ( 423 ) , smtp ( 327 ) , pop3 ( 188 ) , http - proxy ( 111 ) , ssh ( 104 ) , imap ( 103 ) , irc ( 46 ) and nntp ( 44 ) .
The version detection service is extensively documented .
Host discovery ( ping scanning ) system rewritten
The old host discovery system ( massping ( ) ) was removed and the primary port scanning engine ( ultra_scan ( ) ) augmented to support host discovery .
The new system is more accurate , and in some cases faster .
We removed the artificial limits on the number of ports and protocols ( such as - PS arguments ) which can be used for discovery .
A new IP protocol ping type ( - PO ) was added which sends IP headers with your specified protocol numbers in the hope of eliciting a response .
Bug fixes
There were hundreds of bug and portability fixes to keep Nmap working on all the popular operating systems and prevent crashes or other misbehavior .
These are all detailed in the Nmap Changelog .
We have also been proactive about discovering and fixing bugs before users encounter them .
Static code analysis company Coverity generously offered to scan the Nmap code base for flaws and it identified about a dozen potential issues which we fixed .
We have also been using the open source Valgrind utility to identify bugs .
Political correctness
To cultivate a professional image , we long ago capitalized all references to God in error message text and also reworded all instances of “ fucked up ” to “ borked ” .
We have now also changed this warning message : “ TCP / IP fingerprinting ( for OS scan ) requires root privileges .
Sorry , dude . ”
A woman reported that it was “ highly offensive and sexist ” , that “ times have changed and many women now use your software ” , and “ a sexist remark like the one above should have no place in software . ” -- reason explains why a port is open / closed / filtered
The new -- reason option adds a column to the Nmap port state table which explains why Nmap assigned a port status .
For example , a port could be listed as “ filtered ” because no response was received , or because an ICMP network unreachable message was received .
With -- reason , you can find out which was the case without digging through -- packet - trace logs .
Advanced traceroute support Nmap now offers a -- traceroute option which uses Nmap data to determine which sort of packets are most likely to slip through the target network and produce useful results .
The system is well optimized for speed and bandwidth efficiency , and the clever output system avoids repeating the same initial hops for each target system .
The - A option now includes traceroute .
Public Subversion ( SVN ) repository
While some formerly open source programs are becomming more proprietary , Nmap continues to open up with a public Subversion ( SVN ) source code repository .
All users can now check out the latest Nmap in - development code , and several developers now have commit access so sending patches to Fyodor is no longer a bottleneck .
We have posted Instructions for using the Nmap SVN repository .
TCP and IP Options Nmap now supports IP options with the new -- ip - options flag .
You can specify any options in hex , or use “ R ” ( record route ) , “ T ” ( record timestamp ) , “ U ” ( record route & timestamp ) , “ S [ route ] ” ( strict source route ) , or “ L [ route ] ” ( loose source route ) .
Specify -- packet - trace to display IP options of responses .
For further information and examples , see this post .
TCP options are now reported by -- packet - trace too .
Added the -- open option , which causes Nmap to show only open ports .
Ports in the states “ open|closed ” and “ unfiltered ” might be open , so those are shown unless the host has an overwhelming number of them .
The -- scanflags option now also accepts “ ECE ” , “ CWR ” , “ ALL ” and “ NONE ” as arguments .
The new -- servicedb and -- versiondb options let you specify a custom Nmap services ( port to port number translation and port frequency ) file or version detection database .
In verbose mode , Nmap now reports where it obtains data files ( such as nmap - services ) from .
IP Protocol scan ( - sO ) now sends proper protocol headers for TCP , UDP , ICMP , and IGMP .
Updated Nmap 's data files to contain the latest service port numbers , Ethernet mac address prefix ( OUI ) assignments , IP address allocation data , IP protocol numbers , and more .
Updated to recent releases of Nmap dependency libraries Winpcap , Libpcap , Libdnet , and LibPCRE as well as the latest Autoconf support scripts .
Improved nmap.xsl , which is used to transform Nmap XML output into pretty HTML reports .
Added the -- unprivileged option , which is the opposite of -- privileged .
It tells Nmap to treat the user as lacking network raw socket and sniffing privileges .
This is useful for testing , debugging , or when the raw network functionality of your operating system is somehow broken .
The Windows executable installer now gives users the option of applying TCP performance tweaks to the Registry .
Nmap now allows multiple ignored port states .
If a 65 K - port scan had , 64 K filtered ports , 1 K closed ports , and a few dozen open ports , Nmap used to list the dozen open ones among a thousand lines of closed ports .
Now Nmap will give reports like “ Not shown : 64330 filtered ports , 1000 closed ports ” or “ All 2051 scanned ports on 192.168.0.69 are closed ( 1051 ) or filtered ( 1000 ) ” , and omit all of those ports from the table .
Open ports are never ignored .
Windows compilation now supports the free Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express edition , so you do n't have to pay for Visual Studio Pro .
We also automated the build system with a Makefile in the mswin32 directory so releases can be built without even having to open Visual C++.
Google sponsored 16 student developers since the Nmap 4.00 release to spend a summer working on Nmap .
Those students implemented many of the improvements described in this release .
You can read about our Summer of Code successes in our 2006 results and 2007 results pages .
Hundreds of other features , bug fixes , and portability enhancements described at http://nmap.org/changelog.html.
The changelog describes 320 improvements im more than 1,500 lines since version 4.00 .
MOVING FORWARD :
With this stable version out of the way , we plan to dive headfirst into the next development cycle .
Many exciting features are in the queue , including a fixed - rate packet sending engine ( so you can tell Nmap to ignore its normal timing algorithms and simply specify the number of probes to send per second ) and port frequency statistics ( so you can tell Nmap to scan just the 100 most common TCP or UDP ports ) .
We also plan to work on infrastructure , potentially adding an Nmap wiki and bug tracker , while continuing to enhance the mailing list archives at SecLists .
Org .
We also plan to stabilize , extend , and improve all of the new features .
For example , we could use many more NSE scripts and 2nd generation OS detection fingerprints .

Mark :
Why do I still read old media ?
I miss the ads .
Back with entrepreneur Chad Severnson .
We were talking about the illogic of bottled water ...
Man : Right , Mark .
We have the purest water supply in the world , and yet we buy billions of bottles of the stuff !
Coke and Pepsi bottle municipal tap water as " Dasani " and " Aquafina " and sell it to us at twice the cost of gasoline !
Bottled water is a triumph of perceived need over reason - the greatest marketing coup in history .
Mark :
So that 's what inspired Alpin - Diaz ?
Man : Right .
I just knew the world was ready for bottled air !
Mark : Ahh !
Like a little whiff of Switzerland !
Man : Actually , we collect it in Newark , but who cares ?
Reno , Nev .
THE multimillionaire creator of “ Girls Gone Wild ” sits in a jail visiting room here , wearing a uniform of orange shirt and gray pants and looking pale but rested from eight months of incarceration .
He talks to a visitor through glass , often yelling , sometimes tapping on the glass with his index finger for emphasis , railing into a handset against “ evil ” and “ vengeful ” government officials and vowing to sue them all .
“ Enough is enough , ” he spits out .
“ I am not a criminal . ”
Joe Francis , 34 , has long been a polarizing figure , having made his riches enticing young women at Spring Break locations ( many of them drunk ) to bare their breasts for the cameras for his popular videos .
He has not been scoring brownie points by calling local officials in Florida  where Spring Break 2003 in Panama City Beach went terribly wrong for him  “ Nazis ” and “ cockroaches . ”
But , stuck in jail in Reno , Mr. Francis is now desperately trying to drum up public sympathy , if not win release , to expose how unfairly he believes authorities have treated him .
For the last two and a half months , he has taken out ads , sent out news releases , appeared on dozens of radio and TV talk shows and used a Web site , www.meetjoefrancis.com, to relate his convoluted story while his lawyers file motions charging prosecutorial misconduct and ask for investigations .
And as he goes about trying to transform his image from soft - porn entrepreneur to victim of vindictive officials , support has come from unusual quarters .
His most vocal allies are not the Hollywood A - listers who have vacationed at his Mexico estate , but conservative radio hosts and their listeners , who suspect government shenanigans .
About Moar Internets
The life and time of a digital nobody , thought flow , ramblings , musings and observances of one of the multitude .
It 's like a magazine or a blog , or something .
Seven years ago , The Register broke what became the biggest DRM story of all time .
It described a plot that took place in obscure committee rooms that was quite cunning in its insidiousness .
Had it succeeded and been implemented , it would have seen the demise of the open personal computer platform - without anyone realising it .
For the first time , many of us became fully aware of the consequences of a locked - down PC .
This was n't science fiction , but a very real and present danger .
CPRM was a sophisticated , cryptographically - based restriction technology designed for use on removable media , developed at IBM's Alamaden Research Lab .
It 's the " S " on an SD Card , and 200 million copies of CPRM media have been sold .
However , at the behest of Hollywood interests , moves began to incorporate it into PC Hard Drives , by making CPRM a part of the standard command set for ATA disks .
Each hard drive would be individually signed , and total control of the media could be assumed by the rights holder .
A CPRM - compliant song or movie file that resided on a CPRM - compatible hard drive could be deleted or locked - down at will : assuming you were given the right to save it in the first place .
This caused an outcry from enterprise users and their software vendors , who quickly realised that CPRM would break existing storage and backup systems .
Then , as the implications spread , it became apparent that this provided the Holy Grail copyright holders had been seeking .
CPRM was incredibly hard to break .
As a broadcast encryption system it provided a constantly moving target for hackers in the form of a matrix of tens of thousands of device keys ; these keys could be revoked and refreshed by the rights holder .
A group of manufacturers comprising Intel , IBM , Matsushita ( Panasonic ) , and Toshiba formed a group to license the technology widely .
We published shortly before Christmas 2000 , and a fascinating and fairly nerve shredding few days followed .
There was no anti-DRM lobby at the time : no P2P bloggers to hound the manufacturers .
But understanding this one required learning some obscure technical procedures , and a little about standards committee politics .
CNet followed - up , but the reporter failed to do the necessary homework , so was easily misdirected by PR spin .
It looked like our story might die , and it was only when Dawn Chmielewski put the issue on the front page of the San Jose Mercury nine days later that I could breathe easily .
In the ensuing storm , the issue reached the boardrooms of Intel and IBM .
The perception of a locked - down media appliance hurts business .
What the hell are we doing ?
directors demanded .
CPRM on ATA was dropped from the spec - but from there we entered even more dangerous territory .
The T.13 committee produces a specification that covers only the lowest common denominator set of operations , and two thirds of commands are " vendor - specific " .
A Western Digital or a Seagate often produces its own .
See any parallels to today ?
Let 's see ...
From the Minnesota Monitor , a Christian ministry called “ When You Can Run But You Cannot Hide ” has been doing anything it can to get in front of a group of public school students , at which point they unleash condemnations on homosexuality and evolution .
A lot of administrators have n’t caught on and continue inviting the group to speak to their schools :
[ Group founder Bradlee ]
Dean ’s ministry may not believe in the separation of church and state , but they seem well aware that public school administrators do .
And they have repeatedly run afoul of school officials and students in recent years for promising to run a program on abstinence and drug abuse , and mentioning God only when in front of students .
And by doing so , they ’ve been able to earn thousands of dollars per event from public schools that later express surprise about the group ’s brand of hardline Christianity .
In addition to gloating about the 100,000 + religious tracts his group has passed out in public high schools , Dean also made this comment at a recent ministry fundraiser :
His speech compared the teaching of evolution to the ideology of Hitler , claimed that drugs to treat depression and ADD were “ more potent than cocaine ” and called the pope “ a devil disguised as a minister of righteousness . ”
Former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore , the guy who refused to remove the Ten Commandments monument from his state courthouse , was a speaker at the fundraiser .
What ’s the reaction like after they perform their duplicitous show ?
Here ’s one principal who made the mistake of inviting them and now regrets it :
“ They had a captive audience for their message , and that was n’t right , ” said Benton Principal Gary Neis …
Neis later would call an assembly to apologize to students for the group ’s decision to stray into religion .
“ They talked about influencing and brainwashing people .
Be wise to the fact that is what they were doing .
They were using the same tactics , ” Neis told the students .
Another principal :
According to the [ Tennessee ] Oak Ridger , “ [ Roane County High School ] Principal Jody McLoud apologized for any controversy or heartache the assembly generated .
In addition to homosexuality , race and obesity , the materials reportedly also included such topics as suicide , drugs and premarital sex . ”
“ They encouraged bigotry and hate - mongering toward children that may not share their religious beliefs or who are struggling to find an identity or self - esteem , ” said Laura Dailey , a parent of a Roane County High student …
The school district was forced to deal with the controversy by reiterating its policy that “ forbids religious statements in schools . ”
Just to clarify , students can be religious all they want .
They just ca n’t have religion forced upon them by an authority figure .
Yet another principal :
“ I can tell you , I was n’t happy . ” [ one unnamed principal ] said , according to the Pantagraph .
“ I ’m extremely disappointed , ” he told the students .
“ Not in you , but that I allowed this . ”
He added , “ I felt like the kids got cheated . ”
And , what the heck , here ’s one more person who sat through their presentation :
“ It seemed like total propaganda .
It was like a cult .
They were trying to get kids who ca n’t think for themselves to think like them , ” said Amy Deitcher , then a high school junior , according to the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette .
According to Deitcher , girls and boys were segregated during the presentation , and the girls were “ presented with a ‘ treasure chest ’ theory in which they were told that any sort of physical contact with a man before marriage would result in a woman becoming ‘ leftovers ’ for her husband .
How much taxpayer money does the group get for this seminar on Christian fundamentalism ?
In 2005 , they were “ paid $ 2500 to perform for three school districts . ”
Reporter Jeff Fecke concludes with these wonderfully - worded paragraphs :
While Dean and his followers may not believe in the separation of church and state , the vast majority of Americans , including the vast majority of American Christians , do .
We may not always agree on where the line should be drawn , but most of us agree that we do n’t want our schools pushing a religious message ; as parents , that ’s our responsibility , in accord with our own religious views and our church , if we have one .
That ’s not just to protect a small minority of liberal atheists , either .
While Dean feels he is justified in using public money to bring the gospel into the school , he may be forgetting that when the public pays your bills , it gets get a veto on your message .

BANKS across the United States , particularly the smaller ones , have become dependent on construction lending just as that area of the economy is weakening and the number of bad loans is growing .
Figures compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and released last week show that both midsize and small banks had construction loans outstanding that were greater than their total capital .
A decade ago , such loans were equal to only a third of capital for those banks .
For most of this decade , that was a good strategy .
Construction loans proved to be very profitable , particularly for smaller banks as competition from larger banks and securities markets eroded their position in areas like mortgage lending and credit card issuance .
Now , however , more than 3 percent of all construction loans are classified as being nonperforming , or have borrowers that are behind on their payments .
That is the highest proportion in a decade .
Music diversity will grow .
The major labels ' business model requires them to have a steady stream of consistent products .
The very nature of their operation produces homogenized music designed for specific radio formats and scientifically honed to hit - making models .
Artists are signed and promoted based on the opinions of individual A&R executives , not the popularity of the music .
When the major labels crumble , the diversity of mainstream music will blossom .
It will be a revolution in pop culture .
People will decide what 's popular , not marketing .
Pay - for - play radio will end .
For decades , the major labels have controlled what 's on the radio by paying radio stations to play their songs .
Pay - for - play radio ( aka " payola " ) means that independent labels can't get their music on mainstream radio and mediocre major label music gets on the radio just because somebody 's paying .
Legislative efforts to end the practice have failed consistently .
Payola is illegal , but labels simply skirt the law by paying third - party " independent promoters " to pay radio stations .
As long as the major labels continue to have huge amounts of money to throw into radio promotion , we 'll always have pay - for - play .
But we can take the money out of the system .
If we stop paying for major label music , we can stop payola .
Independent music wo n't be marginalized .
The major labels use their monopoly of distribution and their control of radio to prevent independent music from competing in the mainstream .
Pay - for - play happens in print media too : if a record label places ads , they 'll get reviews .
Many in indie music circles have grown so used to being marginalized by the majors that they just accept it .
Some even become proud of their own obscurity -- after all , in this system obscurity is where you get when you stay true to principles .
But it does n't need to be that way .
With the record industry in disarray , the media and the public are trying to understand what 's happening .
If independent labels and musicians speak out against the majors ' unfair business practices , they can shift the debate and change the system .
The lawsuits will stop .
The major labels hit a new low when they started suing fans this fall .
But the million - dollar filesharing lawsuits are hurting hundreds of families , many of whom have young children .
We 've spoken with dozens of the people who 've been targeted , and these lawsuits are literally driving families into bankruptcy .
The risk and expense of fighting the suits rather than settling means that of the over 400 people targetted by the RIAA , there may not be a single case that gets decided in court .
The only way to stop these suits is to stop buying the CDs that fund the lawsuits .
Artistic freedom will expand .
For artists on major labels , label bureaucrats hijack the sound and control the final product .
The label picks the producer of the album and they can always refuse to release it ; sometimes labels even trash entire albums .
And at the end of the day the label - - not the musician - - owns the copyright to each song .
The major labels have also made it illegal or prohibitively expensive to make sample - based music .
They own all the copyrights and , unless musicians pay to ' clear ' each sample , the musical equivalent of a collage becomes illegal art .
Hip - hop and electronic music suffer the most from this restrictive , legalistic atmosphere .
But if we take down the copyright cartel , the problem is solved .
Blackwater crushed car with three kids , old man to avoid traffic : former US official John Byrne
Published : Saturday October 6 , 2007

Print This Email This Janessa Gans , a visiting political science professor at Principia College who served as a US official in Iraq from 2003 to 2005 , opened fire on the private security contractor Blackwater in Saturday 's edition of the Los Angeles Times .
" When the Iraqi government last month demanded the expulsion of Blackwater USA , the private security firm , I had one reaction :
It 's about time , " she begins in an editorial .
Gans says she witnessed firsthand " over - the - top zeal " of the behemoth US mercenary force .
" We would careen around corners , jump road dividers , reach speeds in excess of 100 mph and often cross over to the wrong side of the street , oncoming traffic be damned , " she writes .
" I began to wonder whether my meetings , intended to further U.S. policy goals and improve the lives of Iraqis , were doing more harm than good .
With our drivers honking at , cutting off , pelting with water bottles ( a favorite tactic ) and menacing with weapons anyone in their way , how many enemies were we creating ? "
Gans describes a particularly " infuriating " incident where the lead Chevy Suburban in her convoy allegedly crashed into a sedan ferrying an older man , a young woman and three children .
" As we approached at typical breakneck speed , the Blackwater driver honked furiously and motioned to the side , as if they should pull over , " she pens .
" The kids in the back seat looked back in horror , mouths agape at the sight of the heavily armored Suburbans driven by large , armed men in dark sunglasses .
The poor Iraqi driver frantically searched for a means of escape , but there was none .
So the lead Blackwater vehicle smashed heedlessly into the car , pushing it into the barrier .
We zoomed by too quickly to notice if anyone was hurt . "
" Where do you all expect them to go ? " she allegedly cried .
" It was an old guy and a family , for goodness ' sake .
Was it necessary for them to destroy their poor old car ? "
" Ma'am , we 've been trained to view anyone as a potential threat , " she says the driver , who she did not identify , replied .
" You do n't know who they might use as decoys or what the risks are .
Terrorists could be disguised as anyone . "
" Well , if they were n't terrorists before , they certainly are now ! " she says she replied .
According to Gans , the Pentagon 's rules of engagement and the private security contractor 's seeming indifference created a stark contrast for local Iraqis , who saw the US military as a more responsible force .
" Blackwater seemed to have no such rules , paid no compensation and , per long - standing Coalition Provisional Authority fiat , had immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law . "
" As we do the work of bridge building and improving our host citizens ' lives , if the people providing our transportation and security are antagonizing , angering and even killing the people we are putatively trying to help , our entire mission is undermined , " she concluded .
Founder and president of The Euphrates Institute , Gans also keeps a blog , " Letters from the Sandbox . "

Being someone that ’s interested in having as many people using browsers with the latest CSS and JavaScript implementations , I ’ve been struggling to figure out why Firefox adoption rates and even Internet Explorer 7 adoption rates are flat lining .
Have we basically converted everyone that had a problem with Internet Explorer 6 ?
And that ’s when it got me thinking .
What were the problems to the masses that got them switching over in the first place ?
Last year I wrote a bit about The Change Function , a concept that proposes that people move over to new products based on the relationship of two variables : Perceived Crisis and Total Perceived Pain of Adoption .
And at the height of the Firefox craze , there was a a very real crisis across the Internet and it came in the form of viruses , pop-ups and spyware .
Between 2003 - 2004 , we were at the peak of the crisis with the Internet suffering from spam terrorism .
During the height of conversions , Firefox was one of the first popular solutions for making the web usable again .
Yes , it loaded faster and sure it had tabbed browsing , but the biggest difference of opening a web site in Firefox versus Internet Explorer 6 was that you were n’t ashamed to do so around children and colleagues at work .
Toolbars Killed the Firefox Star
In 2005 something happened .
Pop-ups and spyware started to become less of a problem .
Here ’s a graph courtesy of Google Trends that shows the decline in users searching for popup and pop-up over the last few years .
Firefox was just one solution of many that were released by everyone and their mom to help make the Internet safe again from popups and spyware .
There were countless programs created to help fight the good fight .
Even AOL pitched in , releasing AOL version 9.0 and AOL Spyware Protection in 2004 .
My guess is that Google Toolbar , Yahoo Toolbar , MSN Search Toolbar and Windows Live Toolbar were probably the most popular and they all patched up IE6 ’s biggest problem ( in the eyes of users ) by blocking popups .
In regards to the spyware hysteria , here ’s a look at the activity involving searches for the term spyware in relation to the popup searches in Google Trends :
To give you some context that might explain things , at the end of 2004 , Microsoft finally released Windows XP Service Pack 2 and if you look at the feature list , you ’ll notice the first one highlighted is “ Internet Explorer Pop - up Blocker . ”
In January 2005 , Microsoft launched their Anti-Spyware and Anti-Virus Tools , which was offered for free and seeing that it came from a familiar ( and some - what ) trusted source — it too , was downloaded like gangbusters .
And so we should n’t be surprised that in the fall of 2005 , a number of reports started coming in from bloggers wondering about the slowing of Firefox adoption .
By the end of the first quarter of 2006 , we can see that spyware was on the slow decline in the minds of users of the Internet .
By the time Internet Explorer 7 came out in the fall of 2006 , the crisis was basically over and the masses were already content customizing their favorite web 1.0 application ( MySpace ) , which worked just fine in IE6 .
One might even argue that the arrival of IE7 was way too late and probably explains why the browser ’s adoption rate ( and I ’m guessing here ) follows the adoption rates of Vista and those who are willing to let SP2 just install it for them .
What ’s interesting is that Microsoft should be thanking Google .
The company that had done the most to encourage Firefox adoption , might have also done the most harm with their , well … excellent toolbar for IE6 .
In fact , Google ’s toolbar and desktop search applications pretty much launched the whole toolbar battle that ’s been raging between the trinity ( Yahoo , Google and Microsoft ) .
My bet is that for every toolbar that was installed on Internet Explorer 6 , it effectively halted the need for that user to convert to a different browser .
The Effect of iTunes and BitTorrent
If you can remember , the primary delivery mechanism of a number of spyware and popup programs was through file sharing networks like Kazaa and BearShare .
The need of the public to search and download millions of songs and videos ( and porn ) was exploited by numbers of malicious advertisers and web sites by uploading tons of self - installing programs disguised as desirable media .
File sharing programs themselves even turned out to be spyware .
In April of 2003 , which was in the middle of this crisis , Apple launched the iTunes Music Store , a legal alternative to downloading music that people seemed to be happy to see just work .
It took a few years , but by the summer of 2005 over half a billion songs had been downloaded through the iTunes .
Following their lead , a number of music download services launched and the demand for music and videos was met with a safe , perceptively cheap and extremely easy outlet .
In addition to a legal alternative , traditional file sharing networks were also being replaced by a new mechanism for media transfer : BitTorrent .
What ’s interesting about the torrent community , is their dedication to quality .
The most popular torrents are carefully cataloged and meticulously labeled and compressed .
It ’s a relatively safer community than traditional file sharing networks based on Gnutella clients and the worst thing you ’ll come across in your downloads are poisoned torrents from HBO .
While Bram Cohen , implemented the first versions back in 2001 , it was n’t until 2003 that the protocol became hot when it was combined with RSS to create broadcatching .
Popularized by Steve Gilmor ’s article , which was written for Ziff - Davis ( they own PC Magazine and a number of other popular media sites ) , the idea that you can just subscribe to your favorite shows and watch them the day after they aired captured the imaginations of a large number of users hoping for the convenience of TIVO without the costs .
And so , in addition to spyware being blocked by toolbars and other helpful applications , the channel by which spyware and viruses were infecting browsers and computers , was replaced by alternatives that produced clean downloads .
The crisis that gave birth to Firefox ’s rising popularity was extinguished on two fronts and from unexpected sources .
What about Safari ?
In regards to Safari , the increased adoption there ( like Internet Explorer 7 ) is probably tied to the increased market share Apple ’s computers are making in the PC market .
I find it interesting that some people think Apple ’s release of Safari for Windows is a serious attempt to gain browser adoption on the personal computer .
The thing is nothing has changed .
The factors that lead users to switch to Firefox are n’t around anymore and so what real hopes does Apple have for people to switch to Safari ?
Safari is entering a crowded space and is far from being above and beyond better than its competition .
Let ’s face it , Firefox is a great browser with a great development team behind it and beating it on quality and innovation will be tough .
If anyone understands the importance of a vacuum or crisis to cause users to switch , Apple certainly does .
The iPod , iTunes Music Store and iPhone were are released in those conditions .
Knowing this going in , I ’d like to argue that Steve Jobs has no real passion about growing Safari usage on Windows .
If you listen to the keynote when he announced the beta , he was even half - hearted about his enthusiasm for Safari making some headroom in the market .
No , browsing on the Internet on a personal computer does n’t suck anymore .
Where it does suck , however , is on the cell phone .
Safari is n’t leaps and bounds better than Firefox or IE7 , but it is ridiculously better than every mobile browser out on the market today .
So the serious strategy , I think , for Safari is to grow it like iTunes , which piggybacked off the iPod .
Make the hardware associated with it ( iPhone ) number one in its market and then by it being the default and only browser on the system ( one of the adoption factors I list below ) , you spread your software better than if you were to try and compete directly with other vendors .
Considering the fanfare iPhone has received so far , it ’s hard to believe it wo n’t take off like the iPod .
Here ’s what I think about the release of Safari on the Windows platform .
It has less to do with attempting to actually be a competitor in the browser space as it does with giving developers a tool to accurately test and build iPhone applications .
Steve Jobs said there would n’t be an SDK for the iPhone because he essentially just announced it with the release of Safari 3 for both operating systems , which is , for the most part , exactly what he said .
Apple is betting that Safari is going to be the # 1 mobile browser because the iPhone is probably going to be the # 1 cell phone .
And if the world is moving towards an Internet powered by mobile broadband , then developers ( knowing how the story went with IE6 ) are going to make sure their sites and web applications works on the # 1 platform .
In Conclusion
My theory of browser adoption is built on the foundation that your typical user is incredibly lazy and hates change .
There are really only two factors driving browser adoption .
Was it the default browser on the system ?
Does it make browsing the Internet suck ?
Now , you may think IE6 obviously makes browsing the Internet suck because it does n’t have tabs and tends to implement CSS and JavaScript poorly .
But that ’s because if you ’re reading this site , you ’re probably a designer or developer .
Remember : ugly , buggy and slow are n’t enough to make users think it sucks enough to switch ( think MySpace and Windows ) .
In hindsight , the best thing to happen to Firefox was probably the rise of file sharing networks , spyware and pop-ups .
Basically , everything that made the web suck .
Everything that made the web a safer place to browse , made Firefox less relevant and quelled the urgency that made an alternative to IE6 a necessity .
What I find most interesting is that web developers ( specifically those of the standards and Web 2.0 variety , which includes myself ) , were so excited by the Firefox momentum that we were convinced that it was a revolution .
We actually thought the masses were starting to believe Internet Explorer was Satan incarnate .
Just goes to show that it has to be in your face popups of wangs and cooters to make you download something different .

The government of Nigeria is still assessing the scheme
XO Laptop in Nigeria
Walter Bender of One Laptop per Child ( OLPC ) said politicians were unwilling to commit because " change equals risk " .
But , he said , there needed to be a " dramatic change " because education in many countries was " failing " children .
In an interview with the BBC , Nigeria 's education minister questioned the need for laptops in poorly equipped schools .
Dr Igwe Aja - Nwachuku said : " What is the sense of introducing One Laptop per Child when they do n't have seats to sit down and learn ; when they do n't have uniforms to go to school in , where they do n't have facilities ? "
" We are more interested in laying a very solid foundation for quality education which will be efficient , effective , accessible and affordable . "
The previous government of Nigeria had committed to buying one million laptops .
Dr Aja -Nwachuku said he was now assessing OLPC alongside other schemes from Microsoft and Intel .
" We are asking whether this is the most critical thing to drive education . "
But speaking separately to BBC News , Professor Bender said : " We think that change has to be dramatic . "
" You 've got to be big , you 've got to be bold .
And what has happened is that there has been an effort to say ' do n't take any risks - just do something small , something incremental ' . "
" It feels safe but by definition what you are ensuring is that nothing happens . "
Winds of change
OLPC was started in 2002 by Nicholas Negroponte , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

It aims to put thousands of low - cost laptops , known as the XO , in the hands of children around the world .
The machines are planned to cost $ 100 and have been especially designed for use in remote and harsh environments where there is little access to electricity or the internet .
But getting the project off the ground has proved difficult .
Professor Negroponte has had high profile run-ins with major technology firms .
He told an audience at a Linux event : " if I am annoying Microsoft and Intel then I figure I am doing something right . "
Microsoft head Bill Gates had questioned the XOs design , particularly the lack of hard drive and its " tiny screen " .
But recently , the firm announced that it was working on a version of Windows XP that would run on the pared down machines .
The price will come down as the numbers go up .
It will take time but it will happen
Walter Bender
" We are spending a non-trivial amount of money , " Microsoft 's Will Poole told Reuters .
Earlier this year , Professor Negroponte also accused Intel of selling its own cut - price laptop - the Classmate - below cost price to drive him out of markets .
He said that Intel " should be ashamed of itself " and said its tactics had hurt his mission " enormously " .
Within weeks it was announced that Intel had joined the board of OLPC amid speculation that the firm was unhappy about the XO using a processor from its main rival AMD .
' Small thinking '
Although these episodes now appear to be behind OLPC , Professor Bender said there was still an " aggressive " effort to undermine the charity .
" There is still a concerted misinformation campaign out there , " he said .
Mr Bender said he would not speculate on who was behind the alleged campaign .
" Wherever it is coming from , it exists , " he told BBC News .
But he said the main problem for OLPC was dealing with conservative politicians .
" Change equals risk especially for politicians .
And we are certainly advocating change because the [ education ] system is failing these children , " he said .
" It has not been that processor versus that processor or that operating system versus that operating system - it 's been small thinking versus big thinking .
That 's really the issue , " he said .
Sales target
Originally , the laptops were to be sold to governments in lots of one million for $ 100 apiece .
Over time , however , the project has dropped the minimum number of machines that can be ordered , leading some to speculate that governments were not buying into the scheme .
The project also recently launched an initiative to allow citizens of North America to buy two machines at a time ; one for themselves and one for a child in a developing country .
But Mr Bender said the shift was because of a better understanding of how to distribute smaller numbers cheaply and effectively , rather than a lack of orders .
" Part of it was our understanding of how the supply chain was going to work and having enough flexibility in the supply chain to make it work with a small number , " he said .
" The big numbers were really about how you get this thing started not how you make it work in the long term .
" That was always going to be about supporting any good idea that comes along .
And we 've been able to get it started without the big top down numbers so we are off and running . "
Developing tool
Since the scheme was first announced in 2002 there have been reports of several countries signing up to it .
Both Nigeria and Libya were reported to have ordered more than one million laptops .
Tests of the XO are going on around the world
Other countries including Thailand and Pakistan had also placed orders , according to reports .
But recently , OLPC revealed it had just taken its first order for 100,000 of the machines , placed by the government of Uruguay .
" Uruguay is first then it will be Peru , Mexico , Ethiopia then we are going to be doing stuff in Haiti , Rwanda and Mongolia , " said Mr Bender .
In addition , he said , OLPC had done a deal with Birmingham , Alabama , in the US , to provide the laptop for schools in the city .
" The numbers of countries where we have trials set up is also increasing , " he said .
Tests were also going on in the Solomon Islands , Nepal and India , a country that had previously shunned the scheme .
The Indian Ministry of Education had previously dismissed the laptop as " pedagogically suspect " , whilst the Education Secretary Sudeep Banerjee said the country needed " classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools " .
Tipping point
The first machines will cost almost double the $ 100 originally planned .
The high price has been blamed on the increasing cost of the raw materials for the components inside the XO .
Each machine currently costs $ 188 .
The laptops have been designed to cope with harsh conditions
The manufacturer of the laptop - Quanta - recently revealed it had started mass production of the machines , after a number of delays .
Previously , OLPC had said it needed three million orders to make production feasible .
Professor Negroponte said it was an important milestone that had been reached despite " all the naysayers " .
" We 're not turning back - we have passed the point of no return , " said Mr Bender .
" It is happening . "
HELSINKI , Finland —
Television talk shows often use conflict as their formula to win viewers , but a young producer in Finland is making a go of it with a different model .
On his Monday night program , Aram Aflatuni presents a problem , then has a panel of experts try to solve it using consultation and cooperation .
" I do n't believe in confrontational journalism , " he says .
" I do not think that it is an effective way of finding solutions . "
His hour - long show - " Harkaa Sarvista , " or " Grab the Bull by the Horns " - this week wraps up its first season of 15 episodes and has attracted as many as 345,000 viewers .
Average viewership was 220,000 - 20 percent of the TV audience for its time period .
In Finland , TV shows often look for confrontation and " sometimes quite aggressive debate , " said Juho - Pekka Rantala , a television executive who works on this show and others .
" ' Harkaa Sarvista ' is different .
It is looking for solutions . "
Viewers are invited to submit an issue for consultation .
If chosen , the person goes on the air and presents the problem to the panel .
Mr. Aflatuni , 31 , is a member of the Baha'i Faith and said he tries to use part of a consultation model used by Baha 'is as the starting point for his show .
It is a model that asks participants to remain personally detached from the ideas presented as everyone seeks a single truth or best outcome .
No one " owns " or takes credit or blame for any idea offered during the consultation .
" It 's a brave show because it is different , " said Laura Jansson , a psychologist and human relations specialist who has appeared on the program .
" In principle , the consultative model is a key to the show 's success , " said Mrs. Jansson , who is a Baha'i .
But viewers and even participants generally are unaware of the principles behind what is going on .
More obvious , she said , is the skill of the host in guiding the conversation .
" People in the world today are very egotistical , " she said .
" They try and push everything through themselves and make themselves look good ....
Aram keeps people focused on the issue and not themselves . "
Immigration , asylum , schizophrenia , boss - employee relations , intercultural communication , and health care issues are among the subjects that have been addressed .
One week , a young refugee from Eritrea who was facing deportation appeared on the program and outlined his predicament .
To weigh solutions , Mr. Aflatuni had gathered a lawyer , a clergyman , a psychologist , the head of a nongovernmental agency , a politician , and another refugee .
The discussion revealed some facts and produced some ideas , including a suggestion from the other refugee that the young man could go underground and thus avoid deportation .
Not surprisingly , other panel members did n't feel that was the best idea - going underground is illegal and also psychologically harmful .
The panel suggested ways that the man might be able to stay in Finland legally and also talked about how he could prepare himself for the possibility of deportation .
It turned out that although the young immigrant had been working , his employment had not been deemed full - time and had not satisfied the authorities .
It was n't anything that a good lawyer could n't fix by talking to the various parties , and several attorneys indeed came forward after the show and offered their services free of charge .
The young man no longer faces imminent deportation , and his case is being reconsidered by the authorities , Mr. Aflatuni said .
MORE DETAILS
Still , Mr. Aflatuni's goal with the program is to go beyond resolving the dilemma of one individual and shed a broader light on society .
" One aspect of the show is to raise awareness of humanitarian issues , " he said , noting that sometimes this means " putting pressure on the system " by informing the public of difficult situations or outright injustices .
" People have an inflated idea of the human rights situation in Finland , " he said .
One unusual program addressed the subject of triplets , and the difficulties of parents of modest means trying to cope with three newborn babies .
" A woman from the Triplets ' Association came on the show and said you really cannot do it without help , " Mr. Aflatuni related .
Also invited to speak was the father of a set of young triplets , and some 30 - year - old triplets who described the experience of their family .
As a result of the program , one Finnish city changed its policy for public aid and will provide a helper five days a week for one family with three new babies , Mr. Aflatuni said .
Future TV plans
Mr. Aflatuni is determined to continue exploring the use of consultation on television as a way to resolve problems , but he says the challenges are stiff .
" There is pressure on me to change the show and make it more confrontational , " he acknowledges .
" But I think this will kill the spirit of the show .
If you bring negative elements in , you destroy this consultative model that we are developing . "
He remembers one show where he invited doctors and nurses to discuss a health - care crisis , but tempers were short and people indeed became confrontational .
" It is too hard to find a solution under those circumstances , " he said .
He said he had better success with a program that featured a 32 - year - old convict who was being released from prison after 10 years .
The man seemed serious about going straight but felt overwhelmed by a large debt that he owed .
On the program , the panel of experts counseled him to dismiss thoughts of the debt for the time - being and concentrate on getting a job .
They also coached him about the way he seemed to cultivate his " tough - guy " image rather than exhibiting the humility that would help him in the working world .
" He still has an attitude problem , " Mr. Aflatuni said , recounting that the man had found a job but then lost it .
" Harkaa Sarvista " might revisit the case for a discussion of where things had gone wrong and how they might be made aright .
The idea of following a problem , periodically evaluating how the supposed solutions are working , and changing course or adjusting details as needed , is part of Mr. Aflatuni 's vision for the program .
He said his biggest challenge as producer stems from his program being based on an untried concept .
" We do n't have examples of a show like this on TV , " he said .
" It would have been easier to use an older show as a model .
But as it is , we are the people that are creating the model . "
The Truth About MARGARET SANGER ( This article first appeared in the January 20 , 1992 edition of Citizen magazine ) How Planned Parenthood Duped America
At a March 1925 international birth control gathering in New York City , a speaker warned of the menace posed by the " black " and " yellow " peril .
The man was not a Nazi or Klansman ; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf , a member of Margaret Sanger 's American Birth Control League ( ABCL ) , which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood .
Sanger 's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists .
One , Lothrop Stoddard , was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy .
Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as " scientific " and " humanitarian . "
And Dr. Harry Laughlin , another Sanger associate and board member for her group , spoke of purifying America 's human " breeding stock " and purging America 's " bad strains . "
These " strains " included the " shiftless , ignorant , and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South . "
Not to be outdone by her followers , Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as " unfit , " a plan she said would be the " salvation of American civilization . :
And she also spoke of those who were " irresponsible and reckless , " among whom she included those " whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers . "
She further contended that " there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped . "
That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered " unfit " can not be easily refuted .
While Planned Parenthood 's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements , history definitively says otherwise .
The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review , which Sanger founded in 1917 .
She published such articles as " Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics " ( June 1920 ) , " The Eugenic Conscience " ( February 1921 ) , " The purpose of Eugenics " ( December 1924 ) , " Birth Control and Positive Eugenics " ( July 1925 ) , " Birth Control : The True Eugenics " ( August 1928 ) , and many others .
These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America ( PPFA ) , which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966 , and whose current president , Faye Wattleton , is black , a former nurse , and attractive .
Though once a social pariah group , routinely castigated by religious and government leaders , the PPFA is now an established , high - profile , well - funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government .
Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as " gospel " ; its full - page ads appear in major newspapers ; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America 's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen , state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as " social orthodoxy . "
Blaming Families
Sanger 's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family .
One of 11 children , she wrote in the autobiographical book , My Fight for Birth Control , that " I associated poverty , toil , unemployment , drunkenness , cruelty , quarreling , fighting , debts , jails with large families . "
Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status , exacerbated by the iconoclastic , " free - thinking " views of her father , whose " anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity " in a predominantly Irish community .
The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning , N.Y. , had relatively few children , Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families .
The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899 , at the age of 48 .
Sanger was convinced that the " ordeals of motherhood " had caused the death of her mother .
The lingering consumption ( tuberculosis ) that took her mother 's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18 , 1905 .
The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth .
Despite the precautions , the birth of baby Grant was " agonizing , " the mere memory of which Sanger described as " mental torture " more than 25 years later .
She once described the experience as a factor " to be reckoned with " in her zealous campaign for birth control .
From the beginning , Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the " unfit . "
Her first handbook , published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled , What Every Boy and Girl Should Know , featured a jarring afterword :
It is a vicious cycle ; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance .
There is only one cure for both , and that is to stoop breeding these things .
Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence .
Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them .
To Sanger , the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual 's search for self - fulfillment .
" Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct , " Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization , " sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself . "
Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism , but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty , as her writings on procreation emphasized .
The second edition of Sanger 's life story , An Autobiography , appeared in 1938 .
There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916 .
Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that " mandated " the use of birth control : the third was " when parents , though normal , had subnormal children " ; the fourth , " when husband and wife were adolescent " ; the fifth , " when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate . "
No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation .
Sanger described the fact that " anyone , no matter how ignorant , how diseased mentally or physically , how lacking in all knowledge of children , seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent . "
Religious Bigotry
In the 1910's and 1920's , the entire social orderreligion , law , politics , medicine , and the media was arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control .
This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed , and a Protestant president signed into law , a bill that became known as the Comstock Law , named after its main proponent , Anthony Comstock .
The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing , along with drugs , and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion , under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing .
Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended .
Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington , D.C. , office of her American Birth Control League in 1926 .
Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians , druggists and drug manufacturers .

まつもとゆきひろの起こした小さな奇跡---梅田望夫氏の著書「ウェブ時代をゆく」の中の節のタイトルである。「時代の巨大な変化の中で個人がどう生きるべきか」をテーマにしたというこの本の中で，Rubyを生み「オープンソースで飯を食う」生き方を実践するまつもと氏の生き方に，梅田氏は何を見い出したのか。梅田氏とまつもと氏が，インターネットがもたらす新しい時代の新しい仕事，新しい生き方を語る。

まつもとゆきひろの起こした小さな奇跡
――梅田望夫さんの新刊 「 ウェブ時代をゆく」には，「まつもとゆきひろの起こした小さな奇跡」という節があります。この本で何を伝えようとされ，なぜまつもとさんを紹介されたのでしょうか。
梅田 いま，インターネットの切り拓いた新しい時代というのが，我々の生き方にダイレクトに影響を及ぼしていこうとしています。時空を超えられる，いろんな人とつながれる，様々な可能性がある。それを見ないようにしている人もいるし，どっぷりと浸かっている人もいる。
そういったなかで，過去になかった生き方をしている人，エッジの立った人の生き方を見て次の時代の生き方を想像するというのかな。僕はシリコンバレーに来て13年になるんですが，シリコンバレーのビジョナリーと呼ばれる人は，Tim O'Reillyなんかもそうですが，水面に出てきたものを見てその氷山の形や大きさを想像するんです。それは外れてバカにされるかもしれないし，当たって賞賛されるかもしれない，そうしてリスクをとって未来を予想していく。
たとえば，オープンソースは，次の50年から100年というスパンで，とても大きなことになるのではないかと，数年前から思い始めています。インターネットという空間の中で，不特定多数の志向性を同じくする人たちが結びついて，金銭的な動機付けが存在しない中で，ものすごく複雑なソフトウエアが，価値が生まれる。僕はこれはとても大きなことだと思う。このことを，そうとう真剣に考えなければいけないという問題意識がある。
そんなウェブ進化の中から，どういう新しいタイプの人が出てきたかというと，本の中でも紹介しているんだけどLinus Torvaldsやまつもとゆきひろさん，将棋の里見香奈さん――里見さんもまつもとさんと同じ島根県出身なので，島根には何かあるんじゃないかと思ったりするのですが――など，こういった人たちはどういう共通点があるんだろうと考えると，好きなことと出合い，それをファースト・プライオリティにして，内からのうながしでそれに打ち込み，やり続けているところにあると思います。そういう人たちが自然に浮上してきて，なおかつ若いひとたちのあこがれの対象となっている。
アメリカにもヨーロッパにもそういう人たちはいるんだけど，特にまつもとさんは，海外ではなく日本にいる，身近な存在として若い人たちの一つのロールモデルとして意味のある大きな存在になっていると感じています。
I sent the following letter to the author of this report ...
Hello .
What does it mean to be Osama Bin Laden 's " Handling Officer " for the Pakistani ISI ?
What is the responsibility of the person that has this particular job ?
Any help would be greatly appreciated .
Sincerely ,
Jon Gold
His response ...
The handling officer of a source in Indian and Pakistani intelligence agencies is the person who looks after the welfare of the source , keeps him motivated and uses him as needed .
The source cannot meet anybody else other than his handling officer except the head of the agency .
One source -- one handling officer is the general rule .
This is to prevent the exposure of the operation and maintain its deniability .
I understand in the CIA they call him the Running Officer of a source .
Thanks .

Osama 's handling officer was incharge of Benazir 's security

According to latest reports , at least 132 persons -- 20 of them police officers deputed to protect former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto [ Images ] -- were killed in a suspected suicide attack on the convoy by which she was being taken from the Karachi airport to the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah on the night of October 18 .
The suicide attack or attacks were clearly aimed to kill her on arrival in Karachi to a triumphant welcome by her supporters , but she managed to escape .
Reliable sources say one or two suicide bombers were involved .
The bullet - proof vehicle by which she was being taken by her supporters was protected by two cordons of security guards .
The inner cordon consisted of security guards engaged by her Pakistan People 's Party parliamentarians to protect her .
Many of them were former policemen and ex-servicemen enjoying her and her party 's confidence .
The outer cordon consisted of officers of the Sindh police and plainclothes security officers of Pakistan 's Intelligence Bureau , which is now headed by Brig Ejaz Shah , a former officer of Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence , who is a close personal friend of Gen Pervez Musharraf [ Images ] and Gen ( retd ) Mohammad Aziz , a Kashmiri officer belonging to the Sudan tribe who orchestrated the overthrow of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister in October 1999 .
Shah is also a close personal friend of many Punjabi leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League ( Qaid e Azam ) , which is opposed to Benazir 's return .
According to these sources , the suicide bomber or bombers managed to penetrate the security cordon of the police and IB officers without being frisked , but could not penetrate the inner cordon of security guards of the PPP .
When stopped , they blew themselves up at a distance from her vehicle .
At the time of the explosion , she had gone inside the vehicle to rest for a while .
This seems to have contributed to her miraculous escape .
Had she been standing on top she might have been injured , if not killed .
There are many elements in Pakistan , and in Karachi itself , which are opposed to her and are determined to prevent her return to power .
These include the various jihadi terrorist groups , Al Qaeda [ Images ] and its allies , those involved in the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl and the supporters of Dawood Ibrahim [ Images ] , the Indian mafia leader who has been given shelter in Karachi by the Pakistani intelligence agencies .
The anger against her is due to various reasons -- the fact that she is a woman , her close proximity to the US and her open statements supporting the US on various issues .
They see her as the US cat 's paw .
It is difficult to say at present who might have been responsible for the attack on her .
Brig Ejaz
Shah has been strongly criticised by Benazir and her supporters for the security failure and they have demanded his removal and arrest .
When he was in the ISI , he used to be the handling officer of Osama bin Laden and Mulla Omar , the amir of the Taliban .
After Musharraf seized power in October 1999 , he had Shah posted as the home secretary of Punjab .
It was to him that Omar Sheikh , who orchestrated the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl , surrendered because Omar Sheikh knew him before and was confident that Ejaz Shah would see that he was not tortured .
After Pearl 's murder , there were many allegations regarding Shah 's role .
Musharraf tried to protect him by sending him as the ambassador to Australia or Indonesia .
Both the countries reportedly refused to accept him .
Musharraf then made him the DG of IB and he saw to it that the death sentence against Omar Sheikh for his role in the Pearl case was not executed .
The courts have been repeatedly postponing hearings on the appeal filed by Omar Sheikh against the death sentence .
Ejaz Shah played an active role in the campaign to discredit Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Caudhury of the Pakistan Supreme Court after he started calling for the files of a large number of missing persons who were taken into custody by the police and the intelligence agencies .
Reliable sources in Pakistan reported that Gen Pervez Kiani , who was the DG of ISI at the time of the suspension of the Chief Justice , was against the suspension but Musharraf suspended him on the advice of Ejaz Shah and Maj Gen Nadim Taj , who was at that time head of the Directorate - General of Military Intelligence .
Maj Gen
Taj has since been promoted as Lt Gen and has succeeded Kiyani as the DG of ISI .
While the ISI under Kiyani refused to file any affidavit against the suspended Chief Justice before the court , the IB and the DGMI filed affidavits giving details of all the information which their organisations had indicating the alleged unsuitability of the Chief Justice to head the Supreme Court .
Despite the political embarrassment caused by the case , which ended in a fiasco , Ejaz Shah continues to enjoy Musharraf 's total confidence .

Former Powell aide says Bush , Cheney guilty of ' high crimes '
Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday May 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This A former top State Department aide to Colin Powell said today that President Bush and Vice President Cheney are more deserving of impeachment than was Bill Clinton .
Lawrence Wilkerson , who was chief of staff to then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , said on the public radio program On Point Thursday that " Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes ... pale in significance " when compared to the " high crimes and misdemeanors " of Bush and Cheney .
Wilkerson did not directly call on Congress to begin impeachment hearings , and he brought up impeachment in response to a caller 's question .
Early in the show , however , he observed , " This administration does n't know how to effect accountability , in my opinion . "
Wilkerson 's comments were first reported by pro-impeachment Web site AfterDowningStreet.org .
" The language in [ the Constitution ] about impeachment is nice and precise - it 's high crimes and misdemeanors , " he said .
" You compare Bill Clinton 's peccadilloes for which he was impeached to George Bush 's high crimes and misdemeanors or Dick Cheney 's high crimes and misdemeanors , and I think they pale in significance . "
Taking a historical view of impeachment , Wilkerson said he believed the Founding Fathers would be surprised that more presidents had not been impeached .
" I do believe that they would have thought had they been asked by you or whomever at the time of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia ' Do you think this will be exercised ? ' they would have said ' Of course it will , every generation they 'll have to throw some bastard out .
'" Wilkerson said .
" That 's a form of accountability too .
It 's ultimate accountability . "
Asked about the high crimes of the current administration , Wilkerson said the American public was duped into supporting a war in Iraq .
" I think we went into this war for specious reasons , " he said .
" I think we went into this war not too much unlike the way we went into the Spanish American War with the Hearst press essentially goading the American people and the leadership into war .
That was a different time in a different culture , in a different America .
We 're in a very different place today and I think we essentially got goaded into the war through some of the same means . "
OK , I cheated .
I do n't really speak Chinese .
But I know a bot that does , and we 're releasing it today together with number of other translation bots .
For those not familiar with bots , a ( ro ) bot is a piece of software that acts as a chat contact and provides some fun or useful functionality .
If you want to try it , just add en2zh@bot.talk.google.com as a friend in Google Talk and send it a message to translate from English to Chinese .
You can use it as an interpreter in your group chat , or as a pocket translator in your Google Talk client for BlackBerry .
For more languages , just add any of the 29 23 other translation bots .
They 're named using two - letter language abbreviations as " [ from language ] 2 [ to language ] @bot.talk.google.com " , and the supported language pairs are : ar2en , de2en , de2 fr , el2en , en2ar , en2de , en2el , en2es , en2 fr , en2it , en2 ja , en2 ko , en2nl , en2ru , en2zh , es2en , fr2de , fr2en , it2en , ja2en , ko2en , nl2en , ru2en , zh2en .
So , for French to German translation , talk to fr2de@bot.talk.google.com .
For those of you into programming , why not build your own bot ?
Maybe a weather service or a rock / paper / scissors game .
The Google Talk service uses an open protocol called XMPP , and it 's easy to find client libraries and code samples that will give you a flying start .
For Java users , check out Ignite Realtime 's Smack library .
Please note that the Google Talk service enforces traffic limitations on user accounts , so if you want to support more than a few thousand Google Talk users on your bot , connect using the server - to - server protocol ( either by making your bot act as an XMPP server or by hosting the bot on your own XMPP server ) .

Software Engineer
Update :
Our initial list of available bots included some languages that are not actually available .
There are 24 bots currently available : ar2en , de2en , de2 fr , el2en , en2ar , en2de , en2el , en2es , en2 fr , en2it , en2 ja , en2 ko , en2nl , en2ru , en2zh , es2en , fr2de , fr2en , it2en , ja2en , ko2en , nl2en , ru2en , zh2en .
As some have guessed , this is a 20 % project , and while machine translation is n't perfect , we hope these bots can be helpful in bridging language barriers .

The digested read , digested : Coming to a lavvy near you this Christmas .
JERUSALEM -- A scholar looking into the factual basis of a popular but widely criticized documentary that claims to have located the tomb of Jesus said Tuesday that a crucial piece of evidence filmmakers used to support their claim is a mistake .
Stephen Pfann , a textual scholar and paleographer at the University of the Holy Land in Jerusalem , said he has released a paper claiming the makers of " The Lost Tomb of Jesus " were mistaken when they identified an ancient ossuary from the cave as belonging to the New Testament 's Mary Magdalene .
The film 's director , Simcha Jacobovici , responded that other researchers agreed with the documentary 's conclusions .
Produced by Oscar - winning director James Cameron , the documentary has drawn intense media coverage for its claims challenging accepted Christian dogma .
Despite widespread ridicule from scholars , " The Lost Tomb of Jesus " drew more than 4 million viewers when it aired on the Discovery Channel on March 4 .
A companion book , " The Jesus Family Tomb , " has rocketed to sixth place on The New York Times nonfiction best - seller list .
The film and book suggest that a first - century ossuary found in a south Jerusalem cave in 1980 contained the remains of Jesus , contradicting the Christian belief that he was resurrected and ascended to heaven .
Ossuaries are stone boxes used at the time to store the bones of the dead .
The filmmakers also suggest that Mary Magdalene was buried in the tomb , that she and Jesus were married , and that an ossuary labeled " Judah son of Jesus " belonged to their son .
The scholars who analyzed the Greek inscription on one of the ossuaries after its discovery read it as " Mariamene e Mara , " meaning " Mary the teacher " or " Mary the master . "
Before the movie was screened , Jacobovici said that particular inscription provided crucial support for his claim .
The name Mariamene is rare , and in some early Christian texts it is believed to refer to Mary Magdalene .
But having analyzed the inscription , Pfann published a detailed article on his university 's
Web site asserting that it does n't read " Mariamene " at all .
The inscription , Pfann said , is made up of two names inscribed by two different hands : the first , " Mariame , " was inscribed in a formal Greek script , and later , when the bones of another woman were added to the box , another scribe using a different cursive script added the words " kai Mara , " meaning " and Mara . "
Mara is a different form of the name Martha .
According to Pfann 's reading , the ossuary did not house the bones of " Mary the teacher , " but rather of two women , " Mary and Martha . "
" In view of the above , there is no longer any reason to be tempted to link this ossuary ... to Mary Magdalene or any other person in biblical , non-biblical or church tradition , " Pfann wrote .
In the interest of telling a good story , Pfann said , the documentary engaged in some " fudging " of the facts .
" James Cameron is a great guru of science fiction , and he 's taking it to a new level with Simcha Jacobovici .
You take a little bit of science , spin a good yarn out of it and you get another ' Terminator ' or ' Life of Brian , ' " said Pfann , who briefly appeared as an ossuary expert in the documentary .
In Israel on Tuesday for a screening of the film , the Toronto - based Jacobovici welcomed Pfann 's criticism , saying " every inscription should be re-examined . "
But Jacobovici said scholars who researched the ossuary in the past agreed with the film 's reading .
" Anyone who looks at it can see that the script was written by the same hand , " he added .
Jacobovici has faced criticism much tougher than Pfann 's academic critique .
The film has been termed " archaeo - porn , " and Jacobovici has been accused of " pimping the Bible . "
Jacobovici attributes most of the criticism to scholars ' discomfort with journalists " casting light into their ossuary monopoly . "
" What we 're doing is democratizing this knowledge , and this is driving some people crazy , " he said .

Not one of these activities has altered qualitatively over the past century , while in the previous hundred years they altered beyond recognition .
We do not live in the age of technological revolution .
We live in the age of technological stasis , but do not realise it .
We watch the future and have stopped watching the present .
When I finish reading most books , they hang around on shelves , prop up tables or go to friends .
David Edgerton 's The Shock of the Old is a book I can use .
I can take it in two hands and bash it over the heads of every techno- nerd , computer geek and neophiliac futurologist I meet .
Edgerton is a historian of science at Imperial College in London and must be a brave man .
He has taken each one of his colleagues ' vested interests and stamped on it with hobnailed boots .
No , research and development do not equate with economic progress .
No , the computer is not a stunning technological advance , just an extension of electronic communication as known for over a century .
No , the internet has not transformed most people 's lives , just helped them do faster what they did before .
No , weapons technology has not transformed warfare , merely wasted stupefying sums of money while soldiers win or lose by firing rifles .
Technological innovation is always hyped by those lobbying for money , usually from government .
But , says Edgerton , if we only attended to ends rather than means we would waste less and get more right .
Scientists never feed into their equations the opportunity cost of their successes , let alone the cost of their failures .
Where now are such " life - changing revolutions " as supersonic travel , manned moon flight , coal hydrogenation , system - built housing , brain lobotomy , drip - dry shirts and electric knives ?
How come more goods travel by ship than ever ?
How come the fastest - growing domestic industry is housework and do - it - yourself ?
To Edgerton the thesis that civilisation must innovate or die is rubbish .
Nations are not sharks that must move to breathe .
Yet we are so dazzled by newness as to lose the power of scepticism , indeed of reason itself .
The result is a grotesque overselling of the new and neglect of what is tried and tested .
There is nothing recent in this phenomenon .
Steam power was hugely expensive in resources and manpower and for most of its life probably less efficient than horse power .
At sea it wiped out sail long before it could economically and safely replace it .
On land it required even more horses ( to supply coal and service its terminals ) than before .
Even today there would probably be less traffic on roads if outrageously uneconomic trains did not exist - and so did not divert car journeys to stations - though nobody will believe it .
What Edgerton calls " techno- nationalism " is regularly proclaimed by politicians as vital to domestic economies as they pour money into government research .
There is no evidence of any need for this .
Global technology transfer is virtually free .
What impedes its growth is not lack of invention but government restriction on free trade .
Shrewd countries " borrow " technology , as did Japan after the war and the tiger economies from America in the 1990s .
The most remarkable feature of Edgerton 's book is his emphasis on the durability of past innovations .
Today the fastest - selling cooker in Britain is the Aga .
The fastest - selling home investment is the flatpack , made with cheap foreign labour and transport and assembled by the user .
Most attics and garages are stuffed with kit for which there was no sensible use , from exercise bicycles to fondue machines .
Middle - class women probably do more manual labour than in the 19th century , assisted by such old technology as the washing machine and vacuum cleaner .
Small wonder they still consume those ancient standbys , alcohol , nicotine , cannabis and opium .
Of course , the computer has radically speeded communication .
But for the overwhelming bulk of users ( still only half of Britons and a tiny fraction of the globe ) it merely supplements the post and the telephone .
Most people send emails back and forth twice a day , roughly the same exchange as the Victorian letter post achieved .
Amazon and eBay have replicated but not replaced the retail market .
Television , 80 years old , and radio have improved but not changed over time .
Both were essentially Victorian innovations .
The greatest techno - dazzle involves flying .
The glamour of defying gravity created a global Icarus complex .
Air forces have won over every generation of 20th - century politician , yet have never delivered .
They have killed civilians and wrecked property but not won wars .
More serious , the cost of new planes so overwhelms budgets as to leave land troops underequipped - as is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Ministers are putty in the hands of airborne weapons suppliers .
Yet any analysis of the past half - century will show the rifle , the mortar and ( in Africa ) the machete are the tools of success .
The technology of war , supposed galvaniser of innovation , has barely changed in a hundred years .
Indeed by replacing battlefront bravery with stand - off cowardice , air innovation could be said to contribute to defeat .
The fastest - rising aid to mobility is another Victorian invention , the car , dependent on internal carbon combustion .
Flights are trivial , a minuscule percentage in any sense necessary .
Planes are used overwhelmingly for holidays , business and perks .
Yet lobbyists sell planes ( and airports ) as " economically vital " to the nation .
This neophilia at least has its piquant moments .
HG Wells wrote in The Shape of Things to Come ( in 1937 ) that " airmen will bring peace and civilisation to a war - devastated world " .
He forecast that within 30 years the world would agree a new global order based on the hub of intercontinental aviation .
And where was that hub ?
His answer was Basra .
There is still a hotel in Basra decorated with murals of glorious pilots ushering in this brave new world .
It is ( or was on my last visit ) a British officers ' club .
Every night mortars try to wipe it off the face of the earth in a nasty Victorian - style war .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Some English people have resorted to pulling out their own teeth because they cannot find -- or cannot afford -- a dentist , a major study has revealed .
Six percent of those surveyed in an English study said they had resorted to dental " self - treatment . "
Six percent of those questioned in a survey of 5,000 patients admitted they had resorted to self - treatment using pliers and glue , the UK's Press Association reported .
England has a two - tier dental care system with some dentists offering publicly subsidized treatment through the National Health Service and others performing more expensive private work .
But more than three - quarters of those polled said they had been forced to pay for private treatment because they had been unable to find an NHS dentist .
Almost a fifth said they had refused dental treatment because of the cost .
One respondent in Lancashire , northern England , claimed to have extracted 14 of their own teeth with a pair of pliers .
In Liverpool , one of those collecting data for the survey interviewed three people who had pulled out their own teeth in one morning .
" I took most of my teeth out in the shed with pliers .
I have one to go , " another respondent wrote .
Others said they had fixed broken crowns using glue to avoid costly dental work .
Valerie Halsworth , 64 , told British television 's GMTV she had removed seven of her own teeth using her husband 's pliers when her toothache became unbearable and she was unable to find an NHS dentist willing to treat her .
Halsworth admitted that the first extraction had been " excruciatingly painful . "
But she added : " It got that painful that I just had to do something ...
When you have taken a tooth out ... the pain has gone . "
Sharon Grant , chair of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health , which commissioned the survey , said : " These findings indicate that the NHS dental system is letting many patients down very badly .
" Where NHS dental services are available , people are happy with the quality of treatment provided but many find the NHS fee system confusing and expensive , with some patients taking out loans to pay for treatment or more worryingly taking matters into their own hands . "

What Global Warming Looks Like
New report visualizes impact of sea level rise -- and it's not pretty .
Sept. 14 , 2007  -- Edward Mazria wants people to know how rising sea levels — made worse by global warming — will affect residents along U.S. coastlines .
Goodbye , Hollywood , Fla .
So long , Boston .
New Orleans ?
Forget about it .
" We 're not talking about South Sea islands and Bangladesh here , " Mazria said .
" We 're talking about the U.S. being physically under siege with a very small increment of sea level rise . "
Mazria is n't a climatologist .
He 's not even a scientist .
He 's an architect who gave up running his company in January to devote his time to a nonprofit group he founded several years ago .
Called Architecture 2030 , the organization tries to bring attention to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that the building sector contributes to global warming through inefficient electricity use , lighting , heating and cooling .
" The building sector is responsible for close to half of all energy consumption in this country and close to half of all greenhouse gas emissions , " he said .
Buildings are the single largest contributor to global warming , he said , emitting more than even automobiles .
To demonstrate Mazria 's point , Architecture 2030 has compiled a report that features images depicting the dramatic effects of sea level rise — from about 3 to 16 feet — on 31 cities around the country .
The 2030 Challenge
The chief villain contributing to global warming , Mazria said , is coal that is burned in power plants to generate electricity in buildings .
Mazria 's group has issued the " 2030 Challenge , " calling for greatly improved efficiency standards in new and renovated buildings in the coming decades .
The goal is to make buildings " carbon neutral " by 2030 .
The plan has been adopted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the American Institute of Architects , among others .
If the goal can be reached , Mazria said , demand for coal should drop dramatically .
" Seventy - six percent of the energy produced in this country goes just to operating buildings .
That 's heating , lighting , cooling and hot water , " Mazria said .
" Our focus has been on how to reduce the demand side so we do n't need the new coal plants . "
So Long , Boston
The images of cities under a layer of water in the Architecture 2030 report are eye - opening .
Mazria said they took a year to compile , using government elevation data combined with Google Earth maps .
The results show wide swaths of Miami and Hollywood , Fla. , under water after just 3 feet of sea level rise .
With about 5 feet of sea level rise , Galveston , Texas , would lose its airport and much of the area around it .
And if San Francisco sees a 8 - foot sea level rise , the waters of McCovey Cove would be lapping across the infield at AT&T Park .
Sea level rise of 3 feet by the end of this century may seem apocalyptic , but some leading scientists say it is a very real possibility .
In a report issued earlier this year , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — it 's made up of thousands of scientists from around the world — said various warming scenarios could raise sea levels anywhere from 7 to 23 inches .
Many researchers , however , consider the panel 's estimates conservative because of the uncertain contribution that melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could make to sea level in coming decades .
" We do not have good models that include all of the relevant physics for the ice sheets , " said James Hansen , a top climate scientist at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
But Hansen said that if humans continue to heat the atmosphere in a business - as - usual fashion — and the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets start to collapse — all bets are off .
" Once a collapse starts , things can happen very rapidly , " Hansen said .
" I would expect that it 's almost certain that before the end of the century we would have sea level rise measured in meters .
At least one or 2 or 3 meters [ 6 to 9 feet ] this century if we follow business as usual . "
With so many people around the world living within several meters of sea level , the implications could be catastrophic .
" A large fraction of people live within several meters ' elevation of sea level , " said Hansen .
" So we would be talking about hundreds of millions of people being displaced if sea level goes up a few meters .
So we really can't afford to go down that path . "
Mazria , like Hansen , believes humans must act now to dramatically reduce the use of coal .
The Architecture 2030 report claims that any other measures proposed to fight global warming are almost futile .
Consider the following statistics , which were calculated by Architecture 2030 using government data .
" Wal - Mart is investing a half billion dollars to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of their existing buildings by 20 percent over the next seven years , " the report stated .
" If every Wal - Mart Supercenter met this target , the CO2 emissions from only one medium - sized coal - fired power plant , in just one month of operation each year , would negate this entire effort . "
" California passed legislation to cut CO2 emissions in new cars by 25 percent and in SUVs by 18 percent , starting in 2009 .
If every car and SUV sold in California in 2009 met this standard , the CO2 emissions from only one medium - sized coal - fired power plant , in just eight months of operation each year , would negate this entire effort . "
Grim figures , for sure , But Mazria does n't want anyone to lose hope , either .
" The American public is exceptional at taking a hold of a problem and solving it , " he said .
" If there 's a need to do something , we 'll do it . "

I have seen the “ right tool for the job ” comment one too many times , and felt like writing something about it .
Real tools are pretty simple , really .
Things like saws and hammers have been around for thousands of years , and do n’t require a great deal of thinking to understand .
Some people are masters with hand tools and create wonderful works of art with them , but the tools themselves are not complex .
My programming language , Hecl , is a pretty simple one in a lot of ways ( it has to be , to fit on cell phones ) , and at last count , the core has 7670 lines in a rough count that includes comments .
That entails quite a few “ moving parts ” compared to even something like an electric drill .
Programming languages are complex .
Certainly to create , but even to use well ; to understand the nooks and crannies and ramifications of the language ’s design is not something that is accomplished in a few days for most people .
Your average programmer really does n’t know all that many languages , and even those who know many probably do n’t use most of them on a day to day basis .
I like learning new languages , yet still would n’t relish the idea of going through the mental task - switch required to move between too many in one day .
What this means , is that when there is a job to be done , most programmers will reach for what they already know , rather than the best possible system , and that makes sense .
If you know Python , why not write web software in Python , if you get asked to create something for the web ?
Or if you know Tcl because you create gui’s with Tk , you ’re still likely to pick it when you need to create a little server .
There are reasons why something like Erlang might make for a better server platform than Tcl , but is it that much better to justify dropping everything , learning a new language , committing to a new set of infrastructure requirements , and adding another thing to ask of people joining your organization ?
Most likely , it is not , unless the server you ’re writing is for a telephony switch that has to be on all the time , in which case , yes , maybe you do need Erlang .
If , as is often the case , it was n’t something that had to be the best in the world , all that extra time to learn a new language would have been mostly “ wasted ” ( ignoring , of course , the fact that for individuals , learning new things is almost always good , but that ’s not what we ’re talking about ) .
Even the smart folks who hack away in languages like Haskell are fond of using what it has to offer , rather than jumping ship to something else at the first hint of the “ something else ” being better at their language of choice for a given task .
So both Tcl and Erlang were up to the task of creating a little server .
You could have used Ruby or Python as well .
Java might prove a bit more verbose , but it ’s certainly up to the task .
Any number of languages would be , of course .
So it ’s not like there is a “ right tool ” and a “ wrong tool ” .
Maybe a better analogy is languages are like toolboxes , or even whole workshops , full of tools .
Most of them have most of the common tools like hammers and saws , some sort of web libraries or the means to create tcp / ip servers .
Where they differ is in things like the amount of tools available , the specialized tools that you get for free , the craftsmanship and ease of use of the tools in the hands of both experts and beginners … or in some cases ( lisp , say ) , some fancy tools and supplies that make it possible to build yourself some new tools if you need to ( that only you know how to use , but that ’s another topic ) .
Some sets of tools really are n’t very good for some jobs – you do n’t want to build blazing fast 3 - d shooter games in PHP , just as you would n’t want to use a regular set of screwdrivers on a delicate watch .
However , even though you ’d want to use a toolset that also has some specialized tools for working on the watch , you ’d rather own a toolbox that came with the watch tools as well as the regular Phillips screwdrivers , because those are pretty handy around the house , and it would n’t do to have only the watch tools for fixing common household items .
The point being , languages are big investments , so those that do more , even if they ’re not the absolute greatest or first choice for a given task , are generally going to be more useful to more people , especially those just starting out who want a “ safe ” choice , a language they know will let them do a variety of things , rather than only one or two things ( pound nails , say ) really well .
From a case study I 'm reading for class : " Mikitani ( founder of Japanese e- commerce company Rakuten ) considered but rejected the idea of acquiring a U.S. company that had developed software for online malls . "

Claim : Champagne glasses were modeled on Marie Antoinette ’s breasts .
FALSE
Example : [ Snegireva , 2007 ]
The “ saucer ” shaped glass is another Champagne icon associated with a celebrity sex symbol .
The Champagne coupe is often claimed to have been modeled on the shape of the breast of a French aristocrat , often cited as Marie Antoinette or Madame de Pompadour .
Origins :
The search for amusing bits of trivia to trot out at cocktail parties leads many to the misbelief that the saucer - shaped champagne glass was modeled on a famed beauty ’s breast .
Over the years , this claim has been made of a number of women :
Marie Antoinette ( 1755 -1793 ) :
This narcissistic French queen ( wife of Louis XVI and of apocryphal “ Let them eat cake ! ” fame ) was said to have had champagne glasses fashioned from casts of her breasts so courtiers could drink to her health from them .
and Madame du Pompadour ( 1721 -1764 ) :
This mistress of France ’s Louis XV supposedly had the glasses crafted as a special gift for her imperial lover who it was said greatly admired her breasts and longed to be able to drink champagne from them .
supposedly had the glasses crafted as a special gift for her imperial lover who it was said greatly admired her breasts and longed to be able to drink champagne from them .
Madame du Barry ( 1743-1793 ) :
The same story told about du Pompadour is also told of du Barry , another mistress of France ’s Louis XV .
another mistress of France ’s Empress Josephine ( 1763 -1814 ) :
This wife of Napoleon had a great fondness for the bubbly ( her champagne bills were said to have horrified her husband ) , so it ’s not surprising this legend would attach to her .
Diane de Poitiers ( 1499 - 1566 ) :
This mistress of Henry II was said to have commissioned a glassblower at their Chateau d’Anet to make them as a present to Henry , who was particularly enamored of her breasts and harbored a fantasy to drink wine from them .
In another version of the tale , Henry was the one who came up with this idea , and the mold was solely of her left breast .

In another version of the tale , Henry was the one who came up with this idea , and the mold was solely of her left breast .
Helen of Troy : Helen was said to possess “ the face that launched a thousand ships , ” a reference to her husband , Menelaus , coming after her and her lover , Paris , with a force of thousands .
It is said Paris made wax molds of her breasts , then used those molds as forms for drinking glasses .
None of the “ famed beauty ’s breast ” tales hold up .
Champagne was invented in the 17th century when a Benedictine monk discovered a way to trap bubbles of carbon dioxide in wine .
As for the glass , it was designed and made in England especially for champagne around 1663 , a chronology that rules out du Barry , du Pompadour , Josephine , and Marie Antoinette , all of whom were born
long after the coupe came into existence .
As for de Poitiers , she died a century before either the glass or the beverage was invented .
And if she existed at all , Helen of Troy antedated both champagne and the champagne glass by about two millennia .
No one knows how this rumor began , but a good guess would be someone ’s drunken observations on the shape of the glass coupled with a dollop of male fantasy sparked it off .
The coupe is further associated with ladies ’ breasts by the oft - repeated claim that prospective members of the Folies Bergere dance troupe were subjected to a champagne glass test — a coupe fit over their naked breasts determined who was eligible .
Provided the young ladies ’ charms remained within the glass , they were still in the running ; if their natural wonders overflowed , it was , well , tough titties for them .
Popularity and salacious lore aside , the coupe is not the glass of choice for champagne connoisseurs .
Fans of the grape swear that the best glasses to tipple from are flutes , which are tall and thin with lips that curve inward slightly at the top .
Flutes concentrate the bubbles and the bouquet , heightening the champagne experience .
Coupes encourage the wine to warm and go flat quickly .

Economists of the Austrian School of economics define inflation differently than much of the mainstream of the economics profession .
The typical mainstream intermediate macroeconomics textbook defines inflation as " [ a ] n increase in the overall level of prices " ( Mankiw , Macroeconomics 5th Edition , 530 ) .
The eminent Austrian economist , Ludwig von Mises , suggested otherwise :
What people today call inflation is not inflation , i.e. , the increase in the quantity of money and money substitutes , but the general rise in commodity prices and wage rates which is the inevitable consequence of inflation .
( Mises , Planning for Freedom , 79 )
A recent exchange between Congressman Ron Paul and Ben Bernanke took place during Bernanke 's testimony before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on November 8 , 2007 .
Congressman Paul , instead of referring to either the PPI or CPI , referred to the MZM money aggregate :
Currently , of course , we can't follow the money supply with M3 but we can follow one of your statistics , which is the MZM — the ready cash available — and we see that inflation is alive and well .
That money supply figure is going up about 20 percent per annualized .
In a typical Austrian analysis of the business cycle , Congressman Paul attributed both the NASDAQ bubble and the more recent housing bubble to interest rate manipulation .
Congressman Paul 's interpretation of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory ( ABCT ) suggests that distorted messages transmitted via the price mechanism to consumers and to investors in particular cause malinvestment to occur within the economy .
Specifically , Congressman Paul pointed out the 1 % federal funds rates that followed the September 11th attacks as evidence of the Federal Reserve distorting the economy and likened the role of the Federal Reserve to that of a price fixer .
After first attributing the problem of bubbles in the economy to the Federal Reserve 's expansion of the money supply , Congressman Paul then questioned how a further inflation could prove helpful .
The Achilles heel of all statist attempts at central economic planning is the problem of economic calculation .
Ludwig von Mises , who first formulated the theory of economic calculation , reasoned that socialist planning was theoretically impossible because of its inability to rationally allocate resources due to the absence of information provided by prices determined in the marketplace .
Mises 's reasoning holds true for artificial manipulation of the " time market " ( Rothbard , Man , Economy , and State , 375 ) for interest rates :
What economic calculation requires is a monetary system whose functioning is not sabotaged by government interference .
( Mises , Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth , 225 )
Artificially low interest rates result in an impairment of the economy 's ability to perform economic calculation .
In 1974 , the year following the death of Ludwig von Mises , Friedrich August von Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his " pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and for their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic , social and institutional phenomena . "
Hayek 's Nobel Prize–winning theories drew directly from Mises 's work on the business cycle .
Hayek showed , in his book Prices and Production , how monetary distortions caused by inflation and credit expansion cause the capital structure of the economy to become maladjusted .
New money that enters the economy does not affect all economic actors equally nor does new money influence all economic actors at the same time .
Newly created money must enter into the economy at a specific point .
Generally this monetary injection comes via credit expansion through the banking sector .
Those who receive this new money first benefit at the expense of those who receive the money only after it has snaked through the economy and prices have had a chance to adjust .
Perhaps the most current rendition of the ABCT is that of Professor Roger Garrison .
In Garrison 's model , as presented in his book Time and Money , the market for loanable funds is linked to a production possibilities curve that shows the economic tradeoff between capital investment and consumption .
These two diagrams are then linked to a Hayekian Triangle illustrating the capital structure of the economy .
Through his model , the manipulation of the money supply by a central bank can be analyzed .
By lowering interest rates below a sustainable market level a diversion develops between the time preferences of investors and consumers .
The result is malinvestment in capital goods by entrepreneurs .
In due time , this " cluster of errors " by investors manifests itself in a recession .
Bernanke responded to Congressman Paul 's remarks on inflation by saying that the Fed is acting under its Congressional mandate to promote full employment and maintain price stability .
Bernanke 's remark prompted Congressman Paul to open a second Austrian front in his war of economic theory with the Fed Chairman .
Congressman
Paul pointed out that the value of the dollar is falling not just domestically , but also abroad .
How can you do this and pursue this , the policy that you have , without further weakening the dollar ?
There 's a dollar crisis out there and people 's money is being stolen ; people who have saved , they 're being robbed .
Congressman Paul continued :
I mean , if you have a devaluation of the dollar at 10 percent , people have been robbed at 10 percent .
But how can you pursue this policy without addressing the subject that somebody 's losing their wealth because of a weaker dollar ?
Fed Chairman Bernanke , however , saw no such problem .
According to Bernanke :
If somebody has their wealth in dollars and they 're going to buy consumer goods in dollars and it's a typical American , then the decline in the dollar , the only effect it has on their buying powers , it makes imported goods more expensive .
While Bernanke 's conclusion is correct in that the decline in the dollar will cause imported goods to become more expensive , only an acute case of myopia can prevent one from seeing that the rising price of imported goods is not the " only effect it has on their ( the typical American 's ) buying powers . "
Murray Rothbard was aware of the profound implications caused by the occurrence of falling exchange rates in the period following President Nixon 's 1971 announcement that the United States was withdrawing from the International Gold Exchange Standard .
American tourists suffer abroad , and cheap exports are snapped up by foreign countries so rapidly as to raise prices of exports at home ( e.g. , the American wheat - and - meat price inflation ) .
So that American exporters might indeed benefit , but only at the expense of the inflation - ridden American consumer .
( Rothbard , What Has Government Done to Our Money ? , 54 )
A few short years after Nixon declared the United States Government bankrupt by refusing to repay debts in gold , the United States economy began to suffer its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
An inflationary recession had arrived and this time the embattled American consumer could seek no solace in the " merciful veil of deflation " ( Rothbard , America 's Great Depression , xxxiii ) .
The stagflation of the 1970s brought with it high unemployment and high inflation .
Another casualty caused by a falling exchange rate is the economy 's structure of capital .
Ludwig Lachmann emphasized that " capital resources are heterogeneous " ( Lachmann , Capital and Its Structure , 2 ) .
Any particular capital good ( higher order good , i.e. , not a consumer good ) can only be used for a limited number of purposes .
Capital goods , in other words , are not perfect substitutes for one another .
Only specific combinations of capital goods can complement each other such that a harmonious integration of the economy 's capital structure results .
The limited range of uses of any particular capital good is what Lachmann referred to as " multiple specificity . "
When capital goods can no longer be profitably employed in their original optimal configuration , the owner of the capital must revise his plans .
Capital goods will then be regrouped and employed at their best alternative uses on a scale of alternative possibilities .
In this process , a loss of value will often result because the capital is now employed in ways other than those for which it was originally intended .
Changes in exchange rates brought about by the Federal Reserve 's expansion of the money supply inevitably results in relative price changes of the factors of production .
This is not the working of the free market allocating society 's scarce resources to meet the most urgent needs .
These relative price changes will invariably result in a shift of the rates of industry profitability in favor of certain industries and at the expense of other industries .
Friction occurs within the economy while the structure of capital grudgingly restructures as it loses value accommodating the new economic landscape produced by governmental interference in the workings of the free market .
In conclusion , inflation wreaks havoc on the structure of capital .
It does so not only through the intertemporal misallocation of resources that takes place when the interest rate no longer reflects the social rate of time preference , but inflation also wrecks the existing structure of capital by introducing unpredictability into entrepreneurs ' plans that rest on predictable exchange rates .
Wealth is lost not only through a devaluation of currency , but also by way of the transition of capital from its intended uses , in the face of a now unprofitable business venture , towards its second best use .
A central - bank - engineered monetary expansion producing falling exchange rates is a pecuniary externality resulting in a Lachmannesque kaleidoscopic vision of capital forever in disequilibrium .
Here ’s what I wrote following that appearance : “ Mr. Greenspan ’s performance yesterday , in his first official testimony since he let the genie out of the bottle , was a profile in cowardice .
Again and again he was offered the opportunity to say something that would help rein in runaway tax - cutting ; each time he evaded the question , often replying by reading from his own previous testimony .
He declared once again that he was speaking only for himself , thus granting himself leeway to pronounce on subjects far afield of his role as Federal Reserve chairman .
But when pressed on the crucial question of whether the huge tax cuts that now seem inevitable are too large , he said it was inappropriate for him to comment on particular proposals .
“ In short , Mr. Greenspan defined the rules of the game in a way that allows him to intervene as he likes in the political debate , but to retreat behind the veil of his office whenever anyone tries to hold him accountable for the results of those interventions . ”
I received an irate phone call from Mr. Greenspan after that article , in which he demanded to know what he had said that was wrong .
In his book , he claims that Robert Rubin , the former Treasury secretary , was stumped by that question .
That ’s hard to believe , because I certainly was n’t : Mr. Greenspan ’s argument for tax cuts was contorted and in places self - contradictory , not to mention based on budget projections that everyone knew , even then , were wildly overoptimistic .
If anyone had doubts about Mr. Greenspan ’s determination not to inconvenience the Bush administration , those doubts were resolved two years later , when the administration proposed another round of tax cuts , even though the budget was now deep in deficit .
And guess what ?
The former high priest of fiscal responsibility did not object .
And in 2004 he expressed support for making the Bush tax cuts permanent — remember , these are the tax cuts he now says he did n’t endorse — and argued that the budget should be balanced with cuts in entitlement spending , including Social Security benefits , instead .
Of course , back in 2001 he specifically assured Congress that cutting taxes would not threaten Social Security .
In retrospect , Mr. Greenspan ’s moral collapse in 2001 was a portent .
It foreshadowed the way many people in the foreign policy community would put their critical faculties on hold and support the invasion of Iraq , despite ample evidence that it was a really bad idea .
And like enthusiastic war supporters who have started describing themselves as war critics now that the Iraq venture has gone wrong , Mr. Greenspan has started portraying himself as a critic of administration fiscal irresponsibility now that President Bush has become deeply unpopular and Democrats control Congress .

Though it would n’t mean anything to Hillary Clinton , a football metaphor has been used to describe her campaign .
Blogger Kirk Caraway , for example , writes : “ Hillary has the best campaign organization , and knows that the nomination is hers as long as she does n’t make a mistake .
But just like a football team playing prevent defense , sometimes it prevents you from winning . ”
While the term “ prevent defense ” is n’t used much anymore in pro football , the strategy itself is still used .
When the clock is winding down and a team finds itself with a slim lead , the coach is liable to go all conservative on us .
Since everyone knows that the losing team needs to pass to catch up , he plays his team ’s defensive backs deep .
The offense is thus able to complete short passes in front of them .
But it ’s almost impossible to connect on a scoring strike .
Still , as every fan can tell you , a succession of short passes against it takes the team down the road to defeat as sure as a long pass .
Hillary Clinton ’s conservative strategy leaves her wide open to attacks from those on the left who question her opposition to our presence in Iraq .
But to her and her staff , that ’s just giving up short passes and they ’re unlikely to yield enough points , or votes , to lose .
Were she to call for complete withdrawal , though , the charge that she ’s soft on defense might stick .
The fear on the part of Clinton ’s people is that , the equivalent of a long pass , it might yield enough votes against her to prevent her from being nominated .
Assuming she is , though , the Democrats will find that running Hillary is like playing a prevent defense from the opening whistle .
First , there ’s the infamous October 20 Zogby poll that shows 50 % of the poll ’s respondents would never vote for Hillary .
( In the process turning the old clichÃ© “ Never say never ” on its head until it cries “ Always say never . ” )
Second , Hillary is only leading Giuliani by three or four points .
How , you ask , can a Republican spurned by the base of much of his party find himself that close to the leading representative of the stronger team , the Democrats ?
Because , even though the hard right characterizes her as the epitome of liberalism , Hillary is a Democrat in name only , equally as unpopular with the base of her party as Giuliani is with his .
The Democrats sell themselves short by using the prevent defense when the Republicans are n’t , for one reason or another , fielding their best team .
They handicap themselves by opting for a candidate capable of providing only a slim margin of victory .
With Mike Huckabee closing the Iowa gap on Romney ( sorry , ca n’t bear to call a grown man “ Mitt ” ) , the prevent defense , as is its wont , might backfire on the Democrats in the election .
Settling for winning by a whisker could result in the Democrats playing the most morose game of Monday Morning Quarterback ever .
Puzzlement ; who is ' winning ' the so - called " war - on - drugs ? "
This fifth in a series of articles pertaining to the " War on Drugs " illustrates a huge disconnect from our government toward average citizens .
To write this piece , I interviewed my brother , 18 year veteran police officer and detective , Howard Wooldridge ( retired ) , now with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , www.leap.cc, stationed in Washington , DC .
" One hundred and forty two years ago lawmakers amended the United States Constitution to eliminate slavery and give full citizenship to the freed slaves , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" How well has ' freedom ' worked for the descendants of slaves ?
Certainly there has been tremendous progress in the past several decades .
Record numbers of African - Americans hold elected offices and important positions in government .
" Just as certain , millions of blacks have been put in chains , lost their votes , even had their children taken away from them .
Black neighborhoods are too often plagued with violence , crime and despair .
For over 100 years Jim Crow kept the black population from enjoying citizenship .
In the past 36 years the ' War on Drugs ' has devastated African - Americans nearly as much as Jim Crow . "
By the late 1960s Jim Crow laws of the South disappeared .
The KKK 's power to intimidate blacks and local politicians vanished like a raindrop in the Sahara Desert .
With the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 , millions of blacks voted for the first time .
African - Americans made progress economically , educationally , spiritually and politically .
The Old South would never be the same , or at least it seemed that would happen .
The future appeared bright .
" Then , President Nixon launched a ' War on Drugs ' in 1971 , " Officer Howard Wooldridge said .
" He committed the United States to a ' drug - free ' America , established the Drug Enforcement Administration and poured money into law enforcement to stop this ' scourge . '
President Reagan continued this battle cry of a ' drug - free ' America and added mandatory minimums to those possessing or selling drugs .
We ' public - service troops ' in law enforcement knew it to be a " War on People " – mostly People of Color .
Whether by design , ignorance or lack of research , the New Prohibition policy has been nothing short of devastating to people of color – black Americans in particular .
Blatant discrimination ; blacks are the losers
" Due to racial profiling and the nature by which blacks sell drugs openly on the streets , they are incarcerated at a ratio of about eight to one over white drug dealers .
As they are more visible to buyers , so are they more obvious to others who want the dealer 's money , drugs and selling turf .
Thus , everyone buys weapons to protect themselves or to rob and kill the dealers .
" Black neighborhoods have been for decades plagued by gunfire and death .
Minor disputes escalate into deadly force being employed .
The quality of life in a black neighborhood , never that prosperous , has been dramatically lowered due to another , unintended consequence of drug prohibition . "
Life has been cheapened by the decades of violent deaths .
A recent drive - by shooting in Washington DC resulted in seven people hit by bullets as everyone ducked for cover .
Because it happened that the victims were black , the local paper buried it on page 17 .
Since the policy of the drug war gives a job option to a million teens , thousands have been shot and killed .
However , no one outside the victim 's family raises an eyebrow when a 15 year old dies on the street corner .
We no longer react to the horror of a violent death at such a young age , especially when the victim is black .
" Homeowners put iron bars across all the windows , trying to stop thieves , " Officer Wooldridge said .
" Every year dozens of black children die in house fires , unable to get out .
These young , innocent victims never saw another birthday because of drug prohibition .
You may not count them as drug war victims – but I do .
Political solution has become more difficult
ONE consequence of the growth of microelectronics has been an exploration of the periodic table reminiscent of European navigators ' search for the spice islands half a millennium ago .
Then , as now , the objective was material of great rarity and value , which was needed in only small quantities but which did jobs that nothing else could manage .
In the case of nutmeg , cloves and mace , the job was to enhance the taste of food and demonstrate wealth and sophistication .
They were so valuable that wars were fought to control the supply of some .
In the case of indium , gallium and tantalum it is their unique electrical properties that are of interest .
Indium - tin oxide , for example , is both transparent and electrically conductive .
Without it , liquid - crystal display screens would be much harder to make .
Meanwhile tantalum ( used as an insulator in mobile - phone chips ) once became so valuable that it , too , helped drive a war — the civil war in eastern Congo , where its ore has been dusted over the countryside like icing sugar by ancient volcanic eruptions .
The latest element to be dragged out of obscurity by the chemist - descendants of Prince Henry the Navigator is hafnium .
This metal ( or , rather , its oxide ) is the magic ingredient that computer - chip designers hope will enable them to carry on shrinking the transistors on their products in obedience to Gordon Moore 's famous law that the number of such transistors on a given area of chip will double every two years or so .
Indeed , it is the most significant change of recipe since Dr Moore and his colleagues invented the microprocessor back in the 1960s .
Intel , the firm that Dr Moore helped to found on the back of the invention , will introduce its new hafnium - based chip , called Penryn , on November 12th .
Its competitors are expected to follow suit as soon as they can .
At bottom , transistors are electronic valves that use a small voltage at a place called a gate to regulate the flow of current through the rest of the device .
This switching of current is what produces the zeros and ones of binary arithmetic , and is the basic process of computing .
Gates , which are made of silicon , must be electrically isolated .
Until now , that has been done using silicon dioxide — in other words , quartz .
The insulating layer is made by exposing the silicon of the gates to pure oxygen , which is a well - honed manufacturing process .
As transistors have got smaller , though , the silicon - dioxide layer has been made thinner and thinner .
It is now a mere five atoms thick , which is already too thin to be a perfect insulator .
As a result , modern transistors have to accommodate some current leakage .
This has been regarded as a price worth paying to avoid having to reorganise the manufacturing process to accommodate new materials .
Any thinner , however , and the insulation would break down altogether .
Researchers at Intel and elsewhere have seen this problem coming for some time .
In the late 1990s they started to look for a material that could serve as silicon dioxide 's replacement .
They rejected oxides of aluminium ( which is abundant ) and lanthanum ( which is n't ) and eventually lighted upon hafnium .
Hafnium oxide is a very good insulator indeed .
Unfortunately , using it requires completely rebuilding the gate , by including a metal connection between the insulator and the underlying silicon .
( Exactly which metal , all of the companies involved are being cagey about . )
This is a lot harder than just baking the chip in oxygen at the appropriate point in its manufacture , which is why engineers have held out until the last possible moment before making the change .
The new combination of materials is , however , just what Dr Moore ordered .
Penryn chips have twice as many transistors as their predecessors ( about a billion ) .
Just as important , they waste only one - fifth the amount of power in the gate .
With luck , though , the quantities needed for microelectronics will not be worth fighting over .
BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) --
In a game with 136 total points and nearly 1,300 yards of total offense , it was the defense that made the biggest play .
Sooner or later the defense had to make a stop , and Boise State 's Tim Brady did just that on the final play in the fourth overtime period , stuffing a 2 - point conversion attempt in a thrilling 69 - 67 victory over Nevada on Sunday night .
The game set a record for most points in an NCAA Division I - A game since 1937 , when official record keeping began .
The shootout finally ended on a sack by Brady , foiling Nevada 's attempt to send the game into a fifth overtime .
" It was the biggest play we had all night , " Boise State coach Chris Petersen said .
" It 's really too bad someone had to lose this one .
I do n't think I 've felt that way after any game , ever . "
For a while , it seemed this one would never end -- not with the way the offenses were moving up and down the field .
The Broncos ( 5 - 1 , 2 - 0 Western Athletic Conference ) rolled up 627 total yards on offense , including Ian Johnson 's 205 yards rushing and three touchdowns .
Nevada , led by Colin Kaepernick , a redshirt freshman quarterback making his first start , topped the Broncos with 639 total yards .
The Wolfpack ( 2 - 4 , 0 - 2 ) tied the game in the fourth extra period when Luke Lippincott scored on an 8 - yard burst up the middle , capping a rushing attack that amassed 406 yards , the fourth most ever allowed by Boise State .
But Nevada opted to pass on the two - point try , and Kaepernick rolled right , found nobody open then moments later found himself in Brady 's grasp , sealing Boise State 's eighth straight win over the Wolfpack .
" To come up two points short in overtime in a game like this is a hard pill to swallow , " said Kaepernick , who threw for three TDs and rushed for two more .
" We knew we were going to have to keep putting points on the board to stay in the game . "
Talk about an understatement .
Altogether , the teams combined for 17 touchdowns , 1,266 total yards of offense and a handful of personal bests .
Boise State quarterback Taylor
Tharp threw for a career - high 320 yards and four touchdowns .
Two of those came in the first two overtimes , both 25 - yard scoring strikes to Jeremy Childs and Sherm Brasser .
Johnson had 256 yards total offense , including a 32 - yard TD pass , the first of his career in the fourth quarter that put the Broncos up 41 - 34 .
His 72 - yard TD run in the second quarter was the longest of his career .
Kaepernick , starting in place of injured sophomore Nick Graziano , ran for 177 yards and two scores and passed for another 243 yards and three TDs .
His performance came against a Boise State defense that entered the game the third best in the nation , averaging just 12.2 points per game .
" I 'm proud of our guys , " Nevada coach Chris Ault said .
" They came back and stood up all game long .
We 're going to learn a lot from this game and get better . "
The Wolfpack trailed most of the game , but grabbed their first lead late in the fourth when Brett Jaekle made a 35 - yard field goal .
But Boise State freshman Kyle Brotzman sent the game into overtime by nailing a 27 - yard field goal as time expired .
The teams traded touchdowns through the first two overtimes .
In the third , Jaekle put Nevada on top with a 27 - yard field goal , but Brotzman answered with a 29 - yarder .
In the fourth overtime , Johnson scored from a yard out and Tharp lofted a short pass to Jeremy Avery on the 2 - point conversion .
Nevada matched the touchdown , but Brady came up big when he got back up on his feet and chased down Kaepernick to end the game .
" You 've got to give a lot of credit in this game to our offense , " Brady said .
" They battled for us and they kept us in the game because we were n't on top of our game tonight . "
Russia to continue advanced missile tests in 2007 - SMF commander
RIA Novosti
01/09/2007 13:39 MOSCOW , September 1 ( RIA Novosti ) - Russia 's Strategic Missile Forces will conduct more tests of new warheads for its intercontinental ballistic missiles later this year , the SMF commander said Saturday .
" This year we will continue test and combat - training launches of new types of warheads for the Topol - M and Bulava sea- launched missile complexes , " Col. Gen. Nikolai Solovtsov said .
He said previously a second missile battalion , equipped with advanced Topol - M ( SS - 27 ) road - mobile ICBMs , will be put on combat duty before the end of the year and that the deployment of silo - based Topol - M systems in the Saratov Region and road - mobile systems in the Ivanovo Region ( central Russia ) would be completed in 2010 .
As of December 2006 , the Strategic Missile Forces operated 44 silo - based and three mobile missile systems .
The commander said the Topol - M system will be equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles ( MIRV ) in the next two or three years , adding that the new system would help penetrate missile defenses more effectively .
His statement came against the backdrop of growing tensions between Moscow and the West regarding plans by the United States to deploy elements of its global antiballistic missile defense system in Central Europe .
Gen . Solovtsov said the Strategic Missile Forces would factor in the new threats .
" If the U.S. proceeds with missile defense plans , despite serious opposition from people in Europe , the Strategic Missile Forces will manage to take adequate measures to counter threats to Russia , " he said .
The national defense program envisions the deployment of Bulava - M sea-launched ballistic missiles on nuclear submarines .
The missiles are expected to become the mainstay of the Russian Navy 's strategic nuclear forces in decades to come .
The Russian Armed Forces commissioned more than 30 new types of advanced weapon systems in the first half of 2007 , the defense minister said last month .
Anatoly Serdyukov said these weapon systems included the submarine - launched R - 29RM Sineva ballistic missiles , the S - 400 Triumf air defense complex , and the 120 - mm Nona SM - 1 towed mortar for Ground Forces .
Serdykov also said Russia conducted test launches of the Yarts land - based ballistic missile , the X - 102 airborne missile , and a new version of the Iskander - M ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple warheads , and launched two military reconnaissance and communication satellites .

Chapter 34 : Explaining Benford's Law
Digital Signal Processing usually involves signals with either time or space as the independent parameter , such as audio and images , respectively .
However , the power of DSP can also be applied to signals represented in other domains .
This chapter provides an example of this , where the independent parameter is the number line .
The particular example we will use is Benford 's Law , a mathematical puzzle that has caused people to scratch their heads for decades .
The techniques of signal processing provide an elegant solution to this problem , succeeding where other mathematical approaches have failed .
Republicans use obscure motion 16 times in a year , compared to just 14 for the Democrats in more than a decade of opposition
All year long , Democrats in the House of Representatives have watched with increasing impatience as their Senate counterparts find themselves bedevilled by a filibuster - wielding Republican minority .
On measures criticising the war in Iraq , the House has passed four since May to the Senate 's zero ; on annual spending bills , the House has cleared all 12 to the Senate 's six .
That Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and his Senate Republican colleagues routinely have blocked the Democrats from getting the needed 60 votes on many measures has received considerable press attention , even inspiring a splashy " anti-obstruction " media campaign .
What 's far less well known , though , is that the party has almost as nasty a bugaboo in the House .
Republicans there have found stunning success with a procedural tool called the motion to recommit , and they have repeatedly used it to divide the Democratic caucus and block key initiatives .
Sometimes called the MTR , its full name is the motion to recommit , with or without instructions .
Ironically offered as a minority - party right by Newt Gingrich in the heyday of the Contract With America , its aim is to allow the often - powerless House minority a chance to shape legislation as it moves toward a vote .
Even if Democrats allow no debate on amendments to a bill , the MTR guarantees Republicans a vote - usually minutes before final passage - either on new additions they have written or on forcing the measure back to square one .
Republicans have mastered the game of crafting MTRs they know will force Democrats to defect to their side or risk political consequences , especially among the 60 or so Democrats who represent " red " districts .
Some Republicans motions are phrased to ensure a delay of the bill at hand if they pass , compelling Democrats to pull measures from the floor rather than lose precious ground .
When Democrats were in the House minority , they succeeded only rarely in blocking Republican initiatives with the gambit .
The MTR helped push through the television filter known as the " v-chip " in 1995 and nearly closed campaign - finance loopholes aimed at free - spending political groups four years before the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth targeted John Kerry .
Only 14 of the motions , or 7.6 percent of the minority 's efforts , prevailed between 1995 and 2006 .
This year , 16 of the House Republican motions have passed , several with significant support from across the aisle , blocking initiatives large and small .
Remember the effort to bring voting rights in the House to the District of Columbia , which stalled before falling short over the summer ?
It was derailed first by a successful MTR that called for overturning the US capital 's gun ban , which many red-state Democrats supported .
Another gave legal immunity to anyone reporting suspected terrorist activity on public transportation , which some Democrats decried as a call to racial profiling .
But the biggest MTR intrusion of the year came last week , when the Republicans stalled a bill to provide greater judicial oversight of secret wiretapping by the Bush administration with a proposed MTR that even critics begrudgingly called clever .
The motion provided that no court order would be needed to tap the phones of Osama bin Laden and al - Qaida members - a caveat that frustrated Democrats noted was already in their measure .
" All members and all Americans believe in this goal , " one Democratic memo stated , " so the authors cynically wrote this redundant motion in such a way that if it passed it would KILL this important national security bill . "
The MTR now threatens to become as aggravating to the House speaker , Nancy Pelosi , as the filibuster has for Harry Reid , the Senate majority leader .
House Democrats have vowed to bring back the wiretapping bill soon , but there are few solutions in sight for how to defeat the Republican MTR should it rear its head .
" We need some discipline on motions to recommit , " said Massachusetts Democratic congressman Jim McGovern , a veteran of the rules committee that sets procedures for House debate .
" That 's going to come . "
Indeed , Republicans stopped the majority of Democratic MTRs under Mr Gingrich and former speaker Dennis Hastert by treating the votes as purely political .
Even if the minority 's alternative plan had merit , Republican leaders urged solidarity , and the motion 's defeat , as a matter of party loyalty .
Despite a 93 % record of sticking together on House votes this year compared to 84 % for Republicans , Democrats have found party loyalty elusive on several MTRs .
The clash between a Democratic bill and its forced amendment can be stark : to legislation cracking down on the " no- bid " contracts that have driven charges of Bush administration cronyism , Republicans added language requiring colleges to welcome military recruiters onto campus .
Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein , who recently wrote a book on the health of the legislature titled The Broken Branch , predicted that Democrats might have to consider changing the rules for the pesky motions .
" Democrats are not anticipating as well as perhaps they might some things that can come to the floor and heading them off with language that might be in the bill ... to cut the pins out from under the motions to recommit , " Mr Ornstein said .
Such an attempt risks unsavoury coverage that contrasts a mid-year rules change with vows from Ms Pelosi and others to run an open and transparent House .
When some Democrats suggested in March altering the guidelines for relevance ( " germaneness , " in Congress - speak ) of the MTRs , Republicans threatened to walk out of the chamber and halt business altogether .
John Boehner , an Ohio Republican and the House minority leader , crowed at those reports of a planned rules change .
" Perhaps before they game the system by changing the rules to their liking , the Democrat leadership should ask its own members why they are voting in droves for our proposals , " Mr Boehner said , dropping the " - ic " suffix from his rivals ' party in a common Washington putdown .
Faced with the choice between limiting Republican attempts to split their caucus and prodding those members to resist the MTRs , Democrats are likely to choose the latter , at least for the time being .
The Republicans ' 30 - second campaign ad on the wiretapping motion may write itself - featuring ominous Bin Laden visuals and a voiceover murmuring , " Democratic congressman X voted to stop the government from listening to terrorists ' phone calls " - but the party 's nearly 10 - to - 1 fundraising advantage over Republicans helps take the sting out of that threat .
Besides , as Mr McGovern pointed out , " If I order the wrong thing for lunch , these guys will run a 30 - second ad against me . "
The stakes are particularly high for the House wire - tapping vote .
Democrats believe they have the votes to pass their bill , which largely threads the needle in satisfying the liberals and conservatives among them .
But a difficult battle remains with their filibuster - plagued Senate counterparts .
The Senate intelligence committee has offered legal immunity to the telecommunications companies that allowed the Bush administration to eavesdrop without a court order .
That group of senators is the only congressional panel to win access to documents on the purported legal framework for the wiretapping , and Democrats in the House have refused to discuss immunity until their members can examine the documents .
" We can't provide immunity when we do n't know what we 're providing immunity for , " said Stacey Farnen Bernards , a spokeswoman for House majority leader and Maryland Democrat Steny Hoyer .
The Senate judiciary committee soon will take up the intelligence committee 's measure , and its members remain in the dark with the House , denied access to the Bush administration documents .
Even if the Senate begins debating a bill without a shield for the telecoms , however , Republicans there are almost certain to insist on 60 votes to end a filibuster .
Thus Democrats ' ability to beat back an MTR and pass the House bill becomes crucial to establishing the party 's position , as George Bush continues to insist on his way or a veto .
WESTVLETEREN , Belgium -- The Trappist monks at St. Sixtus monastery have taken vows against riches , sex and eating red meat .
They speak only when necessary .
But you can call them on their beer phone .
Monks have been brewing Westvleteren beer at this remote spot near the French border since 1839 .
Their brew , offered in strengths up to 10.2 % alcohol by volume , is among the most highly prized in the world .
In bars from Brussels to Boston , and online , it sells for more than $ 15 for an 11 - ounce bottle -- 10 times what the monks ...
In recent weeks , it has seemed that a day does n't go by without Google becoming embroiled in a new legal controversy .
Earlier this month we covered the company 's antitrust complaint against Microsoft , its negotiations with the EU over its data retention policies , and the FTC 's scrutiny of Google 's DoubleClick acquisition .
Not surprisingly , Google has concluded it can no longer afford to ignore Washington , DC .
Last week the Washington Post published a widely discussed story on the swift expansion of the company 's presence inside the Beltway .
Also last week , the company unveiled a new public policy blog which pledges to " do public policy advocacy in a Googley way . "
The case for regulation
One recent post lays out Google 's position in the network neutrality debate .
Noting that " one of the challenges raised by our opponents has been defining what exactly the term means , " Richard Whitt , Google 's Washington telecom and media counsel , offers details about what would and would n't be permitted under the company 's ideal regulatory scheme .
The requirements
Whitt enumerates closely mirror the terms of the Snowe - Dorgan bill , the most prominent network neutrality legislation introduced last year .
Google wants to ban ISPs from imposing " surcharges on content providers that are not their retail customers , " discriminating among packets based on their source , or building a new " fast lane " that would be limited to content providers who paid extra for the privilege .
Google worries that if cable and telephone incumbents are allowed to build such a tiered network , Google could be forced to pay tribute to companies like AT&T and Verizon or blocked from access to certain customers altogether .
Whitt notes that 99.6 percent of broadband customers get their service from either their phone company or their cable company .
He contends that two firms per market is insufficient to ensure a robust , competitive marketplace .
The devil in the details
There 's certainly reason to be concerned that the Baby Bells — companies with a congenital hostility to open networks — will not respect the Internet 's open architecture .
And as a company whose livelihood depends on that architecture , Google has particular reason to be concerned .
But Google 's post also highlights the difficulties of translating the theory of network neutrality into specific rules .
History shows that it 's difficult to craft a sensible and effective regulatory scheme .
If regulation is too complicated , it can tie ISPs up in red tape and make it more difficult for them to manage their networks effectively .
On the other hand , vague regulations can leave open loopholes that can undermine the entire purpose of the regulation .
And above all , regulators must be wary of unintended consequences ; we can be sure that once a network neutrality rule is on the books , regulated firms will look for ways to turn the rules to their advantage .
One potential loophole can be found in Google 's list of what behaviors are permitted under its proposed rules ( and in the Snowe - Dorgan bill on which it is based ) .
Google would allow ISPs to provide " managed IP services and proprietary content ( like IPTV ) " and to prioritize " all applications of a certain general type , such as streaming video . "
This suggests one strategy that an ISP could employ to evade the intent of the network neutrality rules : it could give video services the lowest priority on its broadband service ( which would apparently be legal as long as all video services were treated the same ) , and then it could syndicate the video content of partner companies via its IPTV service .
It 's not clear how the law would distinguish between a prohibited " Internet fast lane " and a permitted " managed IP services and proprietary content . "
But the effect on the video marketplace would seem to be very similar in either case .
Regulatory capture
There 's also a real danger of what economists call " regulatory capture " : when regulations designed to control the behavior of industry incumbents are manipulated to serve those incumbents ' interests .
One of the first examples of this problem in the United States was the regulation of railroads in the 19th Century .
The railroads were the high - tech industry of their day , and there was a lot of concern in the 1870s and 1880s that the railroads had become too monopolistic .
Congress responded by creating the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887 , giving it the power to regulate the railroads .
Yet as I wrote in the New York Times last year , the story of the ICC does not have a happy ending .
After President Grover Cleveland appointed Thomas M. Cooley , a railroad ally , as its first chairman , the Commission quickly fell under the control of the railroads , gradually transforming the American transportation industry into a cartel .
By 1935 , when it was given oversight of the trucking industry , the commission was restricting competition and enabling price increases throughout virtually the entire surface transportation industry .
Decades later , in 1970 , a report released by a Ralph Nader group described the Commission as " primarily a forum at which transportation interests divide up the national transportation market . "
And not all examples of regulatory capture are ancient history .
Until the 1970s , consumers paid high prices for airline tickets thanks to limitations on competition enforced by the Civil Aeronautics Board .
The cable industry has used cable franchising rules — which were originally intended to protect consumers — to exclude the Baby Bells from the video market , allowing them to charge monopolistic rates for cable television .
And the Bells themselves are using a slew of telecom regulations — Universal Service fees , E - 911 requirements , CALEA , and others — to harass up - and - coming VoIP providers .
Something similar could happen if network neutrality regulations are adopted .
Once Congress passes a bill like Snowe - Dorgan , it would fall to the FCC to enact specific regulations that implement the bil 's requirements .
Google advocates imposing several new obligations on all Internet service providers : " requiring carriers to submit semiannual reports with broadband deployment data , " interconnection and open access requirements , a " ban on most forms of packet discrimination , " and " an effective enforcement regime . "
These requirements could lead to FCC bureaucrats second - guessing the decisions ISPs make about their router configurations .
And at a minimum , it would require every ISP in the country to hire telecom lawyers to deal with the FCC 's oversight process .
That 's worrisome because new technologies are likely to introduce additional competition to incumbent broadband providers in the next decade or two .
Some of them may not have the deep pockets of a Verizon or a Google .
Overly burdensome regulations could become a barrier to entry for these smaller firms .
Incumbents are likely to file a slew of complaints against these competitors .
Even if the incumbents ultimately lose in court , such harassment could be sufficient to drain small firms ' resources , slow them down , and drive them into bankruptcy .
Indeed , that 's precisely the strategy they used against competitive local exchange carriers during the DSL wars of the late 1990s .
Wait and see ?
Given the complexities and uncertainties involved in the network neutrality debate , it could be that the best outcome would be for Congress to continue to take a wait - and - see posture .
Princeton computer science professor Ed Felten made precisely this point in a paper last year :
There is a good policy argument in favor of doing nothing and letting the situation develop further .
The present situation , with the network neutrality issue on the table in Washington but no rules yet adopted , is in many ways ideal .
ISPs , knowing that discriminating now would make regulation seem more necessary , are on their best behavior ; and with no rules yet adopted we do n't have to face the difficult issues of linedrawing and enforcement .
Enacting strong regulation now would risk side - effects , and passing toothless regulation now would remove the threat of regulation .
Network neutrality is an important principle of the Internet 's design .
But given the FCC 's poor track record at serving the interests of consumers , we should think twice before giving the agency more authority over the Internet — even to defend a worthy principle .
It 's quite possible that the mere threat of new regulations will be sufficient to keep the telcos on their best behavior .
And threatening to enact new regulations has far fewer negative side effects than actually enacting them .

PORTSMOUTH —
A complaint about a couple having sex on someone else�s trampoline prompted a Saturday evening police call .
According to police records , officers were dispatched to an unspecified neighborhood on August 11 at 11:41 p.m. , after a caller said she heard some noise , looked out her window , then �saw a couple having sex on her trampoline . �
The caller told a police dispatcher she yelled at the couple , they put their clothes on and left the area .
Police Lt. Rodney McQuate told the Herald that officers were dispatched to the residence and based on a description of the female having �long dirty blonde hair , � were unable to locate the randy couple .
McQuate said officers then questioned people at a nearby party , but no one volunteered any information and the party was shut down .
CPython Extensions for IronPython
A Proof of Concept Using Python.NET
Note
This article describes one way to use CPython extensions from IronPython / .NET by embedding CPython itself via Python .
NET .
Since this article was written a much more practical approach has been implemented as an Open Source project by Resolver Systems .
This project fakes Python25.dll and has a large subset of the Python C API implemented in C# .
A large percentage ( around a thousand tests at the time of writing ) of the Numpy test suite passes when used from IronPython and other whole extension libraries are usable : Ironclad Introduction
Ironclad Project Page ( with Downloads )
Introduction
This module came out of The C Extensions for IronPython Project started by Resolver Systems .
This module allow you to access CPython modules from IronPython .
It works by embedding a CPython interpreter , using a an assembly provided by the Python .
NET Project where most of the hard work was done !.
Despite some serious limitations it works !
The example code included uses matplotlib with numpy and Tkinter from IronPython .
It provides two different usage patterns :
An import hook allowing you to import CPython binary modules with normal import statements
An Import function allowing you to import modules ( pure Python or binary modules ) into the embedded CPython interpreter
See the usage section for examples .
Download
The download includes Python .
Runtime.dll from Python.NET , for a UCS2 build of Python .
This is the right assembly for Python 2.4 on Windows .
For Linux you probably want a UCS4 build .
The Python.NET distribution contains runtimes for Python 2.4 and 2.5 in both UCS2 and UCS4 .
This technique does depend on having the appropriate version of Python installed ( although you could also ship the relevant Python dll ) .
Download cext 0.1.4
The source for this module lives in the FePy Subversion Repository : embedding.py
cext.py ( the import hook )
This code only works with IronPython 2 because of an annoying bug when passing Arrays as arguments in IronPython 1 .
This can be worked around , but targeting IronPython 2 may be better as we could look at using the DLR to help with making PyObjects behave like IronPython data types ( see below ) .
Bug reports , contributions and suggestions welcomed .
The C Extensions for IronPython Project Resolver Systems recently announced a new project to get CPython extensions working seamlessly with IronPython .
This is needed by customers of Resolver , but is being run as an Open Source project .
Announcement : Project to get some CPython C extensions running under IronPython
C Extensions for IronPython Mailing List
The approach in this module , is to embed the CPython interpreter in an assembly and access CPython extensions through the hosted interpreter .
This module is far from the final solution and it's not even clear that it is the best approach to take .
At Resolver we have also been experimenting with directly loading CPython assemblies and replacing the CPython API with function pointers that use delegates to call back into managed code .
This would also give us binary compatibility and avoid some of the problems caused by hosting a real CPython interpreter .
So far we have Python binary extensions loading , calling into our code and then crashing !
This is a great first step because it means the basic approach works , and know all we need to do is implement the whole Python C API in managed code ...
Usage
The distribution includes the following files : embedding.py :
The main module
: The main module cext.py :
The import hook
: The import hook test.py :
A simple test of the basic functionality - run this with IronPython 2
: A simple test of the basic functionality - run this with IronPython 2 echo.py :
A test module that is imported into CPython by test.py
: A test module that is imported into CPython by Python .
Runtime.dll - Suitable for a UCS2 build of Python 2.4 Note Due to some bug in the Orcas Beta , the import hook does n't work if you have any of Visual Studio 2008 betas ( Orcas ) installed .
There are two ways of using this project .
The first way is with the Import function from the embedding module .
The Import Function
The test .py shows this approach in action .
The final part of this module generates a plot using matplotlib :
pylab = Import ( ' pylab ' )
pylab .
plot ( [ 1 , 1 , 1.5 , 2.5 , 3 , 3 , 3.1 ] )
pylab .
show ( )
This generates a simple plot :
As you can see , the the pylab module imported from CPython behaves in ( apparently ) the same way as it does when running directly in CPython .
Caution !
The actual code in test .py imports the sys module from the hosted interpeter , and attempts to adds to sys.path .
Ufortunately this has no effect !
( Although the path seems to be set correctly for my computer anyway . )
The reason it does n't work highlights something to be aware of if you want to use this module .
sys = Import ( 'sys ' )
sys .
path .
append ( 'c :\\Python24\\Lib\\' )
In the code above , the sys module is successfully imported as a proxy object .
When you access sys.path , this proxy object recognises that you are accessing a Python list ( on the CPython side ) and copies it across to IronPython for you .
This means that the append is executed on the copy , not on the original .
d'oh
The solution would be , either to not copy the list and to proxy access to it as well , or to provide functions on the CPython side allowing you to manipulate sys.path .
The Import Hook Installing the import hook allows you import Python binary extensions using normal import statements !
Python binary extensions are .pyd files on Windows and . so files on other platforms .
To install the import hook , execute the following code : import cext
cext .
install ( )
You can then do things like import cElementTree .
The goal is that eventually this will be build into FePy and enabled by an option , so that you can import CPython modules without having to take any special steps .
Under the hood , the import hook uses the embedding .
Import function .
When you use the import hook to import binary modules you may want to do things like setting the import path on the hosted interpreter .
Obviously normal import statements ( like import sys ) will import the IronPython version .
To access the builtin modules of CPython you will still need to use embedding .
Import .
Implementation Details The Python Runtime Assembly
This provides a very thin wrapper around the CPython embedding API .
You have to acquire and release the Global Interpreter Lock ( GIL ) around every operation and it works with PyObjects which are managed wrappers around CPython types .
The code below imports the PythonEngine and initializes it .
It also defines two decorators GIL acquires and releases the GIL , and wraps all operations with CPython objects .

handle_exception handles exceptions that occur in CPython and reraises them as IronPython exceptions import clr

finally :

def handle_exception ( function ) :

return function ( * args , ** kw )
except PythonException , e :
exc = PyExcConvert ( PyObject ( e . PyType ) )
value = ConvertToIpy ( PyObject ( e . PyValue ) )
raise exc ( value )
return f Importing modules is done with the Import function .
This could be the only function you need to import from the embedding module to access CPython extensions .
@ GIL
def Import ( name ) :
module = engine .
ImportModule ( name )
if module is None :
raise ImportError ( " Importing module named %s failed " % name )
return PythonObject ( module ) Proxied Objects and Data Structures
When you import a module it returns a proxied object .
By default all objects you access are proxied objects unless they are a fundamental datatype - which will be converted from a PyObject into the equivalent IronPython type .
Proxied objects let you get and set attributes on them , plus call them .
The proxied class is PythonObject : class PythonObject ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self , real ) :
self .
_real_ = real
@ GIL
@ handle_exception
def __getattribute__ ( self , name ) :
real = object .
__getattribute__ ( self , ' _real_ ' )
if name == ' _real_ ' :
return real
return ConvertToIpy ( real .
GetAttr ( name ) )
@ GIL
@ handle_exception
def __setattr__ ( self , name , value ) :
if name == ' _real_ ' :
object .
__setattr__ ( self , ' _real_ ' , value )
return
self .
_real_ .
SetAttr ( name , ConvertToPy ( value ) )
@ GIL
@ handle_exception
def __call__ ( self , * args , ** keywargs ) :
if not keywargs :
return ConvertToIpy ( self .
_real_ .
Invoke ( ConvertToPy ( args ) ) )
return ConvertToIpy ( self .
_real_ .
Invoke ( ConvertToPy ( args ) ,
StringDictToPy ( keywargs ) ) )
The ConvertToPy and ConvertToIPy functions do the converting between CPython and IronPython types .
It can convert integers , long integers , strings , booleans and None , lists , tuples and dictionaries .
This means that if you call a Python function ( or set an attribute ) with a reference to an Iron Python data structure it will be copied into CPython types .
Any return values will be copied from CPython types to IronPython types .
See the limitations section below for some of the consequences of this .
It does mean that once you have imported a module you can call functions / methods and instantiate classes from inside CPython .
You can also fetch and set attributes and all the right things should happen .
The Test File test.py tests the basic functionality of the embedding .
py module .
It also serves as a usage example .
When run with IronPython 2 , it imports echo.py into CPython and passes data back and forth to check that it survives the journey .
These are done with asserts , so if any fail then it will bomb out with an error .
If it works you should see : Received into CPython : 1 Type : < type ' int ' >
Received into CPython : 3.2000000000000002
Type : < type ' float ' >
Received into CPython : u' Hello from IronPython ' Type : < type ' unicode '>

Caught an exception from CPython correctly .
test.py also tests other features of this module , like catching exceptions from CPython ( etc ) .
Palaeontologist Dr Phil Manning , working with National Geographic Channel has uncovered the Holy Grail of palaeontology in the United States : a partially intact dino mummy .
Named Dakota , this 67 - million - year - old dinosaur is one of the most important dinosaur discoveries in recent times - calling into question our conception of dinosaurs ' body shape , skin preservation and movement .
The find is documented in the UK premiere of Dino Autopsy on Sunday 9 December at 9 pm on National Geographic Channel .
The special follows leading palaeontologists in the UK and United States as they uncover the rocky tomb of one of the most complete dino mummies ever found and carry out a CT scan on the specimen .
Most of our understanding of dinosaurs is based on fossilised skeletal remains - from bones and teeth , usually the only tissue durable enough to fossilise .
Dakota includes an uncollapsed skin envelope on many parts of the body and limbs that offers a degree of insight impossible from just bone structure .
Fossilised skin and tendons have allowed us to reconstruct major muscle sizes - with many body parts offering a tantalising glimpse of a 3 - D dinosaur .
" It is quite fair to say that our dinosaur mummy [ Dakota ] makes many other dinosaurs look like road kill .
Simply because the evidence we 're getting from our creature is so complete compared to the disjointed sort of skeletons that we usually have to draw conclusions from " , said Dr Manning , a palaeontologist from The School of Earth , Atmospheric and Environmental Studies ( SEAES ) at The University of Manchester .
Post excavation , Dakota was transported to the Black Hills Institute in the United States , where it was revealed to be a Hadrosaur , more commonly called a duck - billed dinosaur .
A team of UK - based scientists then tested skin samples , examining the fossilised skin to determine how Dakota might have looked , and measuring muscle mass to determine how it might have moved .
With the aid of a giant CT scanner provided by the Boeing Company , technology usually reserved for testing aircraft and spacecraft parts for NASA , the team also attempted to peer inside Dakota 's preserved body and tail .
The scan of the 3,600 - kilogram body was of the one of the largest CT scans ever undertaken .
Dino Autopsy reveals what the scans showed and examines the extent to which the results could change our understanding of Hadrosaurs forever .
Dakota may contribute some significant findings to the field of palaeontology , altering our comprehension of how dinosaurs looked and moved :
* The Hadrosaur 's backside appears to be approximately 25 percent larger than previously thought ; a surprising conclusion that could change our image of the dinosaur for the last 150 years .
* With a larger backside , the Hadrosaur would have been able to reach top speeds of 45 kilometres an hour - 16 kilometres faster than the T. Rex .
* The skin envelope also shows evidence that the Hadrosaur may have been striped and not block coloured , producing an almost striped camouflage pattern on some parts of the dinosaur .
* With its body so well preserved , researchers are able to more accurately estimate the spacing between vertebrae .
While most museums have dinosaur bones stacked tightly against each other , Dr. Manning 's research suggests that the vertebrae should be stacked approximately one centimetre apart .
This could mean that some dinosaurs are at least one metre longer than previously thought .
Dakota was discovered in 1999 by Tyler Lyson ( then aged just sixteen ) , on his family 's land in North Dakota .
Subsequently , he teamed up with British palaeontologist Dr. Phil Manning and scientists from the University of Manchester , who have worked with Tyler and his team of volunteers as they struggle to unearth the tomb , bringing us closer to understanding how this dinosaur really looked and moved , and whose fossil remains survived through the sands of time .
The National Geographic Society partly funded analysis of the mummified dinosaur , including the CT scanning of the fossil .
Scientific papers based on study of the dinosaur are in progress .

Contact me About JCR JCR ( or jcodereview as it's known on Sourceforge ) is a web application for performing and managing formal code reviews .
It can be used for reviews of any type of source code , although it has some special smarts for reviewing Java projects .
It has special features to make large - scale reviews not only practical but easy and fast .
JCR is intended to assist : Reviewers .
All changes to code are highlighted , and syntax highlighting works for most languages .
Code extracts are shown for context when adding comments .
If reviewing Java code , references to other classes within the file are clickable , so that you can drill into the detail if required .
After review comments have been made , those comments can themselves be reviewed , and the required actions decided on and tracked
Project owners .
Review projects are easy to create and configure , and support ( but do n't require ) integration with your source code management ( SCM ) system
Process bigots .
Details of all comments are held in the database , along with any actions required , and whether they 've been completed .
Status reports can be viewed at any time , and also show how much review activity took place on each file ( to make sure they were all reviewed )
Architects and developers .
As well as viewing the comments made for a project , it 's possible to see details of all review projects and comments for a specified file - good for finding code that would benefit from refactoring .

JCR is intended to assist : JCR is generally targeted at larger - scale and more formal code reviews than other review tools ( such as Crucible , Review Board , Rietveld and Codestriker .
At work ( TNS Payments ) , we use JCR to review more than half of the code we write .
It 's made a huge difference to our review process - code reviews now take less time , and the code gets reviewed much more thoroughly than it did in the past .
Why bother with formal code reviews ?
There are all sorts of benefits from code reviews , and they 're not always the ones you 'd think .
For my money , they include : Education
Code reviews are a great way of pointing out good or bad techniques to other developers ( particularly less - experienced ones ) and making developers aware of internal or external libraries etc. that can be used instead of resorting to wheel - reinvention .
Additionally , they give you an opportunity to discuss some of the issues , to make sure everyone 's on the same page .
Oh , and you 'll probably learn quite a bit yourself ...
In particular , you get a guided tour of parts of the codebase you may not know , from someone who 's just been there .

Finding bugs
Yes , but not necessarily as important as you might think .
If you 've got good unit , integration and system test coverage ( and if you have n't , what are you waiting for ? ) , the main issues you might spot in a code review will be for non-functional aspects like concurrency issues , memory leaks etc .

Code and design quality
Very important .
Reviews give you a chance to suggest better ways of doing it , whatever it is , and to discuss potential issues with the way the code has been written

One of the tenets of agile methods is that all code should look the same - it should n't be possible to tell from the code who wrote it .
That way you can concentrate on understanding the code , rather than grappling with trying to parse the code .
While you can ( and should ) use static checkers like Checkstyle to ensure that your basic coding standards have been met , reviews will catch the issues that need human eyes to find .

Introducing the rPhone
r Phone combines three delightfully diverse products into one awkward and cumbersome handheld contraption -- a revolutionary steam - powered satellite phone , a stylish French musicbox , and a vibrasonic multi- purpose tool that is almost , but not quite , entirely unlike a Sonic Screwdriver .
rPhone is the first portable telephone constructed of materials you 've come to associate with progressive technology ... from its exquisite rosewood paneling to the handsome brass frame , it shouts " This is the 18th century ! " and " Gee , this thing sure is heavy ! " and " What do you mean it costs $ 20,000 ? ? " .
Rest assured this is one phone you 'll never lose in a pocket ( unless you have extremely fancy pants m'lord ! ) and best of all , rPhone provides an analogue interface that even the simplest of simpletons ( like you ! m' lord ! ) can comprehend !
No more confusing menu screens or complicated keystrokes , rPhone is built for space pirates on the go !

Mitt Romney raised more than a few eyebrows with his " freedom requires religion " line during a speech earlier this month , and on Meet The Press today he tried his best to clarify .
Tim Russert asked him point blank - can an atheist be a moral person and participate in freedom ?
Romney backpedals , saying that he was actually speaking in the spirit of John Adams , and that for this American experiment to work , it required strong morals - which required religion .
As for an atheist appointee for a President Romney ?
He says he'd be ok with it , if they were the most qualified person for the job .

The steady dirge of diabetes swells all about us , dark and onerous .
The condition is now estimated to affect 7 % of California ’s population , with some putting the figure closer to 10 % .
With new molecular diagnostics , the numbers get even grimmer , with pre-diabetes -- a risky level of sugar and inflammatory agents in the blood -- edging in on 20 % of the state ’s adult population .
It is no surprise that a UCLA professor last week called the numbers “ the tip of the iceberg . ”
Or is it the beak of the finch ?
When a condition that can lead to disability and premature death affects so large a part of a population , what ’s really going on ?
One way to think about Type 2 diabetes is as evolution in our own time .
Think about Darwin ’s tale of the short - beaked finch , the one that could n’t crack the best nuts on the Galapagos Islands and so died out , ceding its place to the finch with the curved , long beak .
Type 2 diabetes marks the human short - beaked finch -- the ones whose genes and challenged pancreas can’t keep pace with today ’s calorically unbalanced world , where sugary , fatty foods are abundant and our jobs pay us to be sedentary .
Most of us are short - beaks .
Such a dynamic has unfolded at least once before , in Western Europe during the post - Renaissance period , when crop yields exploded , personal fortunes grew and famine -- the evolutionary driver of our genetic propensity to acquire and store calories by way of the so - called hungry gene -- became less frequent .
This produced a growing population , mainly the rich and the new upper - middle class , who began displaying all the symptoms we now recognize as diabetic : unquenchable thirst ( as described in the instructively titled “ La Vita Sobria , ” by Italian merchant - humanist Alvise Cornaro ) , numbness and pain in the extremities ( often in the form of gout or metabolic arthritis ) , blindness ( J.S. Bach , a diabetic , died after two eye operations ) and , eventually , loss of limb to infection .
Importantly , the period also produced the first literature of public and occupational health , with an emphasis on hygiene , self - control and more diagnostically attuned physicians .
That “ cryptic epidemic ” of Type 2 diabetes , as Jared Diamond has dubbed it , may well explain present - day Europe ’s relatively mild increases .
In terms of evolution , the continent has already been winnowed , the hungry gene at least partly eliminated , producing a population less vulnerable to the caloric hammer now banging away at the metabolism of the rest of the world .
The European poor -- the 19th century ’s version of today ’s Latin American immigrant -- brought their hungry genes to America , where they still party on .
Of course , we are not finches .
Even better , we are not 18th century burghers , who likely believed that their illnesses were somehow linked to the stars , Galenic humors , atmospheric miasmas or the twists of fate .
We are , at least in the case of Type 2 , engineers of our own evolution .
Humans have invented relatively inexpensive tools to mitigate the ravages , or at least to grease the evolutionary pole .
The first of these tools , the prototype of today ’s glucose meter , came into circulation in 1965 .
Today the palm - sized meter , lancet and strips allow individuals to determine and chart exactly how their metabolism is reacting to the modern environment of “ diabesity . ”
( The very concept of diabesity -- the connection between sugary foods , obesity and diabetes -- originated at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles through the pioneering work of Dr. Fran Kaufman . )
The meter is not a cure - all .
But it gives us an evolutionary edge of which Bach ’s physician never dreamed .
It ’s not as easy to determine the origins of the second tool to mitigate our glucose evolution : the pedometer , or step counter .
Its inventor may have been Thomas Jefferson ( my choice ) , or Leonardo da Vinci ( my wife ’s ) .
What we do know is this :
If your pedometer counts fewer than 10,000 steps a day , your blood sugar can more easily get out of control .
Beleaguered public health officials also know this .
The pedometer is cheap and easy to understand , and it serves an important psychological role as a prompt toward exercise .
That ’s why you see them popping up everywhere .
Nevertheless , tools without teachers -- and the social and medical environments to support them -- do n’t work .
That is why California health officials , who are on the front lines of the diabesity fight , are pressing for a smarter , earlier and more sustained focus on glucose control .
Much of this dynamism comes from Los Angeles ’ leading medical institutions , UCLA and USC , whose underfunded teaching hospitals are in constant contact with the main Darwinian victims : the poor and the recently arrived .
Unfortunately , there is n’t yet much of a consensus about what to do .
Solutions get snared in endless policy debates about medical insurance , state budgets and what might be called “ anti- stigma ” ideology -- the notion that recognizing a health problem in a specific community will saddle said community with a negative image -- the immigrant , say , as destroyer of public health , the fatty as Medicare killer .
Fortunately , we ’re moving beyond that nonsense .
In fact , focusing on glucose control may be one way to get the dangers of obesity across without getting it entangled in the chubby politics of victimhood and identity .
Here is one idea : Teach every California ninth - grader how to use a glucose meter , and use the state ’s vast purchasing power to make the devices nearly free for every family .
Next : Show every California fifth - grader how and why to use a pedometer -- and then give them one .
Also : Include simple , glucose - control educational information in any application process for immigrants .
Lastly , appoint and fund a state diabetes czar .
On this last , I can already hear the usual suspects screaming about big government .
We ’ll be sure to send them the huge state healthcare bill in 2020 , when , if we do n’t take such measures , the finch will start eating our wallets .

There 's been some discussion recently among moneybloggers about writing more for those who earn the minimum wage , and for those who face other financial difficulties .
This is a good thing .
But all this talk made me wonder :
How prevalent is the minimum wage ?
Who works minimum wage jobs ?
I decided to do some research .
According to the U.S. Department of Labor , the median annual income of a U.S. worker is $ 32,140 .
Federal minimum wage is currently $ 5.85 an hour , or about $ 11,500 per year — just above the poverty line .
Of the 76.5 million people paid by the hour in the United States in 2006 , 2.2 % make minimum wage or less .
Here are some generalizations we can make about minimum wage workers :
Most minimum wage earners are young .
While 2.2 % of all hourly workers earn minimum wage or less , just 1.4 % of workers over the age of 25 are paid at or below the Federal minimum wage .
More than half ( 51.2 % ) of minimum wage workers are between 16 and 24 years old .
Another 21.2 % are between 25 and 34 .

More than half ( 51.2 % ) of minimum wage workers are between 16 and 24 years old .
Another 21.2 % are between 25 and 34 .
Most minimum wage earners work in food service .
Nearly two - thirds of those paid minimum wage ( or less ) are food service workers .
Many of these people receive supplemental income in the form of tips , which the government does not track .

Most minimum wage earners never attended college .
Just 1.2 % of college graduates are paid the minimum wage .
If you only have a high school degree , you 're more likely ( 1.9 % ) to be paid minimum wage .
Those without a high school degree are nearly three times as likely ( 3.7 % ) to earn minimum wage .
59.8 % of all minimum wage workers have no advanced education .

Those without a high school degree are nearly three times as likely ( 3.7 % ) to earn minimum wage .
59.8 % of all minimum wage workers have no advanced education .
Finally , as you might expect , part - time workers are five times more likely to be paid the minimum wage than full - time workers .
You can find more information at the official characteristics of minimum wage workers page , and in the page of data tables .
Also , the Department of Labor has a map that shows how state minimum wage rates compare to Federal minimum wage rates :
These statistics mirror my own experience .
When I earned minimum wage , I was working on farms or in restaurants .
I was young .
The other people I knew who earned minimum wage were also young .
As an adult , I 've known a few people who earned at ( or just above ) minimum wage .
These people have usually lacked a college education .
In many cases , they were actually working toward some sort of degree while they worked their minimum wage job .
Most people do n't see a minimum wage job as an end , but as a means to an end .
That 's not to say that there are n't those who are n't stuck in bad situations .
Research from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates :
Many workers begin their post - school careers in jobs paying the minimum or something close to it , but …the vast majority of workers move on to higher paying jobs as they accumulate experience .
However , there is a nontrivial fraction of workers who spend substantial portions of their early careers consistently working in minimum wage jobs . [… ]
Less educated persons , blacks , women with young children , and workers who reside outside of urban areas are much more likely to have such minimum wage careers .
The percentage of hourly workers paid at or below the Federal minimum wage has declined steadily ( and significantly ) since the numbers were first tracked in 1979 .
In 1980 and 1981 , 15.1 % of workers were paid at or below the minimum wage .
In 2006 , just 2.2 % of workers were paid at or below the minimum wage .
( A strong argument could be made that the minimum wage has failed to keep pace with the cost of living , and that employers have been raising wages on their own .
In other words , this statistic may be meaningless . )
Enough numbers !
Later today I 'll explore ways for those trapped in minimum wage jobs to get ahead .
It 's not all about pinching pennies .
I 'd also like to hear stories from people who have worked minimum wage jobs in the past , and from those who still do .
If I collect enough stories , I 'll post them in a separate entry .
( If you 'd like to share your story , please drop me a line , or post it in this forum thread . )
Update : I 've posted my piece on how to escape from minimum wage .
But the interrogators had an array of techniques to extract the " confession " they wanted to hear from him and the thousands of others scattered in jails across Burma ; an admission that the pro-democracy demonstrations led by thousands of monks that shook the country 's paranoid military government in September were really a foreign - backed political plot to bring down the regime .
" I was sitting on the floor of the interrogation room , " said the man , an art shop owner in his 20s .
" There were five of them asking questions .
The first day I was beaten very hard and they asked : who organised the monks ?
I told them we were following the monks , respecting the Buddha , they were n't following us . "
" I was interrogated all night for three nights .
They kicked and punched me on the side of my head with their fists .
They asked me the same question over and over .
I told them : you can ask anything , my answer will always be the same .
I do n't know who organised the monks .
They did n't like that answer . "
So the interrogators forced the young man to half - crouch as though he were sitting on a motorbike , made him put his arms out as if gripping the handlebars and demanded he imitate an engine , loudly .
The initial humiliation gave way to intense pains in his legs , arms and throat after several hours .
When he fell over he was beaten again .
He was held for a month and is still not sure why he was detained .
He suspects the police identified him from photographs of civilians who marched with the monks .
But he was not alone in the cells of police station No 14 .
Thousands of civilians have emerged from weeks in prison following the protests with accounts of brutal torture aimed at extracting " confessions " and at terrorising a new generation of Burmese into acquiescing to military rule .
Crackdown
From Rangoon to Mandalay and down the Irrawaddy river to the small town of Pakokku , demonstrators and politicians were rounded up in the crackdown against the greatest challenge to the 400,000 - strong army 's hegemony in a generation .
Scores were killed , including monks .
At the same time , hundreds of monasteries were purged of monks .
Some were arrested and tortured but mostly they were driven back to their villages to prevent more protests which began over price rises but evolved into demands for an end to 45 years of military rule .
What remains is a climate of terror in an already fearful land where anyone who took part in the protests lives in dread of being identified .
Even the monks are suspicious of each other , believing the regime has planted spies and agents provocateurs or coerced some into becoming informers .
But the military has not emerged unscathed from its confrontation with the monasteries .
There are divisions over the brutal treatment of the monks , and accounts that soldiers are fearful of the spiritual price they might pay .
The monks of Pakokku are wary of unknown faces .
Their monasteries were among the first to be purged after the small town and seat of Buddhist learning , about six hours downriver from Mandalay , became the crucible of the demonstrations that spread nationwide .
Behind closed doors inside the largest of Pakokku 's monasteries , the Bawdimandine , two monks describe a confrontation with the army that on the face of it the monks have lost , but which the Buddhist clergy believe marks the beginning of the downfall of the regime - although none of them are predicting that it will happen any time soon .
" All the monks here are very much against the government , " said one .
" They 're still against the government mentally but not physically because we can't do anything .
If we do they will arrest us .
We do n't want to kill .
We do n't want to torture .
The government takes advantage of this .
The government suppressed the protests but there 's not really quiet .
There 's a lot of defiance . "
The protests began in August over fuel and food price rises but escalated in September after the army broke up a demonstration in Pakokku by shooting dead one monk and lashing others to electricity poles and beating them with rifle butts .
Pakokku's monks demanded an apology from the junta and the reversal of price rises .
But they added two overtly political demands - for the release of the opposition leader , Aung San Suu Kyi , from house arrest and the start of a dialogue to end military rule - that changed the character of the confrontation .
When the deadline passed , monasteries across Burma took up the cause and poured tens of thousands of monks on to the streets in days of marches that initially left the military paralysed .
But the crackdown soon came .
In some cases it took no more than the threat of mass arrests to empty a monastery .
Lorryloads of troops herded the clergy away from others .
Fear of arrest
Almost half of the 1,200 monks at the Bawdimandine monastery fled .
Those who remain say they are afraid to venture on to the streets for fear of arrest .
" Things have changed for us , " said one monk .
" The soldiers used to drag the civilians off the buses to check their identity cards and leave the monks in their seats .
Now it is the monks they line up in the road to check and they leave the civilians on the bus . "
It is a similar story in monasteries from the former capital , Rangoon , to Mandalay where 20,000 monks and their supporters turned out on the streets of Burma 's second city and religious heartland to challenge the military regime .
The purges continue despite the government 's assurances to the United Nations .
" The government has many spies among the monks , " said one of the chief monks of the Old Ma Soe monastery in Mandalay .
" During the demonstrations they pulled the prisoners out of Mandalay jail and shaved their heads and put them among the monks to cause trouble .
The bogus monks were chanting aggressively .
They are still trying to send spies .
When we have a new monk we do not know we test their knowledge of Buddhist literature .
If they do n't know we send them away . "
In some monasteries , the monks were given time to pack up and get out .
But in others , they fled without notice , leaving neatly made beds , books lining the shelves of their cubicles and the single key that each monk is permitted to possess .
Cats and dogs wander the prayer halls .
Ask where the monks are and those that remain say they went back to their villages .
What has happened to them there ?
Some were arrested but most have been left alone , provided they do not try to return to their monasteries , according to the leading clerics .
" It was all about silencing them , " said the monk at Old Ma Soe .
Fear is pervasive in Burma .
There are not many soldiers on the streets but the regime has many ordinary people believing that their every move is being watched and that anyone might be an informer . .
The fear is underpinned by the sheer numbers of men who have been through the regime 's jails at some time or another , even if only for a few weeks .
The 1988 generation of protesters remembers the slaughter of 3,000 of their number as the regime quashed the demonstrations and the mass arrests afterwards .
The latest crackdown has introduced a new generation to the regime 's use of terror against its own population .
" There were 85 others in my police cell , mostly young people , " said the young shopkeeper held in police station No 14 .
" Some were only 15 or 16 years old .
One boy told me he was arrested for wearing an American flag on his head .
Some of the students had broken bones and head wounds .
" At the end of three days I still had n't confessed so they gave up and put me back in the cell and left me alone .
Some of the others confessed under the pressure but they were n't real confessions .
I do n't blame them .
There were people in my cell who were interrogated non -stop for 15 days . "
Among those detained were politicians from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) elected in the annulled 1990 parliamentary election .
Last week , the government called diplomats to the new capital , Naypyidaw , to lay out the results of all these interrogations .
The military said it had uncovered a longstanding plot involving " bogus monks " , a little - known exile group , the Forum for Democracy in Burma , and billionaire financier George Soros 's Open Society organisation to bring down the regime .
The junta outlined a complex conspiracy to infiltrate the monasteries , the labour force and universities in an 18 - page document filled with scores of names of alleged plotters and their backers .
Among others , it names U Gambira , the 27 - year - old leader of the All Burma Monks Alliance , who is presently locked up in Mandalay prison .
The government accuses him and opposition politicians of using ordinary monks as a front for political ends .
Foreign diplomats who have spoken to senior army officers since the protests say the regime is blind to the growing discontent at deepening economic hardship that underpinned the demonstrations .
The government maintains the illusion that Burma 's economy is growing faster than China 's even though the World Bank has rubbished statistics that claim to show double - digit growth .
The reality can be seen in the contrasts with the booming economies of much of the rest of south - east Asia - Thailand , Vietnam , Malaysia - particularly outside Rangoon .
There 's hardly a new vehicle to be seen besides scooters and Chinese - made motorbikes .
The principal means of transport is old , underpowered buses and horse and trap .
Ploughs are pulled by cattle .
There is such a shortage of cars that 25 - year - old vehicles worth a few hundred pounds across the border cost £ 10,000 in Burma .
A Sim card for the government - run mobile phone network , the only one there is , costs about £ 1,000 .
Aside from a sprinkling of new hotels , there are few modern buildings to be seen beyond Rangoon and the surreal new capital , Naypyidaw .
Life expectancy is well short of that in Burma 's neighbours .
The chief United Nations representative , Charles Petrie , left Rangoon last week after being expelled for a speech in which he observed that Burma 's per capita gross domestic product was less than half that of Cambodia or Bangladesh , and that the recent protests " clearly demonstrated the everyday struggle to meet basic needs .
The average household is forced to spend almost three - quarters of its budget on food .
One in three children under five are suffering malnutrition , and less than 50 % of children are able to complete their primary education " .
Military elite
That is not the world the generals live in .
They are cocooned in the new capital or Pyin U Lwin , an army town 90 minutes ' drive north of Mandalay .
It is home to the military 's main barracks and the Defence Services Academy training base .
The grand , red - tiled entrance proclaims in gold lettering that its officers are the Triumphant Elite of the Future .
Two new and vast mansions sit on distant hilltops , and a neighbourhood of spacious , colonial - style homes is spreading in all directions , all apparently reserved for the military elite .
Few outsiders penetrate this closed world where career officers and their families live mostly cut off from the rest of Burma .
Inside that world , the junta portrays itself as all that stands between order and disintegration into ethnic conflict .
It says it is committed to a roadmap to a " disciplined flourishing democracy " that will lead to a " golden land in future " .
But it has taken 14 years to complete the first two stages of the map which means that at the present rate of progress the end of the road will not be reached until well into the second half of the century .
The military 's view that it is central to Burma 's very survival is displayed on the front of all the heavily censored newspapers , where each day appear the 12 " political , economic and social objectives " of the military government .
These include " uplift of the morale and morality of the entire nation " and " uplift of dynamism of patriotic spirit " .
A senior monk who teaches at Pyin U Lwin 's military academy said there was disquiet among some soldiers over the assault on the monks .
" Soldiers are telling their relatives not to go into the army .
Many soldiers are unhappy with what has happened .
Some of them are my pupils .
Even some of the colonels tell me they do n't agree with what has happened , " he said .
" We are educating the new generation about what is right and what is wrong .
Evolution is better than revolution .
We have no weapons .
They have the weapons .
All we have is loving kindness .
Who wants to be killed ?
People are very peaceful , very passive .
No one wants to die , no one wants to kill .
They are not like the Muslims .
You never heard of Myanmar people suicide bombing .
But it will not be quick .
Maybe another 10 years . "
Many people in Burma are patient , but not that patient .
The frustration and sense of helplessness is reflected in the self - delusion among some that the United Nations will invade and overthrow the regime .
Others draw strength from the widespread practice of interpreting what are seen as auspicious signs .
Near Bagan a small pagoda has become the site of pilgrimage after a colony of bees settled on the face and chest of a Buddha .
Bees are considered particularly auspicious and their choice of a Buddha has been widely interpreted as siding with monks .
Sitting atop a centuries - old pagoda nearby , a politician who has gone into hiding said many Burmese drew strength from the belief that the military leaders will pay for their crimes in the next life .
" They will have an amazing surprise in their afterlife .
By killing monks they will come back as dogs who eat shit with many diseases , not the ones that eat good food and look nice ; ugly dogs , " he said .
There are not many who would dare say such things openly but Thet Pyin is among them .
The army first threw him into prison 45 years ago for his opposition to its rule .
" The problem the government has created for itself is that the conflict is no longer between the government and the people , it 's between religion and the government .
That 's important because 80 % of the population is Buddhist and the government is Buddhist .
All the army is Buddhist .
That will be its downfall , " he said .
Occupation
" I 'm 81 years old .
I 've never in all my life seen as bad a government as this , as unqualified as this .
Even the Japanese occupation was not as bad as this .
These military people do n't have a clue what they are doing and their treatment of the monks is the latest evidence of that . "
Pyin , a member of a small party that won three seats in the annulled 1990 election , said that the army duped people back then with promises of democracy but that it will not be able to get away with that again .
" This regime managed to pacify people after the 1988 demonstrations with promises of multiparty elections and an open economy and that the military would return to the barracks .
The army reneged on that but it was forced to make the promise .
The regime is going to have to do something to pacify the people again but they will not believe its promises now , " he said .
" There are divisions in the army .
The core of the dictatorship is small , it is at odds with the military in its larger role .
This government will fall . "
Burma 's most renowned female writer , Ludu Daw Ahmar , is also outspoken against the regime .
Arrested in 1978 at the age of 63 on suspicion of links to the Communist party , which she denies , Ahmar spent a year in Mandalay jail .
She has just celebrated her 92nd birthday and no longer fears what the regime might do to her .
Frail and hard of hearing , she remains vigorously defiant .
" People are very much afraid of the government but this can't go on forever .
There will be a day when the people break this , " she said .
" People will have to sacrifice their lives .
There is no choice .
We can't go on like this .
We must get arms to resist them .
I can't say how , but the people must find arms . "
That is not the view of most Burmese , or the monks who have taken up a low - key but symbolically significant protest against the regime by refusing alms from the government .
Some monks turn their bowls upside down when offered food by soldiers , interpreted as a form of excommunication .
At the Old Ma Soe monastery the monks refused to invite government representatives to celebrations to mark its 100th anniversary .
The clerics have also declared a boycott of government exams they are expected to take every year .
But the monasteries hold their own exams in April , and some senior clerics are predicting that will mark the beginning of a new campaign of protest .
" The monasteries will be full again .
They will not be silent .
No one has changed their mind about this government , " said a senior cleric in Mandalay .
" But we know it will not change tomorrow .
It might take five years , it might take 10 , but it will be go .
It has no solutions . "
Atop the pagoda near Bagan , the political activist who is now in hiding said the military was wrong to believe it has cowed another generation .
" Nobody won in September because it 's not finished , " he said .
Resource - rich but with faltering economy
Burma is a resource - rich country but its economy is crippled by overbearing government control and ineffective policies .
It is the world 's biggest exporter of teak , a principal source of precious stones , has fertile soil and significant offshore oil and gas deposits but the majority of its people live in abject poverty .
Steps in the early 1990s to liberalise the economy after decades of failure under the programme Burmese Way to Socialisation , a large - scale attempt at central economic planning , were largely unsuccessful .
The US imposed fresh economic sanctions in August 2003 in response to the junta 's attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and her convoy .
A banking crisis in the same year saw hundreds of Burmese lining up outside banks to withdraw their savings after the government shut down several institutions .
The average household spends three - quarters of its budget on food and one in three children under five are suffering malnutrition .

In new books writers as disparate as Naomi Wolf and Pat Buchanan conclude that America as we know her is disappearing .
Both writers hope , but are not confident , that enough Americans will catch on in time to find the leadership to pull America back from the brink .
If polls are reliable , a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with President Bush and Congress .
However , Americans are far short of Wolf and Buchanan 's grasp of our peril .
Americans are unable to connect their dissatisfaction with the current political leadership with their choice of new leaders .
All polls show that Hillary Clinton is far in the lead for the Democratic presidential nomination and Rudy Giuliani is far in the lead for the Republican nomination
These are the only two candidates guaranteed to be worse than Bush / Cheney .
Both Hillary and Rudy are committed to the war .
Both refuse to rule out expanding the war to Iran and beyond .
Both are totally in the pocket of the Israel Lobby .
Indeed , practically every Giuliani advisor is a member of the Lobby .
Both defend the police state measures that " protect us from terrorism . "
And neither gives a hoot for the US Constitution and the civil liberties it guarantees .
The Republican Giuliani is likely to overturn the Second Amendment even quicker than the Democrat Hillary .
Both Hillary and Rudy are creatures of ambition , not of principle .
Both are one up on Karl Marx .
Marx said truth serves class interests .
For Hillary and Rudy , truth is what serves their individual interests .
They both wear black hats , and the horse they ride is called power .
Yet in November polls , Republicans prefer Giuliani by a margin of five or six to one over Ron Paul , the only principled Republican candidate and a person who without any doubt believes in the Constitution and would protect it .
Democrats prefer Hillary by a margin of twenty to one over Dennis Kucinich , the only member of Congress sufficiently concerned and courageous to introduce impeachment against the notorious war criminal Dick Cheney .
By margins as much as forty - four to one , Democrats prefer Hillary to Senator Christopher Dodd , who promises to give America back its Constitution in the first hour of his administration .
Former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel does not even register in the polls .
Obviously , the American people have n't a clue .
In November 2007 they show a distinct preference for leaders who are even worse than the ones with whom they are currently dissatisfied .
What does this tell us about the American people and their commitment to be sufficiently informed for democracy to function ?
It tells us that they are not up to the challenge .
It is only a matter of time before America succumbs to the plutocracy , against which Warren Buffet recently warned Congress , or the fascist tyranny that Naomi Wolf sees in our future .

Feeding babies on pureed food is unnatural and unnecessary , according to one of Unicef 's leading child care experts , who says they should be fed exclusively with breast milk and formula milk for the first six months , then weaned immediately on to solids .
Gill Rapley , deputy director of Unicef 's Baby Friendly Initiative and a health visitor for 25 years , said spoon - feeding pureed food to children can cause health problems later in life
She blames the multimillion - pound baby food industry for persuading parents that they need to give their babies pureed food .
' Sound scientific research and government advice now agree there is no longer any window of a baby 's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids , ' Rapley said .
The industry in Britain is worth more than £ 450 m , compared with £ 191 m in 1989 .
More than four out of five of Britain 's one million babies aged between four and 20 months eat and drink baby food worth more than £ 120 m a year .
Until recently , the words ' baby food ' conjured up nothing more exciting than a bit of stewed apple and a rusk .
Now , supermarket shelves groan with jars of organic , fresh ingredients , with some ranges even seeking to tempt the discerning baby with ' superfood ' options and local ingredients .
Makers of baby food say they are taking Rapley 's study seriously .
' This is very new research and we need to look at it very carefully , ' said Roger Clarke , director - general of the Infant and Dietetic Foods Associations , a group representing such manufacturers as Heinz , Nestle , Boots and Nutricia .
' UK infant food companies support a flexible approach to feeding infants , but the age at which solids are introduced depends on the nutritional and developmental needs of individual infants and a " one size fits all " policy is not appropriate , ' he added .
' Generations of mums and dads have relied on the simple convenience of these special recipes as part of their baby 's diet to provide safe , sound nutrition with a wide variety of tastes and textures - from purees that are easy to suck straight from a spoon to soft lumps that encourage chewing . '
But Rapley , who has produced a DVD explaining how to follow a new feeding programme called Baby - Led Weaning , points to an increasing number of scientific projects and government guidance that she says support her programme .
' In 2002 , the World Health Organisation backed research that found breast or formula milk provided all the nutrition a baby needs up to the age of six months , ' she said .
' That research said feeding a baby any other food during their first six months would dilute the nutritional value of the milk and might even be harmful to the baby 's health . '
After six months , Rapley says , babies are capable of taking food to their mouths and chewing , making purees and spoon feeding unnecessary .
' The World Health Organisation was so impressed by the research that it rewrote its recommendations on baby feeding , ' she said .
' A year later , the Department of Health for England and Wales followed suit . '
Offering babies pureed foods once they can chew is not only unnecessary , it could delay the development of chewing skills , Rapley believes .
In addition , allowing a baby to take as much or as little food as it needs stops it becoming constipated .
Rapley believes that babies allowed to feed themselves tend to become less picky , develop better hand control more quickly and to avoid foods to which they are later found to be intolerant .
Rapley was inspired to investigate the widely accepted use of pureed foods during her quarter - century as a health visitor .
' I found so many parents were coming to me with the same problems - " my child is constipated , my child is really picky " - and they could n't get them on to second - stage baby food .
So I started to wonder what would happen if we never took the control away from them in the first place , ' she said .
After years spent observing babies and conducting her own studies , Rapley developed her feeding programme , which teaches that babies over six months should be in charge of what goes into their mouths and when .
' Provided a child is sitting up straight and is supervised by an adult , he or she can feed themselves a variety of healthy finger foods with their hands , ' she said .

ARCHAEOLOGISTS are attempting to piece together facts about the life of a 2nd century Briton after unearthing a skeleton at the site of a former Roman town in North Yorkshire .
A half - tonne , six - foot , lead coffin , containing the skeleton , was discovered at the Isurium Brigantum site , at Aldborough , near Boroughbridge .
The bones and teeth found at the burial site , dating to around the 2nd century , could offer archaeologists clues about everyday life for high status Yorkshire folk almost 2,000 years ago .
Keith Emerick , English Heritage 's inspector of ancient monuments , said : " The fact the burial involved an expensive lead coffin signifies the person was perhaps of high status .
" We are keen to see what specialists can tell us about the bones so we can build a picture of this person 's life . "
After being alerted to the chance find , English Heritage and York Archaeological Trust ( YAT ) are now working together to unravel the secrets of the skeleton .
It was a major week - long operation to excavate and lift the half - tonne relic from the ground and transport it to a YAT laboratory in York city centre .
Experts have now opened the casket 's partially crushed lid to reveal the well - preserved remains of what is most likely a Romano - British adult .
Finds of this kind are very unusual in Yorkshire and across the country only about 300 Roman lead coffins have been unearthed .
Although no burial goods have been found , the chief scientific treasures are the bones themselves , according to Ian Panter , principal conservator with the YAT .
He said : " We have not yet been able to sex or age the remains , but the skeleton is in pretty reasonable condition .
" We also have the teeth , which is very important .
" Thanks to modern technology , we will be able to use these to shed light on the person 's childhood diet and determine whether he or she was born locally , or came from further afield .
" I 've only ever worked on one other Roman lead coffin burial , and that was from the south of England , 20 years ago , so this really is an exciting find . "
Archaeologists are carefully extracting the bones from the coffin and are subjecting them to a detailed analysis .
I make my living writing about scams .
Check - cashing schemes , Nigerian frauds , fake Viagra -- I ’ve covered them all .
And in the back of my mind was always the sense that the victims must be a bit greedy or stupid .
Like me .
My comeuppance came this year when I went shopping online for high - end earphones and ended up with a fake .
Advertisement
And I do n’t mean crude knockoffs .
I thought I was getting a brand - name product at a bargain price by being a smart shopper , just like my flea - market - loving mom taught me .
Lately , fake merchandise has become a genuine menace , moving far beyond the bogus Rolexes and Louis Vuitton handbags that have been sold for decades with a wink and a nod .
Counterfeit toothpaste showed up in discount stores in June and fake wine has been popping up at auctions .
In May , the Food and Drug Administration warned about counterfeit versions of the Xenical weight - loss drug purchased by consumers online .
The Internet opens up new vistas for hunting down the lowest possible price .
And for getting scammed .
“ It used to be that counterfeits was what you saw on a street corner in New York , ” market researcher Lauren Freedman said .
“ Now the whole world is a street corner . ”

When the Sennheiser CX - 300 earphones arrived , they looked perfect .
The black earbuds were adorned with company logos , the asymmetric cord was just the right length and the silver plug fit an iPod perfectly .
They came in a snazzy Sennheiser package with text in six languages .
I had wanted a set of these earphones ever since I gave them a rave review last year in The Times .
They sounded great and fit snugly in the ear .
Perfect for gym workouts , just in case I ever got back to the gym .
List price -- $ 79.99 .
But only a fool pays list .
Amazon.com had them for about $ 65 .
I was n’t about to stop there .
On the same Amazon product page was a link to Amazon Marketplace , where anyone can put an item up for sale .
That ’s where the CX - 300s were being offered for less than $ 25 .
Advertisement
A drop from list price of more than 66 % raised a warning flag , even though the seller with the best price , Wifipro , had a positive customer feedback rating .
I wrote him an e-mail asking :
Was the product , at his price of $ 24.99 , used , refurbished or damaged ?
Wifipro ’s reply : “ These units are brand spanking new in factory blister pack , not returns , not used and not refurbished .
“ They are a beautiful product at an unbelievable price . ”
I was sold .
The price was so good , I almost felt like a bandit .
Advertisement
Indeed , it was a “ beautiful product . ”
But only , as it turns out , if you admire the work of counterfeiters .
--
Counterfeit electronic products have a history of being so obviously flawed that they ’re jokes .
For example , U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in Long Beach recently displayed seized packs of what were intended to look like Duracell batteries , except that the label read “ Dinacell . ”
These days , no one in the industry is laughing much .

“ I ’ve seen fakes with our case , our logo , our address , even our instruction booklet , all faithfully reproduced , " said Lou Lenzi , a senior vice president for product management at Audiovox Corp. , which makes a variety of electronics .
When the CX - 300s arrived from Wifipro , I removed the medium - size cushions from the earbuds and tried replacing them with the smaller ones included in the package to better fit my ears .
But they would n’t stretch over the earbuds , no matter how much I pulled on them .
I figured someone else must have run into the same problem , so I did a search on the Web .
That ’s when I first came across a site : “ How to spot fake Sennheiser cx300 . ”
Advertisement
Still no worries .
The fake depicted was a crude copy .
But further digging made it clear there were several different fakes in circulation .
Finally , I happened upon a posting from a man who had bought a set identical to mine , also at a huge discount .
He had sent a picture to Sennheiser and got a reply that the earphones “ are almost certainly fake . ”
My heart sank .
Now I knew what it was like to get cheated online .
It was made worse by the fact that I thought myself so clever for getting such a bargain .
I sent the earphones to Sennheiser ’s experts , who said they were among the best counterfeits they had seen .
Advertisement
There was a clue , right on the front of the package .
“ Look on the front where it says ‘ Blocks Outside Noise , ’ ” said Uwe Sattler , technical director at Sennheiser .
Under that , in the German translation , was the word Aussengerauche .
“ They forgot the umlaut -- the two little dots -- over the second ‘ a , ’ ” Sattler said .
Ah , the mystery of the missing umlaut .
If I had been the German version of one of the Hardy Boys , I might have caught it .

“ The fakes , ” said Jeff Alexander , Sennheiser ’s U.S. marketing chief , “ are getting so much better . ”
And not just of Sennheiser products .
Counterfeits of Audiovox ’s universal remote controls , sold under the RCA brand , have been cropping up worldwide .
“ It used to be that you needed a very sophisticated facility to produce something like that , ” Lenzi said , “ but now the technology is so widely available . ”
The counterfeiters start with reverse engineering to study the design and components , he said .
Then , plastic injection machines and circuit board printers can be programmed to make a clone .
Up to a point .

The emphasis is on appearance , not functionality .
“ It only has to be in good - enough operating condition to function , at least some , ” Lenzi said .
The counterfeit CX - 300s varied greatly in audio quality .
Andy Ukasick of Milwaukee bought a pair on EBay that he learned were fakes .
“ They sounded terrible , ” he said in an interview .
“ No better than what you could pick up for $ 3 . ”
Ian Moore of Chester , England , who got his on Amazon Marketplace , fared better .
“ The sound was good , but not what you expect from Sennheiser , ” he said .
“ There was no real bass . ”
Advertisement
Moore sent an e-mail to the seller , questioning the product ’s validity .
He immediately got a reply from a Mr. Hussain , offering a full refund .
“ Then I knew they were fakes , ” Moore said .
“ You expect the seller to say , ‘ How dare you . ’
But he was very apologetic . ”
Ukasick also got a quick refund from his seller -- Wifipro .

I set out to find the man behind the moniker , Sidney Jacobs .
It was n’t hard -- his name and return address were on the package the earphones arrived in .
He operates his business in Southern California , only about 30 miles from my home .
Jacobs , 66 , was n’t trying to hide .
His picture was in his EBay seller ’s profile , where he described himself as a “ Vietnam - era Vet ” who had worked for large corporations .
“ I have said goodbye to the business suits , stuffed shirts and power ties , ” Jacobs wrote .
According to comments left on EBay and Amazon Marketplace , buyers started to identify the earphones as counterfeit in July , shortly after Jacobs began selling them .
At first , he made fun of doubters .
“ This is a very sick person , ” Jacobs wrote in response to negative feedback from an EBay buyer .
Advertisement
It was time to give Jacobs a call .
He said that to start his online sales company , he bought Sennheiser earphones from an offshore distributor which he declined to identify .
I told him that Sennheiser confirmed that the earphones he sold me were counterfeit .
Jacobs did n’t express shock but blamed the distributor .
“ I had asked about the legitimacy of the products , ” Jacobs said , “ and they said ‘ Yes , yes .
They ’re the real thing . ’ ”
Jacobs said he did n’t know there might be a problem until several buyers questioned the authenticity of his earphones .
Jacobs said they all got refunds .
And with word getting around the Web about fake CX - 300s , he prepared a note for customers .
It was sent to potential buyers who specifically asked by e-mail if the earphones he was selling were the real thing .
“ My products are in original factory package , ” said the note .
“ They look great and sound great .
That being said , I will not guarantee with 100 % certainty that they are genuine . ”

No such warning appeared on his selling sites .
Jacobs said he could n’t send the earphones back to the distributor .
And he had a tale of woe : a son still living at home , a mother - in - law with serious health problems .
“ I have several thousand dollars invested in these items , ” Jacobs said .
Besides , he was never completely convinced all his earphones were counterfeit .
He pointed out that most of his customers , as evident in his feedback , were happy with the earphones they had received at a huge discount .
Jacobs asked if his name could be kept out of the newspaper .
I told him no .

Finally , the specter of being identified as the seller of counterfeit goods outweighed the financial loss .
“ You have put fear in my heart , ” Jacobs said .
The earphones had to go .
“ I am removing them immediately , ” he said , typing frantically in the background .
“ There , they are gone . ”
Shortly after we spoke , $ 24.99 plus $ 4.99 for shipping was returned to my credit card account .
That was a surprise .
I never asked for a refund , between feeling slightly sorry for the guy and fretting about my journalistic ethics -- after all , I was getting a story out of it .

Of course , counterfeits are still out there .
Plenty of sellers still offer CX - 300s at prices as low as $ 15 on the Internet .
I used to love to find bargains like that .
Getting scammed was a good lesson , but it also took some of the fun out of the hunt .
“ You know the old saying about , ‘ If it ’s too good to be true it probably is n’t ’ ? ” said Freedman , the e-commerce analyst .
“ Well , it ’s true . ”
My mom used to say that too .
It was the part of her shopping lesson I relearned the hard way .

In Brussels at the weekend ( the family and I having decided to test out the St Pancras Eurostar experience ) , the chips , the chocolate and the Atomium were all good fun , but the highlight ( forgive the pun ) was the Dexia Tower – 38 floors and 150,000 LEDs equal one hell of a light show .
I encourage my coworkers to lock their computers .
Security , after all , is everyone 's business .
But often gentle encouragement is not enough .
Sometimes , more .. persuasive methods are necessary .
I first learned about the noble art of goating from from Omar Shahine :
We have this problem in Hotmail .
If you walk away from your desk , even for a brief moment , and your PC is left unlocked , someone will walk in , and send mail to a broad distribution list with something silly .
Like " I like oranges " , or worse things , some downright embarrassing .
For some reason this is called " Goating " .
I find it incredibly annoying .
My office has a lock on the door , so I am in the habit of keeping my door locked when I walk away .
Goating techniques vary from insidious and subtle to invasive , borderline vandalism .
I prefer the milder forms :
Installing the bluescreen screensaver .
Replacing the desktop with a screenshot of the desktop , and hiding all the visible items on it .
Switching the mouse from right to left handed .
Using the video driver settings to rotate the display left , right , or upside down .
Switching the keyboard layout from QWERTY to Dvorak ( or vice - versa ) .
Goating can be quite literal .
I once walked back to my computer to find this :
It 's disturbingly common here , which is why I 've learned to reflexively press Windows +
L when I get up from my desk .
One of my all - time favorite goating techniques , however , is to install the Clippy parody applet on a victi .. er , coworker 's machine .
Who does n't love our old pal Clippy !
After one particuarly inspired installation of Clippy , an email titled " What The Heck " went out to all employees :
Is this another prank or something ?
What the heck is this Ã¢â‚ ¬Â ¦
It 's rude .
Look at the right hand corner of this image .
So far this stupid thing has told me :
My typing speed is slow .
My productivity has been decreasing , I hope everything is Ok ?
My posture is degrading and I should reposition myself .
Finally :
It 's time to play a game .
Let 's play hide - and - seek ?
Much hilarity ensued , and more importantly , crucial lessons were learned about computer security by all .
It 's up to each of us to go forth and spread the good word !
If just one person learns how important computer security is , your work here is done .
Many additional goating techniques can be found in these two metafilter threads ; Office Poltergeist looks quite promising , as does ErrMess .
And you really can't go wrong with Clippy .
But do n't forget to lock your computer while you 're out there spreading the word .

Idiocracy is being treated like a red - headed step - child .
Fox is intentionally and inexplicably trying to kill it .
This weekend it arrives without a movie trailer or even and official poster .
20th Century
Fox has n't bothered to let anyone review it , and in fact until about a week ago when some executive decided to change his mind , the movie was n't going to be released at all .
Usually when a movie gets this kind of treatment it 's because it's a piece of crap , but Idiocracy is one of the best movies of the year .
Mike Judge 's first movie since 1999's massive cult hit Office Space rolls out in eight cities this weekend , almost as an afterthought .
Actually , afterthought is n't the word .
Idiocracy is being treated like a red - headed step - child .
Fox is intentionally and inexplicably trying to kill it .
Idiocracy arrives without a movie trailer or even an official poster .
20th Century
Fox has n't bothered to let anyone review it , and in fact until about a week ago when some executive decided to change his mind , the movie was n't going to be released at all .
Usually when a movie gets this kind of treatment it 's because it's a piece of crap , but Idiocracy is one of the best movies of the year .
Judge is a brilliant satirist , and anyone who thought " Beavis and Butt - Head " was glorifying the stupidity of America 's teenagers probably should n't bother seeing this .
Or maybe you should , since this movie is aimed squarely at all of you .
Modern science fiction usually portrays the future world as a shiny utopia of science and advanced learning .
Either that , or it's a post - apocalyptic wasteland ravaged by science gone amok or man 's own arrogance .
Idiocracy takes a look at where the world 's headed right now and says forget it .
None of that 's going to happen , we 're just going to get really stupid .
Think about it .
Who has the most kids ?
Stupid people .
They 're out their breeding like rabbits while geniuses spend their time developing a cure for male pattern baldness .
That 's the gist of the hilarious opening sequence to Idiocracy .
The smartest , the most fit among us no longer procreate while the stupid screw their brains out ensuring that the human race as a whole gets stupider and stupider and stupider .
Without any natural predators to thin the herd ; with science , welfare , and television keeping the dumbest alive , healthy , and happy enough to remain potent we 're done for .
Evolution will take its course and centuries from now we 'll become a planet full of Bam Margeras .
Idiocracy 's story begins with an average Joe from the beginning of the 21st century .
Joe Bauers ( Luke Wilson ) to be exact .
A low level military scrub , Joe tests out as the most average guy the American armed forces have to offer .
When told to lead , follow , or get out of the way Joe happily steps aside to let other soldiers get through .
In other words it 's a perfect role for Luke Wilson .
Luke 's at his absolute best here , this is the role he was born to play .
Joe on the other hand is perfect for the military 's latest experiments in cryogenics .
He and a hooker turned guinea pig named Rita get frozen , stay in too long , and wake up 500 years later where Joe Bauers is now the smartest man in the world .
The future is full of idiots who 've thrown everything they have into buying Big - Gulps and watching porn .
The most popular television show is called " Ow , My Balls " and features exactly what you 'd expect .
The highest grossing movie of all time is called Ass , and consists of 90 minutes of the same naked , hairy butt on screen farting itself silly .
America has gone to hell in a hand basket .
Garbage avalanches are common , crops have failed , and people are staving , all because there 's no one left who 's smart enough to know how to fix any of it .
The film 's all - out , hilarious assault on the future 's culture is also a biting criticism of our own .
As the world 's people have gotten dumber so have its businesses .
It 's corporate America that takes the biggest belly blow , and there 's no way Judge did it with their blessing .
Costco is an all - powerful , all - purpose monolith .
Carl 's Jr.'s is the world 's leading food provider / robber baron , a Gatorade - like drink with " electrolytes " has replaced water ( except in toilets ) , and Starbucks has become a popular chain of jack - shacks .
Ordering a " latte " is now an inexpensive and socially acceptable way to get full - release .
I hate to get caught up in conspiracy theories here , but these companies can't possibly be happy with having their name associated with things like hand - jobs .
20th Century
Fox has to have felt at least some pressure from their billion - dollar corporate brethren .
Fox is the pet of Rupert Murdoch after all .
Captain of industry , baron of big business .
Maybe that explains the film 's shoddy treatment ?
Hey , I 'm just thinking out loud .
Back to the point , what all of that adds up to is a bitingly funny movie that shoots sharp , sometimes subtle , sometimes in - your - face arrows at the Jackass crowd and the general dumbing down of mankind .
When Idiocracy does a fart joke , the real gag is n't the passing of gas but who it is that 's laughing at it .
The film is full of genuinely gut - busting , laugh out loud moments that do n't go away .
Every scene is packed with little details , from crazy stickers to hairdos in the crowd .
The cast is a brilliant amalgam of Judge regulars like Stephen Root in a great cameo role , and perfectly fit newcomers like Dax Shepard as Joe 's dim - witted , future best - friend Frito .
Terry Crews , probably best known as the dad on TV's " Everybody Hates Chris " , is iconic as nine - time Smackdown champion and leader of the free - world President Camacho .
Even Maya Rudolph , whose appearance usually signifies the end of all things good , is killer as a hooker from the past convinced that her pimp will find his way forward in time to beat her ass .
You know what ?
She almost had me convinced that he would .
Idiocracy 's target may be more broad than Office Space 's and it's not quite as instantly quotable , but it 's every bit as strong a satirical gem .
Fox can try to kill it , but assuming they do n't find some way to keep it from coming out on DVD , it 's destined to become another cult mega - hit for writer / director Mike Judge .
How much money do his movies have to make on DVD before studio executives figure out what he 's about ?
The man is brilliant , and there 's no excuse for burying his film in a hurried , limited release that guarantees nobody will even know that it exists let alone go out and see it .
All this movie needed was a trailer with the words " From the writer and director of Office Space " slapped on it to make a cool $ 50 million .
The guys over at 20th Century Fox are clueless , and so they 've mishandled another piece of Mike Judge magic .
Get out and see it anyway .
From start to finish this film is sharp , clever , and downright funny .
Five years from now you 'll be able to brag to your friends that you saw it years ago in a theater when they 're all just discovering it on home video .
You can't beat scoreboard like that .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - New compounds that act like the red wine ingredient resveratrol may offer a new formula for type 2 diabetes drugs and other age - related diseases , researchers at U.S. drug maker Sirtris Pharmaceuticals said on Wednesday .

“ The excitement here is that we ’re not talking about red wine anymore .
We ’re talking about real drugs , ” said David Sinclair , an associate professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and a co-founder of Cambridge , Massachusetts - based Sirtris .
“ This is the first time that real drugs have been designed to go after diseases through the genes that control aging , ” said Sinclair , whose research appears in the journal Nature .
“ One of the drawbacks of resveratrol is the doses need to be large .
Now this paper says you can reduce it into a little pill taken once a day , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Sinclair and researchers at Sirtris have been looking for drug compounds that mimic the effects of resveratrol , the chemical in red wine that has been shown in several studies to prolong the life of mice and reduce the advance of age - related disease .
They tested some 500,000 molecules to isolate a handful that would have the same effect as resveratrol on the seven genes called sirtuins that have been found in several studies to control the aging process .
Their latest research shows these experimental drug compounds -- which are 1,000 times more potent than resveratrol -- helped reverse diabetes symptoms and reduce insulin sensitivity in two different studies in diabetic mice and one in rats .
“ When you see it work in those three models , you have increased confidence that it will have a universal effect on organisms , ” Sinclair said .
He said that is enough to begin human testing , which the company plans for the first half of 2008 .
“ The chances of success in humans is estimated at 80 to 90 percent .
We ’ll know next year , ” he said , depending on when the company gets the go - ahead from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to start clinical trials .
The discovery may have implications well beyond diabetes drugs , which is itself a $ 19 billion global market .
“ We will make a drug to treat one disease , but it will , as an added bonus , protect you against most of the other diseases of the Western world . ”
Those age - related diseases could include cancer , heart disease and Alzheimer ’s , he said .
While Sinclair and company executives have high hopes for the compounds , they acknowledge that many compounds that hold great promise in animals fail to work in humans , either because they are toxic or because they do not work .
Type 2 diabetes , the kind that comes from too little exercise and a poor diet , accounts for about 90 percent of the 180 million cases of diabetes around the world , according to the World Health Organization .
Is the U.S. going to occupy Iraq indefinitely , or will we withdraw our troops within the next year or so , as the majority of Americans would have it ?
President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki do n’t care what Americans  or Iraqis  think or want : they ’ve already settled the question by signing a " Declaration of Principles for a Long - Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America " that commits American soldiers to the task of defending the present Iraqi government against internal enemies , as well as foreign - based threats to its sovereignty , either real or imagined .
As the Declaration declares , the U.S. is tasked with :
" Supporting the Republic of Iraq in its efforts to combat all terrorist groups , at the forefront of which is al - Qaeda , Saddamists , and all other outlaw groups regardless of affiliation , and destroy their logistical networks and their sources of finance , and defeat and uproot them from Iraq .
This support will be provided consistent with mechanisms and arrangements to be established in the bilateral cooperation agreements mentioned herein . "
It ’s in this context that the Kyl - Lieberman resolution , enthusiastically supported by Hillary Clinton as well as the Bush administration , takes on special importance : having targeted the Iranian security force known as al - Quds , or the Revolutionary Guards , as an officially designated " terrorist " group , the American garrison is already authorized to take on Tehran .
The road to war with Iran is paved , and we ’re ready to roll no matter who sits in the driver ’s seat .
The administration is denying that this is a treaty , which would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate : it is , instead , a " strategic framework agreement " that just happened to be announced after Congress went into recess .
Asked if the administration would seek any congressional " input " on the forging of this agreement , Lt. Gen .
Douglas Lute , the administration ’s point man on Iraq , answered :
" In the course of negotiations like this , it ’s not  it is typical that there will be a dialogue between congressional leaders at the negotiating table , which will be run out of the Department of State .
We do n’t anticipate now that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress . "
Short answer : hell no .
Oh , they may solicit the complicity of the top Democratic leadership in both houses of Congress , to the extent of asking them not to make any waves , but essentially they ’ll do what they have always done in the hundred - plus countries where U.S. troops are currently stationed , and that is negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement , the essential element of which immunizes our soldiers from being prosecuted by local authorities for crimes against the natives .
In this case , however , the scope of the agreement is a bit more comprehensive , encompassing economic and political elements , as well as the " security " factor , i.e. , the military details of the continuing occupation , including U.S. troop levels and the construction of permanent American bases .
What stands out is the stated intention of the Iraqi government to give what news accounts describe as " preferential " treatment to U.S. investment in the country , which presumably means the vital oil production sector .
One imagines that the bidding process is already taking place , with all sorts of sub rosa agreements being made to divvy up the country ’s potentially lucrative oil reserves .
For an administration ostensibly devoted to " free markets , " this sort of crony capitalism is a disgrace .
It is , in short , good old - fashioned imperialism of the sort embodied by the British East India Company .
So what are the Iraqis getting in return for allowing the wholesale looting of their natural resources ?
Fifty thousand U.S. troops stationed permanently in the country , mostly in urban areas  the plan is for 14 " enduring bases , " as we found out back in 2003 .
In spite of all the palaver about " foreign " threats , there is no doubt that we are now in the business of protecting the Iraqi " government " from their own people .
In return , favored American corporate interests will be allowed to strip the country bare .
This agreement formalizes Iraq ’s status as a de facto U.S. protectorate , a province of the empire  an American beachhead in a radically destabilized Middle East that could easily be used as a launching pad for future ( and even more ambitious ) wars of " liberation . "
There ’s just one big problem for the War Party : the Iraqi constitution requires a vote by the Parliament in order to give the Status of Forces Agreement ( or this preliminary declaration of intent ) the force of law .
And that looks problematic , at best , given the weakness of the Maliki regime .
As Liwa Sumaysim , formerly tourism minister and now a member of the Iraqi Parliament from the fiercely nationalistic party of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , put it : “ The Iraqi parliament must have the final word on it . "
Can the American Congress say the same ?
I think not .
The Americans are careful to cloak their illegal and increasingly untenable military occupation of Iraq in all sorts of pretensions to legality : they refer to the UN resolution , which sanctions Iraq as a " terrorist " state and a " threat " to " international peace . "
The Bush administration will go to the Security Council once again for a renewal of this formal mandate  even though it declares , in effect , that Iraq remains a pariah among nations , which rankles the Iraqis .
The idea is to transition over to a bilateral Iraqi- U.S. agreement that supersedes the UN framework and codifies the terms of the occupation in Iraqi law .
Whether the Iraqis will go for it , or the more nationalistic elements , such as the Sadrists , manage to stall approval of the declaration and derail the U.S. - Iraqi " negotiations " over the exact content of a future Status of Forces Agreement is a pretty even bet .
What you can count on , however , is that we wo n’t hear a peep out of the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives , which does n’t at all mind being in recess while the president commits us to an open - ended occupation  and America takes a giant step down the road to empire .
Neocon columnist Jonah Goldberg complains that " the word ’ empire ’ substitutes for an argument ; there are no good empires , just as there are no good fascists , or racists , or dictators . "
What he does n’t say is that this argument is only good in America : why , even the supposedly antiwar archbishop of Canterbury , as the denizens of National Review ‘s " The Corner " recently noted , has hailed the alleged achievements of British imperialism as compared to the vulgar American version .
The British routinely point to their imperial past as a source of pride , as do American Anglophiles .
The French , the Spanish , and the Italians all revel in the supposed glory of their past conquests : it ’s only the Americans who disdain the very idea of having an empire , and , indeed , instinctively sense something profoundly un-American about the whole concept of Washington , D.C. , as the capital of a global imperium .
That ’s what ordinary Americans think , at any rate : the elites , on the other hand , believe they are uniquely qualified  and , indeed , have a duty  to rule over the peoples of the world for their own good , of course .
To believe otherwise is to stand condemned as an " isolationist , " a dreaded epithet reserved for any politician or public person who refuses to get with the program and dares challenge the fundamental assumptions upon which U.S. foreign policy has been built since the days of Harry Truman .
So you do n’t believe the U.S. has any business stationing its troops in 100 - plus countries ?
What are you , some kind of isolationist dinosaur ?
Do n’t you realize that we have a moral obligation to be " engaged " in the world ?
It scarcely merits mentioning that this sort of " engagement " means a policy of perpetual war , and that , in particular , the neoconservative dream of a remade Middle East is a prescription for a regional conflict that would dwarf the current level of conflict in Iraq by several orders of magnitude .
Which is why it is never acknowledged , at least in " mainstream " venues , yet that is the future being mapped out for us .
That Congress is in recess as this most important step is being taken is emblematic of our elected representatives ’ abdication in the foreign policy realm , and specifically of their constitutional duty to review and ratify  or reject  treaties .
Yet their abstention is hardly a big surprise : after all , this is the same sorry collection of solons who stood passively by while we were lied into war , then complained that they did n’t know , they could n’t help it , and it was all the Republicans ’ fault , anyway .
This deft maneuver by the Bush administration will give the Democrats an ample out if and when they inherit the occupation .
Our hands are tied , they ’ll cry , as their antiwar base demands a U.S. withdrawal .
We must stand by our agreements , or else we ’ll be seen as unreliable .
And , hey , what are you , anyway  some kind of kooky " isolationist " ?!
Of course , the Senate could reconvene , at the pleasure of Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader , and debate , in an emergency session , the U.S. - Iraqi declaration and the prospect of a permanent U.S. presence  but the Democrats ( at the leadership level ) do n’t consider this a matter of great urgency .
To the Beltway crowd , Democrats as well as Republicans , the Empire is a fact of life , and  when the balance sheet is drawn up  a good thing .
After all , who , other than themselves , is better qualified to run the world ?
And if you ca n’t handle that , my friend , then you most certainly are one of those dreadful " isolationists . "

Having smoked the last cigar in my humidor recently , I decided to stop at my local tobacco shop — Jon's Pipe Shop — and pick up a cigar .
I settled on Hoyo de Monterrey 's Excalibur No. III and I walked out of the store six dollars poorer .
While in the city of Champaign , IL , I conversed with the owner and employees about several different tobacco - related topics — including smoking bans and tax increases .
It seems smokers just can't get a break .
Now , as a brief background , the city of Champaign has been jerked around as of late by politicians on the issue of tobacco .
Last year , the city council voted to ban smoking in bars and restaurants , with the ban taking effect in January of this year .
In May of this year , after two new anti-smoking ban candidates were elected to the city council , the ban was repealed .
But alas , Governor Blagojevich , our scandal - ridden , fearless leader , and the Illinois legislature , the two of which are almost always at odds , incidentally , came together to do what politicians do best — expand the role of government .
So , despite the brief reprise that Champaign has gotten from needless paternalism ( is there any other kind ? ) , come next January bars all across Illinois will have to put up no -smoking signs .
The only point to my visiting bars was to smoke a cigar with friends , given that a glass of scotch tastes just as good at home as at the bars and costs significantly less .
The bars have , through no fault of their own , lost my business .
Now , if that was n't bad enough , there is a similarly odious bill brewing in the United States that would mandate a 20,000 + % increase in the tax on cigars as well as a less exorbitant increase in the tax on cigarettes .
( For those who have not heard about this , you might think the percentage listed above may be a typo — I would say you have too much faith in government . )
Now , while politicians , and federal politicians in particular , may love to extend their own power ( with one notable exception — Dr. Ron Paul ) , they are not stupid .
The increase in taxes on cigars would be a part of a bill to renew the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
Now , if that is n't a brilliant stroke , I do n't know what is !
After all , who could possibly be against giving health care to poor , uninsured children ?
Well , of course , those heartless libertarians , but who else ?
Besides , the program already exists , it just needs to be reauthorized .
What would we tell those children who would be cut out of the program ?
Even those otherwise inclined against socialized health care , it seems , could be easily turned against their own instincts .
A large number of organizations have come out in support of the reauthorization of this program .
The linked story includes this telling line : " The American Medical Association could use an increase in federal tobacco tax for funding the SCHIP program . "
Well then , who could say no to the AMA ?
The saddest inclusions on that list are surely all those Catholic organizations .
The fact that the Church and its adherents worked so hard to set up so many hospitals in Medieval Europe aimed at providing health care to the poor was , to me , always one of the greatest testaments to its benevolence and fidelity to Christ 's teachings ( see Thomas E. Wood 's excellent How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization ) .
Now , however , Catholic Charities receives two - thirds of its annual budget from government grants and such .
They 're on the government dole and they like it .
It seems that charitable health care can only be provided with assistance from the state .
One might say it 's a shame that so few people contribute to charity that so much money must come from the government .
But , honestly , why would anyone donate when they know their taxes already do that for them ( as Charles Murray would tell us ) ?
Jacob Sullum over at Reason has already looked at who the increased tobacco tax will actually hurt and who SCHIP would actually help , so I wo n't deal with that .
There are several other observations that I 'd like to make .
First , poorer cigar smokers would no longer be able to afford cigars .
By " poorer " I mean all non -fat cats .
The Excalibur I mentioned earlier would cost me around $ 15 with the proposed tax .
In my four years of smoking , I dished that much out for a stick maybe two or three times .
They were big occasions .
At Jon 's Pipe Shop , the majority of people buying cigars in there are college students , both undergrads and graduate students .
I highly doubt they can absorb a $ 10 increase per cigar .
I know I can't .
I 'm sure some smokers better off than myself can continue to enjoy cigars , including whatever cigar smokers there are in the federal legislature .
Cigars taste great and are a great way to relax , but I do n't need cigars .
But what does it matter if cigars are a necessity or not ?
Imagine if politicians tried to tax some other non-essential , yet enjoyable ( to some ) , product , such as fast food .
I do n't think McDonald's , Wendy's , Burger King , or their consumers would take kindly to $ 10 cheeseburgers .
But given our culture 's current hyperventilation over obesity it would seem to me just as appropriate as a tobacco tax .
But as Sullum said in his column , " everybody hates smokers . "
Too true .
It 's the modern sin , and we smokers are desperately in need of repentance .
But politicians do n't want to eradicate those sinners whose weakness is cigarettes , given that there are so many of them and they are such a cash cow .
But the cigar industry is a relatively small one in the world of American tobacco , so targeting them is easy .
Maybe , if the politicians are lucky , all those former cigar smokers will make a mass exodus to cigarettes ( ha ! ) .
Finally , perhaps the craziest thing about the whole situation is that Bush may veto the reauthorization if it makes it to his desk .
Our " conservative " president 's love affair with big government is well - documented .
But on this issue he has said that reauthorization would amount to a " massive expansion of the federal role " in health care .
Well , that 's certainly a refreshing sentiment to hear from him , and I 'd love to be able to continue smoking my cigars , but I 'll believe it when I see it .
Until then , I 'll enjoy my cigars while I still can .

The government advises exclusive breastfeeding for first six months
Children with one version of the FADS2 gene scored seven points higher in IQ tests if they were breastfed .
But the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study found breastfeeding had no effect on the IQ of children with a different version .
The gene in question helps break down fatty acids from the diet , which have been linked with brain development .
Seven points difference is enough to put the child in the top third of the class , the researchers said .
In the past people have had different results about whether breastfeeding improves IQ and this would sort out the reason why
Professor Jean Golding
Some 90 % of people carry the version of the gene which was associated with better IQ scores in breastfed children .
Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry , Kings College London , used data from two previous studies of breast - fed infants in Britain and New Zealand , which involved more than 3,000 children .
IQ was measured at various points between the ages of five and 13 years in the studies .
Previous studies on intelligence and breastfeeding have come up with conflicting results .
There has been some debate as to whether mothers who had more education or who were from more affluent backgrounds were more likely to breastfeed , skewing the results .
Nature versus nurture
Professor Terrie Moffitt , a co-author on the paper , said the findings gave a fresh perspective on the arguments by showing a physiological mechanism that could account for the difference between breastfed and bottle - fed babies .
HAVE YOUR SAY
More scare tactics !
Breastfeeding is n't for every woman and in fact some babies get on better with a bottle .

" The argument about intelligence has been about nature versus nurture for at least a century , " she said .
" However , we have shown that in fact nature works via nurture to create better health outcomes . "
Since the studies used in the analysis were done , manufacturers have begun to add fatty acids to formula milk but there have been inconsistent results on the benefits .
Belinda Phipps , of the National Childbirth Trust , said : " This shows for the majority of parents they can have a positive effect on their babies IQ by breastfeeding . "
Catherine Collins , a dietician at St Georges Hospital in London and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association , said the study highlighted the interaction between nutrition and genetics .
" In this study you have an effect that suggests that nature is more important that nurture .
" If nine out of 10 babies benefit , then that is a very good chance . "
But she added the study did not specify how long babies were breastfed for and it may be that even breastfeeding for a short period may be beneficial for intelligence .
Professor Jean Golding , who founded the ALSPAC study set up in the 1990s to follow the development of thousands of children in the South West of England , said the results were fascinating and they would be doing a further study of the gene .
" In the past people have had different results about whether breastfeeding improves IQ and this would sort out the reason why , " she said .
Most people do n't know it , but there is a 60 - year - old man out in the cold right now walking toward Washington DC , who says Bush and Cheney need to be impeached in order to save the Constitution .
He says he does n't like hiking , and he does n't like cold , but that someone had to do something .
He has dipped deep into his retirement savings for the project , so much that he's not sure what he 's going to do about retirement now .
But he 's convinced that if Bush and Cheney are not called to account for breaking the law and violating the Constitution , right now , the country will never be the same .
People are walking alongside , waving , and wishing well as he goes .
His name is John Nirenberg , a college professor from Vermont .
He may be liberal , but I 'm not , so I 've drawn up my own little list of " Why They Should be Impeached " so we conservatives can be counted too .
Because George Bush locked up an American citizen , Jose Padilla , without the jury trial that is his right as an American , and claims he can do exactly the same thing to any one of us .
Because Bush violated our right to freedom from search and seizure without probable cause , and twists it to sound like he's not allowed to spy on terrorists , which is false .
Even John Ashcroft from his hospital bed could n't stomach the NSA warrantless surveillance , and he 's not exactly liberal .
Because someone in his administration exposed an American intelligence officer , Valerie Plame .
These people take an oath to do their jobs even if it costs them their lives .
Their own Commander - in - Chief should be the most concerned , not make excuses for whoever did it .
Because he failed to secure 360 TONS of HMX high explosives in Iraq back in 2004 .
He knew exactly where they were .
These are killing our soldiers now .
Because he refused an urgent request by the Special Forces commander on the ground at Tora Bora , for troops to cut off bin Laden 's escape .
As we can see from Pakistan , bin Laden is alive and well .
Because he did n't have the sense to at least plant some WMDs in Iraq so the world would n't think we were there for the oil .
Now way more people hate us than did before .
I am only half joking here .
I call myself an Eisenhower - Roosevelt Republican .
Eisenhower warned us of the threat to our freedoms of the " Military - Industrial Complex . "
Teddy Roosevelt wanted the little guy to have a chance against big business , so he busted up the monopolies .
I believe that if either of these men were alive today , they'd be calling for the impeachment of George Bush and Dick Cheney .
What people do n't realize is that John Nirenberg is standing up for the rights of even those calling him a nut .
He believes , as the Constitution says , that every American has the right to a jury trial , no matter what the charge is .
Under the label of " enemy combatant " George Bush can now sweep up anyone , waterboard them , and no one will ever know it .
“ You can view this as a pure pipeline , ” says Mr. Chien , himself a former professor .
Jean Stéphenne , president of the vaccine division of GlaxoSmithKline , the pharmaceutical company , says university partnerships with corporations will grow “ because technology is changing so rapidly . ”
Even if companies have the resources to finance their own research and identify the right academic problems to tackle , they usually do n’t have the time to assemble a staff to pursue these problems .
Without help from university professors , Mr. Stéphenne asks , “ How can we cope ? ”
Some people doubt that formal partnerships between corporations and universities can deliver real benefits .
“ Universities do n’t innovate , ” says Curtis R. Carlson , chief executive of SRI International , a nonprofit research institute in Menlo Park , Calif. , that bought what remained of RCA ’s lab .
“ Innovation means you get it out so people can use it .
The university is not going to take it to the world . ”
But corporations hope that universities can help them take innovations to the world faster and more efficiently .
Last month , BP pledged to spend $ 500 million over 10 years on alternative - energy research to be carried out by a new Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley , which will manage work done at a nearby Department of Energy lab and at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
“ This is a new model we ’re working through in real time , ” says Robert J. Birgeneau , the chancellor of Berkeley .
CRITICS of corporate - university partnerships fear limits on academic freedom or , worse , that companies might censor results that go against their interests .
The risk of such interference seems small , however .
Despite the large amount being offered by BP , the money will be divided three ways ; of Berkeley ’s annual research budget of $ 500 million ( nearly all from the federal government ) , BP will be contributing less than 3 percent .
Under the terms of the partnership , meanwhile , Berkeley professors are free to publish results of BP - funded research .
The university also will own the rights to any resulting intellectual property .
BP would even have to license that intellectual property , though payments are capped and the company would get the first look at promising results .

第一の関門は、経営陣が、まったく異なるビジネスに対して、考え方を切り替えられるかどうかという点にあります。パッケージやサービスのビジネスというのは、基本的に先行投資のビジネスです。まずソフトウェアを完成させるまでに時間がかかり、次にソフトウェアが世の中で認知されるまでに時間がかかり、認知されてからも普及していくまでにはさらなる時間がかかります。そして損益分岐点にたどり着くまでの間、しかも、いくら時間をかけたところで、ソフトウェアが世の中に受け入れられるものになるかどうかわかりません。人月ビジネスには、稼働率の向上や継続的なスキル向上といった人月ビジネスならではの難しさがありますが、ソフトウェア開発という意味では同じカテゴリーに位置するものでありながら、プロダクトやサービスには、これらとはまったく異なる種類の難しさがあります。これまで稼働率を高めて行けば着実に会社の利益が上がっていたところが、半年も一年も、場合によっては何年も、いくら時間をかけても収益が上がるかどうかわからなくなってしまうことは、経営者にとって身震いがするほど恐ろしいことです。*1個人の生活に例えるなら、これまで普通に毎日会社に行っていれば一定の給与が得られ、安定した生活を送ることができていたのが、急にすべてが成果報酬になって、成果が出るまでは、何年もの間生きていくためのお金さえ得られなくなる可能性がある、というのと同じことです。このようなリスクに対して、具体的には、従来のビジネスを継続しながら、共通の部品がそれなりにまとまってきたところでライブラリやフレームワークとして製品化しようとしたり、空いた時間を使って新しいサービスを開発したりしようとします。このような方法でビジネスを成功させるのは、実際には極めて困難です。安定したキャッシュを生み出す従来のビジネスが第一義的に優先し、新しい事業に対して戦略的にリソースを割り当てることができないからです。多くの経営者は、人月ビジネスと、プロダクトやサービスのビジネスが根本的に異なることを、直感的に理解しています。異なる事業に対し、社長も社員も給与体系も労働形態も、何もかも新しくして取り組まなければ、インパクトのある新事業を立ち上げるのは難しいことを知っています。そして、経営者の多くは、事業の初期の構想段階において、プロダクトやサービスの立ち上げを、資本関係の薄い別会社で立ち上げようとしたり、できるだけ親会社が関与しないように配慮しながら、従来と異なるメンバーで子会社を設立したりすることを考えます。もし、そのままこの方向で進むことができれば、新事業に望みを託すことも可能かもしれません。*2ところが、ここで経営者の頭の中に、という発想がムクムクと首をもたげ始めることがあります。それは、ソフトウェアのビジネスは、それぞれがまったく異なるものでありながら、からです。求められる能力というのは、具体的には、ソフトウェアを設計・実装する能力や、テストする能力や、運用する能力や、バグの調査と修正を行う能力等のことです。これらはいずれも、どのような種類のソフトウェアを開発する場合にも必ず求められるものですが、これまでと異なる業態のソフトウェア事業に転向するのは、なのと同じような難しさがあります。経営者に求められるものも、リスクの取り方も、お金の流れも、営業のスタイルも、対象顧客も、リリースに対する考え方も、就業のスタイルも、共通なのは基礎体力の部分だけで、その他の部分については根本的に何もかもが異なるからです。従来と異なるメンバーで別会社を立ち上げたところでうまく行くかどうかはわかりません。しかし、片手間で二義的に始めた新規のソフトウェア事業は、それよりずっと高い確率で失敗しているように見えます。最初は経営者も社員も、新しい事業の柱をつくるのだと目を輝かせていたプロジェクトが、まさに上記のパターンで勢いを失っていくケースを最近身近で聞いたことのがこのエントリを書いたきっかけです。そして、同じような話を、これまで何度も耳にしてきました。*1 そして、人によっては、身震いがするほど楽しいことです。見通しが立たず、普通に毎日開発をしているだけでは確実に倒産してしまう中で、どのように活路を見出していくか、ということについて、強くやりがいを感じる経営者は少なくありません。*2 もちろん、これだけでうまく行く、ということではありません。また、このフェーズを飛ばして、いきなり「今のうちの会社でもできるのでは？」というフェーズに行ってしまったケースも何件か見たことがあります。

It sounds like the start of a joke - how many police officers can you fit into a Volkswagen ?
The answer , apparently , is 14 ... but it 'll be a squeeze .
This extraordinary sight is the result of Metropolitan officers ' desire to get as quickly as possible to the scene of Monday 's warehouse fire at the Olympic site in London .
Scroll down for more ...
The Volkswagen van is designed to carry eight passengers , but onlookers were amazed to see it driving through Tower Hamlets with an extra six bodies on board .
There certainly were n't enough seatbelts to go round , as at least one officer could be seen pressed uncomfortably against the back window .
And after their traffic department colleagues see these photographs , those PCs who found it was standing room only could be given a £ 500 fine for not belting up .
The driver could also be fined up to £ 5,000 for allowing the minibus to be overloaded .
Carrying too many passengers is dangerous because it can make the vehicle less stable .
It would also be harder to steer and take longer to stop .
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the policemen involved would be reprimanded .
' Officers from Tower Hamlets were asked to assist colleagues at the Olympic site during the recent fire , ' he said .
' During the early stages of the incident it was necessary to ensure the response was quick .
' The officers concerned will be spoken to regarding the incident . '
Firemen believe the blaze in Stratford could have been started by welders demolishing a building .
The question is :
What can be done to lower both the high level of health care spending and its high rate of increase from year to year ?
The Solutions
Geography .
Pioneering studies by researchers at Dartmouth have shown enormous disparities in expenditures on health care from one region to another with no discernible difference in health outcomes .
Doctors in high - cost areas use hospitals , costly technology and platoons of consulting physicians a lot more often than doctors in low - cost areas , yet their patients , on average , fare no better .
There are hints that they may even do worse because they pick up infections in the hospital and because having a horde of doctors can mean no one is in charge .
If the entire nation could bring its costs down to match the lower - spending regions , the country could cut perhaps 20 to 30 percent off its health care bill , a tremendous saving .
That would require changing the long - ingrained practices of the medical profession .
Public and private insurers might need to refuse coverage for high - cost care that adds little value .
Stick to What Works .
The sad truth is that less than half of all medical care in the United States is supported by good evidence that it works , according to estimates cited by the Congressional Budget Office .
If doctors had better information on which treatments work best for which patients , and whether the benefits were commensurate with the costs , needless treatment could be junked , the savings could be substantial , and patient care would surely improve .
It could take a decade , or several , to conduct comparative - effectiveness studies , modify relevant laws , and change doctors ’ behavior .
Managed Care .
For a brief period in the 1990s it looked as if health maintenance organizations competing for patients and carefully managing their care might bring down costs and improve quality at the same time .
The H.M.O. ’s did help restrain costs for a few years .
The problem was , doctors and patients hated the system , management became much looser , and the upsurge in costs resumed .
Managed care techniques are creeping back into some health plans , especially for services apt to be overused , but too heavy a hand would most likely produce another backlash .
Information Technologies .
The American health care system lags well behind other sectors of the economy — and behind foreign medical systems — in adopting computers , electronic health records and information - sharing technologies that can greatly boost productivity .
There is little doubt that widespread computerization could greatly reduce the paperwork burden on doctors and hospitals , head off medication errors , and reduce the costly repetition of diagnostic tests as patients move from one doctor to another .
Without an infusion of capital , the transition from paper records is not apt to happen very quickly .
Prevention .
Everyone seems to be hoping that preventive medicine — like weight control , exercise , better nutrition , smoking cessation , regular checkups , aggressive screening and judicious use of drugs to reduce risks — will not only improve health but also lower costs in the long run .
Preventive medicine actually costs money — somebody has to spend time counseling patients and screening them for disease — and it is not clear how soon , or even whether , substantial savings will show up .
Still , the effort has to be made .
The Milken Institute recently estimated that the most common chronic diseases cost the economy more than $ 1 trillion annually , mostly from lost worker productivity , which could balloon to nearly $ 6 trillion by the middle of the century .

CONSPIRACIES OF DUNCES
by Douglas Rushkoff
( from Arthur No. 26 )
I have to admit that I do this with some trepidation .
I can already feel the assault on my inbox .
But after a good long think about potential time and energy being lost by our entire community to senseless and ultimately inconsequential musings , I have to come out and say it : the alternative theories about 9 - 11 are wrong .
Worse , the endless theorizing and speculation about trajectories , explosives , military tests , fake airplane parts and remote control navigation actually distracts some of our best potential activists from addressing the more substantive matters at hand .
Yes , I believe that 9 - 11 theorizing debilitates the counterculture .
It robs us of some potentially creative thinkers .
It replaces truly important questions with trivial ones .
It marginalizes more constructive investigation of American participation in the development of Al Qaeda as well as its subsequent aggravation .
And perhaps worst of all , it is precisely the sort of activity that government disinformation specialists would want us to be involved with .
9 -11 theorists are unwittingly performing as the unpaid minions of the administration ’s propaganda wing .
( At least most of them are unpaid ; no doubt , some of the loudest are working as contractors for the same agencies whose activities they pretend to deconstruct . )
That ’s why , instead of nodding along with their long - winded , preposterous yarns under the false belief that any critique is better than no critique , we — the informed , intelligent , and reasonable members of the war resistance — must instead disassociate ourselves from this drivel .
In other words , we must draw the line between the kind of analysis done by Greg Palast and that done by Pilots for Truth .
If we do n’t apply discipline to our thinking , we risk falling into the trap that even some of our best intellectuals have — like Harper ’s editor Lewis Lapham , who on reading a bit too much 9 - 11 conspiracy , has concluded that it all has some merit .
I ’m all for supposing .
It ’s how the best science fiction gets written , the best science gets speculated , the best innovations get developed , and the wildest thoughts get hatched .
But forensics is a different beast .
As any detective will tell you , the most straightforward solution is usually the right one .
As one NYPD detective explained to me , “ Nineteen hijackers took four planes and crashed them at different places : WTC 1 , 2 , the Pentagon and a field in PA .
These accounts broadly correspond to all that was observed and heard that day , who was on the flight manifests , where they came from and what they claimed to want to do , and yet do not involve vast US government conspiracies and do not need the coordinated , perfect lying of tens of thousands of people about the mass murder of their fellow citizens and those they gave their oath to spend their careers protecting . ”
True enough , these huge incidents have produced many unexpected details .
The plane in Pennsylvania scattered its parts differently than we might have expected it to .
Lamp posts near the Pentagon got knocked over when we would n’t have thought were vulnerable given the altitude of the approaching plane .
Building number 7 fell hours later , even though it was never directly hit by a plane .
Video photography of the collapses show the towers falling quite neatly , as if in a planned detonation .
But strange and unexpected details do n’t necessarily point to the fallacy of the central premise — especially when the alternative involves the active coordination of thousands , if not tens of thousands of citizens in a conspiracy to attack the United States .
We must look at what each intriguing detail or inconsistency actually says about how the crime took place .
Again , in the words of my favorite member of the NYPD , “ These explanations are principally based on the fatally flawed idea that any confusion or misinterpretation or differing accounts in times of crisis must be the product of purposeful lies .
They neglect the idea that in crises , and when there is mass confusion , people do not have specific recollections , only general ones that are highly subjective , such as what direction a plane sounded like it was coming from .
Their stories seek to poke holes in prevailing truth , yet offer no alternative that could be seen as remotely plausible . ”
For example , the Pilots for 911 Truth website explains : “ Why was Capt .
Burlingame , a retired Military Officer with training in anti-terrorism , reported to have given up his airplane to 5 foot nothing .
100 and nothing Hani Hanjour holding a “ boxcutter ” .
( Exaggeration added for size of Hani , he was tiny , lets just put it that way ) .
We at pilotsfor911 truth.org feel the same as his family in that Capt .
Burlingame would not have given up his airplane unlike what is reported in this linked article from CNN . ”
What , exactly , is this supposed to mean ?
Was Captain Burlingame murdered ?
Or was he the willing participant in the government ’s effort to sell the invasion of Iraq to America — so much so that he chose to enter into a suicidal pact ?
Or was the hijacker bigger than his passport suggests ?
Or is it implausible that a small dark man from an undeveloped country was able to overpower a big , trained , white man from a Superpower ?
And that ’s where I suspect all this theorizing really takes us : to the heart of a racist jingoism worse even than the triumphalism justifying our foreign policy to begin with .
They ca n’t bring themselves to accept that our big bad government can really be so swiftly outfoxed by a dozen relatively untrained Arab guys .
And rather than go there , they ’d prefer to maintain the myth of American hegemony .
On a certain level , it feels better to believe that we are only vulnerable by our leaders ’ sick choice — not by our adversarsies ’ increasing strength and prowess .
But maintaining this comforting illusion comes at a price .
It paralyzes our ability to do the real work necessary to parse what is going on .
I mean , on a certain level , what does it matter whether Osama Bin Laden , a CIA - trained former ally is currently acting on his own or as an operative of some covert semi-governmental organization or corporation ?
We ca n’t even begin to ask these questions when the people who might be most qualified to look into them are instead crippled by their own ethnocentrism .
The cultivation of a critically aware public is too important right now for us to entertain this silliness any longer .
When a full 40 percent of the American public believes that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9 - 11 , we ca n’t afford the luxury of this delusional behavior .
We are the alternative to the FoxNews version of events , and we must strive to present a more responsible alternative to Karl Rove ’s disinformation .
The war profiteers are absolutely delighted that so many of us are still distracted by this phantom menace .
And they delight in our belief that the central government is really powerful enough to pull something like this off .
I ’ve been interacting with intelligence people for the past three years , going to conferences and writing articles promoting an open - source approach to national security .
After these encounters , I can assure you — anyone who knows anything about our government knows that a conspiracy on this order is well beyond their capabilities .
Hell , the administration could n’t even “ find ” weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
They ca n’t even reveal a Valerie Plame or fire the few remaining honest US attorneys without a complete backfire .
Conspiracy is not what these folks are good at .
Our government excels at doing its really bad stuff out in the open .
They break laws in order to spy on citizens , and refuse to acknowledge objections from lawmakers or justice .
They take taxpayers money and give it to the companies they run .
They acknowledge the many billions of dollars that go missing , and offer not even a shrug .
They put the people who formerly lobbied on behalf of industries in positions running the agencies that are supposed to be regulating them .
By looking under the rug for what is n’t even there , we neglect the horror show that is in plain view .
In the process , we make it even easier for the criminals running our government to perpetuate their illegal , unethical and un-American activities .
In fact , the most logical conclusion I can draw from the existing evidence is that 9 - 11 theorists are themselves covert government operatives , dedicated to confusing the public , distracting activists from their tasks , equating all dissent with the lunatic fringe , and provoking the counterculture ’s misplaced belief in the competency of its foes .
That ’s the real conspiracy .

This wreath is certainly festive and seasonal , but it 's just a bit too small , about the width of a human hair , to place on the front door to welcome guests .
It 's made from a common species of diatom ( Eucampia zodiacus ) .
Why can diatoms look so much like stained glass windows in a Cathedral ?
They 're made from opaline silica , SiO2 -- the material of opals and glass .
Diatoms are critically important in that they 're the beginning of the food chain .
Aquatic plants ( of which diatoms are the most prolific ) supply 50 percent of the oxygen on Earth , and when they die they sink to the bottom of the oceans , acting as a carbon sink .

Asexual organisms are usually short - lived
A Cambridge team says the creature owes its existence to a genetic quirk that offers some recompense for its prolonged celibacy .
Many asexual organisms have died out because they cannot adapt to changes in the natural world .
But an evolutionary trick allows this pond - dweller to survive when conditions change , researchers report in Science .
There could be some benefit to millions of years without sex after all
Dr Alan Tunnacliffe , University of Cambridge
The secret to this novel survival mechanism lies in a twist of asexual reproduction , whereby the animal is able to make two separate proteins from two different copies of a key gene .
Prolonged celibacy
Dr Alan Tunnacliffe , from the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Cambridge , who led the research , said his team had been able to show for the first time that gene copies in asexual animals can have different functions .
" It 's particularly exciting that we 've found different , but complementary , functions in genes which help bdelloid rotifers survive desiccation , " he explained .
" Evolution of gene function in this way can't happen in sexual organisms , which means there could be some benefit to millions of years without sex after all . "
The researchers discovered that two copies of a particular gene , known as LEA , in the asexual pond - dweller are different - giving rise to proteins with separate functions that protect the animal during dehydration .
One copy stops other essential protein molecules from clumping together as the animal dries out , while the second copy helps to maintain the fragile membranes that surround the creature 's cells .
Genetic diversity
Humans and most other types of organism reproduce sexually .
The union of sperm and eggs results in two copies ( or a pair ) of genetic instructions within a cell , one copy inherited from each parent .
This produces two nearly identical copies of each gene in each cell , and therefore two nearly identical proteins .
The " re - shuffling " of genetic material over many generations allows sexual animals to adapt to changes in their natural environment .
In contrast , many asexual organisms have died out because their rigid genetic make - up means they are unable to adapt in this way .
The latest discovery explains why the bdelloids have likely escaped this fate with their mechanism for generating genetic diversity in the absence of sexual reproduction .
The study reported in Science magazine was conducted on a species of bdelloid rotifer known as Adineta ricciae .

A two - year - old Indian girl born with eight limbs has astonished doctors with a remarkable recovery following major surgery .
Lakshmi Tatma was born with four legs and four arms - but has had them removed in a gruelling operation .
She was today removed from intensive care following a procedure which removed her headless ' parasitic twin ' a week ago , and was reunited with her parents .
Scroll down for more ...
Without the operation to remove her twin , who was fused at the pelvis , the toddler - hailed as the reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Vishnu - was unlikely to live beyond her early teens , medics said .
Doctors at the Sparsh Hospital in Bangalore , where Laskhmi underwent the 27 - hour operation , admitted they were amazed at her quick recovery .
" She is alert , eating solid food and on nothing stronger than paracetemol , " said Dr Sharan Patil , who led the operation .
" She has well and truly passed the danger stage and is on course to make a full recovery .
There may be further operations down the line , to correct her club feet , but so far so good .
She is making remarkable progress . "

In the first pictures since she regained consciousness five days ago , Lakshmi can be seen happily smiling with her mother Poonam , father Shambu and older brother Mithilesh , four .
Doctors predict she could be released from hospital shortly after Christmas .
" Lakshmi is behaving exactly like her old self , it 's amazing , " said Poonam .
" She remembers exactly who she likes and dislikes .
Some people have come in her room and she points and screams at them until they leave .
" But she is smiling again and happy to see those she likes .
" She has developed a taste for the hospital canteen 's raspberry milkshake , which we resorted to when she refused normal milk , but other than that she is the same as before only with two legs . "
" She has a very sweet tooth , so we have been treating her a little .
She 's been bought a beautiful pink dress for the first time in her life she can fit in normal clothes . "
Scroll down for more ...
Lakshmi was born with eight limbs in Rampur Kodar Katti , a remote village without electricity or water in the crime - ridden state of Bihar , 20 miles from India 's border with Nepal .
Her poverty - stricken parents , who earn less than 50 p a day as casual labourers , were turned away from every government hospital they visited for help .
Until the intervention of Dr Patil , who visited Bihar in January to asses whether an operation was viable , Lakshmi had never received any medical attention .
" Her recovery is God 's will , just as it was God 's will that she was born like that in the first place , " said her father Sahmbu , " but what the doctor 's have done is like a miracle .
" The doctors are like gods - they can make the living dead and the dead living .
They have made Lakshmi a normal little girl .
It was my dream and it has come true . "
Speaking at a press conference to declare the operation a complete success , Dr Patil said : " All the surgeons ' lives have been enriched by our contact with Laskhmi and I really feel it has been our privilege .
" By no means are we completely done with Lakshmi , but so far so good .
She has a plaster cast on both legs at the moment to hold her feet in a steady position and to keep her wounds together .
" Her wounds are both raw and extensive , so that is something we are paying great attention to at the moment .
Her recovery from the operation overall has been excellent . "
ABC : Evangelicals wary of Romney

ABC News reported Sunday that Mitt Romney 's Mormonism is creating problems for him with " evangelical Christians , some of whom are deeply skeptical about Mormonism . "
Host Dan Harris showed footage of a yearly event in rural Utah , where every summer thousands of Mormons gather , followed by thousands of evangelicals aiming " to try to save Mormon souls . "
The video included one evangelical telling a Mormon , " Your Jesus can not save you .
Your Jesus is the brother of Lucifer . "
Evangelicals often reject the Mormons ' claim to be Christians , because Mormons hold beliefs that other Christians do not share .
They are also wary of the " massive missionary campaign which has turned Mormonism into one of the fastest - growing religions on the planet " and fear a Romney presidency would help Mormonism grow even further .
Despite this , ABC concluded , many evangelicals would vote for Romney simply on the basis of his conservative social positions .
The following video is from ABC's World News , broadcast on August 5 .
Baghdad Babylon Hope and Despair in Divided Iraq
When describing Iraq , the word " peace " is seldom used .
Truth be told , the Americans have restored order to many parts of the county .
But Iraq remains fractured , and where new schools are built today , bombs could explode tomorrow .

They have blamed their neighbour , then 47 - year - old Lori Drew , for participating in that harassment using a fabricated a MySpace profile of a teenage boy called Josh Evans .
" Josh " pretended to be interested in Megan before he began bullying her .
On October 16 , last year , " Josh " sent his final message , telling Megan the world " would be a better place " without her .
Soon afterwards , Tina Meier found her daughter hanging from a cloth cord .
Megan died the next day , and weeks later her family learned that a boy she had been communicating with online did not actually exist .
Banas , the prosecutor , said that although Lori Drew knew about the fake MySpace page she had not created it .
He said it had been set up by an 18 - year - old employee of the Drews who was also responsible for that final message .
A police report indicates others gained access to the profile , though those involved dispute who thought up the idea for the site and who was present when messages were sent .
Banas said he took a look at the case after federal authorities said no federal crime was committed .
He said he reviewed laws related to stalking , harassment and child endangerment before making his announcement .
Banas said harassment and stalking laws both require proof that communication was made to frighten , disturb or harass someone .
In this case , he said , the fictitious MySpace profile was created not to bully Megan , but to find out what she was saying about Lori Drew 's then 13 - year - old daughter .
Megan and Lori 's daughter had been friends but had a falling out ..
" There are a few statements at the end that are a heated argument , " Banas said .
" That 's why you have a hard time making a harassment case . "
Reaction to the case has been strong , with angry postings on the internet outing the Drews as the neighbours involved in the ruse .
The Drew household has reported vandalism , including a brick through a window , once word got out about the circumstances surrounding the death .
Police have stepped up patrols in the area .
Banas said it's his understanding that Lori Drew 's daughter is now being home - schooled .
He added that the employee who was also involved is hospitalised and receiving psychiatric treatment .
Megan 's family has been seeking legal changes since it became clear in recent weeks that it was unlikely anyone would be charged .
" We were certainly hopeful that there was going to be some sort of prosecution , but I 'm certainly not surprised , " Tina Meier , said on Monday .
Two Missouri communities , including Megan 's hometown , have changed local laws to make internet harassment a crime , and several others are considering measures .
Changes are also being proposed to state law .
Tina Meier said the bottom line for her was that Lori Drew knew about the fake profile , knew Megan was on medication , and let the hoax continue .
She said the fake profile was deleted right after Megan 's death .
Then , she said , Lori Drew did n't come clean .
" Our daughter died , committed suicide , and she still did n't say a word , " Meier said .
" I still feel what she did is absolutely criminal . "
Meier previously has acknowledged that Megan was too young to have a MySpace account under the website 's guidelines , but she added that she was able to closely monitor the account .
Meier 's family has also acknowledged that Megan was also sending mean messages before her death .
Megan was being treated for attention deficit disorder and depression , her family has said .
Tina Meier said those involved will have to live with the choices they made , and said perhaps one day the 18 - year - old will be able to educate people against cyberbullying .
" I really hope she gets the help she needs , and I do n't think she meant for this to happen to Megan , " she said .
Of Megan 's former friend , she said : " I certainly do n't wish her any harm .
Unfortunately , she does n't get to pick her parents . "

A Plan for a Preemptive Strike on the United States by the British Dominion of Canada , circa 1921
Introduction
In December 2005 , the Washington Post published a quixotic article entitled Raiding the Icebox .
The piece introduces readers to U.S. War Plan Red , the little - known 1930 plan to conquer Canada .
More sardonic than serious , the article acted mostly as a holiday diversion from the quagmire in Iraq : " Invading Canada wo n't be like invading Iraq :
When we invade Canada , nobody will be able to grumble that we did n't have a plan . "
When interviewed , both Canadians and Americans took it as a joke , competing for the cleverest quip .
Winnipeg mayor Sam Katz defiantly vows to the American enemy : " It will be like Napoleon 's invasion of Russia . "
Americans routinely joke about conquering Canada .
But these plans are no joke .
As a loyal , self - governing Dominion in the British Empire , Canada served as a proxy for American tensions with Britain throughout the 19th century .
American troops invaded Canada during both the American Revolution (! ) and the War of 1812 .
Significant border disputes existed until the 1850s , covering tens of thousands of square miles .
Tensions rose during the American Civil War , when Confederates and Irish nationalists looked to Canada as a shelter , launching pad , and target .
Even seemingly unrelated matters such as the Venezuelan boundary dispute of 1895 threatened to flare up into conflict between Britain and the United States .
As the twentieth century dawned , tensions lessened as Anglo - American interests coincided more and more .
Yet , until the 1920s , there was a real risk that the Anglo - Japanese alliance would draw Canada into war with the United States .
The British were quite serious about their alliance with Japan , inviting Japan into the inner circle of the Allied Powers in the Paris peace talks ending World War I1 .
The alliance bound Britain to neutrality in the event of war between Japan and one other power , and to military support of Japan in the event of war between Japan and two other powers .
As World War I demonstrated , overlapping treaties can have a cascading effect .
Strategic thinking tends to lag behind strategic reality .
Despite the end of the Anglo - Japanese treaty in 1921 , the US developed War Plan Red in the 1920s to address a possible war with the British Empire .
Conversely on the Canadian side , James Sutherland " Buster " Brown prepared for a war with the United States .
Thus was hatched Canadian Defence Scheme No. 1 .
Analysis
Knowing that Canada suffered from a ten - to - one manpower disadvantage against the United States , " Buster " Brown 's plan relied on strategic surprise and lightning movements .
Canada could not hope to win a one - on - one war with the United States , so any Canadian defense plan had to rely on troops from the British Empire for military parity .
Yet , in the age before air transport , any aid from Britain or her colonies would take weeks or months to arrive by sea .
Canada had precious little strategic depth with which to undertake a defensive war , as the bulk of its population , industry , and rail lines were located near the American border .
Indeed , the American War Plan Red relies on the proximity of Canadian resources to project a rapid and successful conquest of Canada .
To counter the seemingly overwhelming American military advantage , " Buster " Brown envisioned a preemptive strike against the United States .
Canadian troops would mobilize quickly and attack with little warning , relying on surprise to penetrate American soil as far south as Oregon .
Of course , the massively outnumbered Canadian forces could not hope to hold on to the captured territory .
So they would begin a strategic withdrawal , destroying bridges , roads , and factories as they went .
Thus , it would be American territory , rather than Canadian , that would be used for strategic depth .
It would be American industry , farmland , and infrastructure that was destroyed , all of which would hamper American efforts to bring troops to the Canadian border .
The gamble , then , was that Imperial forces would arrive to hold the line by the time Canadian forces had retreated back into Canada .
Clearly , Canadian Defence Scheme No. 1 was both daring and risky .
It relies to a certain extent on US forces being caught off guard , a naive assumption given the proximity .
Ultimately , Defence Scheme No. 1 and its American counterpart faded away as Anglo - American relations continued to improve .
War Plan Red was one of two dozen color - coded plans developed by the US military , ranging from major world wars to the invasion of Caribbean nations ( Gray ) .
In contrast , Canada 's potential enemies were much fewer .
Defence Scheme No. 2 addressed a possible war with Japan , in case the Pacific realignment drew Britain into war with its former ally , and No. 3 and No. 4 simply planned the dispatch of Canadian troops to aid British forces in European and colonial wars2 .
American War Plan Red was declassified in the 1970s , but quickly became a footnote in comparison to Black ( Germany ) and Orange ( Japan ) .
Military historians seized on Orange , in particular , as a sign of the times , envisioning super - dreadnought battleships steaming to the Philippines ( then an American colony ) to engage in a fleet action with the Imperial Japanese Navy , sixteen - inch guns blazing .
Canadian Defence Scheme No. 1 fell into even greater obscurity , not least because it was largely an internal army discussion , " not fully disclosed to the Government .
"
3 War Plan Red resides in the National Archives of the United States , while Defence Scheme No. 1 lives at Queens University , in a collection of James Sutherland Brown 's papers .
An excerpt was published in a 1965 five - volume academic study of Canada 's defense history4 , which as the sole published copy seems to be the source of most further inquiry ( although many sources cite the James Sutherland Brown papers collection directly ) .
The well - known War Plan Red is available online [ Link ] .
Interestingly , it was located , digitized , and posted to Usenet in 1995 by Floyd Rudmin , who was then at Queens University , where the full Defence Scheme No. 1 is located .
I guess that University is just a hothead of Canadian resistance to American domination !
Until and unless I make my way to Queens University someday to locate the complete copy , I present here the partial plan that is available in published works .
Canadian Crown Copyright lasts fifty years , so the Defence Scheme is now in the public domain .

DEFENCE OF CANADA — GENERALLY
Section 1 . Problems to be met by the Empire
The Imperial General Staff is of the opinion that the possible eventualities , which the Empire must be prepared to meet , fall roughly under two main headings :
A struggle for the existence of the Empire such as that from which we have only recently emerged .
Minor crises which may be only local in character but which may synchronize or spread until a situation develops straining the resources of the Empire very greatly without enabling us to take the extreme methods which would be justified by a great national emergency .
These latter cases would probably call for the employment of the full authorised Forces of the Crown in the various parts of the Empire , namely , Regular Army and Permanent Forces ; territorial forces and militia forces , to be kept up to strength by voluntary enlistment , but would not call for national service in the case of other parts of the Empire or Levee en Masse in the case of Canada .
The major eventuality is a plain straightforward issue , but it is considered by the Imperial General Staff that it could scarcely arise without the inclusion of one of the great civilized powers in the enemy ’s ranks .
Although there are indications that we may be faced by a hostile Russo - German combination and signs of danger from other centres are not absent , the British Cabinet has come to the conclusion that a war similar to that which has just been concluded is not likely to recur during the next 5 or 10 years .
The Imperial General Staff held at the same time that such an eventuality cannot be lost sight of entirely , and though neither the locality nor the chief actors can at present be foretold , it will be wise to take such general measures as will enhance the value of the Land Forces of the Empire as a whole , without prohibitive expenditure , such as ( a ) the co-ordination of military thought throughout the Empire , including measures for ensuring the close co-operation of Staffs , which was so marked a feature of the recent struggle , ( b ) the standardization of establishments and equipment , ( c ) the drawing up of schemes in each part of the Empire for the distribution of man power as between the three Services and the industries necessary to maintain armies in the field with a view to obtaining the maximum value for the available manpower .
From this it will be possible to assess for different parts of the Empire the relative proportion of effort to be devoted to each of the three Services , which will best suit the requirements of the Empire as a whole , ( d ) the extension in Peace time and the expansion in War of industries intimately connected with the supply of warlike material in order that Indian and Dominion Forces may be , so far as possible , self - supporting , ( e ) the distribution of responsibility for the collection of intelligence and arrangements for co-ordinating the results .
The above are matters which will be discussed at the approaching Imperial Conference .
The Defence of Canada , therefore , falls under two categories : —
Direct Defence , i.e. , the immediate defence of our country against invasion by hostile forces ; Indirect Defence , by which we send an Expeditionary Force to bring the hostile country or countries to action in their own country or countries , or in any case , in territory beyond the confines of the Dominion of Canada .
Section 2 . Three Defence Schemes Necessary
For a struggle for the existence of the Empire , it would appear that four cases may occur : —
A European Combination The United States Japan A combination of the above .
Only ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) of the above and possibly in a lesser extent ( 3 ) would put Canada in immediate danger of invasion and call for the Levee en Masse .
It is necessary , therefore , to draw up three different Defence Schemes : —
For the Defence of Canada against the United States .
For the Defence of Canada against Japan .
For the Organization and the Despatch of an Expeditionary Force to help the Empire in case of a European Combination or a Minor Crisis . . .
Section 3 . General Strategical Situation of Canada
. . .
The first thing apparent then in the defence of Canada is that we lack depth .
Depth can only be gained by Offensive Action .
To carry out an Offensive Action against the United States , with our population in a ratio of 1 to 12 and the United States ’ Regular Army of 175,000 Enlisted Men , and with between two and four millions of men who were lately embodied for service , is a difficult and on the surface an almost hopeless task , but on further study , it would be found out that it is not as hopeless as it appears on the surface and that Canada has a good many advantages in her favour .
To carry out an Offensive Action against the United States means , first of all , Quicker Mobilization ; secondly , the immediate despatch of Flying Columns on the declaration of War ; thirdly , the despatch of our Formations at Peace Strength to be followed rapidly by drafts filling them to War Establishment ; fourth , a speedy mobilization of our Reserve Units by General Recruitment and by putting in force the Levee en Masse , as soon as Proclamation is made ; fifth , the completion of the organization of our Formations by the inclusion of Reserve Units ; sixth , the despatch of Reserve Units to certain garrisons or certain strategical points ; seventh , the early formation of Depots .
Time is of the essence of everything of our mobilization and of our early operations .
To keep up this offensive and to continue the successful defence of Canada , will require the timely arrival of reinforcements from the Empire and particularly from the United Kingdom and the full use of the man power and resources of the Empire in other theatres of operation , namely , the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States ; the Southern Seaboard , i.e. , the Gulf of Mexico , Florida and Mexico ; the Pacific Coast .
In order to carry out this Offensive , well chosen lines of Offence should be decided upon , these to produce the greatest results , firstly , to increase our Depth ; secondly , to increase our resources by the occupation of hostile territory ; thirdly , to increase the moral [ sic ] of our population with a corresponding decrease of moral of the enemy ; fourthly , to cover the organization and mobilization of our man power and to prevent the destruction of our resources and lateral communications ; fifthly , to gain time until the arrival of help from the various parts of the Empire , as soon as the man power and the resources of the Empire are mobilized and transported to their various spheres of action .
SEA POWER
Sea Power is another of the most important factors in the Defence of Canada .
To keep open for periods , at least , the seas for the transport of Britannic and Imperial troops to the various Theatres and for the protection of our Atlantic and Pacific Coasts , to prevent our flanks from being turned , to prevent our Ports of Disembarkation for help from the Empire being occupied or destroyed .
Control of the Great Lakes
Another important strategical feature in the Defence of Canada is the control of the Great Lakes .
On all , except Lake Ontario , the Americans have a preponderance of shipping and they have in the States bordering the Great Lakes a Naval Militia of considerable size , which could be made use of to arm and man United States ’ Mercantile Great Lakes boats .
Timely arrival of British ships of suitable size in Lake Ontario and the proper protection of the Welland Canal , might ultimately give us control of Lake Erie .
Many Canadians , including many navigating officers , are serving in the United States ’ Great Lakes Mercantile Marine .
Further information concerning this question will have to be gathered and action taken to put their service into use at the appointed hour .
WINTER CAMPAIGN
A winter campaign , for obvious reasons , by a large force , is not feasible , but the subject should not be lost sight of , as we might be forced into a winter campaign and in any case mobilization might have to take place during the winter and tactical raiding would be feasible .
POLITICAL QUESTIONS
Statesmen decide on the Time , Circumstances and the Locality of War and leave it to the Soldier to make the best of them .
It is hoped that our Statesmen will act in such a manner to give us as many advantages as possible in case war becomes inevitable between the British Empire and the United States of America .
Members of Parliament and Members of the Senate are drawn from various sources of life , most of them with no War Service and very many of them with no militia connection and no knowledge of the vast machinery required for War and of the terrible disadvantage of loss of the initiative at the commencement of a campaign .
It is your duty then to do what you can within your sphere of action to see that such political personages are enlightened on questions of Defence .
French Canadians ( all Roman Catholics ) form nearly one third of the population of Canada .
They took little interest in the Great World War .
There may have been “ Vatican ” influence , but it would appear that the main reason for lack of interest was lack of proper political control and leadership from Ottawa .
The Roman Catholic Church in Canada is suspicious of the Militia .
It has no reason to be so .
It has everything to gain and nothing to lose by supporting the Militia .
If the United States ever conquered Canada , the dual language would be done away with at once and the Roman Catholic Church would have much less power and influence by one hundred fold .
Americans in Canada .
Many in British Columbia .
Well over 50 % in Alberta .
Over 50 % in Saskatchewan .
Many others holding important positions , especially in manufactures and transportation , in other parts of the country .
Census , 1921 .
Commanders should obtain information from the Census , 1921 , as soon as the Census Report is compiled , as it will give the latest information of foreign population and of man power of the various Commands and Districts .
Provincial Jealousies .
Friendly rivalries between the East and the West and between the various Provinces may help to stimulate matters , but every care should be taken to prevent Provincial or Parochial matters interfering with broad questions .
There is a tendency for Provincial politicians to interfere with proper organization and there will probably be the same tendency to prevent the proper distribution of troops in time of war .
This tendency may only be eliminated by education .
. . .
Section 9 : Allies or Possible Allies of Great Britain
Japan .
Japan is still an Ally of Great Britain .
The question of the renewal of the Japanese Treaty comes up this year .
Whatever Japan ’s attitude may be at any other time , there is not much doubt , in case of war between the British Empire and the United States , that Japan would take immediate military action against the American Republics , in which case it would make matters much more favourable to us , especially at the beginning of the campaign , if we would find that Japan would carry out her traditional policy of delivering their Declaration of War and a Military Operation at the same time . . .
France .
France has always taken a friendly interest in the United States .
She came to her help during the Revolutionary War and for years the American Army organization and tactics were based on the French system .
France has seen more in the last two years of the modern “ Yank ” .
She is dissatisfied with American action , with the low rate of exchange of the franc in the United States , with the attitude of the United States towards the League of Nations .
It would appear then that the United States would get no support either actively or sympathetically from France .
Mexico .
It has a turbulent and unruly population estimated from 12 to 15 millions .
For over 100 years it has been a pin-prick on the American Southern Flank .
The Mexicans have not shown themselves , generally speaking , opposed to British interests .
In case of war with the United States it is not unlikely that Mexico would cause trouble on the Southern Frontier , causing a goodly force of United States ’ troops to be concentrated towards Mexico .
If Mexico became an active participant in a War against the United States , it would be an area of operation for Britannic or British Empire troops against the Southern States , having for its object the capture of Galveston and New Orleans , and blocking the Mississippi River .
The South American Republics .
Many of whom are not hostile to British interests and might decide to support the British Empire .
Many of these Republics possess Navies of a useful size which would be a tremendous factor in operations against the Panama Canal .
Section 10 : The Strategic Importance of Newfoundland , Alaska and West Indies .
Alaska .
The Alaskan Coast presents harbours to be used as submarine bases of operation against the British Columbian Coast .
A sufficient force of regular troops might be kept on the Southern Alaskan Coast to capture Prince Rupert by a coup de main , immediately after the declaration of war .
Newfoundland . . . . enters largely into the Defence of Canada .
American occupation of the Island would have far reaching results .
It would be on the flank of the sea routes between Great Britain and Canada and it would be a menace to all our shipping and a base for naval operations against Nova Scotia , the Gulf of the St. Lawrence , and the St. Lawrence River generally .
Newfoundland would appear to be a rendezvous and a probable base of operations for the British Grand Fleet .
West Indies .
The West Indies are admirably situated as bases for naval operations against the Southern States and particularly against the Panama Canal .
They are situated on the flank of the Panama Canal route and if , by any chance , the United States ’ fleet or any great portion of it was in the Pacific at the outbreak of war the use of the Panama Canal for concentration on the Atlantic Coast might be denied absolutely to them .
. . .
CHAPTER TWO : PROBABLE ACTION OF THE UNITED STATES
Main Objectives .
The main objective of the United States force would undoubtedly be Montreal and on to Ottawa .
The next important objective of the United States would be the occupation of the Ontario Peninsula , including the cities of Hamilton and Toronto .
The other objectives at which the American Land Forces would be moved against would be Quebec , Winnipeg , the Island of Vancouver and South Western British Columbia , i.e. , the area including Vancouver and New Westminster .
The grain growing Provinces of Manitoba , Saskatchewan , and Alberta which now have a large percentage of Americans , are especially attractive to the United States , and there is just a possibility that they might make the conquest of these Provinces the ultimate objective of their campaign . . . .
First attempt Invasion of Canada — Mode of :
It is considered that the first attempt of the invasion of Canada would take place as mentioned above by the use of Flying Columns , to carry out a great strategical stroke to catch us unawares before the Canadian Militia was mobilized .
If this was not successful , it is considered that there would be a period elapsing of possibly a couple of weeks before a determined effort would be made to advance on Canada by Divisions of all Arms .
Organization of Our Flying Columns for Immediate Action
This emphasizes the fact that our Flying Columns must be organized for immediate action : that our Divisions must get underway with units at Peace Strength with the least possible delay , that is , within three or four days of the declaration of war .
This is the object to work up to in the Scheme for Mobilization .
If , after careful study , and taking into consideration the improvement that is sure to come in the position of Militia recruiting , you consider that your units will not be able to move towards their war station on the third or fourth day of mobilization , please advise the General Staff at Ottawa of that fact and of what time you estimate that your Division will be on the move to its War Station .
Section 2 : General Instructions for Offensive Action
All training and organization in Peace and all arrangements during the Precautionary Period will lead up to a general Limited Offensive against the United States .
Pacific Command .
The field troops of the Pacific Command to advance into and occupy the strategic points including Spokane , Seattle , and Portland , Oregon , bounded by the Columbia River . . . .
Prairie Command . . . should converge towards Fargo in North Dakota . . . and then continue a general advance in the direction of Minneapolis and St. Paul .
The occupation of Minneapolis and St. Paul would cut most of the lines leading to Duluth . . . and would have a tendency to protect our railway communications through the Kenora and Rainy River Districts . . . .
Great Lakes Command . . . will , generally speaking , remain on the defensive , but rapid and well organized raids should be made across the Niagara Frontier , the St. Clair Frontier , the Detroit Frontier and the St. Mary ’s Frontier , with sufficient troops to establish bridgeheads . . . .
Quebec Command . . . will take the offensive on both sides of the Adirondack Mountains with a view of converging . . . in the vicinity of Albany , N.Y. . . .
Maritime Command . . . will make an offensive into the State of Maine . . . .
Everyone ’s got quirks .
Me , I like finding new ways to think about problems , and I ’ve started seeing numbers in a new way .
Today I ’m bringing you along for the ride .
And why do you care ?
You ’ll see math as one of several approaches .
We ’re still improving our number system .
.
We ’re still improving our number system .
You ’ll start noticing core relationships and apply them to diverse areas
and apply them to diverse areas
You ’ll have a way to approach “ weird ” concepts like division by zero and imaginary numbers .
Math is Software For Your Brain
Though our favorite encyclopedia describes math as “ the body of knowledge centered on such concepts as quantity , structure , space , and change ” I think there ’s more to it than that .
Math is software for your brain :
Your brain is a raw computer .
You learn new math ( install “ Counting 1.0 ” and “ Algebra XY Pro ” ) and suddenly you can solve new types of problems .
Sometimes math has bugs .
“ Roman Numerals I ” was ok , but Decimals 2.0 was a much - needed upgrade .
But we still have a few issues , like dividing by zero .
It ’s a strange analogy , but I ’m a bit strange , so I think it works out .
But Math Has Its Limits
Quick quiz : Can you multiply two Roman numerals ?
No cheating , no converting to decimal : I ’m talking about “ IX times XXXIV ” .
Ready , set , multiply !
…
Having fun yet ?
It ’s CCCVI .
Does this horrendous experience mean multiplication is “ hard ” ?
Or are we thinking about multiplication in the wrong way , using the wrong mental software ?
If you upgrade your brain from “ Roman Numerals I ” to “ Decimals 2.0 ” , you ’ll find that 9 times 34 is a much easier question : after some work you ’d get 306 .
Same problem + different mental software = drastic difference .
Painting With Notepad
Yes , you could squeeze multiplication into Roman Numerals .
But it ’s neither fun nor easy , and do n’t get me started on long division .
Our difficulties are often due to our approach , not the concept .
Think of it like trying to draw in Notepad .
It ’s a nice tool , and you can even “ type ” the Mona Lisa , but the software just was n’t built with images in mind .
Similarly , Roman Numerals were built when we were still learning to count — zero was n’t even invented yet !
Math is a software system that gets better over time , and Roman Numerals were due for an upgrade .
But before we get too high - and - mighty , realize our current number system is a patchwork of new features and bug fixes , used to improve our understanding of the universe .
And when we hit difficulties ( What ’s 1/0 ?
The square root of - 1 ? ) we need to wonder if we ’re hitting universal “ laws ” or walls of our own making .
Like the Romans trying to multiply , let alone do fractions , my money ’s on the latter .
From Ug to Infinity
Our number system developed over time .
We started counting on our fingers , moved to unary ( lines in the sand ) , Roman Numerals ( shortcuts for large numbers ) and Arabic Numerals ( the decimal system ) with the invention of zero .
Along the way we found “ bugs ” in our number system and had to invent new ways around it .
Again , the bug was in our thinking ( our mental software ) .
Ugware
Ugware is the counting system devised by Ug the caveman : counting on your fingers and toes .
Ug ’s bug was that he was limited to 20 items !
The fix was to abstract the need for physical objects : you do n’t need 20 cows to count 20 cows .
You can make 20 lines in the sand .
Or take shortcuts like C for 100 .
Unary and Roman Numerals
Having numbers represented abstractly let us do cool things like add and subtract , even fairly large numbers .
I + II = III .
X + XX = XXX .
Not bad .
But there was still a few “ bugs ” — what is III – III ?
Zero
What a fantastic , beautiful invention : using the symbol 0 to represent nothingness !
It ’s a mind - bending and useful idea : we can keep track of “ no ” cows at all !
This development led to our familiar positional number system : 204 means two “ hundreds ” , zero “ tens ” and four ones .
Integer division and multiplication became possible in ways the Romans ( and Ug ) had never imagined .
You could work out 1234 × 5678 if given enough time .
What a great feature !
Negatives
But zero did n’t solve everything ; subtraction still had problems .
What happens when we take 5 from 3 ?
One solution is to throw up our hands and say “ it ’s a bug and it ’s undefined ” , but we ’ll do better .
We can think about the problem differently , and entertain the possibility that a number can be “ negative ” — a number that is less than nothing !
( Pretty mind - bending , no ? ) .
There are many interpretations ( a lack of cows , a debt of cows ) and negatives were invented to handle this “ bug ” in subtraction .
Of course , it took a few thousand years to accept this new feature — negative numbers were still controversial in the 1700s !
Rational Numbers
Division introduced bugs as well .
8 /4 is fine , but what is 3/4 ?
It ’s a bug !
The fix is to find a way to represent “ numbers between numbers ” .
3/4 is really 75/100 , or “ 0.75 ” .
We invented the decimal point to handle the crazy idea of a number more than zero but less than one .
Wow !
Pretty wild , but we included these crazy types of numbers to make our mental software better .
Lo and behold , fractions have their uses .
The average family can have 2.3 kids and we know what it means .
Irrationals Make Greeks Angry
Here we are , minding our own business when we see a right triangle :
The sides are 1 and 1 .
And there , staring us square in the face , is the square root of 2 .
It taunts us , asking to be written down .
We ca n’t — it ’s an infinite , non-repeating decimal number that ca n’t be expressed as a fraction !
And yet it ’s right there on paper .
It ’s more than a conundrum — it ’s madness !
The guy who discovered irrationals got thrown off a boat .
Luckily , irrationals are at least “ algebraic ” in that they are the solution to some algebra equation .
We can consider $ \sqrt{2} $ as shorthand for “ the solution to the equation $ x ^2 = 2 $ ” .
We often forget $ \sqrt{9} $ is really both 3 and - 3 , do n’t we ?
Convention implies the positive root .
Complex Numbers
Now some a smart aleck asks , “ Ok bub , what number is the solution to the equation x ^2 = - 1 ? ” .
What to do ?
Declare this to be impossible and non-sensical , just like zero , fractions , rationals and irrationals were once “ impossible and non-sensical ” ?
Or do we accept that maybe , just maybe , our human understanding of the universe is not complete and we have more to learn .
You know where my money lies .
Imaginary numbers are just as “ realistic ” as other numbers ( or equally contrived , depending on your viewpoint ) .
But , we do n’t have an intuition for them because they ’re often “ explained ” :
Oh , you do n’t have an Electrical Engineering degree ?
Did n’t learn about complex impedance ?
No intuitive imaginary numbers for you !
I ’ve been thinking about these numbers and plan to address this issue .
But not yet — have patience .
Why .9999 … = 1 , and why you should care
Our number system is a way of thinking , but it still has a few gaps .
We ’re not quite sure how to deal with infinity and infinitely small numbers .
Here ’s a brain - buster for you :
You : What ’s 1/3 ?
Me : Um , .33 repeating .
You : Ok .
What ’s 1/3 + 1/3 ? Me : 2/3 You : Sure , but do it in decimals .
Me : Um , .33 repeating plus .33 would be… .666 repeating .
You : Great .
Now what ’s 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 , in decimal ?
Me : Uh… .33 repeating plus .33 repeating plus .33 repeating … is .99 repeating .
You :
But does n’t 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 ?
So .99 repeating = 1 . Me : What manner of trickery is this ?
( Pushes you off blog ) .
Try that argument on a kid ( or adult ) — it ’s fun to see people ’s reactions .
Clearly , 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1 , but somehow when we try to “ add it in decimal ” the result seems a bit strange .
Again , is the strangeness due to the concept , or our thinking ?
What is .33 repeating , anyway ?
Is it a monkey writing 3 ’s until the end of time ?
Is it a number beyond our notation that we ’re hopelessly trying to approximate , like the square root of 2 ?
If we simply switch to base 3 , the problem goes away : 1/3 = .1 in base 3 , so .1 + .1 + .1 = 1 ( again , in base 3 ) .
And why do you care ?
It may be time for a number system upgrade .
Discussing infinity with our current numbers is like drawing in notepad .
It ’s crude and feels “ tacked on ” ( like saying 1/0 = infinity .
What about 2/0 or 0/0 ? ) .
Mathematicians are working on new number systems where infinity is built - in , but there ’s still unsolved problems about how to “ count ” infinity .
Let ’s seek the “ a ha ! ” insights that made zero , fractions and negative numbers understandable , not just the results of manipulating equations .
We ’ve been able to overcome every previous mathematical roadblock .
Going Forward
The goals of this article were simple :
Show how math is like mental software that improves over time
that Explain that “ nonsense ” like zero or negative numbers can start as a paradox and become intuitive as we adapt our approach .
as we adapt our approach .
Today , we still have trouble with ideas like infinity ( or at least I do ) .
It ’s ok to admit it .
This is a way to think about math ; combine it with your own understanding .
Do n’t stand in a daze , unable to add because you ’re unsure what 1/3 really means .
Insights deepen our understanding , but sometimes only emerge with use .
Newton did n’t have a “ formal ” understanding of infinitesimals when he invented calculus , but it seemed to work fine for him ( equations got solved ) .
I do n’t advocate plug - and - chug , but for certain ideas you need to hammer away before the insights come .
But enough philosophy .
Upcoming articles will show real , concrete ways to think about arithmetic and complex numbers , which can aid the “ mechanical ” understanding we have today .
Happy math .

Shuttle Discovery and Expedition 16 astronauts talk with reporters from inside the new Harmony node aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) on Oct. 27 , 2007 , after the module was opened earlier in the day .
This story was updated at 9:28 a.m. EDT .
HOUSTON — Astronauts the International Space Station ( ISS ) celebrated the grand opening of their orbital laboratory 's latest addition on Saturday to christen the hub - like node dubbed Harmony .
The station 's Expedition 16 commander Peggy Whitson and Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli opened the hatch to the nearly 16 - ton Harmony module at 8:24 a.m. EDT ( 1224 GMT ) , commemorating the event with a brief ceremony .
" It 's a pleasure to be here in this very beautiful piece of hardware , " Nespoli said of the Italian - built Harmony node which he and his STS - 120 crewmates aboard NASA 's shuttle Discovery helped install during a Friday spacewalk .
Nespoli and Whitson wore protective goggles and masks inside the node to guard against any loose debris shaken free during the module delivery to the ISS .
They also took air samples after floating into the new orbital room .
Harmony in space
Named by students in a NASA contest , the Harmony node serves as the docking point for European and Japanese laboratories to be installed during future shuttle missions .
" We think Harmony is a very good name for this module because it represents the culmination of a lot of the international partner work , " Whitson said during the node 's christening .
The school bus -sized connecting node was temporarily attached to the space station 's Unity module on Friday and will be moved to its permanent position once Discovery leaves the ISS on Nov. 4 .
" We 're just getting it suitable so we can go in and get the work done , " said ISS flight director Holly Ridings late Friday .
" But [ we 'll ] not actually do anything permanent in there so that it can be moved again . "
Astronauts connected power and data lines to the Harmony module earlier today to power up its internal systems .
They will then begin the busy task of replacing valves and removing more than 700 bolts that secured the module 's internal components in place during Discovery 's Oct. 23 launch .
" At one point , originally in the mission , it was not a requirement for us to go inside , ' Discovery 's STS - 120 mission commander Pamela Melroy said before the spaceflight .
" And the crew said , ' No way !
We want to go inside !'
We were excited about that . "
Melroy presented Whitson with a necklace bearing a Harmony module - shaped charm after the node was opened .
The Harmony module increases the internal volume of the ISS by about 2,666 cubic feet ( 75.4 cubic meters ) , bringing the station to a total of more than 17,000 cubic feet ( 481 cubic meters ) .
When complete in 2010 , the station will include some 43,000 cubic feet ( 1,217 cubic meters ) of pressurized volume and enough habitable space to rival a five - bedroom home .
Earlier , NASA astronaut Clayton Anderson previewed Harmony 's grand opening today with the song " Harmony . "
" So that was a little Elton John welcoming her to the fold , " said Anderson , who is returning to Earth with Discovery 's crew .
An orbital hub
The Harmony node 's port side docking berth is reserved for Japan 's three - segment Kibo laboratory , while the European Space Agency 's Columbus module is slated to be attached to Harmony 's starboard side during a December shuttle mission .
NASA European space station partners are counting the days , hours and minutes until Columbus arrives at the station later this year , said ISS deputy program manager Kirk Shireman .
" I think it 's prime real estate , because it is at the front and it's at the nexus of three primary pressurized modules , " Discovery pilot George Zamka has said of Harmony node before flight .
Installing and outfitting Harmony is one of the major goals for Melroy and her STS - 120 crew .
During their planned 14 - day mission , astronauts will also perform a total of five spacewalks and move a massive solar array segment to the port - most edge of the station 's backbone - like main truss .
The Discovery crew awoke at 1:38 a.m. EDT ( 0538 GMT ) today to the song of " Bellissime Stelle " — Italian for " Beautiful Stars " — sung by Andrea Bocelli .
The tune was chosen specially for Nespoli .
" We certainly hope that you 've had a little bit of time to look out and see the beautiful stars since you 've been up there in space , " NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid radioed Nespoli from Mission Control here at the Johnson Space Center .
" Yes , stars a really beautiful and from up here they 're even more beautiful , " Nespoli said .
" Thank you to everybody who made this possible .
I really appreciate it . "

DARDENNE PRAIRIE , Mo. , Nov. 21 — Megan
Meier died believing that somewhere in this world lived a boy named Josh Evans who hated her .
He was 16 , owned a pet snake , and she thought he was the cutest boyfriend she ever had .
Josh contacted Megan through her page on MySpace.com , the social networking Web site , said Megan ’s mother , Tina Meier .
They flirted for weeks , but only online — Josh said his family had no phone .
On Oct. 15 , 2006 , Josh suddenly turned mean .
He called Megan names , and later they traded insults for an hour .
The next day , in his final message , said Megan ’s father , Ron Meier , Josh wrote , “ The world would be a better place without you . ”
Sobbing , Megan ran into her bedroom closet .
Her mother found her there , hanging from a belt .
She was 13 .
The Ministry of Defence released photographs of the latest in a series of incidents over the past few months in which the Russian planes flying close to British airspace have been intercepted by the RAF .
The MoD said in a brief statement that the Typhoons , based at Coningsby in Lincolnshire and part of the RAF 's quick reaction alert team , intercepted the Bear aircraft on Friday .
Defence officials played down the incident describing it as a " picture - led story " .
They made clear it was an opportunity to show off the air defence role of the Typhoon , an expensive and long - delayed aircraft originally designed in the cold war to engage in dogfights with Soviet planes over northern Europe .
The Tupolev Bear was designed during the cold war as a long - range bomber .
First indications that Russia was flexing its muscles in this way came in May when Russian Bear aircraft flew towards British airspace during an exercise off Scotland , to spy on Royal Navy warships .
Two Tornado F3 air defence aircraft were scrambled to see the bombers off .
On three occasions last month , as the row over Russia 's refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoy , suspected of murdering exiled dissident Alexander Litvinenko , caused tit - for - tat expulsions , Tornados were scrambled to warn off Russian Bear aircraft .
British intelligence officials are concerned that President Putin 's ambitions are more serious than the mere rhetoric they initially hoped .
A defence official said Friday 's interception was " appropriate " in the context of Nato guidelines .
Offer of the Day ( 10/24/2007 ) :
Deliverance ( 1972 ) DVD
( 27 votes , average : 4.22 out of 5 ) votes , average : out of 5 )
If you havenâ€™t watched the movie Deliverance go out and buy , rent , or download it today !!
We highly recommend you do so .
Our favorite character in Deliverance was a boy named â€ œLonnyâ€ .
The Lonny character , played by actor Billy Redden , sometimes gets lost in the mix when there is a discussion about Deliverance ; with actors like Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds , it ’s understandable .
We are taking a stand and making sure that Lonny gets his recognition too , because Lonny is special ( a very “ special ” boy indeed ) .
And for God sakes , the boy can play a mean banjo !
If you foolishly decide not to watch Deliverance , which has an all - star cast by the way , then feel free to read what we have found on the internet below .
The following is just a TASTE of what youâ€™re missing .
These excerpts about Deliverance actually talk about Billy Redden :
Excerpt # 1 : “ The face that you do n’t forget when you see Deliverance belonged to a backward boy of fifteen named Billy Redden , who had the role of a retarded banjo player .
His thin - lidded eyes and simple grin are haunting on film , and they were just as disturbing to see on the set .
Billy seemed so lost .
He went around bumming cigarettes , proud of himself for smoking in public , more interested in his Marlboros than almost anything else that was going on .
And he did try to do as he was told , but some things were beyond him . ” - by Christopher Dickey
Excerpt # 2 : “ The movie opens with a sequence at a backwoods gas station , where Drew on the guitar and this boy with his banjo start out just sort of picking a few notes , then take off into a burst of bluegrass virtuosity : “ Dueling Banjos . ”
Nobody ever expected that Billy could play that piece , or any piece .
The music was all going to be dubbed .
But Billy could n’t even fake it .
He could make his right hand strum more or less convincingly , but he could n’t imitate the fretwork with his left hand at all .
In the end the scene was set up with Billy sitting on a kind of swinging bench , and another little boy hidden beneath it , whose left hand up Billy ’s sleeve was faking the fingerwork for the camera . ” - by Christopher Dickey
Excerpt # 3 : I have also seen this description of him on the Internet ; â€œson of a mountain manâ€ .
The following is further reading I found on The Internet Movie Database ( IMDb ) :
He also worked for a time giving Deliverance tours along the river where the movie was shot .
Over 30 people have died on the river since the film was made .
Redden said that he found it too risky and quit .
At the age of 16 , this boy from Rabun County , Georgia , was the only “ authentic ” local to play the role of The Banjo Boy in John Boorman ’s disturbing hit movie Deliverance ( 1972 ) .
He was hand - picked from his local elementary school , largely due to his “ look ” ( his large head , skinny body , odd - shaped eyes and moronic grin had sadly branded him a poster - child for inbreeding and mental deficiency ) .
He was discovered by director Tim Burton in 2003 working as a dishwasher - busboy at the Cookie Jar Cafe in Clayton , Georgia .
Burton wanted him for a cameo ( as the “ banjo boy “ ) in his movie Big Fish ( 2003 ) .
Quote about Billy Redden : “ He was a real nice guy , a lot nicer than Burt Reynolds . ” - Tim Burton
Where is Billy Redden Now ?
As of November 2003 - Cook and dishwasher at the Cookie Jar Cafe in Clayton , Georgia .

Is Your Printer Spying On You ?
Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it .
Sounds like something from an episode of " Alias " right ?
Unfortunately the scenario is n't fictional .
In a purported effort to identify counterfeiters the US government has succeeded in persuading some color laser printer manufacturers to encode each page with identifying information .
That means that without your knowledge or consent an act you assume is private could become public .
A communication tool you 're using in everyday life could become a tool for government surveillance .
And what 's worse there are no laws to prevent abuse .

The ACLU recently issued a report revealing that the FBI has amassed more than 1 100 pages of documents on the organization since 2001 as well as documents concerning other non-violent groups including Greenpeace and United for Peace and Justice .
In the current political climate it's not hard to imagine the government using the ability to determine who may have printed what document for purposes other than identifying counterfeiters .
Yet there are no laws to stop the Secret Service from using printer codes to secretly trace the origin of non-currency documents ; only the privacy policy of your printer manufacturer currently protects you ( if indeed such a policy exists ) .
And no law regulates what sort of documents the Secret Service or any other domestic or foreign government agency is permitted to request for identification not to mention how such a forensics tool could be developed and implemented in printers in the first place .
With no laws on the books there 's nothing to stop the privacy violations this technology enables .
For this reason EFF is gathering information about what printers are revealing and how - a necessary precursor to any legal challenge or new legislation to protect your privacy .
And we could use your help .
In the preliminary research paper linked below we explain what we 've observed so far briefly explore the privacy implications and ask you to print and send us test sheets from your color laser printer and / or a color laser printer at your local print shop .
That way we can watch the watchers and ensure that your privacy is n't compromised in ways that harm your fundamental constitutional rights .
In addition to documenting what printers are revealing EFF has filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request and we will keep you updated on what we discover .
In the meantime we urge you to participate and pass the word along about this research project .
Thank you for your support !
