If you 're reading this while your boss thinks you 're hammering away on some code or updating that Excel spreadsheet , then you 're likely one of the workers that spend about 25 percent of their work time doing personal stuff online .
And chances are that your boss does n't even know it .
Network security consultant firm Voco says that CEOs and CIOs of companies are often completely unaware of what employees are doing online during work hours , allowing them ( especially the tech - savvy ones ) to get away with all sorts of online goofing off .
Employees tend to spend work time browsing eBay auctions , using online dating or social networking sites , chatting over IM , and more , and they do it for just over a quarter of the time they spend at work .
Sometimes , employees also make use of company resources to engage in nefarious activities , like downloading movies and music over P2P .
According to Voco 's data , for example , many of the prerelease downloads of Hellboy : The Golden Army were over corporate networks .
Not only does this consume bandwidth meant for business , it also opens up corporate networks to spyware , adware , and other challenges for network security .
And , of course , it could pose a legal issue for the company in question as well .
" If investigators were tracking who was downloading , then the company address would turn up and the company would be the one facing legal implications , " Voco consultant Paul Hortop said in a statement .
At the same time , not all " personal " Internet use is necessarily bad .
Hortop points out that sometimes it can be a challenge to determine exactly what kind of use is inappropriate .
" Is it more time - efficient to let staff do their banking online than having them leave the office for half an hour ? " he asks .
Additionally , workers spending time on social networking sites could actually help the company , given their increased importance to businesses .
Of course , surfing at work is n't exactly a new phenomenon .
In a survey conducted in 2005 , 93 percent of all US employees admitted to using their employer 's Internet access for personal reasons as well as business ones , and 52 percent said they would rather give up coffee than their Internet connections at work .
How much that personal Internet use actually impacts businesses is up in the air , however .
Websense claims that such behavior costs American corporations nearly $ 200 billion per year , although given the tiny sample used when drawing that conclusion , the actual number may be quite a bit different .
Regardless of how much it 's costing companies , what 's important is to make sure you 're actually getting your work done while you 're not checking your friends ' status updates in Facebook or overbidding on an eBay auction .
Now , get back to work !

Laundry detergents and air fresheners have long promised to keep your house and clothes smelling sunshine fresh and rain shower clean .
But what they have n't said is what exactly you 're sniffing when you snuggle up in your just - washed sheets .
After hearing from people who said strong scents made them sick , University of Washington researcher Anne Steinemann scratched the surface and found almost a hundred chemicals that were n't listed on the labels .
According to her report in the journal Environmental Impact Assessment Review , plug - in air fresheners , scented sprays , dryer sheets and detergents all contained a mixture of volatile organic compounds .
Since manufacturers are n't required to list their ingredients for such consumer products , the boxes only admitted to containing a " mixture of perfume oils . "
But five out of the six products Steinemann tested emitted one or more so - called hazardous air pollutants , which are carcinogens determined to have no safe exposure level by the EPA .
While the study did not test for any human health risk from exposure to these chemicals , Steinemenn says the next time the air in the house smells stale , maybe you just open a window .

After Gabe logged off for the night , Robert - who had grown tired of my brutal golf techniques in previous rounds - entered the fray with Tiger Woods .
While tethered to the real world , Tiger Woods is an excellent golfer .
His counterpart in the videogame that bears his name is not a golfer but a kind of God , a barely coherent being of pure light that has yoked physics and cannot be beaten , except by another Tiger Woods - some other gleaming bead in that perpetual chain we call the Tigerion .
The team behind the Tiger Woods series adheres to the Navajo Rug school of game design , where each product contains some purposeful imperfection to give next year ’s iteration some semblance of appeal .
This year , graphics have been improved .
Simultaneous Stroke Play , where colored lines represent everyone ’s shots and you can burn through nine holes in as many minutes , is blessedly present .
We were able to connect to one another and play through nine entire holes without crashes .
That ’s correct : the game we purchased appears to be present , somewhere on the disc .
Golf is , in reality or in simulation , an experience which is largely defined by its shared misery .
People are certainly competing with one another , but their true enemy is the Earth itself , warped by evil men into some villainous shape .
Simultaneous Stroke Play works well , as I ’ve suggested - but they gave no thought whatsoever to people who might want to play without it .
There are times where you might want to play a more social game that shows off your character , or retains the experience of the actual sport .
In the 2009 version of the game , you ’re given completely useless views of the currently playing character , with inexplicable zoom options and no user interface to speak of .
Once a player hits , the camera shifts to a number of completely random , often nauseating , universally unhelpful views that often rarely show the ball in the context of the course so you have no idea how well they did .
If you see an opponent putt , it does n’t even render the colored lines that show the lay of the green , so the “ there but for the grace of God ” element that is so core to the game evaporates .
Entering the office after a night of solo play , Gabriel was aglow - it was deeply unsettling - but the stories he told me about the tightly integrated GamerNet experience did compel .
Essentially , on any hole , on any shot , other players can establish challenges that appear dynamically during your own game .
Or , if you ’ve done well yourself , pull the trigger and establish a challenge for others .
I used to play a Korean golfing MMO called Shot Online that dished up custom challenges while your party was playing , and vying for these added an interesting kind of side - bet element .
But for some reason when you play online in Tiger , this entire concept - one that adds so much dynamism to the experience - is completely excised .
And great play in an online match does n’t benefit your stats the way normal play would .
I understand that it ’s not okay to like the second Rainbow Six Vegas , but it uprooted this pernicious bullshit earlier this year when it allowed character progression anywhere - online , offline , adversarial , and cooperative .
You ’re rewarded for playing the game the way you want to .
There ’s no behavior that is n’t recognized .
All interactions are sanctified , which is to say that they are part of the game proper and not cordoned off into some velveteen nega - zone that renders your time inert .
It really is 2008 , now .
Online play is n’t a novelty anymore , and it has n’t been for at least a decade .

Senate passes bailout , returns it to House ECONOMY IN TURMOIL Bill passes overwhelmingly with support from Obama , McCain , Boxer , Feinstein
WASHINGTON - OCTOBER 1 : ( L - R ) Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , Sen. Max Baucus ( D - MT ) , Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid ( D - NV ) , Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) participate in a news conference as the financial rescue bill passed in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol October 1 , 2008 in Washington , DC .
The U.S. Senate passed the revised version of the financial rescue plan that failed to pass in the House of Representatives on September 29 .

In a somber and rare demonstration of bipartisan unity , the Senate voted 74 - 25 on Wednesday for a $ 700 billion rescue of the nation 's banking system - loaded with $ 150 billion in tax breaks - and sent it back to the House for a second chance on Friday .
Senators , including both presidential candidates , Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain , remained seated during the vote , a symbol of the weight they placed upon the stupendously expensive emergency bailout and the votes they cast in the face of intense public opposition just five weeks before an election .
The vote united some of the Senate 's most liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans , both in assent and dissent .
Obama and McCain both voted for the bill .
Obama , a junior senator from Illinois but now the hope of his party , spoke during the daylong debate and gave House Democrats still in opposition a strong shove .
" To Democrats and Republicans who 've opposed this plan , " Obama said , " I say step up to the plate , let 's do what 's right for the country at this time , because the time to act is now . "
McCain did not arrive in time for the debate and , when he entered the chamber , walked past Obama without acknowledging him .
Several minutes later , Obama strode to where McCain was talking with his friend Joe Lieberman , independent - Conn. , and held out his hand in greeting .
McCain gave a curt , frigid shake back and instantly looked away .
In the clubby world of the Senate , it was an unmistakable rebuff .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he would not have called for a Senate vote had he not thought the legislation would clear the House , where its spectacular failure in a tense vote Monday stunned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio and sent leaders in both chambers and the White House scrambling .
" The Senate came together tonight in bipartisan fashion , " Reid said , " and sent a clear message to America , to all Americans , that we will not let this economy fail . "
Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the vote showed the Senate " at its finest , " saying he could not recall a time this close to an election when so many " resisted the temptation to play partisan games " and instead " rose to the occasion . "
The vote reflected the conviction now shared by the nation 's top political leaders that the financial system is on the brink of a collapse that would be followed by a deep economic contraction and the loss of millions of jobs .
House approval expected
Some senators predicted that the House will approve the bill easily on Friday after the political kickstart from the upper body .
Sen . Max Baucus , D - Mont. , said the tax provisions will " clearly " aid House passage , predicting a big vote there on Friday .
The popular tax breaks had already cleared the Senate , 93 - 2 , but had been blocked in the House by conservative Democratic budget hawks who call themselves Blue Dogs .
They have protested the fact that only $ 43 billion of the tax breaks were offset by spending cuts or other tax increases .
And only half of them voted for the banking system rescue Monday , mainly on budget grounds .
The agreement was reached after a day of behind - the - scenes phone calls among Pelosi , Reid , the White House and GOP leaders .
Rep. Ellen Tauscher , a Walnut Creek Democrat who co-chairs the centrist New Democrat coalition in the House and is close to the Blue Dogs , said she believes the legislation will pass the House .
Tauscher warned that the credit crunch is " a catastrophic emergency " and said this is not the time to oppose the intervention on budget grounds .
Reid said speed is of the essence .
" Inaction is not an option we have , " he said .
Tax breaks
The added tax breaks include a one - year fix of the alternative minimum tax to shield millions of upper - middle - income taxpayers from a big tax increase ; tax breaks for wind , solar and other alternative energy projects ; and an extension of the research and development tax credit for businesses .
The energy and research tax breaks have been pushed heavily by Silicon Valley companies that see alternative energy as the next technological frontier .
A temporary increase from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in bank deposit protection by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , endorsed by both presidential candidates , also was added .
The higher FDIC limit was a key demand of House Republicans and was favored by many Democrats .
Two - thirds of House Republicans voted against the bill Monday .
Republicans said many would be assuaged by a planned relaxation by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the " mark - to - market " rule that requires companies to write down their assets to current value .
Republicans argued that the rule was forcing financial institutions to write down their capital to fire - sale prices , accelerating the credit contraction .
Some senators facing difficult re-election bids voted for the bill , such as Sens. Norm Coleman , R - Minn. , Gordon Smith , R - Ore. , and John Sununu , R- N.H. Others , including Sens. Elizabeth Dole , R - N.C. , and Mary Landrieu , D - La. , voted no .
Dissenters included a mix of the very conservative and very liberal , mirroring the unusual unity of ideological opposition on the flanks of both parties .
Panic in Europe
The action came as the banking panic spread to Europe .
The government of Ireland stepped in Tuesday to guarantee its entire banking system , including all bank deposits , securities and short - term loans , an amount equaling twice the country 's entire gross domestic product .
In relative terms , that intervention swamps the shocking size of the U.S. rescue package .
A similar guarantee in the United States would amount to a $ 24 trillion .
Several senators said major businesses in their states had warned them that a sharp contraction in bank lending even to long - time customers was pushing many of them toward failure and a threat of cascading job losses .
Pelosi's office issued newspaper clippings describing business distress .
California Sen. Barbara Boxer , a Democrat , issued a scathing indictment of the Bush administration and promised a regulatory crackdown , but said she reluctantly supported the bill , citing warnings from California Treasurer Bill Lockyer that without action , the state would be unable to sell voter - approved highway , school and water bonds .
Boxer said California also relies on short - term bank borrowing to finance its budget .
" I 've heard from people who are very worried , " said California Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , also a Democrat .
" Once the snowball begins to roll , it picks up snow , and it 's irreversible .
I 'm not going to say who , but the answer is yes . "
Feinstein has supported the bailout in the face of overwhelming public opposition in California .
She said she has received 82,500 calls and letters against the legislation and 5,000 for it .
That began to shift after the 777 - point drop in the stock market Monday when the House rejected the bailout .
" They saw the market drop , they looked at whatever they had , " Feinstein said .
Added to the bill Sweeteners tacked onto the bailout measure to attract votes from certain constituencies include : Business aid : Provide business tax breaks , including some for production of , investment in and the use of renewable fuels .
AMT protection : Increase personal credits against the alternative minimum tax , shielding more than 20 million taxpayers from the tax .
Disaster relief : Grant natural disaster victims tax relief .
Rural help : Extend through 2011 a program that funds rural schools and local governments that have low property - tax bases because they lie within or are adjacent to federal lands .
Tax deductions : Extend until the end of 2009 the deduction for state and local general sales taxes .
Tax breaks : Extend until end of 2009 individual tax breaks , including deductions for higher education costs and teachers ' personal expenses .
Bank insurance : Increase , from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 , the limit on federal bank deposit insurance .

These images of a new HTC handset from Nedge2 k reveal a surprising addition to the Taiwanese company 's line : a half Touch HD , half Touch Diamond handset for which WiMax — of all things — is the most salient feature .
Such a product might not make sense in most places , but Russia already has more than 20 million people soaking in their WiMax networks and other compatible phones in the pipeline .

You can see from the screens that the connection speed is over 13 Mbps , and the front camera indicates ( predictable ) 3G capabilities to complement just about every other type of connection a phone could have .
With the relative newness of America 's WiMax infrastructure it 's unlikely that we 'll see this phone here , but it would be an awfully good way to atone for depriving us of our Touch HD .

Rock Band 2 : you should already own it
Rock Band 2
Developer : Harmonix
Publisher : MTV / EA
Platform : Xbox 360
Price : $ 59.99 ( Shop. Ars )
Rating : Teen
Hundreds of gamers went to their local electronics stores Sunday to pick up their copy of Rock Band 2 and , I hope , invited a bunch of their friends over when they got the game home .
Many will most likely play the game all day , and maybe all night , and more than a few will initially be disappointed .
But for those who come to Rock Band 2 not for a completely new experience , but for one that 's been honed to perfection , there 's a lot to love about this sequel .
It may look and feel familiar , but Rock Band 2 is a worthwhile improvement on the original .
We 've spent the past five days living and breathing Rock Band 2 , and the numerous fixes and tweaks emerge slowly , over time .
The game looks , and plays , much like Rock Band 1 : the notes start at the top and move to the bottom ; you activate Overdrive to get the multiplier up ; you fight over who gets guitar and who gets bass .
But as we played we began to notice that all the things that drove us crazy about the original game are gone , replaced by things that are much better .
There is nothing reinvented in Rock Band 2 , but everything that was already there has simply been perfected .
We 're going to spend the next few pages digging into the new hardware that comes with the game , and give you our recommendations about what you should upgrade and what instruments you 're safe ignoring ; this is going to be a guide as much as a review .
And as far as the review part goes , I 'm going to cut my own throat and kill the suspense : you need to buy this game .
The song list is top - notch , and since you can grab the game alone if you already have good instruments , you 're paying less than a dollar each for the new songs .
Take a gander at the set list , and tell me you 're not interested in at least a dozen or so of those songs .
Plus , $ 5 gets you your Rock Band 1 songs in the game ( with the exception of Black Sabbath 's " Paranoid , " Metallica 's " Enter Sandman , " and the cover of Iron Maiden 's " Run to the Hills " ) , and your downloaded content will be waiting for you the second you put the disc in the system .
So Rock Band 2 boasts an intimidating amount of content from day one .
With new instruments and a bunch of fixes , Rock Band 2 is the perfect venue for a band reunion .
But this is n't just about the songs .
There was clearly as much work put into the game itself as there was into the new instruments and tracks .
We 'll get into what has been fixed , and give you a better idea of how to create your own best possible hardware configuration .
Of course , I wo n't be upset if you run out , grab the game , and then come back and read .
If you 're still with me , though , let 's talk about that new guitar ...

The mutilated body of a 17 - year - old British girl has been found in a suitcase by police in Brazil .
The grim discovery was made after a suitcase was found dumped in a river in Goiânia , a city about 120 miles south west of Brazilian capital Brasilia .
Inside was the torso of student Cara Marie Burke .
Police identified her from two tattoos on her body .
Police have arrested Cara 's Brazilian boyfriend , Mohamed Ali Carvalho dos Santos , aged 20 .
According to initial reports on Brazilian news website Bol Ali told police he turned the volume of his stereo up to drown out her screams , before murdering her last Saturday night .
He then hid her body in the bathroom of his apartment and left it there while he went out to a party .
The following day he chopped her body up , took photographs of her mutilated remains with his mobile phone , packed her torso into a suitcase and threw it into one river , then drove about 30 miles to dispose of her head and other body parts in another river .
Police divers have not yet recovered those remains .
Officers arrested Ali in the early hours of this morning and say he confessed he ’d killed her because she threatened to tell his parents and the cops about his drug dealing and cocaine addiction .
Ali has been charged with murder .
A knife , believed to have been the murder weapon , was found concealed in a drain , near to Ali 's apartment , according to Brazilian website ultimosegundo .
Police commander Cláudio de Oliveira is quoted as saying : " There are no words to describe a person like this .
He is unprovided for by God and whatever it means to be human . "
He added that the murder was committed at about 5 pm on Saturday and on the Sunday decided that in order to move the body it needed to be chopped up .
The suitcase was found on Monday and after an appeal for information based on the tattoos on Cara 's corpse , Ali was arrested on Thursday .
The chief of police in Goias , Jose Maria da Silva , said : " He confessed ( to ) the crime .
He did not show any regret . "
Reports on ultimosegundo said Ali met Cara in London and she had been in Brazil for about three months .
The victim's mother and brother live in London and have been informed .
Her brother Michael , 32 , said his family had not decided whether or not to travel to Brazil , and that all they wanted was for police to find the rest of her body so she could be brought home to them .
There 's an interesting meme that was picked up by Duncan Riley over at the Inquisitr earlier this evening with regard to the effect of FriendFeed on traditional blogging .
It 's an interesting meme and something I 've been spending a not insignificant amount of time thinking about myself .
I 'm in the midst of writing a long series of long posts for my personal blog on journalism with relationship to New Media , and I 'm currently working on the subject of micro- blogging , and its role in the new and evolving ecosystem of for - profit online journalism .
That 's why I 've paid special attention to blog posts like the one Hematopoiesis put out this evening that say stuff like " FriendFeed is killing blogging . "
Duncan Riley disagreed that what Hematopoiesis argued was the case .
I can see merits to both sides , and if you widen up the lens you look at the question with , you can see definite merit in both sides , plus some very interesting context .
Low - Impact Blogging ?
What 's that ?
A few days ago , I wrote a fairly controversial article called 4 Questions for Early Adopters .
In the piece , I suggested a method for selling fringe concepts like " status microblogging " services Twitter and FriendFeed as something I termed " low - impact blogging . "
That term is sort of the basis on how I see these services evolving into the mainstream .
It certainly is n't the only very clear path to mainstream , as Plaxo 's union with Comcast and all the cross-overs that entails with physical objects that the cable company is putting in people 's homes certainly qualifies for mainstream lifestreaming .
But from an Internet user 's perspective , there is very little else that is universally familiar like the concept of blogging , thanks to social networks like MySpace , Bebo and Facebook giving everyone a blogging platform with their socnet account .
Going back to the term , though , I see most of the folks who 've taken up Twitter , FriendFeed , and other similar services drasticly decrease posting volume , but not to the expense of their substantive editorial or news based posts , it seems .
A lot of the personal updates , questions to incite discussion and the observational posts shorten themselves and end up on the lifestream .
Certainly , to some , this can be seen as " killing blogging , " as for many of us ( myself included ) , personal diaries and journals were how we got started in blogging .
If that 's all you blog about , you could very easily see these services as something that will completely eclipse the medium .
FriendFeed , Drop.io , Twitter and Utterz as Meta - Platforms Something I 've done with my personal website is to not just embed various lifestreaming and micro-blogging widgets on the site , but make a valiant effort to actually incorporate the output of these sites as part of the featured content .
Each item not only features the original content ( or an inline frame referencing the original content ) , but the subsequent discussion about the content , making it actual inline ( and monetizable ) content for my site .
Each discussion has a form at the bottom allowing site visitors ( who have FriendFeed accounts ) to participate in the discussion as they would on a blog post .
Even more promising is usage and implementation on the sites Utterz and Drop.io .
Utterz is technically in the same space as FriendFeed and Twitter , though they 've been around much longer ( in fact , up until about April of this year , most traffic monitoring sources like Alexa and Compete ranked them very close to FriendFeed ) .
Instead of going the route of siphoning off conversation from the blogosphere , their strategy was to inject it back in .
Utterz and Drop.io add an extra twist ...
With Utterz , you have the ability to post video , audio or text , and all posts are accompanied by an option to cross post it back to your blogging or distribution platform of choice .
Utterz has a plethora of mobile posting options and an open API that functions almost identically to the Twitter and FriendFeed API ( which is sure to lead to the inclusion of the service in tools like Twhirl or other microblogging stand - alone apps ) , and has the potential to completely eliminate the need to ever hit your blog or podcast interface .
It 's an interesting spin and convergence of micro- blogging , chat , blogging and podcasting .
Drop.io , I learned today , is also evolving in its usage , to a similar utility .
It is n't tied into blogging platforms or syphoning off discussion from existing blogs like FriendFeed , but creating a new way to seamlessly build media .
FriendFeed user Nathan Rein described today the way he 's using it to effortlessly generate podcasts and teaching materials for his students :
Trying drop.io as an informal teaching journal .
Set up a drop , and after each class , quickly phone - in notes and it becomes a podcast .
This is even less fuss [ than creating podcasts with Utterz ] , and it 's a little more " private " in a way .
At the moment I am ( unless I 'm mistaken ) the only person listening to my " dropcast , " and since it basically consists of notes for my own use that I want to keep in the cloud , no one else is likely to be interested in it .
Thus a storage paradigm makes more sense than a blogging paradigm in this case .
Web 2.0 Apps are the New Distribution Tools Ultimately , most of this new media not being funneled into blogging is going to end up in the same places , but the means to create , distribute , and garner discussion on the media will be done with tools that better suit the process .
FriendFeed is superb at creating spur - of - the - moment discussions from a wide cross-section of folks on interesting ideas , blog posts , and bookmarked news items .
Twitter , from a content producer 's perspective , is a great research tool , and an even better way to market your media to folks who really care .
Utterz is an excellent central meta-distribution platform .
Drop.io , like Utterz , is also good at giving producers on the go a way to effortlessly build their media for slightly different applications .
In the end , most of this stuff can and will end up on the websites we 've built originally to showcase our blog content , and the majority of it all ends up in an RSS feed at multiple points along the way .
In short , micro- blogging is n't killing traditional blogging , it 's evolving it .

I am stealing a quote ( about Palin ) from RenoAnne , Americablog , " She should really just focus on her strengths and lay down on the stage with her legs in the air . "
Sexist , YES , Funny YES !

I am all for Palin staying on the ticket .
It will remind us about McCain 's inability to make intelligent decisions .
Go Sarah !
But I do love the quote about B.S. it is spot on !

Obama should have made sure her name came up when McCain started in on his lack of experiance during the debate .
He could have done it by omission .
I can't imagine his reasons for letting it go by .

Palin was put on the ticket to energize and mobilize the far right evangelical base , which McCain could not .
She is doing just that .
They are pumped .
They do not care in the least what she says or how badly .
You can't win the majority of voters by going to the far far right with the VP pick , but with this revitalized base you can get close enough .
Purged voter rolls , missing voting machines , and exit polls that no longer work [ with electronic voting systems ] will make up the difference and then some --- like in 2004 .
The Palin pick was a clear indication of their strategy --- unless stopped , the fix is in .

Sarah , you really should have stayed in school and gone for a higher degree .
You do n't know enough to do this job properly .
Take some geography , history , political science , philosophy , logic , public speaking courses - get an M.A. at least - maybe a Ph.D. - in a field that has something to do with running a government .
Go home , raise the kids , and try later when all this has been forgotten .

McSame chose Palin for only two reasons --- to get the vote of the Hillary supporters and to energize the anti-choice ultraconservative base .
He did n't take the time to properly evaluate her knowledge .
Ordinarily the vice - presidential pick is n't that critical , but McSame is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer .
Palin is truly a heartbeat away from the presidency .

A power - sharing government must be formed in Zimbabwe over the next few days to avoid a humanitarian crisis in the south African nation , its new prime minister designate said Saturday .
Zimbabwe 's farming , mining and other industries have come to a near standstill as the country 's economy continues to crumble , Morgan Tsvangirai told reporters in Harare .
An estimated 5.5 million people will require food aid in the coming months as a result , said Tsvangirai , who is leader of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change .
" I 've had the opportunity to meet with food security experts , the food manufacturing companies and farmers to ascertain the qualities of food available , " he said .
" I 'm sad to report that my preliminary findings in this exercise show a state of emergency , with disastrous consequences if we take too long to attend to this crisis . "
Tsvangirai said the only way to resolve the problem was for Zimbabwe 's leaders to form the new government .
Uncertainty over when that will happen , he said , is causing unnecessary agony and anxiety .
" It is therefore imperative that a government be formed in the next few days and begins to implement plans to ensure that our people have food and do not die of starvation , " Tsvangirai said .
" The inclusive government will have to unequivocally make an urgent request for food assistance in order to see us through this period . "
Squabbling over cabinet posts
The formation of a unity government has stalled as Tsvangirai and President Robert Mugabe continue to disagree over how to divide cabinet posts .
The two recently agreed to a power - sharing deal that allowed Mugabe to maintain his post as leader of the country , with Tsvangirai acting as his deputy .
Signed earlier this month , the power - sharing deal allows for 31 ministers — down from 50 — 15 nominated by Mugabe 's party , 13 by Tsvangirai and three by a breakaway MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara .
Food and manufacturing industries are working at 10 per cent of their capacity , Tsvangirai said Saturday , while mining was working at just five per cent of its capacity .
Formerly the breadbasket of Africa , Zimbabwe is currently facing a shortage of fertilizer needed to produce enough grain to last it until April .
Aid agencies are currently helping feed about 4 million people , or one - third of the population , in Zimbabwe , Tsvangirai said .
Power - sharing deal
While Tsvangirai's MDC party won legislative elections held in March , the party did not win by a wide enough margin to take power .
The MDC withdrew from the widely denounced run-off vote held in June , citing intimidation and violence against its supporters .
The recent power - sharing deal marked the first time Mugabe , a former anti-colonial leader who has been in control since 1980 , has been willing to surrender some of his authority .
Mugabe , 84 , is currently out of the country after attending a United Nations summit in New York last week .
He called on the West to lift sanctions against his country in a speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday , accusing them of genocide .
" The widespread belief that the gender pay gap is a reflection of deep rooted discrimination by employers is ill - informed and an unhelpful contribution to the debate .
The pay gap is falling but is also a reflection of individuals ' lifestyle preferences .
Government can't regulate or legislate these away - and should n't try to , " said the report .
House Bill 2525 will be taken up today and tomorrow , supported by more than 100 humane and fair - minded representatives of the 203 total in the House , along with Gov. Rendell .
It is opposed by a gaggle of heartless maggots who lick the hands of callous pet- profiteers : the commercial kennel breeders who have turned our state into the Puppy Mill Capital of the East .
To breeders , innocent puppies are just a cash crop , like peas , carrots or potatoes .
Westmoreland County Democrat James Casorio is the primary sponsor of HB 2525 .
" If folks would know - and they 're beginning to know - the conditions these poor dogs are subjected to on a day - to - day basis , they would be sick to their stomach , " he says .
Cortana now helps you during the installation process .
Over the past decades , installing Windows has changed greatly and the process has morphed from hand - holding the system to simply asking an AI for help .
The install process has now become an automatic one , as you do n’t have to use the keyboard anymore for the manually guided steps that you were used to .
The Verge observed the fact that the Windows 10 Creators Update brings the coolest novelty : Microsoft ’s Cortana assistant is now being a part of the whole setup process .
The new machines that ship with Windows 10 Creators Update preinstalled will enjoy having Cortana greeting users at the beginning of the setup process .
Forget about the typing , as you can now verbally tell Microsoft ’s digital assistant to connect to your WiFi network , to choose the keyboard options and sign in to your Microsoft Account .
If you have a more complex configuration you ’ll be quite limited , of course , and you can skip talking to an AI helper , if you ’re the kind of user that prefers taking the matter into his own hands .
Anyway , this is a huge step toward simplifying the use of computers and such a feature is going to make them seem less complicated and less intimidating for beginners .
The more advanced users will also benefit from this new experience .
At some point you ’re still going to take the hands - on approach , but through most of the installation process , you ’re going to be able to walk around the room , while accomplishing the install at the same time .
If you clean install Windows 10 Creators Update , or if you setup a new PC , this could turn out to be a surprising experience .
Considering the fact that setting up Windows used to be a nasty chore , it ’s great to see Microsoft trying its best to make this process easier for the less advanced users .
The biggest problem with porting CCL to the x8632 architecture is that the architecture has so few registers .
I need to talk a little bit about how CCL ’s GC works in order to explain why the small number of registers is a problem .
CCL is designed to use pre-emptively scheduled OS threads .
This means that a context switch can happen at any instruction boundary .
Since other threads might allocate memory , this means that a GC can happen between any two instructions , too .
( The following summarizes information found in the Implementation Details of Clozure CL chapter of the CCL manual . )
The GC in CCL is precise .
That is , it believes that it can always tell whether a register or a stack location contains a lisp value or just raw bits .
In order it to enable it to do this , we have to adopt and follow strict conventions on register and stack usage .
What we do is to partition the machine registers into two sets : one that will always contain raw , unboxed values ( “ immediates ” ) , and another that will always contain tagged lisp objects ( “ nodes ” ) .
This works fine on architectures that have a reasonable number of registers .
On x8632 , we ’re so register - starved that it ’s impossible to get by with a static partitioning of registers .
We therefore keep a bit mask in thread - local memory that indicates whether a given register is a node or an immediate , and have the GC consult these bits when it runs .
This allows us to switch the class of a register at run time .
The default register partitioning looks like this :
We have a single “ immediate ” register .
EAX is given the symbolic name %imm0 .
There are two “ dedicated ” registers .
ESP and EBP have dedicated functionality dictated by the hardware and calling conventions .
The remaining 5 registers are “ node ” registers ( % temp0 , % temp1 , %arg_y , %arg_z , and % fn ) .
We do n’t use the x86 string instructions which implicitly use ESI and EDI .
Most of the time , all we need to do is to steal a node register and mark it as an immediate for a couple of instructions .
Typically this is because we need to index some foreign pointer , or use MUL or DIV to produce extended - precision results .
Here ’s an example of a case where we have to do this .
( defx8632 lapfunction %% get - unsigned - longlong ( ( ptr arg_y ) ( offset arg_z ) ) ( trap- unless - typecode= ptr x8632::subtag- macptr ) ( mark - as - imm temp0 ) ( let ( ( imm1 temp0 ) ) ( macptr - ptr ptr im m1 ) ( unbox - fixnum offset imm0 ) ( movq ( @ ( % im m1 ) ( % imm0 ) ) ( % mm0 ) ) ) ( mark - as - node temp0 ) ( jmp-subprim . SPmakeu64 ) )
The mark - as - imm macro expands to something like this :
( andb ( $ bit - for - temp0 ) ( @ ( % :rcontext ) x8632::tcr.node-regs-mask ) )
Here , : rcontext is the register that points to a block of thread - local storage ( the thread context record ) .
On x8632 , it ’s an otherwise useless segment register , typically % fs .
( We ’d be in real trouble if we had to dedicate a GPR to point to thread - local storage on x8632 . )
In simple cases like this , there ’s actually another alternative .
We do n’t use the x86 string instructions , so the direction flag in EFLAGS is otherwise unused .
So , what we do is to say that if DF is set , then %edx is an immediate register .
So , if we used temp1 ( aka EDX ) instead of temp0 ( aka ECX ) in the example above , we could actually replace the mark - as - imm / mark - as - node with the ( presumably cheaper ) std/cld instruction pair .
In fact , I should probably make that change …
Anyway , many ’s the time I wished for just two more registers .
I thought about sending a bug report to Intel , but I did n’t figure that I ’d get a response .
Turns out Cracked writers do n't spend all of their time huddled in a dungeon Googling dick joke fodder .
In fact , some of them have secondary talents , far less important to the world than their contributions to our humble Dick - joke - pedia , but worthy of recognition nonetheless .

Volunteers have claimed to have found the largest prime number yet — twice within a fortnight !
The two new record breakers are both Mersenne primes : numbers which can be written in the form 2 p - 1 , where p is also prime .
Every whole number can be written as a product of prime numbers in a unique way , and this is why the primes are regarded as the building blocks of number theory .
Mathematicians have known since antiquity that there are infinitely many primes , but there is n't a formula which describes them all .
To check if a number is prime , you have to go through painstaking algorithms that take up a huge amount of computing power .
The task becomes easier when the number you 're checking for primeness is a Mersenne number of the form described above .
But still , one computer is n't enough to do the job : the eleven previous largest prime discoverers have all been part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search ( GIMPS ) , which uses the computing power " donated " by tens of thousands of volunteers to chomp through the necessary calculations .
The previous record prime — found in September 2006 — would have taken an ordinary PC 4000 years to find , but with the help of a 70,000 strong computer network , able to perform 22 trillion calculations per second , popped out in " only " nine months .
Why would anyone want to find the largest prime to date ?
For the fun of it , of course , in true nerdy - style , but there 's the added bonus of a $ 50,000 prize for the first to discover a prime with 10 million digits .
On a less frivolous level , primes are extremely useful in cryptography : because factorising large numbers into their prime factors is so computationally expensive , these factors can , and do , serve as almost unbreakable keys to encrypted messages — like the ones we send over the Internet every time we use our credit cards or send encrypted emails .
Experts are now performing independent checks to verify that the two new numbers really are prime , and are due to report back soon .

Right To Play , a charity championed by many of Canada 's top Olympians , is being frozen out of the athletes village at the Vancouver Winter Games for the first time since it began in 1992 .
Right To Play will not be an official partner with the Vancouver Organizing Committee ( VANOC ) at the 2010 Games because it has sponsors that conflict with those of VANOC .
The Toronto - based international humanitarian organization has Wayne Gretzky , Silken Laumann , Adam van Koeverden , Simon Whitfield , Jose Calderon of the Raptors and Gregg Zaun of the Blue Jays among its Canadian ambassadors .
Right To Play , formerly Olympic Aid , has set up a booth in the village at the last three Games to inform athletes about their programs , which are delivered in more than 20 countries affected by war , poverty and disease throughout Africa , Asia and the Middle East .
Moguls skier Deidra Dionne , a 2002 Olympic bronze medalist and Right To Play ambassador , said she was " saddened " by the news .
" It 's unfortunate but not entirely surprising that Right To Play , a not for profit organization designed to spread the Olympic ideals , is a victim of the modern day sport culture that centres around sponsorship dollars and partnerships , " said Dionne , in an email response .
Boston Bruins defenceman Andrew Ference , who made a trip to Tanzania for Right To Play , felt any blame lay with VANOC 's sponsors .
" It 's hard to be frustrated with VANOC when it 's their big corporate sponsors doing the shot calling , " said Ference .
" When you have these huge corporations putting in all this money , some demands are going to be reasonable , some are not reasonable . "
But Andrea Shaw , VANOC 's VP of marketing , said it was their decision to not allow Right To Play into the athletes village .
She said it was based on contractual obligations to give their sponsors exclusivity .
Shaw said VANOC has great admiration for Right To Play , but they could not make any exceptions , even considering the group 's charitable status and that they go into the village without bearing any sponsor logos .
" Because Right To Play has competitors with our sponsor family , that would obviously ... ( go ) right against the grain of our obligations and integrity of our sponsor relationships , " Shaw said .
One of the main sponsor conflicts between Right To Play and VANOC in Canada is in the automotive sector .
VANOC has a $ 67 million deal with General Motors Canada , while Right To Play recently got a $ 480,000 donation from Mitsubishi Motors Canada .
Stu Low , director of communications for GM Canada , said it was clearly explained to Right To Play they could n't be in the village if they took the Mitsubishi sponsorship .
" As much as they 're still a registered charity , they 've gone beyond that to a more mature organization and they 're acting on behalf of Mitsubishi , because you see it all over the website and things like that .
That 's where the conflict comes from , " said Low .
Low said he believes all the Olympic sponsors would back VANOC 's decision , because " they really do n't want guerilla marketing going on . "
Terry Pursell , VP of global business development and communications for Right To Play , said there were no bad feelings towards VANOC .
" The bottom line is we 'll still be in Vancouver , " said Pursell .
" We 're just trying to figure out how to be more creative . "
Right To Play came to prominence at the 2006 Turin Olympics when speed skaters Clara Hughes of Canada and Joey Cheek of the U.S. both made significant donations to the charity after winning gold medals .
Cheek became aware of Right To Play 's existence through the booth in the village .

At a rally in Asheville , NC today , Barack Obama will hammer John McCain for trying to turn the page on the economic crisis by distracting voters with Swiftboat style attacks against him .
Obama will say , “ And on Friday , we learned that we ’d lost another 159,000 American jobs in September .
It was the ninth straight month of job losses – more than three quarters of a million this year , including 24,000 here in North Carolina .
And it came just as we finished a week in which our financial markets teetered on the brink of disaster .
Yet instead of addressing these crises , Senator McCain ’s campaign has announced that they plan to turn the page on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swiftboat - style attacks on me . ”
Obama hits McCain hard on his turn the page comment , “ Think about that for a second .
Turn the page on the economy ?
We ’re facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , and John McCain wants us to “ turn the page ? ”
Well , I know the policies he ’s supported these past eight years and wants to continue are pretty hard to defend .
I can understand why Senator McCain would want to “ turn the page ” and ignore this economy . ”

Obama says that McCain and his operatives would rather distract the country with smears , than talk about substance , “ Senator McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance .
They ’d rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up .
It ’s what you do when you ’re out of touch , out of ideas , and running out of time .
He continues , “ I want you to know that I ’m going to keep on talking about the issues that matter – about the economy and health care and education and energy .
I ’m going to keep on standing up for hard working families .
We ’re not going to let John McCain distract us from what we need to do to move this country forward . ”
Obama is correct , and he is also getting more bold .
Like any great politician , he smells blood in the water , and he is going in for the kill .
He is going to keep pummeling McCain on the economy every day until November 4 .
McCain is not going to win this election with personal attacks .
It is like he and his advisors do n’t understand that 2008 is not a Republican year .
They are not going to win this election by running same campaign that worked in 2000 and 2004 .
Republicans do n’t have a legacy of scandal to run against as they did in 2000 , and they do n’t have the most important issues on their side as they did in 2004 .
The McCain camp does n’t get it .
This election is being contested on the economy .
If they want to win this election , they have to come up with an alternative economic plan that goes beyond generic conservative platitudes about tax cuts , spending , and entitlements .
People want to know what the candidates are going to do about jobs , prices , home foreclosures , and the financial crisis .
These are questions that ca n’t be answered by promising a tax cut .
George W. Bush already did that .
So far , only Obama is talking about the issues that matter most to voters .
Running a character campaign , when voters want to hear about the issues is a path to certain defeat , and this the road that John McCain is speeding down , oblivious to the warning signs all around him .

GOP senator lobs false atheism smears in desperate attempt to hold seat Nick Juliano
Published : Friday October 31 , 2008
Print This Email This Dole ad fakes opponent saying ' there is no God ' North Carolina 's Senate campaign is getting ugly , with Republican Sen. Elizabeth
Dole falsely accusing her opponent , a Sunday school teacher , of being an atheist .
Democratic candidate Kay Hagan , who holds a slight lead over Dole , scolded the incumbent Senator for " bearing false witness " with the " offensive " attacks .
Hagen also intends to sue Dole , alleging the senator 's attacks are false and defamatory .
At issue is a television ad Dole began running this week , highlighting Hagen 's apperance at a fundraiser that also was attended by members of the Godless Americans PAC .
The fundraiser in Boston was hosted by Sen. John Kerry for Democratic senate candidates .
It occurred at the home of a supporter who also was involved in the PAC , which seeks to remove references to God from government documents .
The ad's narrator says , " She ... took godless money .
What did she promise in return ? "
It then plays a Hagen impersonator saying , " There is no God . "
The implication that Hagen spoke those words sets Dole 's ad apart from most typical campaign season attacks , observers say , according to the McClatchy Newspapers .
" When you 're making ads that say , ' There is no God , ' it usually means your campaign does n't have a prayer ,  said Alex Castellanos , a GOP consultant speaking Thursday on CNN .
He 's familiar with controversial ads  he created former Sen. Jesse Helms ' infamous " white hands " ad suggesting opponent Harvey Gantt supported racial quotas that would take away jobs from white people .
Ed Rollins , a longtime GOP political adviser , told CNN : " They did something desperate , which is so despicable and so un-like Elizabeth Dole that she should be ashamed of herself . "
Dole , wife of the GOP 's 1996 presidential nominee Bob Dole , was elected to her first term in the Senate in 2002 .
Her seat has been among Democrats ' prime targets as they seek 60 Senate seats .
Five of six polls conducted in the last week show Hagen with a lead of between two and six percent .
The most recent poll , from Rasmussen shows her leading with 52 percent of the vote to Dole 's 46 percent .
The ads seem unlikely to be effective , and they caused the Raleigh News & Observer to condemn Dole in an editorial .
" This ad is the most telling sign yet of just how stressed Dole is , but it may well leave a permanent stain on a long government career , " the paper concludes .
" Appearing to question someone 's faith , particularly when the question clearly is n't applicable in Hagan 's case , is beneath a person of Elizabeth Dole 's stature and reputation . "

If you had to sum up the past 40 years of research on the mind , you could do worse than to call it the Rise of the Zombies .
We like to see ourselves as being completely conscious of our thought processes , of how we feel , of the decisions we make and our reasons for making them .
When we act , it is our conscious selves doing the acting .
But starting in the late 1960s , psychologists and neurologists began to find evidence that our self - aware part is not always in charge .
Researchers discovered that we are deeply influenced by perceptions , thoughts , feelings , and desires about which we have no awareness .
Their research raised the disturbing possibility that much of what we think and do is thought and done by an unconscious part of the brain — an inner zombie .
Some of the earliest evidence for this zombie came from studies of people who had suffered brain injuries .
In 1970 British psychologists Elizabeth Warrington and Lawrence Weiskrantz showed a series of words to a group of people with amnesia , who promptly forgot the list .
A few minutes later Warrington and Weiskrantz showed them the first three letters of each of the words they had just seen and forgotten and asked the amnesiacs to add some additional letters to make a word .
Any word would do .
The amnesiacs consistently chose the words they had seen and forgotten ; the inner zombie , somewhere beyond awareness , retained memories of the words .
Our inner zombies may also be able to control our bodies .
In 1988 a woman known as “ patient D. F. ” suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and lost the ability to recognize objects and shapes .
Her eyes were still relaying information to her brain , but the connections between regions of her brain had been damaged so that she was no longer aware of what was before her .
Scientists at the University of Western Ontario set a card on a table in front of D. F. and then held up a disk with a slot in it .
They asked D. F. to hold the card at the same angle as the slot .
She could n’t .
But when asked to put the card in the slot as if she were mailing a letter , she immediately — and unknowingly — turned the card to the correct angle and slipped it in .
These days a number of powerful new tools can scrutinize the inner zombies in healthy brains .
Earlier this year , a team of University of Copenhagen researchers reported rendering 11 healthy people temporarily blind by focusing a beam of magnetism at the back of the subjects ’ heads .
This interfered with the activity of neurons in a region called the visual cortex .
For a few minutes the neurons were deactivated , and the subjects reported that they could n’t see anything .
At the start of the experiment , the subjects — who could see at this point — sat in front of three lights , each with a button below it .
When the center light went on , they had to reach out their hand and press the button next to it .
In some trials , the scientists switched off the center light just as the subjects began reaching , and turned on a different one .
The subjects therefore had to shift their hand movement to press the correct button .
Less than a tenth of a second after the light switched , though , the scientists zapped the subjects , instantly blinding them .
With so little time between the switch of lights and the zap , the subjects still thought the center light was on .
Yet a significant number of them moved their hand away from the center button and shifted it to the correct one .
Their inner zombie did n’t need any awareness in order to perceive the change and alter the command it sent to the hand .
In the Danish experiment , the subjects were at least aware of their goal , even if they did n’t know how they were achieving it .
Other experiments show that our unconscious mind can fully act like a conscious self .
Take a recent experiment in which French and English scientists had volunteers play a simple game while undergoing a brain scan .
The subjects held a handgrip while watching a computer screen .
They were told to squeeze the handgrip whenever they saw a picture of money on the screen .
The more they squeezed , the more money they would win .
Some pictures stayed on the screen long enough to be identified .
Others raced by .
Regardless , the image of a British pound caused the volunteers to squeeze harder than they did at the sight of a penny , even when it appeared so quickly that they were not consciously aware of what kind of money they were seeing .
The brain scans allowed the researchers to compare unconscious with conscious responses and showed that a reward - judging region of the brain , the ventral palladium , became active in both cases .
Mounting evidence of our inner zombie at work has led some scientists to downplay the importance of our aware selves .
Earlier this year in Time magazine , Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker declared that “ the intuitive feeling we have that there ’s an executive ‘ I ’ that sits in a control room of our brain , scanning the screens of the senses and pushing the buttons of the muscles , is an illusion . ”
But do n’t give up on consciousness just yet .
A small but growing number of re­searchers are challenging some of the more ex­treme arguments supporting the primacy of the inner zombie .
“ Although these studies are fas­cinating and important , ” writes Matthew Lieberman , a social psychologist at UCLA , “ they ultimately fall short of supporting the assumptions that are seeping into our collective understanding of the mind . ”
While our inner zombies may be able to do some information processing , there are other kinds of processing that they cannot do .
Studies have shown that people can unconsciously prime their minds to perform better on memory tests , essentially training for a test without explicitly being aware of it .
To explore the limits of such priming , University of Kentucky psychologist Nathan DeWall and his colleagues recently conducted a study to see if consciousness is important in completing logic puzzles .
One group of volunteers first arranged words having to do with logic and reasoning into sentences ; another group arranged neutral words into sentences .
Then the scientists had the volunteers complete fragments of words .
The fragments could be completed with a logic - related word or one not related to logic .
( For example , correct answers for L_G_ _ included LOGIC and LIGHT . )
Finally , DeWall tested the subjects on actual logic puzzles .
Although the volunteers who had been primed with logic words tended to choose logic - related terms in the word - completion task , priming did n’t help them with the puzzles .
The zombies failed .
On the other hand , explicitly instructing people to think about logic - related ideas , tapping into their conscious mind , did make them perform better on logic tests .
Brain scans also provide ammunition to beat back the zombies .
If our inner zombie really is in charge , then we would expect to see some distinct patterns of brain activity when we performed a task .
If we did something unconsciously , only the “ zombie network ” of regions would be detected .
If we did the same thing consciously , the zombie network would light up , but this time along with the few other regions of the brain that give us a feeling of awareness .
Lieberman and his colleagues have been running experiments whose results do n’t fit those zombie brain patterns .
To map conscious and unconscious processing of information , Lieberman used a classic psychology experiment in which subjects learn arbitrary rules about stringing letters together , known as an artificial grammar .
People can learn these rules consciously ( by being told , for example , that v always follows t ) .
They can also learn artificial grammar unconsciously by looking at a lot of “ words ” that follow the rules .
Later , when psychologists show them strings of letters , they can tell the researchers whether or not they are valid , without being able to say what the rules are .
Lieberman showed his subjects an artificial grammar that incorporated two types of rules , one that could be learned consciously and another that tended to be picked up only unconsciously .
Then , as he scanned their brains , the subjects were shown another set of letter strings and had to judge whether their grammar was valid .
One region of the brain became active when the subjects identified conscious rules , while a different region became active for the unconscious rules .
The two regions followed an inverse relationship :
When one was more active , the other was less so .
The conscious brain took its own , distinctive path .
Lieberman got similar results when he showed a group of subjects pictures of other people ’s faces while the researchers scanned their brains .
In some trials Lieberman had his subjects choose two words to describe each face ’s expression , forcing them to consciously reflect on the emotions they saw .
In other trials , subjects chose a name for each face , but no attention was drawn to its emotion .
The brain activity in the two groups was strikingly different .
When people merely chose a name for an angry face , the amygdala region of the brain became very active .
The amygdala plays a central role in how we respond unconsciously to emotional situations .
Among the volunteers who used words to describe the faces — consciously reflecting on the emotions they saw — the amygdalas remained quiet .
But an entirely different region , called the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex , became active .
This area is energetic during reflection , reasoning , and self - control .
The inner zombies of the subjects who focused consciously on the faces ’ emotions were silenced .
Such studies do n’t mean that our inner zombie does n’t exist .
A number of networks in our brain process information without troubling our awareness .
But we should n’t be so captivated by this insight that we think of our conscious self as nothing but a passive moviegoer in the theater of the mind .
It may be that our conscious and unconscious minds are parallel systems , each specialized for handling different kinds of tasks .
Perhaps our inner zombies play the same role as the address books on our computers .
We can memorize people ’s addresses and phone numbers , but it takes effort , and we ’re prone to recall them incorrectly or forget them .
Computers store them automatically , leaving us free to spend our time thinking about more interesting things .
The zombie mind may take over simple , repetitive tasks from our conscious mind , leaving the latter free to focus on the kinds of thought we do best with self - awareness .
As Lieberman says , “ The zombielike processes may be taken offline when more reflective processes are brought online . ”
So we may have a mind that is capable of free will and awareness after all — it just needs a little help from its friendly neighborhood zombie .
Senior CIA officers could be put on trial in Britain after it emerged last night that the Attorney General is to investigate allegations that a British resident held in Guantanamo Bay was brutally tortured , after being arrested and questioned by American forces following the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 .
The Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has asked Baroness Scotland to consider bringing criminal proceedings against Americans allegedly responsible for the rendition and abuse of Binyam Mohamed , when he was held in prisons in Morocco and Afghanistan .
The development follows criticism of US prosecutors by British judges who have seen secret evidence of torture committed against Mr Mohamed , including allegations his torturers used a razor blade to repeatedly cut his penis .
The Attorney 's investigation is expected to include allegations that MI5 colluded in Mr Mohamed 's rendition .
Mr Mohamed , 30 , an Ethiopian national and British resident , was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 , when he was questioned by an MI5 officer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
On Tuesday , Government lawyers wrote to the judges hearing Mr Mohamed 's case against the UK government in the High Court .
In the letter they said " the question of possible criminal wrongdoing to which these proceedings has given rise has been referred by the Home Secretary to the Attorney general for consideration as an independent minister of justice " .
Baroness Scotland has been sent secret witness statements given to the court and public interest immunity certificates for the proceedings .
Mr Mohamed , 30 , accuses MI5 agents of lying about what they knew of CIA plans to transfer him to a prison in north Africa , where he claims he was subjected to horrendous torture .
Mr Mohamed , who won asylum in the UK in 1994 , has been charged with terrorism - related offences .
He awaits a decision on whether he is to face trial at the US naval base .
He is officially the last Briton at Guantanamo .
Last night his lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , said : " This is a welcome recognition that the CIA cannot just go rendering British residents to secret torture chambers without consequences , and British agents cannot take part in US crimes without facing the music .
Reprieve will be making submissions to the Attorney General to ensure those involved , from the US , Pakistan , Morocco , Britain , are held responsible . "
Richard Stein , of Leigh Day , representing Mr Mohamed in the High Court proceedings , said : " Ultimately the British Government had little choice once they conceded that a case had been made that Binyam Mohamed was tortured .
The Convention Against Torture imposes an obligation on signatory states to investigate torture . "
In August two judges ruled allegations of torture were at least arguable and that MI5 had information relating to Mr Mohamed that was " not only necessary but essential for his defence " .
The judges have read statements and interviews with Mr Mohamed between 28 and 31 July , 2004 when he says he was forced to confess to terrorism .
The judges said : " This was after a period of over two - and - a - half years of incommunicado detention during which Binyam Mohamed alleges he was tortured . "
He was first held in Pakistan in 2002 , where a British agent interrogated him ; he was then sent to Morocco by the CIA and allegedly tortured for 18 months .
He was rendered to the secret " Dark Prison " in Afghanistan , where his torture is alleged to have continued .
Since September 2004 , he has been in Guantanamo Bay .
Australian hikers have found the suspected remains of a World War II airman hanging from a tree in dense forest in Papua New Guinea .
The moss -covered body appeared to be wearing a harness and goggles .
The discovery was made along the Kokoda Trail , in the east of the country , which was an important battleground during the war .
The Australian Defence Force is preparing to send officials to the scene for further investigations .
A force spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm the nationality of the pilot .
There are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables , so presumably it is an airman
David Collins
Expedition leader
But he is likely to have come from Australia , Japan or the United States , as all three operated aircraft in the area during the war .
" We had a few police officers on the 19 - man trek .
One was taking photos with a large lens of the trees and flowers , " said the leader of the hiking group , David Collins .
" He then discovered what looks like the remains of a body .
" I could n't make it out at first .
It was n't until the wind blew that you could really see it is in a harness .
There are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables , so presumably it is an airman . "
' Too early to speculate ' Some 600 Australian soldiers died in fighting around the Kokoda trail in World War II - seen by the Allies as a key point at which to halt the advance of the Japanese military .
Unexploded ordnance remain in the thick forest around the trail , and hikers are warned not to stray from the path .
Australia 's Defence Department told AFP arrangements were being made to send an expedition to the site .
" It 's too early to speculate on the nationality of the airman or the circumstances of his death , " a spokesman said .

Stewart awards McCain ' Dick Move of the Week ' for Hilton ad David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Senator John McCain 's latest campaign ad equating Barack Obama with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton as an empty celebrity who is famous only for being famous has already drawn reactions from a variety of quarters , including internet parodies and rumors that Spears is considering legal action .
Jon Stewart on Thursday 's Daily Show also piled on by proclaiming the ad to be the " Dick Move of the Week " -- but not because of anything it implies about Obama .
" It 's a dick move by McCain because it turns out one of the fine young ladies featured in this ad ... her parents , the Hiltons , contributed $ 4600 , the maximum you can contribute , to the campaign of none other than John McCain .
John McCain 's saying to the Hiltons , ' I think you kindly for your support , now if you 'll excuse me I 've got to go take a nationally televised dump on your daughter . ' "
" The ad's part of a new line of attack from McCain , " continued Stewart , " that Obama 's got thousands of fans and everyone loves him -- wait , no , that 's not right . "
Stewart then played a clip of ABC's Jake Tapper explaining that the McCain team is trying to paint Obama as " an arrogant , arugula - eating , fancy berry tea- drinking celebrity . "
" Well , nice try , guys , but reducing candidates to two - dimensional stereotypes is kind of my gig , " Stewart said , adding , " The media is not going to be buying it . "
He immediately disproved this with a series of clips of media figures calling Obama arrogant , presumptuous , pompous , over - confident , ' too cool for school , ' and arrogant .
" What 's McCain 's humble strategy ? " retorted Stewart .
" ' Vote McCain .
I am nothing special and would probably make a terrible president .'?
Are you insane ? "
Stewart turned next to media accusations that Obama is promising more than he can deliver .
" Why ca n't he be more grounded , like his opponent ? "
Stewart agreed , turning to a clip of McCain describing " what I would hope to have achieved at the end of my first term as president of the United States . "
Stewart suggested that McCain had probably laid out a set of modest , unpresumptuous objectives .
But what McCain actually said was that by 2013 , " The Iraq War has been won .
There is no longer any place in the world al Qaeda can consider a safe haven .
The United States has experienced several years of robust economic growth .
The world food crisis has ended .
Our southern border is now secure . "
" Let 's just start with the first one , " proposed Stewart .
" ' The Iraq War has been won . '
President McCain , looking back , how did you propose that we had done it ? "
" I 've been there , " stated McCain in an April interview .
" I know wars .
I know how to win wars . "
" Point taken , " Stewart agreed .
" What about the economy ?
Obama 's all ' let 's sit down with a bipartisan panel of economic experts .' ... Come on Johnnie Mac. "
" We 'll balance the budget , " McCain has promised flatly .
He later insisted to George Stephanopoulos that he could cut taxes $ 300 billion in his first term and still balance the budget , saying cheerfully , " I 'll find you a hundred billion tomorrow . "
In response , Stewart strained and groaned and pulled a gold egg out of his ass .
Stewart then proceeded to a clip of McCain saying of Osama bin Laden , " We 'll bring him to justice and I 'll follow him to the gates of hell . "
" I guess we 're going to Pakistan , " surmised Stewart .
However , McCain recently stated , " I 'm not going to go there , and here 's why .
Because Pakistan is a sovereign nation . "
" So you 'll go to hell but not Pakistan ? " Stewart asked in bemusement .
" So , " concluded Stewart , " Senator John McCain will end the war , solve the fiscal crisis , and get our number one enemy in four years through a mysterious process to be divulged only in 2013 .
It leads us to only one possible conclusion . "
He then showed Larry King asking Barack Obama , " All your speeches promise the impossible .
Are you in fantasy land ? "

About the Foundation Our Mission History People
Our Mission
The mission of the Foundation for Deep Ecology ( FDE ) is to support education and advocacy on behalf of wild Nature .
FDE carries out this mission primarily through publications , grantmaking , and support of campaigns on particular issues affecting the future of nature and people .
We believe that stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society .
Present assumptions about economics , development , and the place of human beings in the natural order must be reevaluated .
Nature can no longer be viewed merely as a commodity — a storehouse of “ resources ” for human use and profit .
It must be seen as a partner and model in all human enterprise .
We begin with the premise that life on Earth has entered its most precarious phase in history .
We speak of threats not only to human life , but to the lives of all species of plants and animals , of the entire ecosphere in all its beauty and complexity including the natural processes that create and shape life 's diversity .
It is the grave and growing threats to the health of the ecosphere that motivates our activities .
We believe that current problems are largely rooted in the following circumstances : •
The loss of traditional knowledge , values , and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance .
Correspondingly , the assumption of human superiority to other life forms , as if we were granted royalty status over Nature ; the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose .
•
The prevailing economic and development paradigms of the modern world , which place primary importance on the values of the market , not on Nature .
The conversion of Nature to commodity form , the emphasis upon economic growth as a panacea , the industrialization of all activity , from forestry to farming to fishing , even to education and culture ; the rush to economic globalization , cultural homogenization , commodity accumulation , urbanization , and human alienation .
All of these are fundamentally incompatible with ecological sustainability on a finite Earth .
• Technology worship and an unlimited faith in the virtues of science ; the modern paradigm that technological development is inevitable , invariably good , and to be equated with progress and human destiny .
From this , we are left dangerously uncritical , blind to profound problems that technology has wrought , and in a state of passivity that confounds democracy .
• Overpopulation , in both the overdeveloped and the underdeveloped worlds , placing unsustainable burdens upon biodiversity and the human condition .
As our name suggests , we are influenced by the Deep Ecology Platform , which helps guide and inform our work .
We believe that values other than market values must be recognized and given importance , and that Nature provides the ultimate measure by which to judge human endeavors .

COLORADO SPRINGS —
Well , everybody predicted Broadmoor East would become a bear of a golf course .
But during Friday ’s second round of the U.S. Senior Open , things got even more hairy than usual .
An adult black bear wandered onto the course during the noon hour , crossing several fairways on the back nine before heading for the West Course through a drainage pipe .
The animal later found another drainage pipe and left The Broadmoor property .
“ I never heard of such a thing , ” said Fred Funk , who , at 6 - under - par 134 , takes a two - stroke lead over Eduardo Romero into Saturday ’s third round after both shot a 1 - under 69 on Friday .
Funk was on another area of the course and did not see the bear .
But word spread quickly .
The bear crossed the forward tee box on No. 14 soon after one of Funk ’s top challengers , Mark McNulty , hit his drive .
Tom Watson heard somebody shout “ Bear ! ” while he was in the middle of a backswing .
Bernhard Langer stopped his pre-shot routine and waited until the bear got out of sight .
Television golf analyst Dottie Pepper ran the other way on the 13th fairway .
“ It would be pretty scary if ( the bear ) got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close , ” Funk said .
“ That would n’t have been an issue if a caddie had got too close , ” he added , attempting to add some levity to what could have become a dangerous situation .
The tournament field figured to have a “ Shark ” ( nickname of Greg Norman ) and a “ Walrus ” ( Craig Stadler ) but who could have guess that a black bear would join in ?
“ You do n’t get that every week , ” John Cook said .
Teeing off early , Funk got in the clubhouse at 6 under par through 36 holes , a score that stood up to the afternoon challengers .
Romero , an Argentine who quietly moved up the leader board as befitting of his nickname “ El Gato ” ( the cat ) , sits in second place at 4 - under - par 136 .
Tom Kite , Cook and McNulty are four shots back at 138 .
Funk recorded four birdies against three bogeys despite playing with a stiff left shoulder .
“ That was strange , ” Funk said .
“ On the ( practice ) range , I felt the best I have in a year and a half , two years .
Nothing was hurting , and I was like , ‘ What ’s wrong with me ? ”
Then , walking on the second shot on the 10th hole ( his first hole ) all of a sudden my neck started grabbing and I really could n’t hit through the ball . ”
Funk received an on -course shoulder massage from a tournament physical therapist and mostly kept the ball in play .
“ It got looser on the front nine ( his second nine ) , and actually that was pretty good , ” he said .
“ Fortunately , I could turn my neck to the left ; I could n’t turn it to the right .
I ’ve had it where you ca n’t swing or you ca n’t go to the left .
But with this , I could look up .
I got through it .
“ The irony of it is that I felt so good on the range and then I felt ( poorly ) on the whole back nine . ”
Funk , who has n’t won since the opening tournament of the 2008 Champions
Tour , overcame a shaky start Friday which left him three over par on the day through his first eight holes .
But he made a two - putt birdie at the par - 5 ninth , and then rolled in a 20 - footer for birdie at the 339 - yard No. 2 .
He tapped in for another birdie at the 560 - yard , par - 5 No. 3 after narrowly missing an uphill eagle putt from 12 feet .
But Funk ’s best effort might have been a bogey save on the 478 - yard , par - 4 No. 11 , when he two - putted from 60 feet after having to lay up with his second shot after driving into the rough .
“ I was n’t really frustrated ( after the bad start ) because I felt like I was still playing pretty good and I thought I could make some birdies , ” Funk said .
Romero , a big hitter who set up a birdie on the 510 - yard 17th with a 390 - yard drive , is accustomed to playing at a high elevation in his hometown of Cordoba .
And he is well aware that an Argentine , Roberto De Vicenzo , won the inaugural U.S. Senior Open in 1980 .
De Vicenzo is Romero ’s mentor and hero .
“ Yes , yes , I know , ” Romero said , almost sheepishly .
“ But it ’s two more rounds .
“ I played good today .
I ’m going to be playing in the last group tomorrow ( with Funk ) .
I like that . ”
With tougher pin placements , the course seemed to play a couple of shots more difficult on Friday .
“ The USGA put some on us today that almost defy imagination , ” Kite said of the cup locations .
“ The greens are so treacherous .
If you get on the wrong side of one of those ridges , it is really tough to get it down in two putts .
“ The difficulty is in getting in the proper section of the green and then trying to negotiate all these severe slopes .
Then you ’re reading what the mountain is going to do to it .
The altitude makes club selection a guessing game .
And that mountain makes reading the putts a little bit of a guessing game . ”
Greg Norman shot 72 on Friday and was n’t pleased with the pin placements .
“ I ’m not going to make a comment on the golf course ; the USGA should know better , ” Norman said , declining to elaborate .
Said Cook after his 2 - over 72 : “ The course is right on the edge , right on the edge .
The pin placements , on a scale of 10 , were a 15 .
It was all I could do to survive .
“ On No. 8 , I was behind the hole with a five - footer .
I did n’t know how I could keep it within five feet of the hole .
Luckily , it got a piece of the hole and I had a four - footer ( coming back ) . ”
When told of Cook ’s comments , the USGA ’s Jim Hyler , who is in charge of the daily course set - up , said , “ At least he did n’t say we were OVER the edge .
“ We like where the golf course is .
We have it pretty much where we want it to be .
But the wind came up in the afternoon and that added to the difficulty .
“ There were a couple of challenging hole locations , no question .
The wind dried out things .
When we see hot spots ( on the greens ) , we ’ll suspend play and give them a drink . ”
Among the players who did not make the cut were Sandy Lyle ( plus 9 ) , Mark Wiebe ( plus 9 ) , Mark O’Meara ( plus 9 ) , Ben Crenshaw ( plus 11 ) , Curtis Strange ( plus 11 ) , Dave Delich ( plus 12 ) , Craig Stadler ( plus 13 ) , Peter Jacobsen ( plus 14 ) , Allen Doyle ( plus 20 ) , Dale Douglass ( plus 21 ) , Hubert Green ( plus 24 ) and Audie Dean ( plus 28 ) .
Four of the nine players with Colorado ties qualified for the weekend : two - time U.S. Senior Open champion Hale Irwin ( plus 5 ) , Colorado Springs native R.W. Eaks ( plus 5 ) , Castle Pines resident Gary Hallberg ( plus 5 ) and Mike Reid ( plus 8 ) , who played high school golf for Cherry Creek .
Funk was asked if the bear might be an omen for those competing in the U.S. Senior Open .
“ ( Jack ) Nicklaus is n’t here , so I guess that ’s a substitute , ” said a grinning Funk , referring to golf ’s “ Golden Bear . ”

One criticism of Linux is that ordinary people are , on the whole , too ignorant about technology to use anything except Windows .
This is just wrong .
It 's wrong because Windows is n't easy to use and it's wrong because there just are n't that many people who can't adapt to a new user interface .
More and more people are using computers during their everyday lives , so the average knowledge of computer users is increasing .
This means there are more and more power users .
It also means that more can be asked of computer users and less technology needs to be aimed at the most inexperienced users .
We 've come a long way since the first PC first appeared .
Then computers were mysterious boxes that only geeks used .
Nowadays millions of people use computers every day .
Of these people , there is a vast pool who are moderately sophisticated .
As proof of this , I can point to how difficult many powerful applications , such as Photoshop or Illustrator , are .
None the less many non-technical people become experts .
However , the real proof of the increasing sophistication of computer users is the number of expert Excel users .
To use a spreadsheet , such as Microsoft Excel , to its full capability is difficult , not in the least because it requires knowledge of a scripting language .
Yet , millions manage it .
It is these users to whom the more sophisticated and subtle aspects of Linux can appeal .
It is these people , who can really appreciate higher levels of computing power .
Linux offers these people power on every level .
It offers these people true freedom .
That 's why open source needs to be brought to them .
Oh , do n't act so surprised .
A refresh of Apple 's long - in - the - tooth MacBook Pro line was pretty much the only sure thing slated for today 's event , and Apple certainly delivered .
As for looks , you probably know the score by now : chiclet keyboard , Air- inspired aluminum stylings , and a glossy screen that 's flush with a new iMac - like black bezel ( there 's no non-gloss option for the purists out there ) .
What 's new is confirmation of a multi - touch glass trackpad , which suspiciously rids the computer of a single mouse button and adds some new gestures like app switching .
Apple 's also put in some effort on slimming down the computer , bringing it down to a mere 0.95 - inches thick ( though at 5.5 pounds it 's a hair heavier than the original ) , but much of the real excitement happens under the hood .
There 's a new internal structure , that rumored " brick " of aluminum that helps Apple make the new Pro thin , strong and leaves room for the real goodies : the specs .
Apple 's using NVIDIA 's new 9400M GPU + chipset 1 - 2 punch for integrated graphics , supplemented by 9600M GT switchable discreet graphics chip for heavy lifting , and pumping out those graphics over a Mini DisplayPort connector , if you 'd like to supplement the LED backlit screen .
As expected there 's an SSD option , with drive accessible underneath the battery .
The 15.4 - inch base model retails for $ 1999 , with a 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo processor , 2GB of DDR3 RAM and both GPUs .
Step up to $ 2499 and you get a faster CPU , 4GB of RAM and a 320 GB HDD .
The 17 - inch MacBook Pro comes in a similar configuration with a 2.6GHz processor , starting at $ 2799 , but sans the redesign and GPU love .
Hit the jump for a breakdown of the configurations .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Facing a huge hole in Chicago ’s current and upcoming budgets , Mayor Richard Daley announced on Tuesday a plan to partially shut down city government for six days .
Along with several other measures , the mayor ’s plan was aimed at saving $ 62 million for the city ’s corporate or operating fund , which currently faces a $ 469 million shortfall .
Under the plan , city employees , with the exception of mostly public safety workers , would not work and would not be paid for the day after Thanksgiving or for Christmas Eve and New Year ’s Eve this year and in 2009 .
Daley also said the fiscal 2009 budget he will unveil on Wednesday will eliminate 1,346 currently vacant positions and will include various cost - cutting or revenue - raising measures .
“ I know that no one will be completely satisfied with our recommendations , ” the mayor said in a statement .
“ But , if we work together and responsibly cut spending this year , we ’ll be taking an important step toward addressing the financial challenges we ’ll still face in the years ahead . ”
On Friday , the mayor announced the consolidation of several city departments in a move that will cut almost 240 jobs and save Chicago about $ 5 million a year .
The city expects to collect $ 2.52 billion early next year from a long - term lease of Midway Airport to a private operator , but most of that money would be earmarked to pay off airport debt , as well as for infrastructure improvements and pension funding .
Daley has rejected using all of the remaining $ 100 million to tackle the budget shortfall .
Good question .
There are a few things we know about Microsoft ’s managed application runtime and class library :
There will be major updates to the Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF ) and Workflow Foundation ( WF ) .
According to this announcement along with this post by Steven Martin we are going to see “ better support for Web 2.0 technologies like REST , POX and ATOM ” and a 10 x performance increase in WF .
The table shown here also mentions a bigger role for XAML :
Seamless integration between WF and WCF and unified XAML model .
Build entire application in XAML from presentation to data to services to workflow .
There will be a new application server codenamed Dublin , which hosts WF / WCF applications and manages messages , long - running transactions , state management .
Dublin extends Internet Information Services ( IIS ) and will run on Windows Server – probably Server 2008 only .*
Dublin supports Oslo , which is Microsoft ’s latest attempt at model - driven development .
I guess Dublin is the host for Oslo applications , as this post implies .
XAML is a good fit with modelling , because it is both declarative and well - suited for visual representation .
Models do not have to be visual , and Oslo includes a new textual language which could also be based on XAML (? ) , but nevertheless there is synergy between modelling and visual designers .
Putting this together , we have a new take on Microsoft ’s end - to - end stack , developed in Visual Studio with XAML supplemented by procedural code where needed , hosted on Dublin , and using WPF or perhaps Silverlight ( ? ) for the presentation layer .
Thanks to the new REST support , or the old SOAP support , you could also use other clients including JavaScript or Java .
It is all a bit perplexing if you currently think of the .NET Framework as the runtime engine and class library for C# and Visual Basic .
It sounds as if .NET Framework 4.0 is enterprisey , more JEE than Java .
We are seeing increasing fragmentation or more positively , diversification , in Microsoft ’s .NET story .
There are micro versions , cross- platform versions ( Silverlight ) , desktop versions ( client profile ) , and more and more pieces that only belong on servers .
How much of Oslo and the Dublin application server is likely to be implemented in Mono , I wonder ?
I suspect not that much , since Mono has focused in the past on the common language runtime and ASP .
NET .
There was no WPF support in Mono until Moonlight .
All this begs the question : is .NET becoming too complex ?
I interviewed Scott Guthrie , Corporate VP Developer Division , at the Remix conference in Brighton last month .
I asked him about Oslo , thinking that he must be closely involved in what is , according to some at Microsoft , a major step forward in application development .
His reply : “ That ’s not my world ” .
Guthrie is a simplifier .
He was one of the original developers of ASP .
NET , along with Mark Anders , and as I recall , when asked what modelling tool he used he replied , “ a whiteboard ” .
I spoke to Anders about the early days of ASP.
NET and he emphasized the value of simplifying what already exists ; see also How ASP.NET began in Java .
Microsoft also claims that Oslo / Dublin will make complex things easier for developers , but looking at all these pieces I ’m waiting to be convinced .
PDC 2008 is where we will find out more .
* According to this post “ Dublin ” actually refers to the next version of Windows Server itself , though this announcement says “ a set of enhanced Windows Server capabilities codenamed ‘ Dublin ’ that will offer greater scalability and easier manageability . ”
I guess this comes to the same thing , and that preview versions of Dublin could either be early releases of the entire OS , or preview bits that install into Server 2008 .

October 8 , 2008 .
Background : the First Brigade of the Third Infantry Division , three to four thousand soldiers , has been deployed in the United States as of October 1 .
Their stated mission is the form of crowd control they practiced in Iraq , subduing " unruly individuals , " and the management of a national emergency .
I am in Seattle and heard from the brother of one of the soldiers that they are engaged in exercises now .
Amy Goodman reported that an Army spokesperson confirmed that they will have access to lethal and non lethal crowd control technologies and tanks .
George Bush struck down Posse Comitatus , thus making it legal for military to patrol the U.S.
He has also legally established that in the " War on Terror , " the U.S. is at war around the globe and thus the whole world is a battlefield .
Thus the U.S. is also a battlefield .
He also led change to the 1807 Insurrection
Act to give him far broader powers in the event of a loosely defined " insurrection " or many other " conditions " he has the power to identify .
The Constitution allows the suspension of habeas corpus — habeas corpus prevents us from being seized by the state and held without trial — in the event of an " insurrection . "
With his own army force now , his power to call a group of protesters or angry voters " insurgents " staging an " insurrection " is strengthened .
U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman of California said to Congress , captured on C - Span and viewable on YouTube , that individual members of the House were threatened with martial law within a week if they did not pass the bailout bill :
" The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere . …
Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall , the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day and a couple of thousand on the second day , and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no . "
If this is true and Rep. Sherman is not delusional , I ask you to consider that if they are willing to threaten martial law now , it is foolish to assume they will never use that threat again .
It is also foolish to trust in an orderly election process to resolve this threat .
And why deploy the First Brigade ?
One thing the deployment accomplishes is to put teeth into such a threat .
I interviewed Vietnam veteran , retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and patriot David Antoon for clarification :
" If the President directed the First Brigade to arrest Congress , what could stop him ? "
" Nothing .
Their only recourse is to cut off funding .
The Congress would be at the mercy of military leaders to go to them and ask them not to obey illegal orders . "
" But these orders are now legal ? ’ "
" Correct . "
" If the President directs the First Brigade to arrest a bunch of voters , what would stop him ? "
" Nothing .
It would end up in courts but the action would have been taken . "
" If the President directs the First Brigade to kill civilians , what would stop him ? "
" Nothing . "
" What would prevent him from sending the First Brigade to arrest the editor of the Washington Post ? "
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
" Nothing .
He could do what he did in Iraq — send a tank down a street in Washington and fire a shell into the Washington Post as they did into Al Jazeera , and claim they were firing at something else . "
" What happens to members of the First Brigade who refuse to take up arms against U.S. citizens ? "
" They ’d probably be treated as deserters as in Iraq : arrested , detained and facing five years in prison .
In Iraq a study by Ann Wright shows that deserters — reservists who refused to go back to Iraq — got longer sentences than war criminals . "
" Does Congress have any military of their own ? "
" No .
Congress has no direct control of any military units .
The Governors have the National Guard but they report to the President in an emergency that he declares . "
" Who can arrest the President ? "
" The Attorney General can arrest the President after he leaves or after impeachment . "
[ Note : Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi has asserted it is possible for District Attorneys around the country to charge President Bush with murder if they represent districts where one or more military members who have been killed in Iraq formerly resided . ]
" Given the danger do you advocate impeachment ? "
" Yes .
President Bush struck down Posse Comitatus — which has prevented , with a penalty of two years in prison , U.S. leaders since after the Civil War from sending military forces into our streets — with a ‘ signing statement . ’
He should be impeached immediately in a bipartisan process to prevent the use of military forces and mercenary forces against U.S. citizens "
" Should Americans call on senior leaders in the Military to break publicly with this action and call on their own men and women to disobey these orders ? "
" Every senior military officer ’s loyalty should ultimately be to the Constitution .
Every officer should publicly break with any illegal order , even from the President . "
" But if these are now legal .
If they say , ‘ Do n’t obey the Commander in Chief , ’ what happens to the military ? "
" Perhaps they would be arrested and prosecuted as those who refuse to participate in the current illegal war .
That ’s what would be considered a coup . "
" But it ’s a coup already . "

The events of Black Sunday ( the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers ) and Terrible Tuesday ( the forced takeover of AIG ) are seen by most observers as either cataclysmic or cathartic ; an angry sun setting on decades of " credit " capitalism or the final cleansing of the financial system of its excesses , resulting in swift recovery .
Neither image is accurate .
The events of this week are a logical progression in the elimination of credit excesses , marking neither Armageddon nor the beginning of renewal .
Unfortunately , this is just another stage in the lengthy adaptation of the market system to a less - than brave new world .
But it does allow us to get a glimpse of where we are ultimately heading .
Here are the key events :
Two investment banks , categorized as non deposit - taking financial institutions ( NDFIs ) , were in difficulty .
One fire - sold itself to a bank ( Merrill ) .
The other went bust ( Lehman ) .
In the case of AIG , another NDFI , the government has imposed a controlled bankruptcy through nationalization .
The collapse of these NDFIs ought to have been expected .
Why ?
They have much less capital than banks to support losses and far riskier assets .
They borrow and lend money using securities ( often pledged by their clients ) as collateral .
As financial markets fall their gearing ratios ( i.e. , the value of their debt relative to their assets ) rise .
To maintain a constant gearing ratio , the NDFI has to liquidate assets and pay down loans .
This causes financial asset - prices to fall and the NDFI gearing ratio to rise again .
Then the process begins again .
Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law , according to a review of state records and Social Security data by The New York Times .
The actions do not seem to be coordinated by one party or the other , nor do they appear to be the result of election officials intentionally breaking rules , but are apparently the result of mistakes in the handling of the registrations and voter files as the states tried to comply with a 2002 federal law , intended to overhaul the way elections are run .
Still , because Democrats have been more aggressive at registering new voters this year , according to state election officials , any heightened screening of new applications may affect their party ’s supporters disproportionately .
The screening or trimming of voter registration lists in the six states  Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina  could also result in problems at the polls on Election Day : people who have been removed from the rolls are likely to show up only to be challenged by political party officials or election workers , resulting in confusion , long lines and heated tempers .
Some states allow such voters to cast provisional ballots .
But they are often not counted because they require added verification .
A huge trove of critical videos of Scientology was targeted for takedown late last week by a group called American Rights Counsel .
The group sent more than 4,000 DMCA takedown notices to YouTube and claimed that every video infringed on its copyrights , according to the EFF .
Those who take on the notoriously litigious " church " of Scientology — including groups like " Anonymous " — know what they 're up against and are willing to take action to keep their messages up .
It appears that most of the pulled content has been reinstated already after the various uploaders filed DMCA counter - notices asserting that the videos in question did not infringe copyright .
The targets of the takedown action included everything from Anonymous protest videos to Clearwater City Council hearings ( Scientology has a major presence in Clearwater , Florida ) to German and Canadian news reports .
This led YouTube users to rant in public forums about the " abuse " of YouTube 's takedown system by American Rights Counsel , which even went after user - created videos .
" YouTube , you need to REVIEW YOUR POLICY on copyright claims , the current system is far to [ sic ] susceptible to ABUSE , " wrote ShadowVsScientology .
" All you have to do to get a video taken down is make a claim and it is instantly pulled ; this is WRONG , when a claim is made the person who uploaded the video should have a chance to respond BEFORE the video is removed , this stops people like the Cult of Scientology getting their way instantly .
YouTube PLEASE sort this problem out and do not let Scientology control this website . "
YouTube 's takedown system is a product of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act , not something of its own devising , and one weakness of the system is its potential abuse by rightsholders .
Fortunately , the DMCA includes penalties for anyone who sends takedown notices in bad faith , and it also allows for the reinstatement on content with nothing more than a simple DMCA counter - notice .
The Church of Scientology is n't just under assault on YouTube .
Earlier today , Agence France - Presse reported that the church would be put on trial in Paris for fraud .
Earlier this summer , a number of the church 's secret documents , including those that talk about the breakfast - cereal - sounding " Theetie Wheeties , " were made public on Wikileaks .
And the church 's battle with Anonymous continues , both online and off .
Anonymous has long put out YouTube videos targeting the church and has engaged in real street protests , usually wearing the Guy Fawkes masks seen in the film V for Vendetta .
In a new twist on this latter tactic , many group members will buy tickets for the opening of Katie Holmes ' ( wife of Scientologist Tom Cruise ) new Broadway play next month and will sit in the audience , watching in silent judgment from behind their creepy masks .
Travellers from 27 countries , including Britain , will be required to register online with US authorities at least three days before leaving to visit America , it will be announced today .
This latest measure aimed at bolstering American security is expected to take effect from January 2009 .
Last year , European companies expressed concern when the US homeland security department floated proposals to make passengers register with US authorities 48 hours before travel .
Critics feared this could complicate last - minute business arrangements .
The introduction of the new 72 - hour notice period will be announced by the homeland security secretary , Michael Chertoff , later today , according to a US government official .
The rules will apply to citizens from the 27 nations of the visa waiver scheme .
This includes most of western Europe as well as Australia , Brunei , Japan , New Zealand and Singapore .
Although the measure will require registration 72 hours before travelling , successful applications will be valid for multiple entries over two years .
Passengers will be able to register in advance from August this year through travel agents , airline websites or a special US government website .

Max Blumenthal and I recently spent several days on separate visits to Wasilla , Alaska , Sarah Palin 's hometown where she was mayor from 1996 to 2002 .
We talked to a number of local residents and pored over a number of city documents , looking into Palin 's associations with a far - right political faction in Wasilla .
( We working thanks to a grant from The Nation Institute 's Investigative Fund . )
The report is now complete and can be read in its entirety at Salon.com .
You can also see above the video
Max made of his interview with one of the faction 's main leaders , a man named Mark Chryson , who headed up the secessionist Alaskan Independence Party during the same time period .
It pretty much speaks for itself .
Essentially here ’s what we found :
That Gov. Palin , when a Wasilla city council member , formed an alliance with some of the more radical far - right citizens in Wasilla and vicinity , particularly members of the secessionist Alaskan Independence Party who were allied with local John Birch Society activists .
These activists played an important role in her election as Wasilla mayor in 1996 .
Once mayor , one of Mrs. Palin ’s first acts was to attempt to appoint one of these extremists ( a man named Steve Stoll ) to her own seat on the city council .
This was a man with a history of disrupting city council meetings with intimidating behavior .
She was blocked by a single city council member .
Afterward , Mrs. Palin fired the city ’s museum director at the behest of this faction .
She fomented an ultimately successful effort to derail a piece of local gun-control legislation which would simply have prohibited the open carry of firearms into schools , liquor stores , libraries , courthouses and the like .
The people recruited to shout this ordinance down included these same figures , notably the local AIP representative ( who became the AIP ’s chairman that same year ) .
She remained associated politically with the local AIP / Birch faction throughout her tenure as mayor on other issues , particularly a successful effort to amend the Alaska Constitution to prohibit local governments from issuing any local gun-control ordinances .
In general , we found that not only did Mrs. Palin have numerous associations with these extremists , she actively sought to empower them locally and to enact their agendas both locally and on a state level .
We sent an e-mail to the McCain / Palin campaign asking for their reaction to these findings , and have so far received no response .
If and when we do , we 'll update .
We have n't any insight into Palin 's accusations that Barack Obama " palled around with terrorists " by associating with William Ayers .
But we do know there are serious questions about her own dalliances with the far right during the same time period .
We did n't find any evidence that Palin herself subscribed to their " New World Order " conspiracy theories , but it 's clear she was comfortable with not only aligning herself with them politically , but putting them in positions of actual political power and influence .
I 'll be back tomorrow with some City of Wasilla documents you can peruse on your own substantiating our findings .
UPDATE : ( Nicole ) Max Blumenthal appeared on Rachel Maddow to discuss this article
The newest Mike Leigh joint , Happy - Go-Lucky , explores happiness with the same artistic gravity that most movies reserve for sadness .
Leigh ’s film centers around Poppy , a 30 - year - old primary school teacher who floats through life with a bubbly disposition better suited to the jocular sidekick in a Julia Roberts vehicle .
But as brought to life by Sally Hawkins ’ unbelievable performance and Leigh ’s beautiful filmmaking , Poppy achieves a depth of character that movies allow only for tragic figures , especially in fall and winter releases ; this is as complex a character and performance as Daniel Day - Lewis ’ deservingly ballyhooed There Will Be Blood role last year .
No emotion is simple in the hands of artists with Leigh ’s talent and compassion , and Happy - Go - Lucky , like the best of his films , achieves a kind of cinematic state of grace .
It ’s simultaneously “ serious ” and life affirming , and another triumph for this great filmmaker .
Poppy speeds through London on a bicycle as the credits roll and then enters a bookstore , where the shopkeeper scoffs at her glib attitude .
We all know people like Poppy , but the archetype is still mostly foreign in movies ; always talking , she ’s a woman who annoys because it seems like she does n’t take anything seriously .
Locked in our distinctly unfunny daily routines , as the shopkeeper is , such a sudden burst of personal boundary - defying chatter is grating and obnoxious .
And so it is in Happy - Go - Lucky ; far from giving us an easy heroine , Leigh presents us with a woman who ’s distinctly annoying out of context , then spends the next two hours giving us the background in which to appreciate Poppy ’s demeanor as endearing , even brave .
It ’s the same challenge he issued in his 1993 film Naked , which opens with David Thewlis ’ Johnny attempting to rape a woman and then fleeing Manchester for London .
In both cases , it ’s Leigh ’s project to make us see through our initial impressions and appreciate the complexity — if not the goodness — of even the least appealing characters .
Johnny was similarly logorrheic , but his acerbic , hateful intellectualism was a guard against intimacy whereas Poppy constantly reaches outward .
Hence her loving , supportive relationship with her students ( including a violent one who she counsels outside of class ) and a nearly surreal scene where she encounters a mentally ill homeless man and tries to really understand his manic raving .
We ’re used to viewing people like Poppy as somehow deranged or socially daft , yet she also has a longstanding , loving friendship with her roommate , Zoe ( Alexis Zegerman ) , who is low - key and sarcastic yet clearly values Poppy ’s optimism .
After her bike is stolen in the first scene , Poppy starts taking driving lessons with a private instructor ( Eddie Marsan , who does a complete 180 from his terminally shy role in Leigh ’s 2004 film Vera Drake ) .
That ’s essentially the only plot in Happy - Go - Lucky , and the rest of the film follows Poppy as she attends to her day - to - day professional tasks and relationships .
It ’s a seemingly banal sketch for a movie , but Leigh ’s style is perfectly suited to finding epic themes in private moments .
His camera , as always , moves in achingly slow zooms , allowing us to feel like we ’re leaning in to eavesdrop on intimate conversations .
And his use of close - ups — a continued homage to Carl Theodor Dreyer ’s 1929 The Passion of Joan of Arc that was made explicit in Vera Drake — gives a similarly grand importance to subtle emotions .
Leigh ’s movies , Happy - Go-Lucky included , take place in lower - and middle - class London flats and pubs , but they feel much more spacious since , like Dreyer , he lavishes attention on the human face like a western director photographing the desert .
As evidenced by Poppy ’s job and her recurring interactions with Scott , the racially intolerant and spiteful driving instructor , Leigh ’s film moves cyclically through teacher - student interactions , showing each person ’s duality at different times .
Scott , despite his rigorously defined tutoring methods , turns out to be as childishly violent as the student that Poppy helps in class .
Ditto the hilariously unstable Spanish instructor ( Karina Fernandez ) that leads her salsa dance lessons .
But Tim ( Samuel Roukin ) , the social worker who starts to date Poppy after their initial encounter with the troubled student , is shown to be both an able authority figure and a lovestruck romantic .
Poppy and Tim are ultimately heroic because they embrace both instructive responsibility and neophytic unknowing .
Contrast this to Poppy ’s suburbanite younger sister who becomes unnecessarily defensive when she feels her lifestyle is being judged .
But Poppy instead approaches life with a wide - eyed embrace of its contradictory demands ( that we be both teacher and student at different times , for example ) , a characteristic that Leigh expresses through Poppy ’s participation in trampoline classes .
Photographed in subtle slow motion while momentarily caught between land and sky , Poppy is a picture of emotional harmony .
And when she pulls a muscle in mid-jump and has to have her back adjusted , she laughs giddily as her bones are cracked in the physical therapist 's hands .
Early in the film , Poppy goes with Zoe and their friends to a typical dance club and are seen bouncing up and down to Pulp ’s “ Common People , ” which peaks with the lines , “ Sing along with the common people / Sing along and it might just get you through / Laugh along with the common people / Laugh along even though they 're laughing at you . ”
I suspect this is n’t an arbitrary musical reference ; Happy - Go-Lucky reveals its protagonist ’s unflagging optimism is n’t a retreat from life ’s difficulties but rather a response to them .
Poppy loves life but rarely feels content ; she yearns for a boyfriend and worries about her students and family .
Her optimism is n’t the simplemindedness that others often take it for , and Happy - Go - Lucky honors her by showing that masterful filmmaking and nuanced acting are perfectly suited to exploring even the most seemingly slight emotions .
Happy - Go-Lucky .

Barack Obama 's average weekly broadcast ad buy of about $ 700,000 in Washington jumped last week by nearly threefold to about $ 2 million .
| Composite image by POLITICO Obama drowning out McCain in TV ads
In the first three weeks of September , Barack Obama ran 1,342 television commercials in the Washington media market that reaches heavily populated and contested Northern Virginia .
According to The Nielsen Company , in the same period and market , John McCain aired just eight commercials on broadcast stations .
Advertisement
Similar disparities are playing out across the country as the Illinois Democrat flexes his financial muscle to outspend McCain and the Republican National Committee on television advertisements , in some cases by ratios of as much as 8 - to - 1 .
As of close of business last week , Obama had spent approximately $ 195 million on primary and general election ads compared with $ 99 million by the Arizona Republican and the Republican National Committee , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group .
And the gap is widening in the final weeks .
As McCain constricted his Virginia ad campaign to cable stations and smaller , downstate media markets , Obama doubled down on Northern Virginia .
The Democrat ’s average weekly broadcast buy of about $ 700,000 in Washington jumped last week by nearly threefold to about $ 2 million , according to station public records .
The spending figures are significant because they demonstrate how Obama ’s fundraising advantage has helped him drown out his opponent and maintain a longer — and more positive — presence in the living rooms of voters in critical swing states .
“ Obama is spending $ 3.5 million a day on television ads , ” said Evan Tracey , CMAG ’s chief operating officer .
“ If he does that through Election Day , it will be more than McCain got from the government for his entire general election campaign . ”
Republicans are using every wrinkle and loophole in — ironically — the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law to try to keep pace and stretch their spending power .
The RNC is feverishly raising cash to augment McCain ’s $ 85 million allotment from the taxpayer - backed presidential campaign financing account .
The party headquarters is expected to spend $ 19 million in coordinated campaign activities with McCain and another $ 45 million in hybrid ads that promote McCain and other Republican candidates .
The tactic , which was introduced by the Bush - Cheney reelection committee in 2004 , allows a 50 - 50 split on ad costs for the RNC and McCain .
But the results can be messy since the candidate is n’t in full control of his own message .
McCain ’s much - anticipated first ad attacking Obama ’s ties to former domestic terrorist Bill Ayers was widely panned because it also included an attack on congressional Democrats over federal spending , a muddling of messages deemed necessary to justify the RNC ’s portion of the costs .
Even if the messaging went smoothly , though , the financial maneuvering would still only boost McCain ’s spending to about $ 150 million for the general election .
The remaining spending gaps will have to be filled by the RNC with independent expenditures and transfers of cash to state party operations for swing - state voter turnout operations .
According to Federal Election Commission disclosure forms , about $ 11 million has already been doled out by the RNC to seven states , most of which are in presidential battlegrounds .
But Obama ’s recent purchase of two 30 - minute blocks of time on two national networks — which could cost about $ 1 million apiece and negotiations are continuing with two other networks — has many Republicans worrying that they are up against an even bigger machine than they ’d imagined .
The staggered release of fundraising disclosure reports is n’t helping their plight .
Obama ’s September donations totals will be released next week .
Republicans wo n’t know how much he collects in this final month until after Election Day .
Meanwhile , Obama is urging backers to pony up for the final push and to grow his already record - breaking 2 million donors by at least 100,000 by this Friday .
The consequences of such a significant financial mismatch are already becoming evident on the Electoral College playing field .
Again , look at Virginia , a state that has n’t backed a Democratic candidate since 1964 and is now considered a tossup .
During the heated primary with Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama spent $ 1.5 million in the Old Dominion .
McCain , who was cruising to the nomination and had little money at that point in the GOP primary , spent just $ 330,000 on ads .
Since the Democratic primary ended in June , Obama has spent another $ 13 million in Virginia , compared with McCain ’s $ 5.5 million , CMAG found .
Obama ’s buying power allows him to run a mix of positive and negative ads and to spread them over a wider swath of turf .
He is also able to play in all media markets , expensive or not .
That ’s a luxury McCain ca n’t afford , as evidenced by his near - blackout in Northern Virginia .
" McCain is virtually invisible in the commercial breaks , ” said Bill Lord , vice president of news for WJLA - TV , the Washington ABC affiliate that is owned by Politico parent company Allbritton Communications Co .
To stay competitive in Virginia and elsewhere , McCain has made a series of ad buys in smaller markets or those that can provide a two - fer by bleeding into more than one state .
Nebraska is one of just two states that distributes its Electoral College votes based on the outcome in each of its three congressional districts , an unusual allocation that enticed the Obama campaign to fight for the Omaha - based district vote while all but conceding the rest of the traditionally Republican state to McCain .
While Obama is significantly outspending McCain in the Omaha television market , McCain has been making major buys in less expensive , nearby Sioux City , Iowa , which reaches both Omaha and Hawkeye State voters .
In the first three weeks of September , McCain ran more than 1,000 ads on those smaller stations while Obama did n’t run any .
Though Iowa voted for President Bush in 2004 , it is another state that Democrats are confident they can flip from red to blue come November .
Dissatisfaction with the war and the economy are helping their effort .
But Obama ’s early work in the primary is also paying dividends and may have put the state out of Republican reach before the general election even began .
Since June , McCain and the RNC have spent about $ 4 million in Iowa , airing mostly negative ads aimed at raising doubts about his opponent .
But they appear to have had little effect on Obama , who spent $ 10 million on television commercials introducing himself to voters before the winter caucuses .
Since June , he ’s invested another $ 2 million on ads in in Iowa — a paltry sum by Obama ’s standards but one that may reflect confidence that a roughly 12 - point lead in state polls will hold up until Election Day .
A study recently released by the Wisconsin Advertising Project , an arm of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , documented similar imbalances in other key states .
The report zeroed in on one week of spending , Sept. 28 to Oct.
4 . It found that Obama was outspending McCain and the RNC by more than 3 - to - 1 in Florida , 2 - to - 1 in New Hampshire and 8 - to - 1 in North Carolina .
“ Because of Obama ’s fundraising advantage , his campaign is able to spend more in more states than we ’ve seen in recent memory , ” said Ken Goldstein , the project ’s director .
McCain and the RNC are still trying to play a little offense : Pennsylvania is a rare state they hope will flip from blue to red .
Both campaigns have spent about $ 16.5 million on advertisements in the Keystone State since June .
But , as in Iowa , McCain ’s messages are being delivered to an audience that has already had plenty of exposure to Obama .
When his primary television budget is added to the general election spending , Obama ’s overall advertising in Pennsylvania — so far — comes to $ 27 million , compared to McCain ’s $ 17 million .
" Obama is matching McCain ’s negative ads and using the excess spending to do positive spots .
He ’s able to be both the good cop and the bad cop , ” said Tracey .

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 449 points despite the rescue of AIG .
The years of easy money were fun while they lasted .
Banks and credit card providers were so flush with cash that they could help virtually anyone — including many who had trouble juggling their bills — pay for whatever they wanted .
But the party 's over .
LOAN TIPS : Rates are low , may drop more Q&A : How secure are your investments ?
That 's been marked by the shuddering collapse of investment bank Lehman Bros. , the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America , the federal government 's $ 30 billion loan to foster the sale of investment bank Bear Stearns , its $ 200 billion injection to mortgage backers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , and its $ 85 billion loan to insurance provider American International Group .
We 've entered a period of tight credit — which could mean jobs lost , retirement plans pruned , college deferred and lifestyles diminished .
Across the nation , Americans know that something 's wrong .
Nearly one - quarter of adults — 23 % — believe the U.S. economy is in a depression , according to a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Monday and Tuesday .
That 's nearly double the 12 % who said so in February .
People have n't lost hope .
Nearly half — 47 % — say they expect the U.S. economy to be growing a year from now .
That 's roughly unchanged from the 44 % who expressed the same view in the earlier poll .
But amid the rush of bad financial news , concerns are increasing .
Marilyn Landis , a longtime homeowner and businesswoman in Cleveland , recently saw how dramatically the financial world is changing when her credit card rate shot up to 27 % from 3 % after she bought $ 7,000 worth of new computers for her financial consulting firm .
Landis , a former commercial lender who says she has excellent credit , says her bank explained that her rate rose because she was closer to her credit limit .
Meanwhile , Landis says , she can't get a home equity loan to expand her business because her home 's value has n't risen enough thanks to the housing market slump .
Her firm is still doing well , but Landis says she and many clients are increasingly fearful of the spiraling damage from the financial crunch , as more small to midsize businesses and thousands of their customers find their credit lines capped by banks .
" It 's like throwing millions of stones in a lake and watching the economic ripples , " Landis says .
" That really worries me . "
The complications stemming from the credit crunch worsened Wednesday as investors bailed out of stocks for the second time in three days , causing a drop in the Dow of more than 7 % this week .
On Wednesday , many investors saw the AIG bailout as a sign the government believes the nation 's financial system can't withstand another shock .
Investors rushed to ultrasafe , three - month Treasuries , driving the yield to the lowest since February 1941 , says Bryan Taylor of Global Financial Data .
Meanwhile , a popular measure of investors ' nervousness , the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped 20 % .
The new era of tight credit , and the government 's response to the crises in the financial markets , are touching Landis and other Americans in a range of ways .
Retirement investors
If you 're in a 401 ( k ) savings plan , you 've had a jarring week as panicked investors reacted to the monumental reshaping of financial markets .
Even though the S&P 500 plunged nearly 5 % Wednesday , owning a basket of stocks , such as a diversified stock fund , in a 401 ( k ) plan often is far better than owing an individual stock .
Blue -chip General Electric fell 6.6 % Wednesday , for example , and investment bank Morgan Stanley tumbled 24.2 %
Most people do n't invest all their money in stocks .
Of the $ 4.6 trillion in retirement accounts at the end of 2007 — the latest figures available — 68 % was in stocks .
The rest was in money market and bond funds , which have risen modestly in value .
Nevertheless , it 's discouraging to shovel money into a retirement account and not see any growth — or to see balances decline .
Analysts generally offer three tips to help ease the pain : • Keep contributing , especially if your company matches your contributions .
• Do n't panic .
If you move all of your money out of stocks and into a money fund now , you run the risk of missing profits when the market recovers .
• Rebalance .
If you 've set a target for your investments — say , 60 % stocks and 40 % bonds — check your balances .
If you now have a 50 % - 50 % split between stocks and bonds , sell enough bond funds to get your asset mix back to 60 % stocks and 40 % bonds .
You 'll be buying stocks low and selling high .
Savers
This appears to be a good time to put some money in the bank .
Banks , eager to build their cash reserves and faced with a tightening credit market , began to boost savings rates even before the recent turmoil .
Since the end of April , when the Fed last cut interest rates , yields on the average one - year CD have climbed to 2.4 % from 1.9 % , Bankrate.com says .
Yields at some banks are as high as 4.6 % .
Saving has become an increasingly urgent priority for Monique Shankle , a former Enron employee and contracts adviser for an offshore engineering firm in Houston who has spent the past few years recovering from $ 60,000 in losses from her Enron retirement fund .
Now , the 401 ( k ) she has with her current employer has lost several thousand dollars in value .
Fearing tough times ,
Shankle says she is saving more cash , hiding her credit cards and delaying the purchase of a new car .
" It 's like Enron all over again , " she says .
" You 've got to be prepared for whatever happens . "
Taxpayers
At coffee shops and gas stations across the USA , people are wondering what the government has gotten them into as taxpayers with all the federal bailouts .
" We just keep going deeper and deeper in debt , " says Milton Hubbard , 58 , a pastor in Chanute , Kan .
" At some point , it is going to crash . "
There 's no telling how much taxpayers ultimately will pay for the recent federal efforts to stabilize the system .
But things may look worse today than they will a few years from now .
Taxpayers made money after the government guaranteed loans of more than $ 1 billion to Chrysler in 1979 .
The auto company paid the loan back in full , and the Treasury Department made a profit when it sold the Chrysler stock it got in the deal .
The Resolution Trust Corp. , which was created in 1989 to dispose of the assets of failed savings and loans , cost taxpayers far less than initially feared .
" Often , ( bailouts ) end up being moneymakers , " says Jon Faust , director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University .
He says it 's likely the Fed will make a little money , break even or lose a little .
How would the Fed lose the entire $ 85 billion from AIG ?
" The only way that happens is if the economy really collapses , " Faust says .
" But if the economy collapses , that is the least of our problems .
You 're going to wonder why you did n't spend more . "
Those upset about the government actions need to keep in mind what would have happened if there had been no action , JPMorgan Chase senior economist James Glassman says .
The economy could have slowed further , leading to less tax revenue and thus higher levels of debt .
" If you do n't address the crisis , the real cost to the public can end up being far worse . "
Credit card users
Average credit card interest rates have fallen as the Federal Reserve has cut its short - term interest rate target to just 2 % .
Yet that does n't mean people are paying less for credit .
Those who miss a payment , send their checks in late or exceed their credit limits can discover penalty rates as high as 32 % .
Card providers likely will collect more than $ 19 billion from consumer penalty fees this year , up 5.5 % from 2007 , according to consulting firm R.K. Hammer .
Consumers are relying on credit cards more than ever , especially as it gets harder to land home equity loans .
Revolving debt — much of it on credit cards — hit a record $ 969.9 billion in July .
People are starting to use their cards for necessities such as groceries and gas , credit counselors say .
As the credit market gets tighter , that could be a big problem for consumers deemed to be bad credit risks , especially those who have mortgages that adjust to rising rates .
Lenders are sending them fewer offers for new cards and trimming credit limits for the ones they already have .
The story 's different , though , for people with solid payment records .
Credit card providers are giving them more cards and letting them charge more , according to data from Equifax , one of the three credit bureaus .
" We 're not seeing ( card ) lenders doing a full - scale pullback at all , " says Myra Hart , senior vice president of analytical services at Equifax .
" In general , there seems to be moderate growth in overall credit available to consumers . "
Mortgage borrowers Excesses in mortgage lending got the current mess started .
Delores Nettleton , 75 , a retired elementary school teacher in Spokane , Wash . , sees merit in the old ways of home lending .
" When I was a young bride and we were looking for a home , we had to have so much down , and you could not go over a certain percentage of your salary , " she says .
" If people had stuck to those rules , we would not be in the situation we are in . "
But here we are , and lenders have taken a big step toward tighter lending rules since the steep decline in home values began in mid-2006 .
Mortgage rates fell after the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , but now they 're inching up .
HSH Associates says the average rate on a 30 - year , fixed - rate mortgage was 6.14 % on Wednesday , up from 6.02 % last week .
But banks are making it hard for many borrowers to take advantage of the low rates by tightening lending standards .
The bar likely will be raised much higher now that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have been taken over by the government .
They " are on a mission to be sure every loan is perfect , " says Brian Koss , managing director of Mortgage Network , mortgage bankers in Danvers , Mass .
" It does n't matter what the interest rates are , if you can't qualify . "
Small businesses Nearly 50 % of the USA 's 27 million small businesses say they 've been " impacted by the credit crunch , " according to a July survey by the National Small Business Association trade group .
Bankers often want to keep lending to large corporate customers and , as a result , do n't have enough cash for small businesses , says NSBA President Todd McCracken .
That forces small - business owners to use high - interest credit cards as their main sources of capital .
Predictably , many are postponing big purchases , not filling vacant jobs and cutting back on business travel and advertising .
Spooked by the Wall Street meltdown , they 're moving personal and business - related cash to safer , federally insured savings accounts and CDs , McCracken says .

Goal : Increase Minority Homeowners by 5.5 Million in a Decade
Guess who 's goal this was ?
You might be surprised :
>>
" More and more people own their homes in America today .
Two - thirds of all Americans own their homes , yet we have a problem here in America because few than half of the Hispanics and half the African Americans own the home .
That 's a home ownership gap .
It 's a -- it 's a gap that we 've got to work together to close for the good of our country , for the sake of a more hopeful future .
We 've got to work to knock down the barriers that have created a home ownership gap .
I set an ambitious goal .
It 's one that I believe we can achieve .
It 's a clear goal , that by the end of this decade we 'll increase the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million families . . .
Home ownership is also an important part of our economic vitality .
If -- when we meet this project , this goal , according to our Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , we will have added an additional $ 256 billion to the economy by encouraging 5.5 million new home owners in America ; the activity -- the economic activity stimulated with the additional purchasers , the additional buyers , the additional demand will be upwards of $ 256 billion .
And that 's important because it will help people find work . "

Last week , we mentioned this speech from 2004 .
Fast forward to today 's excerpt , from an even earlier , 2002 speech .
Why keep bringing these up ?
Because it derails the false argument brewing amongst those on the right who blame the 1977 CRA or the 1938 Fannie Mae for the current housing and credit problem .
I have zero patience for this nonsense , and am unafraid to call people on it .
Nothing in any of these Bush speeches that pushed for more lending to minorities and increased lower income home ownership caused the problem .
Neither did any similar Clinton speeches .
Nor did related the legislation related to the Bush speeches , nor did the CRA , nor Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac .
Indeed , none of these actions required the sort of reckless lending that we saw from 2002 - 2007 .
Understand this simple fact :
In an ultra - low rate environment , where prices are appreciating rapidily , and mortgaes are being securitized , ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT THE BORROWER NOT DEFAULT IN 90 days ( or 6 Months ) .
The goal was to make a loan that did not default in that period of time , it can not be put back to the originator .
As a mortgage salesman , you only lose your a fee if a borrower defaults within 3 or 6 months .
What do you do to maximize your returns ?
The best way to do that -- to put people in houses that would not default in 90 days -- was the 2/28 ARM mortgages .
Cheap teaser rates for 24 months , then the big reset .
By then , it was no longer your problem .
Can you grasp what a monumental change this was ?
Instead of making sure that borrowers could pay back ALL OF THE 30 YEAR FIXED MORTGAGE , you only had to find people who could afford the teaser rate for a a few months .
THIS WAS AN ENORMOUS AND UNPRECEDENTED SHIFT IN LENDING .
This is the key to the hosuing boom and bust , anbd ultimately underlies the entire credit freeze .
And , it would not have been possible without the Greenspan ultra - low rates , which made the teaser portion ( the " 2 " of the 2/28 ) of these mortgages so attractive .
~~~
Those who continue to blame the CRA , Fannie Mae , etc. reveal their fundamental misunderstanding of how credit operates in general , what the financing process was like from 2002 - 07 , and how this situation came to pass .
Or worse , they understand it , and choose to lie about it anyway for partisan political purposes .
You either understand these simple facts , or you do n't .
If you cannot comprehend this , well , then , I am at a loss as to what that says about your cognitive functioning .
But if you understand this , but spit out the nonsense anyway , then you are merely a partisan with no respect for the truth .
And that seems to be the main people blaming the CRA and Fannie / Freddie for the credit / housing crisis -- those folks who either can't think -- or wont .

nice rant BR lovin it !!
Posted by : harold hecuba | Oct 14 , 2008 10:05:37 AM
UPDATE : Marc in the comments made a point about sole proprietorships with employees that I ’d like to address as well .
Barack Obama wants to reduce taxes for roughly 95 % of the United States while raising taxes on the other 5 % – those making more than $ 200,000 per year .
John McCain wants to lower taxes on everyone , and attacks Obama ’s tax increase on the upper 5 % as destroying small businesses and jobs .
I decided to do some research on this issues to see if , in fact , raising taxes on those individuals making more than $ 200,000 would reduce employment or not , and I found out some interesting things .
The conclusion , however , is this : Obama ’s tax increase on the wealthy will not directly harm small businesses .
At. All .
First , some definitions so we all know what I ’m talking about .
So far as I can tell , the only small businesses that pay taxes at the personal income rate are “ sole proprietorships ” , the simplest type of business in the U.S. According to NOLO.com , a sole proprietorship may have employees , but the census indicates that the bulk of sole propreitorships do not – they ’re considered nonemployers , and they are the largest portion of all U.S. businesses .
In 2005 ( the last year for which there is both data on nonemployers and employers at the U.S. Census Bureau ) , there were 20,392,068 nonemployers with a total income of $ 951 billion ( Source : Nonemployer Statistics , 2005 , Total for all sectors , United States ) .
Small business employers1 numbered 5,878,784 ( Source : Statistics of U.S. Businesses , All Industries , 2005 ) .
The total number of all employer and nonemployer businesses in 2005 was 26,375,614 , of which 26,270,852 ( or 99.6 % ) would qualify as small businesses as I ’ve defined it above .
This would be why people respond when you threaten to increase taxes on small businesses – there ’s a LOT of small businesses .
But look closer at those numbers .
The average income per nonemployer small business is the total income divided by the number of employers , which in this case is only $ 46,635 .
What that means is that the vast majority of nonemployer small businesses ( which we can probably fairly say are mostly sole proprietorships ) would be unaffected by the Obama tax cut .
In fact , since they make so little , they ’d get a tax cut , not a tax increase .
Yes , you read that right : the average small business would get a tax cut under Obama ’s tax plan , not a tax increase as McCain has suggested .
Various websites have suggested that there are between 15 and 20 million sole proprietorships – that ’s less than the number of nonemployers from the Census data , but since some employers are certainly covered while some non-employers certainly are n’t , we ’ll assume that all the nonemployers are sole proprietorships .
Further , if you look at the Census household income survey for 2005 , you ’ll find that only 3 % of all households made more than $ 200,000 .
Since sole proprietorship income is taxed as household income , we can probably fairly assume that only about 3 % of all sole proprietorships in 2005 would be affected by Obama ’s tax increase .
This means that only 3 % of all businesses would see their taxes go up as a result of the Obama tax plan .
And this will cause our employment situation to get dramatically worse how , exactly ?
It ’s not like all 3 % will go out of business entirely as a result of the tax increase – the increase just is n’t big enough to drive them all out of business .
In fact , according to this BusinessWeek Q&A , the numbers are hard to estimate , but that 9 % per year is a commonly used value .
If we assume that the Obama tax increase boosts the failure rate for sole proprietorships from 9 % to 14 % , then that ’s approximately an additional 31,000 jobs lost .
Of course , if we say that the tax cut to the other 97 % of sole proprietorships drops the failure rate from 9 % to 8 % , then that ’s an additional 198,000 jobs created by the other sole proprietorships , for a net increase of 167,000 jobs .
Annually .
Or , as Factcheck.org said when they tackled this issue earlier this year :
McCain has repeatedly claimed that Obama would raise tax rates for 23 million small - business owners .
It ’s a false and preposterously inflated figure .
UPDATE : Let ’s broaden the definition to assume that all small business employers with less than 10 employees are also sole proprietorships .
From the employer Census link for 2005 above , there were 4.72 million employers with fewer than 10 with a total of 12.83 million employees .
Let ’s assume that , as above , no more than 3 % of those employers fall into the $ 200,000 + individual pay bracket .
That ’s a total 110,000 employers and 31,000 employers for businesses with 0 - 4 employees and 5 - 9 employees respectively .
Again , if we assume that there ’s a 5 % increase in business failures equally through both sizes of businesses ( from 9 % to 14 % ) , that ’s a total of 5500 businesses sized 0 - 4 employees and 2790 businesses sized 5 - 9 employees that would fail due to the tax increase .
The average number of employees for all businesses in the 0 - 4 employees category is 1.66 employees per business .
The average number of employees for businesses in the 5 - 9 employees category is 6.66 employees per business .
Calculating the job losses we get 8,855 employees in those 5500 newly failed businesses ( 0 - 4 employees ) , plus 5500 for the owners themselves , and 18,582 employees in the other 2790 businesses ( 5 - 9 employees ) plus another 2790 for the owners .
Total is 35,036 extra employees losing their jobs .
Adding that to the 31,000 sole proprietorships from the first analysis , that ’s a total of roughly 66,000 jobs lost every year .
And just in sole proprietorships alone ( never mind the newly expanded 0 - 9 employees category ) we created 167,000 new jobs .
Include the 1 % decrease in employer small business failures ( from 9 % to 8 % ) on businesses sized 0 - 9 employees and that ’s an additional 176,000 new jobs , for a total of 343,000 new jobs across all nonemployer and employer small businesses .
Put bluntly , even if we assume the worst case cost of 66,000 jobs and that every business with fewer than 10 employees is a sole proprietorship ( and it ’s not ) , the Obama tax plan is still creating 277,000 new jobs every year .
1 I chose to define “ small businesses ” as those businesses with fewer than 100 employees .
The Small Business Administration uses a much more complicated measurement that depends on the industry and total revenues / number of employees .
UPDATE # 2 : I ’ve been able to do some more accurate calculations with the IRS data from 2005 , and the numbers of small businesses ( defined as all partnerships , S corps , and sole proprietorships ) that fall in to the Obama tax increase zone is actually just over 7 % , not 3 % as I ’d originally estimated .
However , the rate of business failure and closure is much closer to 2 % of all businesses , and so I ’ll need to rework my analysis some .
Instead of tagging that rework onto this post , I ’ll do a new post sometime next week with the updated analysis .
The super vaccine that protects you from all types of flu for LIFE
A super - vaccine that could give permanent protection against all forms of flu is being developed by British doctors .
The once - in - a - lifetime vaccine could do away with the need for an annual jab , according to researchers at Oxford University .
At present , the current jab has to be given every winter to match different circulating strains .
A new flu vaccine could give long - lasting immunity , instead of annual jabs ( file picture )
If successful , the new vaccine could be a key weapon against a flu pandemic because stockpiles could be made in advance .
Official estimates of the impact of such a pandemic in Britain show it could lead to 750,000 deaths , with more than six million children affected , including 750,000 under five .
Lead researcher Dr Sarah Gilbert said the vaccine could be used routinely in as little as five years , once tests had been done to ensure its safety and efficacy .
She said a universal vaccine would drastically change the way flu vaccine is used .
' With having to make new vaccine every year , there 's never enough to go around , ' she said .
' With this vaccine , we could end up having pretty much everyone vaccinated - a situation more like measles , where you do n't really need it any more .
' Children would be protected , we 'd see economic benefits through reduced sickness in people of working age , and the elderly , who respond less well to vaccination , would be better off through lack of exposure to flu . '
Dr Gilbert added : ' The current approach to influenza vaccination is unsatisfactory for use against seasonal influenza , and of little use when new types of flu begin to infect humans from birds .
' It leaves manufacturers with a few months to produce the necessary stocks , the vaccine has to be administered to at risk populations within a short time window , and those receiving the injection will all have to be vaccinated again the following year . '
The latest approach follows successful tests of another universal vaccine by scientists at Cambridge biotech firm Acambis .
Trials on healthy adults in the U.S. showed the jab is safe , causing no side effects other than the occasional red arm and high temperature associated with all vaccines .
The trials found that after two doses a month apart , it worked fast to prime the immune system to produce antibodies capable of attacking the virus in up to 90 per cent of those tested .
At least two other companies - including British - based biotech firm PepTcell and Swiss developer Cytos - are also working on universal flu vaccines .
The idea behind the universal flu vaccine is to prevent it having to be reformulated every year .
Current vaccines are designed to prompt an immune response to H and N proteins on the outer shell of the virus .
But these proteins change their structure and each year the vaccine has to be reformulated on the basis of the strains likely to be the most prominent .
The Oxford University approach is to develop a vaccine based on proteins inside the cell .
These are far more similar across different strains .
The vaccine uses a weakened smallpox virus to carry the proteins into the body , a technique used in malaria and TB vaccines .
Once the virus has invaded the cell and starts to multiply , these inner proteins - called matrix protein 1 and nucleo - protein - are revealed to the immune system .
A specific type of immune cell called a T cell then learns to recognise and destroy cells containing the proteins the next time it encounters them .
Those using the vaccine would need to take a booster every five to ten years .
Professor John Oxford , a flu vaccine expert at Queen Mary , University of London , said such a vaccine would be the ' ultimate prize ' .
' But it 's a fairly difficult prize to get - it may just be a question of luck , ' he added .
' There are people trying all kinds of strategies . '
He said the task of manufacturing different flu vaccines every year was a ' huge burden ' on pharmaceutical companies .
' This team have experience with this type of vaccine so they may well get there , ' he added .
Every year more than 15 million people in England alone receive a flu jab in a programme costing £ 115 million .
Priority groups include those aged 65 and over , with around three - quarters of pensioners getting protection each year .
Patients with chronic respiratory disease , heart disease , chronic renal disease and immune system deficiencies can also get jabs on the NHS .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s tallest man , China ’s Bao Xishun , became the world ’s tallest father this week with the birth of his first child , a boy whose initial height seems a compromise between his gigantic dad and average - sized mum .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Bao ’s son measured 22 inches long at birth , the senior doctor at Zunhua Hospital in Hebei province told Reuters .
Although slightly taller than average for newborn children , Bao ’s boy came up well short of the 29.5 inches claimed as a record birth length last year , also in China .
“ Bao is quite happy .
The baby is healthy and a normal size , ” the hospital ’s senior doctor Zhang told Reuters .
Bao , a 7 - foot - 9 - inch herdsman from Inner Mongolia , last year married Xia Shujuan , a pygmy by contrast at 5 - foot - 6 inches .
“ I hope he or she can be about 2 meters tall , ” Bao , 57 , said last year about his wishes for a child .
“ Then he or she can play basketball . ”
His son weighed 4.2 kilograms at birth , a touch heavier than average .
Bao briefly lost his Guinness World Records title as the tallest man to Ukrainian Leonid Stadnyk but regained it in August when Stadnyk refused to be measured under new guidelines .
Bao ’s son was born on Thursday but news of the birth only spread widely on Saturday , with the Chinese press according the newborn a level of privacy that is rare for the world ’s tallest man .
The former goat herder hires himself out for publicity stunts and his wedding last year was sponsored by at least 15 companies .
Miss McCain goes on to liken Miss Palin 's situation to a moment that " single - handedly changed my life " - when , during the 2000 presidential campaign , a reporter asked her father whether he would tell Meghan , who was then 14 , that she could not have an abortion if she became pregnant .
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The windfall of cash from Washington in June got eaten up by the worst inflation in nearly three years , Commerce Department data showed Monday .
Nominal spending grew 0.6 % on the month , but the increase was all due to higher prices , which spiked 0.8 % .
Adjusted for inflation , June 's real spending fell 0.2 % , the first decline since February .
Real consumer spending is up just 1.2 % from a year ago , the weakest performance during this business cycle .
" Despite the fiscal stimulus , consumers are starting to pull back under the weight of tight credit , falling home values and a weakening labor market , " wrote Michelle Meyer , an economist for Lehman Bros .
" We expect this trend to continue . "
Consumption will probably only rise at a 0.5 % annual rate in the second half of the year , said Harm Bandholz , an economist for UniCredit Markets .
" Soaring inflation , notably higher food and energy prices , has eaten up part of the fiscal payments . "
The impact of the tax rebates on personal incomes was reduced in June : After getting $ 48.1 billion from the government in May , individuals received $ 27.9 billion .
Personal incomes rose 0.1 % after a 1.8 % surge in May .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had been looking for nominal spending to rise 0.5 % and incomes to fall 0.1 % .
See Economic Calendar .
Real disposable incomes fell 2.6 % in June , reversing gears after a 5.2 % gain in May .
Congress approved some $ 110 billion in tax rebates in order to boost the flagging economy .
It appears that consumers are spending some of the money , but much is being saved , at least for a while , as the personal savings rate jumped to 4.9 % in May and 2.5 % in June .
Inflation surged in June .
The personal consumption expenditure price index rose 0.8 % compared with May , the most since Hurricane Katrina hit in September 2005 .
Moreover , inflation 's up 4.1 % in the past year , the largest rate of growth in 17 years .
Core prices , which exclude food and energy prices , rose 0.3 % in June .
The increase was as expected .
Core prices thus are up 2.3 % on a year - over - year basis , significantly higher than the 2 % ceiling the Federal Reserve would like to see .
Details
Monday 's data are likely to have little impact on the Federal Open Market Committee 's meeting on Tuesday .
The Fed seems committed to keeping its interest - rate target steady at 2 % , in an effort to balance the risks of a more severe economic slump against the risks that inflation could get out of hand .
The June income and spending report highlights both sets of risks in bold letters .
Real spending on durable goods fell 1.6 % , the biggest drop in a year , while real spending on nondurable goods slipped 0.4 % .
Real spending on services rose 0.2 % .
Income from employee compensation rose 0.2 % , while proprietors ' income increased 0.6 % and rental incomes rose 14.2 % .
Transfer payments fell 1.1 % as income from assets dipped 0.2 % .
Re : Religious Lady Has Miscarrage and Keeps It . who would even tap that to begin with ?!
she 's a fuggin nut
there 's an old saying for this :
backdoor , no babies !
He shut down newspapers , imprisoned editors , and forced reporters to toe the official US government line long before the PATRIOT Act .
Then he attacked US cities and burned them to the ground .
Who was he ?
He lied to US voters , sided with one European imperial state against another , and plunged neutralist America into a disastrous war that cost 320,000 American casualties .
Who was he ?
He promised voters the dawning of a new age in America .
Instead he secretly dealt with a pair of dictators , providing weapons to both sides ( while lying to Americans ) and encouraged a murderous war between the two nations that cost nearly a million casualties .
He also funded and encouraged repressive Central American regimes that killed thousands , murdering American citizens along the way .
He spent trillions of taxpayer dollars on new weapons for enemies that no longer existed .
Who was he ?
If you answered Lincoln , Wilson and Reagan ' among the most ' respected ' presidents in high school history books -- you know your American history well .
Lincoln , the ' Great Emancipator . '
Wilson , the ' Peacemaker , ' the vocal proponent of the League of Nations .
Reagan , ' The Great Communicator , ' the mythical fighter of World Communism .
At least that is how US history books portray them , among the Best Presidents Of All Time .
But how would they fare on any list of Worst Presidents Ever ?
Would embattled George Bush or disgraced Bill Clinton fare worse ( or better ) than Lincoln , Reagan or Wilson , and why ?
Would n't it be safe to say that once in power , ALL American presidents embrace a cruel conceit , to some degree , that whatever dictatorial power they wield is right ?
George Bush is thus no worse than Woodrow Wilson , certainly no worse than Nixon , Reagan , Clinton or LBJ .
What Defines A Bad President ?
' The criteria to use is to what degree has a president diminished sovereignty of the individual states , how aggressive was his administration in an interventionist international foreign policy and what assault of destruction did his minions do on honest money and national debt , ' wrote Sartre .
' However . . . each successive administration build upon the tyranny of the past . . .
Abe Lincoln was the worst .
He killed the last hope of a genuine Republic . '
Among Sartre 's list of others : Hamilton , Wilson , FDR , LBJ , and Clinton .
What appears to make GWB worse , at present , is his surrounding cast of scoundrels .
By appearances , no one among his retinue seems to have the scruples of a gnat .
But were those courtiers of Bill Clinton ( Madeline Albright ) much better ?
Indeed , one respected leftist writer claims Clinton was far worse than George W. Bush .
The Worst Of The Worst
A list of The Worst Presidents Ever would be impossible to compile precisely .
How would you arrange it and by what criteria ?
Short term or long term harm to the Republic ?
The number of US citizens killed and the trillions of taxpayer dollars funneled from the poor to the rich ?
The repudiation of humane principles ( war crimes ) and moral values ?
The betrayal of public trust and the blatant disregard for future generations ?
The crass enrichment of cronies ?
Or all of the above ?
George Smith wrote : ' At my present level of understanding , I give Lincoln the edge over Wilson as the worst president in American history .
Wilson is a close second because of the damage done in 1913 ( Federal Reserve Act ) . . .
We should n't forget the behind - the - scenes work of people pushing for government privileges , such as J.P. Morgan , who used their immense financial power to restructure government in their favor . '
Smith added , ' Focusing on the president , therefore , can be misleading .
We know Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law , for example , but the Fed was the brainchild of others . '
What would be foremost on any list of presidential failings and felonies , high crimes and misdemeanors ?
' I 'd say the most important issues are expanding the state , advancing the ideology of statism , and body count , ' wrote historian Anthony Gregory .
' Concerning this last one , my list of the top few worst presidents ever is an exclusive club of those who killed hundreds of thousands of people .
Not so coincidentally , but helpful for our purposes of evaluation , those who killed a lot of people also tended to be the ones who eroded liberty , expanded the state , and encouraged statism the most . '
Gregory listed such luminaries -- beginning with the worst 'as Woodrow Wilson , Abraham Lincoln , Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman ( a tough call ! ) , Lyndon Johnson , William McKinley , George W. Bush , Teddy Roosevelt , James Polk , James Madison , Herbert Hoover .
Lincoln made every list of everyone I asked .
And yet , unlike our present leader , Lincoln expressed more than a little remorse for his war , more than a little sorrow , attempted more than a little reconciliation , extended more than a little graciousness to the vanquished ' enemy ' than the current president .
No lengthy torture sessions or inquisitions or imprisonments of thousands of Southerners years after their capitulation .
While the worst US president in history may be the one that afflicts the republic at any given time , the best one appears to be one who governs least 'or least effectively , in a historical sense .
A president who starts no wars , sends no troops , drops no bombs , raises no taxes , expands no government , spends no fortunes , steals no elections , curtails less liberties while allowing freedom a free reign , would qualify as among the best .
Have we ever had ONE of those ?
Footnote : How dangerous was it to threaten the Federal Reserve bankers ?
To get elected , Wilson secretly sided with a cabal of international bankers to form the Federal Reserve in 1913 .
When JFK announced he would rescind the privileges of the Federal Reserve in 1963 , and return the monetary system to the US Treasury , JFK was shot out of office a few months later .
Some historians believe there was a connection .
For Sarah Palin , last night ’s debate was an open - book exam .
She spent much of the evening methodically reading and rehearsing answers from " carefully scripted talking points . "
Palin 's notes were largely hidden from plain view , resting behind the lectern where she stood .
Because the cable and network television stations did not show a split screen of the debate , most viewers could not see that , during Joe Biden 's answers , Palin spent almost all her time looking down and studiously reading her notes .
But viewers did see that when Palin delivered her answers , she would repeatedly glance down to check her talking points .
heck
ear
something
I 'm glad I 'm not the only person that noticed this last night I did n't have the benefit of viewing the debate with a splitscreen , so I was very interested to watch the video at the link .
And I 'm sorry , you do n't get that garbled when responding to spontaneous questions unless you 're trying to mangle your prescripted answers to fit them .
I was speaking to a friend on the phone during the debate last night , and she mentioned that she thought she saw a " Bush bulge . "
I was skeptical , but then a little later , I found myself saying " What theis that in her ?
" Apparently , I was n't the only person wondering this .
And no , I 'm not suggesting that the photo proves that Palin was wired , but I know I saw .
HDTV certainly does make watching these things more interesting .
Now if you 'll excuse me , I have to go make tinfoil hats .
Winter Patriot
September 23 , 2008
In a phone call to an Islamabad TV station , " a group calling itself Fedayeen - i- Islam " has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad , according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn .
Fedayeen - i-Islam is " a little - known group " according to Bloomberg .
But just how little - known ?
Dawn ’s report quotes " a senior [ Pakistani ] government official " as saying :
“ We have not heard the name of the organisation but we are trying to locate its network . ”
Amazing .
Ever since Saturday night ’s bombing the media have been wrestling with the big question : " Why did al Qaeda do this ? "
But now they have to deal with a different question : " How is Fedayeen - i - Islam related to al Qaeda ? "
It goes without saying that Fedayeen - i- Islam must be a violent radical Islamofascist group and that they must have bombed the hotel .
And they must have been assisted , if not directed , by al Qaeda , and probably the Taliban as well .
After all , who else but the world ’s most violent Islamic terrorists could make an anonymous phone call to a TV station ?
It ’s nice to know the big questions are looked after .
That gives us leeway — here in the frozen corners of the blogosphere — to ask meaningless little insignificant questions , like :
What were US Marines doing in the Marriot Hotel just before the attack ?
According to Pakistan Daily , after the blast , a fire broke out on the fourth and fifth floors of the hotel .
Why these floors and not the others ?
The official explanation did n’t make much sense .
On the other hand , according to an eyewitness report from a member of Pakistan ’s Parliament , a group of US Marines had recently visited the hotel , while Admiral Mike Mullen was there .
According to the eyewitness , all access to the hotel was closed off while the Marines unloaded steel boxes from a white US Embassy truck , bypassed both Pakistani and hotel security , and took these boxes directly to the fourth and fifth floors of the hotel — just where the fires mysteriously broke out .
Were the Marines loading the building with incendiaries ?
It certainly would n’t be the first time a building was primed by insiders for a subsequent " terrorist attack " .
I was n’t kidding in my prior post when I called the Marriot bombing " Pakistan ’s 9/11 " .
But I did n’t explain myself particularly well , either .
There ’s a long list of similarities between the two attacks , including the rush by both politicians and the media to cast the event as " an attack on democracy " , when in both cases the attacks came at critical times for governments which falsely claimed to have been legitimately elected .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari can now claim to be in an all - out war against radical Islamic terrorists , and he may even be able to build up enough " political capital " to drag his nation in a direction in which it does n’t wish to go .
As usual , the attack has been followed by a barrage of media nonsense , such as a report from the Financial Times which says men with ties to al Qaeda have been arrested in Pakistan in connection with the Marriot bombing .
Pakistani investigators yesterday said they had found new evidence of al - Qaeda ’s involvement in the suicide truck bombing of Islamabad ’s Marriott hotel .
Intelligence officials also reported the arrest of up to five militants in connection with planning attacks [… ]
According to an intelligence official , two of the five arrested men " came with conclusive evidence of close links to al - Qaeda .
Their connection to the militant group is beyond any doubt . "
Let ’s see now :
The police are arresting members of one group while another group claims responsibility .
Does this not undermine the claims of the police ?
If you were tripped up by this little bit of logic , you must be a Democrat , since according to the Republicans , the Democrats have failed to learn the lessons of September 11th , 2001 .
And the primary lesson from September 11th , of course , is that logic , evidence , and science are all past their prime .
Therefore , we do n’t use forensic evidence to solve crimes anymore ; we label the crimes acts of war , destroy the forensic evidence , and attack defenseless countries instead .
For revenge .
Or something .
If you believe that this massive bombing attack was perpetrated by a Pakistani terrorist group that the Pakistani government has never even heard of , then it ’s not much of a stretch to believe that this hitherto - unknown group must have hither to - unknown ties to al Qaeda , as well .
As the AP reported ( via the Toronto Star ) :
Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said " all roads lead to FATA " in major Pakistani suicide attacks – referring to Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where U.S. officials fear Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda No.2 Ayman al - Zawahri are hiding .
And there you have it ; it does n’t matter who did it ; it does n’t matter who claimed responsibility ; it does n’t matter why Marines were acting mysteriously ( and evading security ) in the building shortly before it was attacked ; it does n’t matter what evidence is collected during the investigation ; it does n’t even matter whether there is an investigation .
What matters is that the media and the politicians have already decided who ’s going to be blamed , and who ’s going to pay the price .
And once again — just like 9/11 — it wo n’t be the perpetrators .

President Lula held urgent meetings to discuss the reports
Brazilian intelligence chiefs have been suspended from duty amid allegations that their agency tapped the phones of top officials , politicians and judges .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ordered that the agency 's leadership be removed while an investigation into the reports was carried out .
The accusations surfaced in a news magazine at the weekend , prompting opposition calls for an inquiry .
Wiretaps are common in Brazil , but the latest reports have raised concerns .
Veja magazine alleged that senior figures , including President Lula 's chief of staff and the head of the Senate , had had their phones bugged by the intelligence agency , known as Abin .
The magazine published what it said was the transcript of a telephone conversation between the head of the Supreme Court , Gilmar Mendes , and an opposition politician , Demostenes Torres .
The agent , who was said to have provided the transcript , alleged that such illegal phone tapping was common .
Rule of law
President Lula was outraged by the reports , his spokesman said , and held urgent meetings with Mr Mendes and members of Congress .
A statement from the president 's office said Abin 's director general , Paulo Lacerda , and other top officials were being removed from their posts until an inquiry was completed .
Although it requires authorisation from a judge , phone tapping is common in Brazil , and conversations of businessmen and politicians under police investigation routinely surface in the local media , says the BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo .
But the latest reports have raised concerns over wiretaps to a new level , our correspondent adds .
" There is a complete lack of control in the state apparatus , " Mr Mendes said .
Some opposition politicians demanded a full inquiry , saying the alleged spying was an attack on Brazil 's democracy .
" The rule of law has been broken , the credibility of our democratic institutions has been damaged , " said Senator Jose Agripino of the DEM Party .

Here 's something McCain said yesterday :
" ... [ D]uring the primary [ Obama ] told a liberal advocacy group that he'd cut defense spending by tens of billions of dollars .
He promised them he would , quote , ' slow our development of future combat systems . ' "
Ooh , sounds awful .
What kind of terrorist - loving commie Muslim would slow " future combat systems ? "
It turns out that future combat systems are really , Guardian rules on capital letters aside , Future Combat System -- that is , a specific thing , a specific procurement program .
Now , guess who else said he was against funding FCS ?
Yep .
Here 's the relevant graf from the Wash Post from just a month ago , when McCain budget advisor Doug Holtz - Eakin provided detailed answers to the paper on McCain 's budget plan :
-- Balance the budget requires slowing outlay growth to 2.4 percent .
The roughly $ 470 billion dollars ( by 2013 ) in slower spending growth come from reduced deployments abroad ( $ 150 billion ; consistent with success in Iraq / Afghanistan that permits deployments to be cut by half -- hopefully more ) , slower discretionary spending in non-defense and Pentagon procurements ( $ 160 billion ; there are lots of procurements -- airborne laser , Globemaster , Future Combat System -- that should be ended and the entire Pentagon budget should be scrubbed ) and reductions in mandatory spending ( $ 160 billion ) from a mix of excessive agricultural and ethanol subsidies , slower health care cost growth , Medicaid savings from the expansion of private insurance , and other reforms .
End the FCS .
He said it .
And now , not only is he ignoring that he said it ( he and his campaign are the same thing ) , but he 's making FCS sound like the generic entire defense structure of the United States of America !
What kind of " honorable man " is this ?
Give me a break .
Think about this .
It 's just a deliberate and cunning lie .
Add the plural " s " so it sounds like Obama wants to weaken America 's defenses , and carry on with the laughter and forgetting .
Can people really just lie so blatantly and never be called on it ?
I guess we 're finding out .
You'd think the press would at some point get a little peeved about all this .
It 's that time of year again .
Yep , the big release season is upon us , which means we 'll be buried in games faster than our wallets can refill themselves .
Time to take advantage of those credit card offers we keep getting in the mail ...
From Resistance 2 to LittleBigPlanet to SOCOM : Confrontation to MotorStorm : Pacific Rift to Fallout 3 and much , much more , there 's a major release that will interest pretty much anyone with a pulse .
But with so many games to choose from , what should you be keeping an eye out for ?
That 's where we come in .
What you 'll find here are the biggest of the big , the best of the best ( from what we 've seen at least ) to hit stores shelves over the next few months .

What to Expect : What to expect ?
The same thing you 've been expecting since skipping over the 360 and PC versions of the game after they won all those Game of the Year awards : an awesome , immersive , cinematic , creepy , thrilling , objectivist tale of dystopian woe .
Now , granted , all that waiting will certainly pay off in the form of new , exclusive ( at least for now ) content burned onto that Blu-ray disc in addition to all the other content that won all those awards , but if you miss out on things this time ... well , we do n't know if we can be friends anymore .
Far more than just a simple first - person shooter , BioShock takes everything that made original developers Irrational Games ' System Shock
September 23rd First - Person Shooter
What to Expect : The Brothers in Arms games have been giving us a different perspective on the normally tired World War II genre for a while now , first introducing us to Matt Baker in Road to Hill 30 and Joe Hartsock in Earned in Blood and then slowly expanding the theatre of war to include actual historical battles .
In the case of Hell 's Highway , that 's painting a semi-accurate picture of the events of Operation Market Garden .
Hell 's Highway is n't just a next - gen version of the previous games , however ; significant attention has been paid to making the gulf between the games and the Band of Brothers mini-series that much smaller , with a heavier cinematic presentation and even more story details .
For those keeping track , that makes the third proper Brothers in Arms game far more movie - like than previous efforts , and this extends to just about all parts of the game , right down to finally being able to draw a bead on someone and squeeze off a shot without just making them a little freaked out .
Hooray for progress !
November 11th First - Person Shooter
What to Expect : Okay , enough about World War II games being tired ( and yes , we 're delightfully hypocritical considering we literally just complained about it while talking about that last game ) , poor Treyarch has heard it for years now , and they think they can do a different World War II game -- if only for the last time .
What 's so different this time around ?
Plenty .
For starters , the well - traveled battlefields of Europe are going to be taking something of a back seat to one of the less - told parts of The Big One : the Pacific Theatre .
It 's bigger than it sounds ; ditching bombed - out burgs and toppled world capitals for the closer - to - home repercussions of Pearl Harbor means a change of scenery ( at least partially -- you 'll still be playing as the Russians ) , but it also means the venerable Quake 3 engine will keep on getting tweaked and enhanced .
The very same core engine for Call of Duty 4 here returns for overseas duty , and with some tweaks to make it even fancier , a full online co-op campaign and offering new weapons like the flamethrower , World War II may still have a few more stories to tell just yet .
McCain seems confused by questions about Spain in radio interview Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Thursday September 18 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Noncommittal stance toward meeting contradicts previous McCain vow to host Spanish PM Does John McCain know where Spain is , or who leads the country ?
The Republican presidential nominee 's responses in a recent interview with a Spanish language radio station suggest the answer to those questions might in fact be no .
Either that or the 72 - year - old candidate became confused after a series of questions about Latin America , or he was simply snubbing a US ally that decided to end its involvement in the Iraq war .
During an interview with Radio Caracol Miami conducted Wednesday , McCain was asked whether he would invite Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House .
McCain 's noncommittal answer seemed to suggest that he did not know who Zapatero was , as he immediately pivoted to talking about Mexico then referred to his commitment to Latin America .
" I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion , " McCain said , before moving on to praise Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's fight against drug cartels .
( A clip and transcript of the interview segment in question and full transcript is reproduced below . )
He was asked twice more specifically about Zapatero .
After fumbling a bit , McCain returned to his talking points ; the only problem was he was using talking points about the wrong continent .
" All I can tell you is I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us and standing up to those who are not , " he said .
" And that 's judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America and the entire region . "
At that point , the interviewer reminded McCain that she was talking about a completely different region of the world .
The candidate seemed to grow agitated and stuck to his script .
INTERVIEWER : OK , what about Europe ?
I 'm talking about the president of Spain .
McCAIN : What about me what ?
INTERVIEWER : Ok , are you willing to meet with him if you are elected president ?
McCAIN : I am willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights , democracy and freedom , and I will stand up to those who are not .
The interview was conducted entirely in English and translated for Radio Caracol 's listeners .
McCain could have been thrown off by the interviewer 's accent , though .
For example , when she asked , " What about Europe ? " it sounded a bit like , " What about you ? "
The Spanish press and liberal bloggers began calling attention to the gaffe beginning Wednesday night .
" In Spain , there seem to be two lines of thinking .
The great majority appear to think the McCain was simply confused and did n't know who Zapatero was -- something you might bone up on if you were about to do an interview with the Spanish press , " wrote Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall , who broke the story .
" The assumption seems to be that since he 'd already been asked about Castro and Chavez that McCain assumed Zapatero must be some other Latin American bad guy . "
Time magazine was the first traditional media outlet to pick up the story , and as of mid-morning Thursday it appeared that only The Washington Post has joined them .
McCain 's camp is arguing that he knew exactly whom he was talking about during the interview and was simply sticking to the Bush administration 's policy toward Zapatero 's government .
After taking office in April 2004 , Zapatero immediately pulled Spain 's troops out of Iraq ; he has never met with President Bush .
McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Sheunemann argued to Post that McCain 's answer was intentional .
" The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain 's willingness to meet Zapatero ( and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred ) .
Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview , " he said in an e-mail .
Update :
If McCain did indeed mean to take such a chilly and non-committal stance on meeting the Spanish leader , he contradicted a promise made to another reporter just three months ago .
America blog 's John Aravosis translated parts of a June interview McCain did with El Pais in June .
" I would like President Zapatero to visit the United States , " McCain told the Spanish newspaper , according to the translation .
" I am very interested , not only in normalizing relations with Spain , but in developing good and productive relations that address the many issues and challenges that we need to be addressing together . "
Now , McCain 's camp could quibble with the precise wording -- he never explicitly said " White House " to El Pais -- but the previous interview seems to suggest only three possible explanations .
Either McCain became confused toward the end of a 10 minute radio interview , his adviser was lying about his noncommittal answer , or the GOP candidate decided to flip - flop on the fly about how he would deal with a fellow NATO member and ally in the war on terror .

TRANSCRIPT
INTERVIEWER : Senator finally , let 's talk about Spain .
If elected president would you be willing to invite President Jose Rodriguez Louis Zapatero to the White House , to meet with you ?
McCAIN : I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion .
And by the way President Calderone of Mexico is fighting a very , very tough fight against the drug cartels .
I 'm glad we are now working with the Mexican government on the Merida Plan , and I intend to move forward with relations and invite as many of them as I can , of those leaders to the White House .
INTERVIEWER : Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government ?
To the president himself ?
McCAIN : Uh , I do n't , I , ya know , I , honestly , I have to look at the situations and the relations and the priorities .
But I can assure you , I will establish closer relations with our friends and I will stand up to those who want to do harm to the United States of America .
INTERVIEWER :
So you have to wait and see .
If he 's willing to meet with you , would you be able to do it ?
In the White House ?
McCAIN : Well , again , I do n't --
All I can tell you is I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us and standing up to those who are not .
And that 's judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America and the entire region .
INTERVIEWER : OK , what about Europe ?
I 'm talking about the president of Spain .
McCAIN : What about me what ?
INTERVIEWER : OK .
Are you willing to meet with him if you are elected president ?
McCAIN : I am willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights , democracy and freedom , and I will stand up to those who are not .
The gold medalist says not all Olympians dine like Michael Phelps
Michael Phelps may fuel his body with 12,000 calories a day – think fried egg sandwiches , chocolate chip pancakes , omelets and French toast for breakfast alone – but not all Olympians get to indulge their cravings .
“ Gymnasts eat totally different , ” gold medalist Nastia Liukin told PEOPLE at Badgley Mischka ’s Spring 2009 fashion show Sept. 12 in New York City .
In fact , she says her daily intake may be closer to 1,200 calories than 12,000 .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
A typical breakfast is “ eggs or yogurt or oatmeal , ” said Liukin , 18 , who took the gold for the individual all - around in Beijing .
“ Then for lunch I ’ll have a salad with chicken or fish or some sort of protein and then for dinner I keep it really light with probably just a piece of fish and vegetables . ”
That lean combo is just enough “ to keep me energized , ” she said , “ but I do have a few power bars before my practices . ”
So how has life changed since Beijing ?
Getting photographed all the time , “ is really different , ” said Liukin , who hit three shows during New York ’s fashion week , possibly gathering inspiration for the line of gymnastics leotards she is designing .

If you are a writer , I ’m sure you have faced situations when your mind seems to go blank and you just do n’t know what to write .
Every writer or blogger , amateur or professional , encounters this situation every once in a while .
This situation is termed as writer ’s block and if the writer is not able to get over it quickly , it could easily strip motivation and become very frustrating .
Writer ’s block is basically a polished term for a lack of ideas .
If you do n’t obtain ideas , you simply can’t write .
Keeping this in mind , I ’ve decided to list 15 ways to get those elusive ideas and capture them .
I ’m sure after reading this article you ’ll have enough ways to come up with new ideas that get turned into great articles .
Your Computer
Yeah , your very own computer which has been begging for attention ever since you purchased an iPhone .
It wants you to go offline and explore it .
It has so much of stuff , ranging from documents , pictures , ebooks , presentations and so much more to get you the ideas for your writing .
Your Bookmarks
We all have a habit of bookmarking nice sites that we come across and building a long list of bookmarks that are never revisited .
So whether you ’ve got your bookmarks in your browser or in your online accounts like Delicious , this is the time to check them out .
Social Media Accounts
If you love digging , stumbling , redditing , sphinning and mixxing , now is the time to stop and go back and check the stuff that you ’ve stumbled , dugg or reddited .
Just dive down deep into your social stuff and you ’ll be amazed to find the wealth of information present there .
RSS Reader
Personally , Google Reader has been the best source of ideas for me so far .
One of the reasons behind that is I subscribe to tons of RSS feeds and also manage them in a way that I can extract relevant information from them easily .
I think if you can manage RSS , it could be a great source of ideas for you too .
Newspapers And Magazines
Yep , old media to the rescue .
Your daily newspaper and weekly magazines are a never ending source of ideas .
Odds are you have been neglecting them so consider reading something that is not digital for once !
Reader Comments
If you facilitate user interactions on your blog through comments , those could be a great source of ideas too .
Many readers love to leave elaborate and engaging comments which could easily spark an idea for a new article on that subject .
Flickr And YouTube
Apart from being popular sites for entertainment ( pictures and videos ) , Flickr and YouTube can be wonderful source of ideas too .
In the past many of my articles have been inspired from videos that I have watched on YouTube , especially some tutorial videos on tech related stuff .
Similarly , an image on Flickr could inspire you to write your next article .
Books
Yeah , I know this is a no - brainer .
Then why are you procrastinating ?.. Just go ahead , wipe the dust off your bookshelf and start reading ! 🙂
Chat And Twitter
Conversations spark ideas which later convert into great posts .
So why not start chatting with your friend on IM or phone and ask him for some advice .
Also , twitter is another good source of carrying out such conversations and extracting ideas out of it .
Old Emails
Gmail tells me that they have given me enough space and I do n’t need to delete any email .
I trust them and hence I have tons of emails which I ’ve already read in my inbox .
These prove to be an unconventional source of ideas in crisis situations .
Television
You may have ditched your old friend for the world wide web , but it still is a huge resource for all kinds of stuff which you ’d love to watch .
While watching you might get something going on in your mind .
Forums
Participating in discussions in forums , especially the ones which relate to your line of work could be a good exercise to get the ideas flowing .
Podcasts
Listen to some podcasts .
When your mind does n’t want to work , hearing others speak could give it the push and it could start churning out new ideas for you .
Your Surroundings
Your surroundings could prove to be a nice resource for generating ideas .
For example , I was facing problems due to the clutter on my desk and hence decided to clean up my home office .
And while doing that , I came up with idea to write the post – 10 Steps To Rejuvenate Your Messy Home - Office .
Brainstorming And Mind mapping
Finally , you can brainstorm and do some mind mapping to get new ideas .
Sit down and think .
Check the articles which you ’ve written .
Brainstorm those topics and see if you can come up with something new .
I ’m sure the creative juices will start flowing sooner or later .
Cheers ,
Abhijeet
Whether it's a slender poplar , a gnarled bristlecone pine , or a sturdy oak , wildly different trees have one thing in common :
Their branches tend to snap when lashed by winds of a certain speed , new research suggests .
It turns out that many of the trees ' characteristics , such as wood softness or size , tend to counteract each other , the researchers found .
While a bigger tree has a more robust trunk to withstand wind forces , " a high tree undergoes larger aerodynamical forces due to its larger exposure to the wind and it has statistically bigger defects and thus a higher chance to break . "
The pros and cons of bigger and smaller trees tend to nearly cancel each other out , the researchers found . "
[ Check Out the Tallest Trees on Earth ]
Breaking wood
Centuries ago , Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo tried to quantify how well wooden beams would resist bending .
They came up with scaling relationships showing that the critical force required to bend and snap a beam rose exponentially with the diameter of the beam , and fell with the length of the beam .
Yet da Vinci , Galileo and later scientists disagreed about just how much the diameter of the beam affected the critical force required to snap it .
Though science eventually settled on a straightforward relationship , the reason for the discrepancy in these early experiments was never fully resolved .
But in January 2009 , wide swaths of France experienced the wrath of a huge storm called " Klaus , " which uprooted nearly 210 million cubic feet ( 6 million cubic meters ) of wood .
Researchers mapping tree damage noticed that the top wind speed in an area correlated strongly with how many trees were broken — whether they were uprooted or snapped like matchsticks .
Interestingly , both hardwood trees , such as oaks , and softwood pine trees , seemed to be equally affected .
Defects and size effects
Emmanuel Virot , a doctoral candidate in mechanics at the École Polytechnique in Paris , and his colleagues wondered why harder trees did n't fare better .
First , they weighted one end of rods made from beech wood and from graphite with buckets of water , determining just how much weight was required to curve rods of different materials , lengths and diameters .
Interestingly , they found a discrepancy between their numbers and those predicted by Hooke 's law , which relates the force applied to a springy object with its deformation .
They wondered whether the discrepancy occurred because they had n't accounted for stress inside the wood .
" Wood rods have knurls and pencil leads [ or the graphite rods ] have cracks that lower the resistance to breakage , " the researchers wrote in the paper , which was published Feb. 3 in the journal Physical Review E .
They realized trees would inevitably have knots and other types of imperfections as well .
So they referred to other work , which showed that in large enough hunks of material , the number of imperfections in that material rises with the square root of the material diameter .
Next , they wanted to see how a uniform wind speed , which hits all parts of a tree trunk equally , would affect their calculations ( weighting just one end of a rod does n't realistically capture what it 's like to be in stormy weather ) .
When they crunched their numbers , they found that the critical wind speed needed to snap a tree was a factor of the wood strength , air density , tree shape and tree diameter and length .
Canceling out
Interestingly , however , all these factors only had a slight effect on the critical wind speed , and tended to cancel each other out .
For instance , trees with bigger , heftier trunks tend to have more internal flaws and also have more surface area exposed ot the wind .
The end result was that most trees tended to snap when winds reached about 94 miles per hour ( 151 kilometers per hour ) .
The findings could have implications for protecting forests in a world with a rapidly changing climate , the researchers wrote in the article .
" Even if this work suggests that the forest damage hardly depends on the tree characteristics , the model in the study gives some clues to design more resistant forests , which might help to face the doubling of frequency of extreme storms expected by the end of the 21st century , " the researchers said in a statement .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - The U.S. current account deficit widened to $ 183.1 billion in the second quarter , or 5.1 % of gross domestic product , the Commerce Department reported Wednesday .
The increase in the deficit was accounted for by a decrease in the surplus on income and an increase in the deficit on goods .
Read the full report .
The current account is the broadest measure of international flows of goods , services and capital in and out of the United States .
In essence , the current account deficit measures how much Americans need to borrow from or sell to foreigners to fund their consumption and investment .
The figures are not adjusted for price changes .
The current account deficit has narrowed in the past year , largely because imports have fallen and exports have increased as the dollar weakened .
It was as high as 6.6 % of GDP a year ago .
The dollar depreciated 2 % in the second quarter against seven major currencies .
Few economists believe a current account deficit of 5 % of GDP is sustainable .
Global economic policymakers have said the U.S. current account deficit ( and corresponding surpluses in China and elsewhere ) represent a major threat to global growth .
In a separate report , the Commerce Department said housing building weakened again in August , with permits for single - family homes falling to a 26 - year low .
See full story .
Quarterly details of current account
The deficit on goods and services trade increased to $ 180.6 billion from $ 177.1 billion .
The deficit on goods trade rose to $ 216.3 billion from $ 211 billion .
The surplus on services trade increased to $ 35.8 billion from $ 33.9 billion .
The trade figures had been reported earlier in monthly reports .
The surplus on income decreased to $ 27.3 billion from $ 33.2 billion .
U.S. investment income from assets owned abroad fell to $ 194.1 billion from $ 199.1 billion .
Foreign investment income from assets owned in the United States rose to $ 165 billion from $ 164.1 billion .
Net financial inflows dropped to $ 136.7 billion in the second quarter from $ 190.4 billion as acquisitions of U.S. financial assets by foreigners fell sharply .
Foreign acquisitions of U.S. assets increased by $ 26.3 billion after $ 459 billion in the second quarter .
Foreign direct investment in the United States increased $ 93.8 billion compared with an increase of $ 80.4 billion in the previous quarter .
U.S. acquisitions of foreign assets decreased by $ 110.4 billion after increasing by $ 260.6 billion in the third quarter .
The emotion on the floor of Mile High Stadium was like a tidal wave .
When the Black Eyed Peas took the stage for a live version of Obama 's " Yes We Can " speech set to music , including the great line " There is nothing false about hope , ' followed by the recorded voice of MLK giving his " I Have a Dream " speech , I looked around to see two African American women in the Wisconsin delegation in tears .
" Our country should be proud of itself today .
That 's all I have to say , " said Paulette Dorsey of Milwaukee .
Hope was more than a campaign slogan , as delegates hugged and celebrated .
In the Louisiana delegation , Elsie Burkhalter , a superdelegate from Slidell , who had just moved out of a FEMA trailer two weeks before the convention was so hopeful and optimistic , despite losing everything , it was moving .
Even as we spoke , another storm was closing in .
" My community - - I do n't know how we could withstand another storm , " she said .
" There are so many people left in FEMA trailers . "
Bukhalter was disgusted by the Bush Administration 's mishandling of Katrina , yet somehow feeling positive about the future anyway .
As a history and government teacher , she said that after Katrina , " the first thing I thought was someone needs to give George Bush a history lesson on the Berlin Airlift .
They could have gotten food and water to people . "
" And they called us refugees !
We 're not refugees .
We 're evacuees .
We give our sweat and blood to build these communities where we live .
When they called us refugees , that was an insult . "
But the Obama campaign has lifted her up .
" His campaign inspires me and many of the young people I taught who are now adults . "
More than that , she is inspired by the tremendous youth energy she sees in both the campaign and in the rebuilding effort after Katrina .
Burkhalter is the chair of the University of Louisiana system .
" My students in eight universities volunteered in the rebuilding of the 9th Ward .
They are out there and they are involved .
They felt this urgent need to do community service . "
" " They did everything they could .
Students and young people came from across the country to nail and paint and hang sheetrock . "
Obama , she says , has tapped into that same positive energy .
" Young people will decide the election , " said Burkhalter .
" I think it 's going to be a surprise to the nation how young people are going to unite .
They 're out there for Barack .
I 'm proud of them .
They 're our leaders .
They 're leading us . "
As we finished talking Sheryl Crow was singing " I Can See Clearly Now , " and the delegates ' energy was tremendous .
The lack of cynicism , and the feeling of possibility were contagious .
Even the anchors up in the CBS sound stages were dancing , When Stevie Wonder came out and played " Signed , Sealed , Delivered " the Ohio delegation came to life .
A cheer went up as the oldest member of the delegation , 85 - year - old Ruby Gilliam started dancing in the aisle .
" What are you thinking right now ? " I asked her .
" I 'm thinking what a great time we 're having and what a great time we 're going to have , " she replied , beaming .
" This is my seventh convention and this is the greatest one .
History is being made . "
Gilliam , the county chair of Carroll County in Ohio , was a HIllary delegate .
" But I 'm with Barack all the way , " she said .
As hard as life can be for many Americans , and even many of the delegates here , having a big party , an outpouring of emotion and a celebration of hope , seemed like a great idea .
Still , after the uplift of the 2004 convention , where Obama and Edwards gave their great , hopeful speeches and the Democrats went on to lose the election , one hesitates to give way to emotion .
There were a few skeptics on the floor .
Al Gore came out to a thunderous ovation and gave what I thought was a very good speech .
But when he got to the part where he was comparing Obama to Abraham Lincoln - -" known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice , " a young , African - American Georgia delegate sitting next to me groaned .
" Oh , come on , " she said .
" He always talks too long !
One bad election and he goes on and on -- blah , blah , blah . "
I was surprised , since I thought he was making a winning point .
The delegate , it turned out , was demographer Bernita Smith , who worked on voter targeting for the Hillary campaign .
She like Hillary , she said , because of all the candidates who came to the DNC 's winter meeting in 2007 , she was by far the smartest in the room .
" I look at it like , are we reaching the right groups we need to reach to win , and how do we get to that ? " she said .
She rode out to the convention all the way from Atlanta with a group of other Hillary delegates in an RV they called " the unity express . "
The youth vote will probably be large for Obama , she said .
But 'we have to swing back and get all those older people to embrace the campaign . "
" We need to win .
Right now we do n't have time to be in a cult of personality .
It 's about the hard work .
It 's about stating our position and getting to people we have n't reached yet . "
Most of all , Obama 's task is to convert the white , working class voters who did n't chose him in the primary .
I sat next to one such voter --a HIllary delegate from the industrial Miidwest , William Cobb , a machinist from Kenosha , Wisconsin .
Cobb 's story , which he told reluctantly , because , he explained , " I'm of a generation where you do n't like to talk about these things , " was the hard luck story the Democrats highlighted throughout the convention .
" For 25 years I had a good paying factory job with all the benefits , " he said .
" in 2004 , days after the election , my job was eliminated .
At that time I 'm 60 years old .
Nobody is going to hire a 60 - year - old at a good paying job . "
Cobb had been delivering pizzas a few hours a week for some extra money .
After he was laid off , he had to ask for more hours at Pizza Hut .
" That plus my Social Security pays the bills , " he said .
Fortunately his house was paid off .
Cobb was for Hillary , who he felt was a real fighter and could win .
During Obama 's speech he listened intently and softly concurred " Uh huh , " " mmhm " " yes . "
When Obama said that the " ownership society " the Republicans like to talk about really means " You 're on your own , " and then detailed how people are left on their own without health insurance , good jobs , and help pulling themselves up by their bootstraps , Cobb said , " That 's me ! "
The job Obama has in front of him is daunting .
How does he convince a historically racist society , and one riven by economic insecurity , to elect him ?
On the closing night of the convention he did exactly what the critics said he needed to do : laying out a specific platform that appeals to working class voters , and taking a few hard swipes at McCain along the way .
He paused over McCain adviser Phil Graham 's comments about a " mental recession , " and , especially , " a nation of whiners . "
" Tell that to the Michigan plant autoworkers . . .
Tell it to the military families who watch their loved ones leave for a third , fourth , fifth tour .
. . .
These are n't whiners .
They work hard and keep going , without complaint . "
He connected his humble family background , the themes of hard work and middle class struggle , and the incompetent and unjust Republican program very effectively .
There was a lot of red meat and a few specific proposals to chew on .
He hit back on the Republican attacks .
" I 've got news for you John McCain .
We all put our country first . "
He took an important step .
" I think he nailed everything , " said Cobb afterwards , as the country western music was playing .
That 's what he needs to do .

Kate Moss paired her short shorts with a fur coat on Tuesday when she and a friend picked up an armload of magazines in London .
She 's often the cover girl herself , and it's not like Kate needs to brush up on her fashion knowledge since she 's already been named a British Style Genius .
Her cameo on the UK show aired earlier this week , and Fashionologie has a special peek at the Kate highlights , including one of her meetings with the designers at Topshop .
It 's a rare glimpse at seeing and hearing Kate in action , and it 's fun to see how giggly and excited she is about working on her line .

Ok , I ’m a little early .
In one month on Halloween eve , JDK 1.4 will officially enter End of Service Life ( EOSL ) as part of the Sun end of life policy .
JDK 1.4 was born in February of 2002 and has lived a long and successful life , probably one of the longest - lived and most widely - used Java releases to date due to fear of JDK 1.5 .
Remember February 2002 ?
9/11 was still fresh and raw .
Winter Olympics were happening in Utah .
The Rams were narrowly defeated by the Patriots in the Super Bowl .
And of course JDK 1.4 was released .
As far as Java upgrades go , it was in the fast and easy upgrade camp .
Some new and useful features ( assert , regex , NIO , exception chaining ) and some dogs ( java logging ) .
Other than the new assert keyword , most code ported up just fine .
So , what does EOSL mean exactly ?
Honestly , that ’s not precisely clear to me , but based on the rest of the policy , it seems to me like free support and updates stop .
You can of course buy “ retirement support ” for the Java SE for Business release program and that is available for another 10 years .
If you look at what ’s available for JDK 1.3 ( obviously well into an end of life program that ’s defined a little differently ) , you can see that there were new patch revs of JDK 1.3 released this year and last with updated time zone rules , so they still seem to be doing that .
But presumably no bug fixes or other work is going into this release .
Based on my poll earlier this summer , there are still a lot of people using JDK 1.4 in production .
I ’m not sure how widely known it is that official free support for JDK 1.4 is at an end .
You may also have caught that next year on Halloween , JDK 1.5 enters EOSL !
Start your planning now …
From guitar faces to the different kinds of axes , here is the Top 10 Greatest Guitar Players .
Squeezing the talent that ’s blessed our ears for all these years into a list of 10 is just as difficult as choosing which limbs to lose or keep .
The list is by no means definitive , but it ’s an accurate representation for the uniqueness of the music the guitarist has made .
In short , these famous guitar players have played the melodies that have made grown men cry , and probably gave you a taste of how your guitar face would look like pretending to play that solo .
Of course many great guitarists may not have made this top 10 list , but feel free to add your own favorites in the comments .
10 . Tom Morello
The guitar player who makes his guitar sound anything but a guitar .
Helicopter rudders , disc scratching , and his use of the kill switch for staccato like guitar riffs has made him probably the most innovative guitar player of our time .
He is a guitarist who can take feedback , and ground hum from his own body into coherent music .
Be it Rage Against The Machine , or Audioslave you can always see Morello ’s signature licks shining through .
9. John Mayer
Whoa whoa wait , what ?
This pop artist ?
A guitar player ?
If all you ’ve ever heard from Mayer is Your Body Is Wonderland , or Daughters , then you ’ve got to give his album Continuum a listen to .
He is no Shakespeare
, but his guitar playing speaks to your soul .
His songs will make most glorified tough guys miss their old girlfriend , and the rest just go to a corner and cry .
If you think that his songs are all too depressing , then watch some videos of him playing .
His guitar face is priceless .
8. Jack White
Mr. White is an incredibly underrated guitarist .
His singles ( From the White Stripes ) always span with just three to four chords and his simplistic blues rhythm and picking styles have him overlooked most of the time .
However , his masterful use of the Digitech Whammy and is erratic playing make for some of the most memorable guitar solos ever .
Check out Ball and a Biscuit and try not to like that solo .
One of my favorite Jack White moments was during the 2004 Grammys , where he took 7 Nation Army and went into a cover of Son House ’s Death Letter ( another artist who I had to unwillingly cut out of the list ) .
In an awards show celebrating Justin Timberlake and Missy Eliot , Jack
White took time to give a salute to where things got started , to an artist born a century ago .
7. Jimmy Page
Admit it .
You ’ve slow danced to Stairway To Heaven before .
Page ’s playing have influenced so many guitar players of today , and Led Zeppelin revolutionized Rock and Roll blending acoustic guitars , banjos , and mandolins while still staying with the same gritty rock image .
His guitar riffs are forever etched into Rock and Roll ’s hall of fame .
How influential was he ?
Step into a guitar store , and you ’ll see .
Thousands of 12 year old kids across the globe are playing the intro to Stairway .
Now that ’s how you know you ’ve made it .
6. BB King
Yeah .
He may have to sit down when he plays , but he ’ll have you on your feet when he does .
BB ’s creamy yet piercing tone , his unique vibrato and his absolute flawless ability to express his emotions through the guitar earn him a spot in the top ten .
King ’s years of fame have n’t gone to his head .
He is still as humble as ever giving front row seat tickets to fans waiting in a cold parking lot just to have a glimpse of him .
BB King ca n’t play chords .
Nor does he sing and play at the same time .
But he has worldwide recognition of his accomplishments as an artist .
That ’s a mark of a truly great guitarist .
5. David Gilmour
Gilmour was made famous by his haunting guitar scores in Pink Floyd .
This “ replacement ” guitarist surpassed expectations and helped shape Pink Floyd ’s unique sound .
You can always expect hairs at the back of your neck to stand whenever you hear one of his solos – be it for the first or hundredth time you ’re listening to it .
All the emotion that Gilmour ’s poured into his guitar work lives on in the music and is channeled through anyone who ’s ever wanted to cover a Pink Floyd song .
I know several guitar players ( myself included ) who whenever playing the Comfortably Numb solo – whether they are alone in their bedrooms or on stage – have always been unwillingly brought to tears , near the point of crying .
How could you not expect things to get esoteric and mystical when it comes to music ?
4. John Frusciante
Let ’s get it straight .
Froo – Shawn – Tey .
If you do n’t know him , he ’s the lead guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Frusciante is the author of the brilliant chord progression on Under the Bridge , the haunting intro to Californication and the simplistic solo and riff on Otherside .
If you ’re the casual listener of the Chili Peppers , then you may wonder why John has made it so far up this list .
But a tad of a closer look will reveal that his simple catchy riffs are the tip of the ice berg .
One can catch a glimpse at his technical skill in the Dani California solo .
A bit deeper and you ’ll run into Lyon 06.06.06 in one of the B Sides .
John takes his influences ( Page , Hendrix ) and mixes his own nuances into a sound that ’s pleasantly different , but melodically having the same effects on you .
A track to look out for on his solo work – Ramparts – showcasing four or so guitars layered upon each other in an introspective orchestra .
3. Stevie Ray Vaughan
Now if this house is rocking , do n’t bother knockin .
Famous words by Stevie .
Many people perhaps know him for Hendrix covers , but where Jimi left off Stevie continued , and continued he did .
The elements of Hendrix were alive and plain to see in SRV , but with it , he also mixed in his own influences such as Albert King and his own soul to make it his sound a trademark spot on his songs .
I vaguely remember a car commercial where I spotted Stevie ’s playing ( Pride and Joy ) in a Nissan ad .
That was much before I really got into Vaughan ’s work .
SRV was an artist who could play while absolutely stoned face .
And when he did sober up , he actually played better .
His newfound health and love for life and music are showcased on In Step his last album before his death a year later .
Stevie ’s footprints will always be in the air and in our hearts .
2. Jimi Hendrix
Hendrix was known for a lot of things .
The beautiful chord embellishments on Little Wing , the grit of the solo in Voodoo Child screaming off of his strat pickups , his cover of the Dylan song All Along The Watchtower , and the backwards solo in Castles Made of Sand , but known as a great innovative guitar player over and over again .
His short but explosive career influenced numerous artists for many years past his death and continues to influence musicians today .
To make such a difference in such a short amount of time truly earns Jimi a spot as number two .
But … then you may ask , “ Who is deserving of number one ? ! ”
1. Robert Johnson
Bobby
Jo is number one on this list .
Every artist has unknowingly been influenced by him .
Starting in the Mississippi Delta , Johnson ’s life is rife with myths , and allegory .
His deal with the devil and death are full of folklore and mysticism , and it only adds to his haunting voice and groundbreaking guitar playing .
His songs are just a pure expression of emotion with no bars held .
He led the groundwork for early blues to be filled in and worked upon by all the artists on this list .
He also worked on breaking down social barriers .
A black man in the early 20th century was not exactly the best place to be .
But his music was to add interest by white musicians and help the civil movements of the sixties .
Politically or musically , Robert Johnson is deserving of number one on this list .

The rapid rise in tuberculosis cases in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is strongly associated with the receipt of loans from the International Monetary Fund , a new study has found .
Critics of the fund have suggested that its financial requirements lead governments to reduce spending on health care to qualify for loans .
This , the authors say , helps explain the connection .
The fund strongly disputes the finding , saying the former communist countries would be much worse off without the loans .
“ Tuberculosis is a disease that takes time to develop , ” said William Murray , a spokesman for the fund , “ so presumably the increase in mortality rates must be linked to something that happened earlier than I.M.F. funding .
This is just phony science . ”

By this time in the 2004 election , John Kerry was already drowning in attack ads hurled at him from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
But this year , outside groups funded by millionaires or billionaires have been relatively dormant — thus far .
As Election Day approaches such outfits are gearing up , and they appear to be biding their time until the final days of the campaign , when they can inflict the most damage .
One of those groups is American Issues Project ( AIP ) , which has been funded almost entirely by a single Texas billionaire and involves many of the leading players from the Swift Boat campaign .
In August , it aired an ad attempting to highlight ties between Barack Obama and William Ayers , the 1960s radical who participated in at least several domestic bombings .
The ad did n’t land with Swift Boat - like power , but it signaled the opening salvo of what could be a nasty conclusion to this year ’s campaign .
The man behind AIP , Tony Feather , could become one of the most significant players in the election .
Feather , a longtime Republican operative , is not a household name and he rarely talks to the media .
But his specialty — mounting stealth political advocacy campaigns — has played an outsized role in the last two presidential elections .
Should Obama end up confronting a Swift Boat - style fusillade in the closing weeks of this campaign , the odds are that Feather will be one of the ops responsible for the onslaught .
A former executive director of the Missouri Republican Party , Feather is known for his fierce campaign tactics on behalf of candidates like John Ashcroft and former Missouri Attorney General Bill Webster .
Feather ran Webster ’s 1992 campaign for governor ; Webster not only lost but went to prison on charges related to misusing his office for campaign purposes .
Feather is also a compatriot of Karl Rove , whom he first met in 1974 .
The two are close enough that Rove at one point endorsed Feather ’s consulting firm on its website .
Politics has also made Feather a rich man .
He started a handful of companies that specialize in “ microtargeting ” voters with direct mail , phone , and grassroots lobbying for GOP campaigns and big corporate clients .
One of his companies sets up fake grassroots groups to give the appearance of public support for corporate legislative efforts .
In 1999 , Feather founded Feather Larson Synhorst with another GOP operative , Tom Synhorst , who is sometimes referred to as the “ Johnny Appleseed of Astroturf . ”
FLS is responsible for many of those annoying robo-calls to voters that arrive during the days leading up to elections .
The firm and its related entities , including the lobbying shop DCI Group , were among the biggest recipients of Republican National Committee money in 2004 election cycle and raked in nearly $ 27 million from Republican Party entities and candidates , including Bush ’s reelection campaign .
Another one of Feather ’s companies , FLS - Connect , has a virtual monopoly on campaign phone work for the GOP , having worked for the state Republican parties in all 50 states , according to the company ’s website .
In the past year , the RNC has paid FLS - Connect more than $ 9 million for its services .
Since 2007 , Feather ’s firms have earned more than $ 16 million from Republican Party entities , candidates , or affiliated interest groups like the National Rifle Association , according to CQ Moneyline .
In June McCain Victory 2008 , a PAC run by the RNC and a handful of state Republican committees , paid FLS - Connect $ 4,000 to provide “ telemarketing ” services .
Feather was the political director of the Bush / Cheney 2000 campaign , and was central to Republican efforts to get around new campaign finance laws banning soft money donations to the national parties .
In 2001 , Feather founded Progress for America , a nonprofit group that served as the de facto political arm of the Bush White House on everything from Social Security privatization to judicial nominees .
In 2003 , Feather stepped down from the group to work for the Bush campaign , but PFA lived on , spinning off a 527 group , the PFA Voter Fund , to spend unregulated money directly influence the 2004 election .
In the five months leading up to the 2004 election , PFA - VF raised $ 45 million , ostensibly to compete with liberal 527 groups that rose up in the wake of campaign finance legislation banning soft money contributions to political parties .
Seventy percent of the group ’s money came from just 13 donors , including Dawn Arnall , the chairman of Ameriquest , the now defunct predatory mortgage lender .
During the 2004 campaign , PFA - VF spent its millions on TV ads in most battleground states supporting President Bush or bashing John Kerry .
PFA -VA employed some of the best creative talent in the campaign business , including Larry McCarthy , who produced the famous Willie Horton ad in 1988 .
Its ads mirrored the themes of the Bush campaign .
One ad featured Kerry windsurfing ( the flip - flopping ad ) .
Most notable , though , was n’t an attack ad but one devastatingly effective clip known as “ Ashley ’s Story , ” a dewy tear - jerker featuring Bush hugging the daughter of a 9/11 victim .
Federal law bars 527 - groups from coordinating election activities with political campaigns , but PFA had several documented close ties to the Bush campaign .
For example , Benjamin Ginsburg , the outside counsel for Bush / Cheney 2004 , was also chief legal counsel to PFA .
In February 2007 , the Federal Elections Commission levied its third - largest civil penalty ever against PFA - VF for violating federal campaign finance laws .
The group agreed to pay $ 750,000 for failing to register as a political committee , raising money from prohibited sources and in amounts above legal limits .
After the 2004 election , PFA continued to push the Bush agenda , getting involved in fights over judicial nominations and in the battle to replace Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the Supreme Court .
The group also ran a series of controversial national ads linking the war in Iraq to the attacks of September 11 .
But the group has since gone dormant and its website has disappeared .
Last year , Feather went to work as a political advisor to Mitt Romney ’s presidential campaign , which did n’t get far .
But his American Issues Project has raised millions of dollars , mostly from a single donor , Dallas businessman Harold Simmons , a pioneer in leveraged buyouts who also invested serious cash in the Swift Boat campaign , according to the Washington Post .
AIP is staffed by people who have demonstrated their ability to drop a big bomb during elections .
Among them is Chris LaCivita , a decorated former Marine who was a media consultant to the Swift Boat campaign in 2004 .
Several other Swift Boat campaign veterans are working with AIP as well .
By law , the group is supposed to be operating separately from the McCain campaign , but given Feather ’s intimate ties with the GOP , it ’s hard to see where one ends and the other begins .
The connections are deep .
One of AIP ’s board members , Edward Failor Jr. , was a paid consultant to the McCain campaign .
( A call to AIP ’s spokesman went unreturned . )
McCain needs the billionaires and their nonprofit advocacy groups .
Obama has raised more money , and business groups that played such a critical role in the election of George W. Bush seem reluctant this go - around to pour money into ads that would benefit McCain .
Indeed , most of the independent expenditures during this campaign have come from groups supporting Obama , according to Congressional Quarterly .
But as the Swift Boat campaign showed , a relatively small amount of money well - spent can go a long way towards changing the direction of an election .
This year , that may prove truer than ever , as the rules of the game have changed significantly since 2004 .
When Congress passed John McCain ’s signature campaign finance reform bill in 2002 , attempting to limit the influence of money in politics , the bill included a provision that banned electioneering ads by corporate entities , unions , or nonprofit groups 60 days before a general election .
That ’s why the Swift Boat ads appeared just before that 60 - day limit kicked in , and not closer to the election .
But last summer , in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life , the US Supreme Court found the ban on such advertising unconstitutional , freeing groups like the American Issues Project to wait until the very end of the campaign to pound a candidate with negative advertising when he has little time to fight back .
The justices who signed on to the majority opinion were John Roberts and Samuel Alito , justices McCain not only voted to appoint but also said he would use as a model for his own Supreme Court appointments .
Clearly he owes them .
Their decision to invalidate McCain ’s own campaign finance law has made it easier for his allies to play dirty to get him elected .
Dana Bash , CNN : I spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham , he is in the McCain campaign , he is negotiation -- is trying to negotiate with the Obama campaign and the presidential debate commission .
What they are saying , and what he is saying is that they are proposing to instead of having next Thursday the vice presidential debate in St. Louis , to make that the presidential debate and then to delay the VP debate to another time .
That is what they are proposing , they understand very well that both the Obama campaign and the debate commission have no intention of delaying Friday 's debate , but both he and a senior advisor that if there is no bailout deal by Friday , McCain has no plan to go to debate .
Oh good lord ... anyone else getting that Titanic - in - front - of - an - iceberg feeling ?
I guess those Navy planes are n't the only things that John McCain will be known for crashing .
His campaign , in the ongoing comedy of errors swirling his sudden and reckless choice to " suspend " his campaign , accidentally released his talking points to the media .
The headline : Do not reach out to the media on this .
Whoops !
Funnily enough , McCain felt no compunction about debating back in 2000 , while his good friend and senior economic advisor Phil Gramm negotiated the deregulation that got us in this situation in the first place .

England has become the most crowded major country in Europe , official figures show .
The number of people crammed in has overtaken those in Holland , long the most densely - populated major nation on the continent .
A count released to MPs showed England now has 395 people per square kilometre .
Crowding has increased because of high immigration into England while the Dutch population has fallen or remained steady .
Last night MPs who are campaigning for ‘ balanced migration ’ said the figures were a milestone in the immigration debate .
Beyond Europe , England ’s population density is among the highest in the world .
Of countries with a population of at least 10 million , England ranks third in density after Bangladesh ( 1,045 per sq km ) and South Korea ( 498 per sq km ) .
The English figures were in a Commons written answer from National Statistician Karen Dunnell .

It 's that wondrous time of year when our inner ghouls come out and we lurk the streets , be -costumed , reveling in our darker selves .
Halloween night represents the one night we can cast off our cheeriness and embrace what lurks within the darkest corner of our souls .
And though we must adorn ourselves with capes and masks to tell the world we 're out for mischief , there are a number of automobiles that come prefabricated for ne'erdowelling across unlit streets .
Below are the ten spookiest , creepiest and scary - cool looking cars ever seen by mere mortals .

10 . ) Mercury Marauder

Hearkening back to the good ol ' days , the Mercury Marauder is one of the few modern cars to appeal to the dark side .
Based on the same Panther platform that underpins countless Crown Vic police cars , the sight of one of these sends chills down the spine , and when you throw in the blacked - out windows , grille , headlights , taillights and pillars you end up with one spooky sled .
There 's a reason why the CIA and the Feds ordered up a bunch of Marauders .
9. ) Plymouth Satellite
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
If , like the eponymous movie wants us to believe , cars have personalities , then the Plymouth Satellite is a scary zombie .
At the very least , a ghost - white one with a little rust and a missing bumper is the perfect car for a zombie crew to jump in and use to terrorize the locals .
Wait ?
Zombie drivers ?
We just came up with the best movie idea .
Someone call Spielberg .
8. ) Buick Roadmaster Station Wagon
Advertisement
In a decade defined by optimism , there was something deeply pessimistic about the nineties - era Buick Roadmaster .
Built on the same b- body platform as a number of other GM wagons , the Roadmaster has an angry stature amplified by the long , mean nose and partially - covered rear wheels .
Powered by a version of the 5.7 - liter LT1 V8 used in the Corvette , a black Roadmaster wagon has the power to chase down lost souls and the room to store them .
Paging the Grim Reaper .

7. ) Avanti II SportCoupe

We always thought a Studebaker Avanti coupe would have made a better batmobile than a Futura .
With nary a straight line to be found , a tail end that abruptly comes to an end and a chrome bumper that looks like it has a pair of fangs we wonder if this is n't what Dracula drives when he turns into a bat .
Combine that with those empty eyes and we doubt this spooky SportCoupe could see its own reflection in its shiny moon wheel covers .
6. ) Lincoln Continental Mark III

Few vehicles bring the promise of misadventure and doom than a Lincoln Mark III .
Squelch on a bet ?
A bookie in a Mark III is going to show up at your door and throw you onto the 16 acres of hood real estate .
Drop a dime on a gangster ?
A dude named Tony and his friends Anthony and Anton will be happy to make room for you — in the trunk .
Unlike the softer , luxurious luxury cars of the era , the Mark III clearly states that it means business .
All black and chrome with those covered headlights , this Lincoln is prepared for stealthy mayhem .

5. ) Alfa Romeo Montreal

If Vader tools around in a GNX and the reaper has a Roadmaster wagon then Satan himself drives around in an Alfa Romeo Montreal .
Do n't let the name fool you :
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world that he was a Canadian .
As Dante will tell you , the Antichrist is clearly an Italian guy and we do n't imagine that his unholiness would drive around in a Ferrari .
There 's no doubt the Montreal 's evil - looking grimace , angry NACA duct and 1970s Italian dependability make it the perfect car for lapping the eighth circle of Hell .
4. ) Plymouth Valiant V - 200
Advertisement
For your classier demon there 's not much better than a Plymouth Valiant V200 .
From its demonically styled grille to the creepy fender chrome , the Valiant V - 200 is ghoulishly awesome .
The creepiest feature on the car , and on nearly any car , is the trunk , which appears to include the door to the underworld .
Though this feature is actually for the spare tire , it looks like a portable gate to Hell .
3. ) Porsche 917
Advertisement
Though we think of Porsches as small and sleek sports cars , the Porsche 917 is something of an outlier .
Though fast and wonderful , it looks like a giant scary monster come down from the hills to eat the villagers .
The sloping wings , huge inlet and bulky styling are more Frankenstein than Frankfurt .
The 917/20 , a.k.a. the " Pink Pig " , is perhaps the most frightening of them all .
From most angles it looks like a stitched - together bird - pig - man hybrid .
Run , run for your lives from the Trufflehunter of Züffenhausen !
2. ) Buick GNX
Advertisement
When the Buick GNX debuted , Car And Driver ran a review of it with the headline " Vader , Your Car is Ready " and that connection has never left the car .
Ignore the fact that nearly every part , down to the wheels , is black .
Ignore the evil grimace on its face .
Ignore even the Buick 's blade - sharp lines that scream " I will cut you and not look back " standing still .
The thing that makes the GNX truly scary looking is the site of this G - bodied two - door from the late 80s screaming down the street to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and running a quarter - mile in 13.26 .
Evil incarnate .
1. ) Rolls Royce Phantom Jonckheere
Advertisement
The single most frightening looking car in history also has one of the most spine - tingling names of any car .
The Rolls Royce Phantom Jonckheere Coupe may be one of the finest automobiles built , but we fear the person who actually drives around in one of these .
Built without concern for cost or common sense in the 1920s , the history of the car is somewhat murky but we would n't be surprised if it spent some time in Transylvania .
From the rear three - quarter view it actually looks like Dracula 's cape flowing in the wind .
And on the inside ?
A blood red , entirely made of the finest materials .
If you 're ever invited inside make sure to bring a wooden stake with you .
Indications out of Washington this week are that Uncle Sam is about to do something that if it were n't so serious would be an absolutely hilarious joke .
Of course , I am referring to the planned taxpayer bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
First of all , in a related story , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should be investigated for perjuring himself before Congress .
In testimony given before the House Financial Services Committee on July 16 Bernanke confidently told members of Congress that the beleaguered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were in “ no danger of failing ” .
His testimony was instrumental in getting Congress to approve Treasury Department and Federal Reserve proposals to make sweeping changes to the relationship between the two institutions and the government .
The changes included making funds available to the firms to ease the credit crunch and allowing the government to purchase shares of stock in both firms .
Just seven weeks later , news breaks that the government is moving in to take control of both institutions to save them from collapse .
With the data available to Bernanke , he either lied to Congress to get his way or he does n't know what he is doing .
In any event , the point is that now the American taxpayer is going to be left holding the tab for these federal boondoggles .
The problem is that no one knows how big the tab is going to be ?
Combined , both institutions own or have guaranteed $ 5.1 trillion in mortgage debt .
Perhaps Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's request to Congress in July for essentially a blank check to help Fannie and Freddie was prophetic ?
Only time will tell .
But , besides the direct cost of the bailout , greater dangers exist in two other areas .
The first is the harm it could do to the government 's credit rating .
What if the economy experiences a prolonged recession ?
What kind of pressure will an unknown debt amount for Fannie and Freddie coupled with customary Keynesian spending put on the credit rating of the U.S. government ?
In other words , how much longer will lenders be willing to loan us money in the future for debts that essentially have no end .
Secondly , the Fed always could and will print the money needed to pay the bills .
With current debt levels and future obligations ( e.g. Medicare ) projected to be in the trillions of dollars , how much money would have to be printed and how much inflation would result ?
Of course , Washington believes that without Fannie and Freddie the mortgage market would be left with a deficiency of funds to conduct business hurting the ability of millions of Americans to own their own homes .
Therefore , the politicians are going to do whatever it takes to save them , apparently even if it means bankrupting the country .
In fact , it is because of Fannie and Freddie that we are in this mess in the first place .
They have interfered with the free market 's mechanism of sifting out unworthy borrowers by purchasing bad loans from smaller banks and guaranteeing them with taxpayer money .
Both firms knew all along that they would not have to suffer the consequences of their risky actions .
Ironic how the very institutions Washington wants to save in order to prevent a credit crunch in the mortgage market are the ones that caused the credit crunch in the mortgage market in the first place .
If Will Rogers were around today he could use that line in one of his monologues .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's the $ 64,000 question on Capitol Hill this week : what is responsible for the record escalation on oil prices ?
Speculators have taken much of the blame .
But on Wednesday , one of the nation 's leading energy analysts said that it's more complicated than that and the cause is multi-faceted .
" In such circumstances as these , there is a tendency to seek a single explanation , " said Daniel Yergin , in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee .
" History , however , demonstrates that changes of this scale and significance result not from a single cause , but rather from a confluence of factors . "
Yergin acknowledged that speculative traders looking to make a buck on oil have played a role in driving up prices and fanning fears about tightening supplies .
But he also pointed to other factors , including the credit crisis and a weaker dollar .
" Financial markets are today playing an increasingly important role in price formation - responding to , accentuating , and exaggerating supply and demand , geopolitics and other trends , " said Yergin , co-founder and chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
Yergin said that markets have helped fuel a " shortage psychology " that the world is " running out of oil . "
" As prices go up , this psychology becomes self - reinforcing - at least until the market turns , " said Yergin .
The subprime mortgage meltdown has led to interest rate cuts and a weaker dollar - propelling the price increases , he added .
Still , prices may be at or near their peak , said Yergin , who urged Americans to adopt a multi- faceted approach to alleviate the energy crisis .
Peak prices vs. peak demand
Yergin said that two years ago , he viewed a range of $ 120 to $ 150 a barrel as the " break point " for oil prices .
Oil prices are trading within that range .
Prices plunged on Wednesday following a government report that showed a buildup in supply , falling more than $ 4 a barrel to about $ 132 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
" As the committee knows , there is much talk about ' peak oil ' supply these days , " said Yergin .
" However , we think something else is at hand - ' peak demand ' - at least in terms of U.S. gasoline consumption , " Yergin said .
" In our view , 2007 may well have been the top , the peak , in terms of U.S. gasoline demand . "
The average nationwide price for a gallon of unleaded gas was $ 4.067 on Wednesday , according to AAA .
The highest recorded price of $ 4.080 occurred on June 16 , according to AAA .
Yergin added that America must take aggressive measures to alleviate its oil problems .
He said Americans should adopt a three - pronged approach : use of renewable energy sources and newly - discovered oil supplies - such as the discoveries in off - shore Brazil - as well as greater fuel efficiency .
" Alternatives and renewables have and should have an important role to play in our energy economy , and their role will grow , " said Yergin .
" A great deal of effort is going into innovation , and the impact will be significant .
But the timing and scale remain uncertain . "
Price bubble , or new reality ?
Lawmakers , who are facing voter anger over high gas prices , have introduced nine different bills on speculation .
Several of those measures have bipartisan support .
Several hearings have been held this week with more scheduled .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , chairman of the committee , convened Wednesday 's hearing to examine the state of the international energy markets and the impact of oil prices on the U.S. economy .
The focus of the meeting was to determine whether skyrocketing oil prices are a " bubble " or a " new reality . "
" I think everyone would like to believe that high oil prices are a bubble , but they might not be , " said Schumer .
" Many would also like to believe that there is a silver bullet that can pop the bubble .
But if there is no oil bubble , or prices temporarily decline and we put off doing the necessary things we have to do - like conservation or investing more in alternative fuel incentives - we 'll be even further behind than we are now from breaking our foreign oil dependence . "
Schumer also downplayed the role of speculators in driving up oil prices , and he placed blame on the oil industry and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
" I think it is interesting that the big oil companies and OPEC are blaming speculators for out - of - control prices , when they may be much more of the cause , " said Schumer .
Schumer said the impact of speculation could be curtailed by raising margin requirements and strengthening regulations " but they may not solve the problem in the long - term , particularly if we think these are the only things that should be done . "
Yergin hesitated , however , to condemn all forms of speculation .
He said that hedging fuel prices was helping the airline industry in a difficult time .
Southwest Airlines ( LUV , Fortune 500 ) , for example , has prospered while other airlines have lost money , largely because of hedging fuel and therefore avoiding today 's skyrocketing prices .
" If they can't hedge , they would be in even worse shape , " said Yergin .
" So I think that removing liquidity from the market would not be a good thing to do . "
Conservation is the key to alleviating the oil crisis , said Schumer , praising the 1970s - era conservation efforts of former California Gov. Jerry Brown in reducing that state 's per capita energy consumption to this day .
" We must address the demand side of the oil equation , " said Schumer .
Unlike Britain , the US and many other countries , France appears to be weathering the credit crunch storm in reasonable shape .
The BBC's Emma Jane Kirby asks if other nations should take a leaf out of the thrifty Gallic book ?
In France , it is very difficult to spend money you do not have If I had to use one word to describe France 's financial system , the word I would choose would be " cautious " .
French banks are immensely careful about whom they lend money to and , to limit risks , they spread their investments much more widely than those in the US or UK .
Only about a quarter of banking activity is related to investment banking and dealer - broker activity - the rest is all to do with retail banking .
This meant when the credit crunch bit , the French banks were hit a lot less hard than those in many other countries .
But it is not just about banking investments - this country as a whole simply takes far fewer risks .
In London ... it was as if wealth was something you could get from a bank , it 's a sort of miracle people seem to believe in England
Francois Artignan , banker
Take the level of household debt .
In France , it is at 47 % of GDP , while in the UK it is well over twice that .
It 's not that temptation does not exist in France - the lure of consumerism is just as strong as it is elsewhere .
But it is very difficult to spend money you do not have in France .
French credit cards are little more than debit cards , so there is no question of simply sticking a couple of flat screen TVs on your credit card and hoping to pay for them later - if there are insufficient funds in your account , your bank will immediately block the transaction .
In the wealthy suburb of St Germain - en - Laye , just outside Paris , I met Francois Artignan , a well - to - do banker who moved back to France two years ago after a long stint of living in the UK .
Mr Artignan was 43 when he bought his first house in France Francois admits he misses the buzz of London living but says he was alarmed by the way so many British people lived on their credit cards and never saved money .
" It 's true that you can note a big difference in consuming behaviours between the French and the English , " Mr Artignan says .
" People here do n't believe you can just put your debts together and get them refinanced ...
But in London ... it was as if wealth was something you could get from a bank , it 's a sort of miracle people seem to believe in England .
" It seems to me people there are very keen to use up all the money they have , and that 's a worry when you wonder how people are going to have money for retirement for instance , " Mr Artignan says .
Sluggish growth From his Paris office , the chief economist for market analyst Xerfi , Alexander Law , has been comparing the spending patterns of France and Britain .
A loan for a mortgage is impossible without a big deposit Mr Law , who has dual nationality , believes that innate French prudence has saved it from disaster .
" Generally in France you spend what you have and not more , " he explains .
" In the US and the UK , the economy has been driven by household spending , consumption has been driven by credit , and a lot less in France , so that 's why when there were periods of expansion France grew a lot more slowly than the UK and the US but conversely when it 's slowing down , it will slow down in a more moderate fashion than the UK or the US . "
France 's rate of growth is horribly sluggish - this year it looks set to hover around just 1 % , meaning its likely to be way off target for meeting its promise to the EU to bring its budget deficit back under control by 2012 .
But although its slow economy is hardly the envy of the world , its reluctance to tie its economy into the housing market in the same way the US did has also meant that when the American sub - prime market collapsed , it did not drag the French market with it .
There are far fewer household owners here than in the UK - about 57 % of French people are on the property ladder , compared to 70 % in the UK .
Although a high earner , Mr Artignan was 43 before buying his first home because in France , unless you have a big deposit , you can forget begging the banks for a huge loan .
Two conditions President Nicolas Sarkozy is trying to push France into becoming a nation of house owners by building thousands of cheap new homes .
Thousands of new cheap houses are being built across France But France still believes in strict rules and regulations , Finance Minister Christine Lagarde says .
" Expect two conditions - a down payment of 20 % of the value of the house plus mortgage [ repayments ] which will not exceed 30 % of income .
" You already have a pretty good safety net there and clearly no real estate financing similar to the sub - prime market that has existed in the US and which has hurt the financial system so much , " Ms Lagarde says .
France has long been feeling the pinch of the global rise in food and fuel prices and many people here complain that their spending power is falling fast .
In France , 46 % of people chose to stay home for their summer holiday this year rather than splashing out on an expensive break away , and so many people are cutting back on dining out that some 3,000 cafes and restaurants went out of business in the first three months of this year .
Ms Lagarde says many people are living in the " world of fantasy " Sparse spending means sparse growth - but should other countries take a leaf out of the parsimonious Gallic book ?
" I 'm not suggesting that we have the basic principles right , I 'm not suggesting that we can teach the world lessons , " Ms Lagarde says .
" But I think it will be for each and every category of players , traders , regulators , supervisors , to examine what they have done , what they should have done and what they should be doing in the future to bring a bit more morality into the system .
" I think we have let this world of fantasy and virtuality overcome reality ...
There have to be more principles , more discipline and a bit more reality , " the minister says .

What are these ?
And after nearly eight years of increasingly unpopular Republican rule in the White House , 52 percent of those polled said that they held a favorable view of the Democratic Party , compared with 37 percent who said they held a favorable view of the Republican Party .
Voters said they preferred Democrats to Republicans when it came to questions about who would better handle the issues that are of the greatest concern to voters  including the economy , health care and the war in Iraq .
The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday through Monday with 1,070 adults , of whom 972 were registered voters , and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for both groups .
After several weeks in which the McCain campaign sought to tie Mr. Obama to William Ayers , a founder of the Weather Underground terrorism group , 64 percent of voters said that they had either read or heard something about the subject .
But a majority said they were not bothered by Mr. Obama ’s background or past associations .
Several people said in follow - up interviews that they felt that Mr. McCain ’s attacks on Mr. Obama were too rooted in the past , or too unconnected to the nation ’s major problems .
“ What bothers me is that McCain initially talked about running a campaign on issues and I want to hear him talk about the issues , ” said Flavio Lorenzoni , a 59 - year - old independent from Manalapan , N.J.
“ But we ’re being constantly bombarded with attacks that are n’t relevant to making a decision about what direction McCain would take the country .
McCain has n’t addressed the real issues .
He ’s only touched on them very narrowly .
This is a time when we need to address issues much more clearly than they ever have been in the past . ”
The poll found that Mr. Obama is now supported by majorities of men and independents , two groups that he has been fighting to win over .
And the poll found , for the first time , that white voters are just about evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama , who , if elected , would be the first black president .
The poll found that Mr. Obama is supported by 45 percent of white voters  a greater percentage than has voted for Democrats in recent presidential elections , according to exit polls .
Mr. McCain was viewed unfavorably by 41 percent of voters , and favorably by 36 percent .
Ms. Palin ’s favorability rating is now 32 percent , down 8 points from last month , and her unfavorable rating climbed nine percentage points to 41 percent .
Mr. Obama ’s favorability rating , by contrast , is now at 50 percent , the highest recorded for him thus far by The Times and CBS News .
There were still some strong findings for Mr. McCain .
Sixty - four percent of voters polled said Mr. McCain , 72 , was well - prepared for the presidency , which has been a central theme of his campaign .
Fifty - one percent said Mr. Obama , 47 , was .
After 16 years as the iconic pinnacle of Chrysler 's lineup , the Dodge Viper is being toppled by a car with a cord .
A source inside the company has indicated that the 600 - horsepower coupe could be replaced by the Tesla - like electric sports car Chrysler unveiled Tuesday .
" You saw the picture of the EV we announced , " says the source , who spoke to Wired.com on condition of anonymity .
" That 's the direction Chrysler is going . "
For all its performance , the Viper is an anachronism .
It was borne of the idea that bigger is better , and that 's been enough to keep the Viper going since its introduction in 1992 .
But it 's an increasingly difficult idea to sell in an era of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline and global warming , and Chrysler says it 's time to move on .
Even if the company was n't looking to sell the Viper line , the supercar 's days were numbered .
" The definition of sports car is changing , " our source says .
" People are looking at things differently now .
The Viper was a throwback to the golden era of sports cars .
It was all about big horsepower and small chassis .
It 's time for that to change . "
That 's not to say Chrysler 's going soft .
The as - yet - unnamed Dodge EV is based on the Lotus Europa that rolls into European showrooms next month .
In fact , the car Chrysler unveiled looked like a re-badged Europa with racing stripes .
Specs call for a 200 kilowatt ( 268 horsepower ) electric motor producing 480 pound - feet of torque – just 80 less than the Viper 's 8.4 - liter V10 .
The goal is 0 to 60 in less than 5 seconds and a top speed above 120 mph .
" We 're still going to offer products that are visceral , " our source tells us .
Although those figures fall well short of the Viper – which hits 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and tops out at 202 mph in base - model trim – they put the car in Tesla 's neighborhood , and possibly for much less than the $ 100 K the Roadster goes for .
" It'll out - Tesla the Tesla , " says Aaron Bragman , an industry analyst with Global Insight , who predicts we 'll see the Dodge EV by the end of 2010 .
" It 's a new halo performance vehicle for Chrysler . "
And it even looks good in Viper green , as our Photoshopped version of Chrysler 's pic shows .
Of course , Chrysler 's still gotta build it .
Anyone can produce one EV ; it 's making a lot of them that 's tricky , and Chrysler 's future is anything but assured .
Some industry watchers were privately speculating that it could be chopped up and sold off as early as next year .
After all , the company 's selling just three cars per month per dealership and it's reportedly lost $ 400 million this year .
" With those kinds of numbers , what can they do to hold on until 2010 ? , " Bragman asks .
Good question .

Not that anyone would wish economic hardship on anybody , but can the case be made that there are in fact health benefits to an economic downturn ?
Well , the conclusion is not as simple as you might think , and the answers are surprisingly mixed .
In a recent article in the New York Times , researchers found that there are in fact instances where lean economic times might actually have a positive impact on our health .
While it goes without saying that a flourishing economy goes a long way to improving our standard or living , it is interesting to note that there are instances where economic prosperity does not always translate into good health .
Take , for instance , the economic expansion of the past two decades .
While we have witnessed unprecedented growth in the stock market along with an incredible accumulation of wealth , the population as a whole has also experienced skyrocketing rates of obesity , diabetes , heart disease , and stroke .
The reason for this seems to boil down to time , or lack thereof .
When the economy is good , people seem to dedicate more of their lives to working hard at their jobs .
In fact , in a previous post , Xin Lu wrote about a Japanese worker who actually worked himself to death !
While the desire to work hard and do a good job is completely understandable , it also means that less time is dedicated to the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle , which includes healthy eating , exercise , and regular check ups with your doctor .
When times are good , people also tend to embrace unhealthy habits like excessive consumption of alcohol ( especially before getting behind the wheel ) , as well as stress and anxiety that can come from trying to maintain a certain lifestyle , which also , in the modern era of consuming , can entail accruing debt .
Then , of course , there is the issue of spending quality time at home with friends and family , which I think is reasonable to say contributes positively to one ’s health and brings up the need to distinguish between one ’s standard of living and one ’s quality of life .
This is especially true in the case of raising children .
In fact , some of the data seems to point to the fact that children may actually benefit from the economy slowing down .
The reason for this may be hard to nail down , but some theorize that it has to do with more time spent with either mom or dad ( who may be unemployed as a result of a slowdown ) , and the healthy aspects of life that go along with it , i.e. , healthy , home cooked meals from scratch , the comfort and peace of mind that come from being around the nuclear family .
It is important to note that for families that are hit harder by a downturn , the results might not be so bright and sunny .
In other words , if a family cannot absorb the loss of income , then it does n’t bode well for the children or the parents .
It makes sense , since not only do they have less access to food and health care , but the stress might also compromise quality family time .
On the other hand , if the loss of income can be absorbed , then having a parent spending more time with their children surely can’t be a horrible thing .
Sure , you ca n’t buy as many houses , cars or big screen TVs , but it begs the question , how much is enough ?
If you can keep a roof over your head , food on the table , and clothes on your back , then maybe the only way to slow down and spend more quality time with your family is to be forced to do it .
So during these difficult times , many of us may have to curb our spending habits .
This could mean buying fewer extravagant and frivolous items , and even forsaking our daily latte .
This , however , could go a long way in instilling us with a greater appreciation for the simpler things in life , like our famiy , friends , and health .
And maybe even that watered down cup of Yuban , which should be enjoyed in the company of loved ones … slowly .
Hedge funds could have an unprecedented level of cash pulled out by investors this quarter , according to insiders , just as they faced millions of pounds of losses from last week 's shock regulation of short selling .
It has been a tough year for the industry with high - profile funds blowing up , clients increasing redemptions , as well as public fury over short selling and increased threats of regulation .
One hedge fund expert pointed to The Hedge Fund Implode - O - Meter ( HFI ) as how he judges the state of the industry .
The HFI was set up online in the wake of the credit crunch " to track as hedge funds learn the double - edged - sword nature of the often extreme leverage they use " .
The group 's " imploded funds " list has hit 51 companies since the sub - prime mortgage crisis in the United States kicked off a widespread downturn .
That compares with its historical list , stretching back more than a decade to the end of 2006 , of just 14 , including the collapse of Long - Term Capital Management and Amaranth .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This year , big names including Peloton Capital Partners , Carlyle Capital Corporation and Dillon Read Capital Management are just some of the half century to collapse .
" We think hedge funds have largely lost their way , " HFI said .
" Notably , most have abandoned capital - preservation for the goal of aggressive accumulation of capital gains , with the benefit of lax regulation and extreme leverage available to exploit . "
It has 34 stocks on its " ailing / watch list " of those that have suffered significant value declines or temporarily halted redemptions .
According to EuroHedge , a hedge fund data provider , 272 individual funds strategies were launched during the first six months of 2008 , the lowest for nine years .
In the same time , 243 funds have been liquidated , the highest in a six - month period .
Nouriel Roubini , the New York University economics professor , says worse is to come .
He believes there will be an increase in client withdrawals and a shake - up of how funds are regulated .
The redemptions seem to have started in earnest , although currently the evidence is mainly anecdotal .
One UK hedge fund manager confided that last week had the highest number of investors rushing to withdraw funds that he has known .
The industry will know for sure whether it is a drip or a deluge when the data providers release their statistics for the third quarter , next month .
One market analyst said : " I know even the good hedge funds have been suffering withdrawals recently .
Investors are very nervous . "
Performance numbers are also under pressure .
Some have done well out of the market disturbance , but on average the performance numbers are at a low ebb .
Andrew Baker , the deputy head of Aima , the hedge fund trade body , said : " The performance is undoubtedly soggy .
There are not many strategies that stand out . "
EuroHedge revealed that strategies that have done particularly badly this year include several run by Naissance Capital , once bankrolled by the Habsburg families , which are down a fifth and Pico Fund , which is down 32 per cent .
At Endeavour Fund , set up by former Salomon Smith Barney traders , the second fund has fallen by 40 per cent , while its third fund is down 38.79 per cent in 2008 .
In the emerging markets , PharmaInvest Fund 's investments in emerging markets are 38.16 per cent down .
Other funds have sought to lock in investors by halting redemptions .
The latest example was RAB , with its flagship Special Situations Fund , as it was so desperate to prevent exits after a 22 per cent drop in performance that it offered vastly reduced fees in return for a lock - in period of three years .

One of the main problems experienced by hedge funds is the extent of leverage in the industry .
The funds were able to take on huge amounts of debt , with little capital needed as security , to boost returns .
One observer said some of the leveraged strategies were like " picking up pennies in front of a steamroller , and that only takes a turn in the market to cause severe problems " .
Andrew Lodge , the managing director of fund of hedge funds Nedgroup Investments , said : " Some funds have gone in for huge leverage - driven strategies , which can be a problem .
The appetite for leverage is less . "
He added that some could be affected by increased margin calls , and could face issues over their covenants .
At the same time , hedge funds , like the banks , have had to write down exposures to investments in risky instruments including collateralised debt obligations and asset backed securities , and also been exposed to the huge swings in the market .
Another issue is the regulators sniffing around .
There have been wider calls for transparency and official controls of the industry , which has already been stung by the shock short - selling rules .
Mr Lodge said : " It 's a myth to say hedge funds are n't regulated .
There is a perception that they are running wild with no oversight , which is n't true .
We would welcome some regulation , just as long as it does n't strangle the industry . "
On Friday , the FSA banned short selling in financial stocks , and forced hedge funds to disclose their positions .
As the underlying shares rose as a result , the industry was looking at well over £ 1bn in paper losses on the day .
Stuart McLaren , financial services partner at Deloitte , said : " When the dust has settled , I expect the regulators to look at the role that hedge funds have played in the current issues .
I expect there will be increased calls for regulation , but I doubt much will come from it . "
Mr Baker said : " Some hedge funds are doing well .
However , the number of professionals feeling good about life will be dwindling .
The health indicators are generally negative , while costs are up and performance is down .
Many are feeling battered and bruised and feeling worried about the future . "

Here ’s an update on the strange story of the Gulfstream II jet filled with 3.7 tons of cocaine that crashed in the Yucatan last year .
The Mexico City newspaper El Universal reports that European Parliament was investigating the circumstances surrounding the plane , which had previously been used by the CIA for " extraordinary rendition " flights .
The daily said it had obtained documents from the United States and the European Parliament which " show that that plane flew several times to Guantanamo , Cuba , presumably to transfer terrorism suspects . "
It said the European Parliament was investigating the private Grumman Gulfstream II , registered by the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation , for suspected use in CIA " rendition " flights in which prisoners are covertly transferred to a third country or US - run detention centers .
Last October , the Austin American Statesman reported the plane had previously flown to Guantanamo Bay .
Here ’s a Chicago Public Radio story from October 31 , 2007 about the crashed CIA drug plane .
[ audio : http://audio.wbez.org/wv/2007/10/wv_20071029b.mp3]
The crashed drug plane also has been linked to a Bush fundraiser .
Mad Cow Morning news has been covering stories about the CIA and drug smuggling .
The plane was owned by Donna Blue Aircraft , Inc .
Mad Cow visited Donna Blue ’s offices and took photos of what appears to be a sham company .
Here ’s a photo of some unmarked police cars parked in front Donna Blue Aircraft ’s empty suite :

Yes I saw the counts today on the breakfast menu in New York City .
Being a silly man , who is easily prone to violating the independence of irrelevant alternatives , I immediately searched for the item with the highest calorie count ( it involved butter and lobster , for breakfast ) .
I thought " no way will I get that " and ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese .
Yes , I know about anchoring and behavioral economics .
Is not one equilibrium that every restaurant puts an especially high calorie item on its menu , so that people feel virtuous in ordering something else ?
In her interview today with ABC News ’ Charles Gibson , Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin stated in no uncertain terms “ we cannot repeat the Cold War ” .
However , in a follow - up question about a possible hot war with Russia , the Alaska Governor ’s answer was an unsettlingly non-committal “ perhaps ” .
The interview revealed today further aspects of Sarah Palin ’s position on foreign policy , first explored in her RNC speech last week .
She said she had already spoken to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and had given him assurances of her commitment to Georgia , and believed “ we ’ve got to keep an eye on Russia ” .
She said she was in favor of NATO membership for both Georgia and the Ukraine , and when asked if this would require the US to go to war if war broke out between Russia and Georgian again , the governor said “ Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally ” .
On other matters , Palin declared her somwhat muted support for “ anticipatory self - defense , ” her commitment to preventing a nuclear Iran , and insisted she would not “ second guess ” Israel if it decided to attack Iran .
In a question regarding the use of US ground troops in Pakistan without the permission of the Pakistani government she said “ I believe that America has to exercise all options in order to stop the terrorists ” .
She also clarified her previous comments that the plan for the Iraq War was God ’s plan , saying she was attempting to reference a quote from Abraham Lincoln that said his greatest concern was to be on God ’s side .
She said that she would never presume to speak for God , or claim to know what His will was .
A California state appeals court has upheld that state 's medical cannabis law .
The court dismissed a challenge filed by two counties against the law and against the state 's patient ID program .
The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Aug. 1 , 2008 ( " California 's Pot Law Upheld In Appeals Court " ) that " The Fourth District Court of Appeal in San Diego dismissed challenges by San Diego and San Bernardino counties , which objected both to the 1996 marijuana initiative and to recent legislation requiring counties to issue identification cards to users of medical pot .
The cards protect their holders from arrest by state or local police for possessing small amounts of marijuana .
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government can enforce its drug laws , which ban marijuana use and cultivation , against patients and their suppliers in California and the 11 other states that have legalized medical marijuana under their own laws .
But in Thursday 's ruling , the appeals court said states remain free to decide whether to punish drug users under their own laws .
' The ( federal ) law does not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession , ' said Justice Alex McDonald in the 3 - 0 ruling , which upheld a Superior Court judge 's decision . "
According to the Chronicle , " San Diego County 's lawyer , Senior Deputy County Counsel Thomas Bunton , said county supervisors may decide by next week whether to appeal to the state Supreme Court .
He said a future appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is also possible .
' We think the court should have found that California 's medical marijuana laws are pre-empted by the federal law , ' Bunton said .
' We think ( the ID card law ) requires us to issue cards in support of conduct that violates federal law . '
Advocacy groups that joined the state in defense of its law said the ruling shows that states are free to chart their own course on medical marijuana .
The decision " provides yet further confirmation that states need not march in lockstep with federal policy , " said Adam Wolf , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
He said the court issued ' a stinging rebuke to the misguided attempt of a few rogue counties to undermine the will of California 's voters and the well - being of thousands of sick and dying patients . ' "
The Chronicle noted that " In a separate case Thursday , the Third District Court of Appeal in Sacramento became the second to declare unconstitutional a 2003 state law that limited the amount of marijuana a patient could possess for medical use and remain exempt from prosecution .
The ruling would leave those decisions up to local governments , or to local prosecutors and juries in counties that lacked an official standard .
The law , part of the same legislation that established the state - approved identification cards , allowed patients to possess up to 8 ounces of dried marijuana , or up to six mature marijuana plants or 12 immature plants , unless a doctor had recommended greater amounts to meet the patient 's needs .
The Third District Court ruled that the law conflicted with the 1996 medical marijuana initiative , Proposition 215 , which set no numerical limits on the amount of marijuana a patient could possess .
An appeals court in Los Angeles reached the same conclusion in May , a ruling that Attorney General Jerry Brown 's office has appealed to the state Supreme Court . "
( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain 's campaign rebuked Sen . Joe Biden on Tuesday , saying the Democratic vice presidential nominee had " sunk to a new low " by raising a debate over who cares more for special needs children .
The Republican camp 's sharp response came after Biden said GOP advocates for children with birth defects should support stem cell research .
During a campaign event in Columbia , Missouri , Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said , " I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability , who were born with a birth defect . "
Biden 's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the Republicans ' vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , whose 5 - month - old son , Trig , has Down syndrome .
Palin , an evangelical Christian , opposes embryonic stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos , but her running mate , GOP presidential nominee McCain , does support stem cell research involving embryos .
" Well , guess what , folks ?
If you care about it , why do n't you support stem cell research ? " asked Biden , the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama .
Those comments brought a sharp response .
" Barack Obama 's running mate sunk to a new low today , launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children , " McCain - Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said .
" Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign . "
Biden spokesman David Wade insisted that the Delaware senator 's comments were not directed at Palin .
" This is a clash of policies , not a clash of personalities , " Wade said .
" We 've heard not a dime 's worth of difference between the McCain - Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans . "
During her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week , Palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be " a friend and advocate in the White House . "
But the Alaska governor 's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since McCain chose Palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago .
Before her run for the vice presidency , advocacy for special needs programs had not been a central part of her political campaigns or during her administration , despite her sister 's autistic son .
Watch more on Palin 's budget priorities »
Palin signed a bill this year increasing special needs funding but frustrated some of the bill 's co-sponsors by stepping in only at the last minute .
Sonya Kerr , an Anchorage attorney specializing in disability rights , filed a lawsuit against the state and Palin , alleging that there are not enough services for kids with special needs , specifically a child with autism .
" I would say , welcome , Gov. Palin , to our reality and what we 've been trying to deal with for a long time , " Kerr said .
" I hope that it means that there will be support on a bipartisan basis for what people with disabilities need so we are not a bargaining chip in the political process . "
CNN 's Deb Feyerick , Alexander Mooney and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report .

Random , invasive laptop searches and other digital privacy violations at the U.S. border are facing increasing pressure from the public and Congress .
One of the big complaints EFF and others have had is the lack of information and accountability about the intrusive examination of computer files , cell phone directories , and other private information -- and the indiscriminate copying of that data -- as Americans come back home from overseas .
The good news is that the government has finally made public its policy guidelines for digital searches and data seizures at U.S. borders .
The bad news is that it is claiming expansive powers to randomly search your laptop , decrypt and translate any information on the machine , and even seize the device for an " off - site " search .
As news coverage of the guidelines have pointed out , there is no limit to how long the government can keep your computer , iPod , camera , or any other digital device , leaving travelers just about helpless to protect their personal property and private information from the whims of a border agent .
EFF has long been involved in the battle against these random and intrusive searches , and has called on Congress to crack down on the government 's claim of blanket search and seizure power of your electronic devices and the data inside .
Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren has decided to take action , introducing a bill to curb the baseless searches .
( Update : Reps. Ron Paul and Eliot Engle have also introduced a border search bill ) .
In the meantime , EFF is working to uncover more information about the border search program with a Freedom of Information Act suit filed with the Asian Law Caucus .
The government is working hard as well .
The Transportation Security Administration recently announced that its Secure Flight program should start operating before the end of the year .
Secure Flight will allow the government to collect the passenger records you are obliged to hand over to airlines when you travel , and then connect that personal data with other government databases .
But as EFF pointed out in comments to the Department of Homeland Security last year , individuals will be prevented from discovering what data is kept on them , lack the ability to correct that data , and lack the right to judicial review to force data to be corrected .

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Asian markets were dealt crushing blows Friday as panic - stricken investors rushed to dump stocks across the board in a scramble to raise cash and reduce risk .
Japanese shares were hurt the most in the resulting stampede , with the Nikkei 225 Average delivering its worst single - day performance in more than two decades .
The benchmark took home a weekly loss of 24 % , while more than $ 650 billion of wealth was wiped off during this period in Tokyo - Asia 's largest stock market by capitalization - according to FactSet Research data .
At their lowest levels during the session , the Nikkei tumbled as much as 11.4 % in Tokyo , the Hang Seng Index lost 9.7 % in Hong Kong , the Kospi index shed 9 % in Seoul and India 's Sensex slumped 9.6 % , although they ended modestly above than the day 's lows .
" We have a complete market disarray , where valuations are n't even appropriate to mention , " said Benjamin Collett , head of hedge - fund sales trading at Daiwa Securities SMBC .
" We 've had a cascading series of events which have served to force equity holders to offload shares under a massive amount of distress , " he said .
" That means that they are selling at 15 to 30 cents on the dollar and there is no risk appetite or funding to allow someone to catch this drop . "
The Nikkei ended the day 9.6 % down at 8,276.43 , its lowest close since May 2003 .
The day 's percentage loss was the worst for the benchmark since the 1987 market crash , according to Reuters .
The broader Topix index fell 7.1 % to 840.86 .
The Hang Seng Index tumbled 7.2 % to 14,796.87 , while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped 7.9 % to 7,135.80 .
China 's Shanghai Composite ended 3.6 % lower at 2,000.57 and the Straits Times Index fell 7.6 % to 1,942.50 by late afternoon .
In Mumbai , the Sensex fell as low as 10,239.76 in early minutes of trading , before paring some losses .
The index was down 5 % at 10,766.04 in afternoon trading .
The drop came even after the central bank further reduced banks ' cash reserve requirement .
The central bank cut the requirement by 1.5 percentage points , from 0.5 point planned earlier .
The move , designed to inject liquidity into the banking system , sent the rupee tumbling against the U.S. dollar .
Australia 's S&P / ASX 200 fell 8.3 % to 3,960.70 , and New Zealand 's NZX 50 index gave up 4.7 % to 2,805.31 .
South Korea 's Kospi lost 4.1 % to 1,241.47 and Thailand 's SET Index shed 8.7 % to 456.74 .
The Taiwanese market was closed for a holiday .
" I think people are trying to liquidate positions , but there just are n't any buyers there .
It 's the nature of the markets that there are very few people willing to buy stocks , " said Andrew Sullivan , a sales trader at Main First Securities .
" A lot of people sitting on cash are happy to be sitting on cash at the moment . "
Sullivan added that the selling in Tokyo was likely intensified because Monday is a holiday there and markets are closed .

A random walk through mathematics -- mostly through the random part .

The studio has attached ( American Gangster , Schindler ’s List ) to adapt “ I Heard You Paint Houses , ” a book byabout the mob assassin Frank “ the Irishman ” Sheeran who many believe had something to do with the disappearance and presumed death of Teamster boss .
The title comes from how mobsters inquire about a hitman and hiring them for a job .
However , this code has also led to unfortunate miscommunications resulting in very alive targets happily residing in freshly painted homes .
According to Variety , De Niro will play Sheeran .
The last time Scorsese and De Niro worked together was on “ Casino ” in 1995 and Goodfellas before that .
No production date has been set .
This time it ’s the booty , not the pirates , that everyone ’s talking about .
And what they ’re wondering is :
Just where were those Russian tanks going ?
As additional U.S. warships gathered around a hijacked Ukrainian ship off Somalia , questions persisted Monday about where the vessel ’s military cargo was destined .
The governments of Kenya and Ukraine say the shipment of 33 Russian - built T - 72 tanks , ammunition and spare parts was part of a legal sale contracted last year to supply the Kenyan army .

But U.S. officials , arms experts and maritime officials say the more likely destination was southern Sudan , where the former rebel group Sudan People ’s Liberation Movement , or SPLM , governs an autonomous region and has been working aggressively over the last three years to transform its ragtag guerrilla army into a professional fighting force .
“ We received reports that the cargo was intended for Sudan , so obviously our goal is to maintain watch over the ship while negotiations are taking place , ” said Lt. Nathan Christensen , spokesman for the U.S. Navy ’s Bahrain - based 5th Fleet .
He said “ several ” U.S. ships had surrounded the hijacked vessel Monday , but no further actions were planned .
Arms experts wondered why Kenya would purchase Russian - made tanks since its previous suppliers have been the United States , Britain and China .
Kenya ’s current tanks are British - built .

“ I ’m not aware of Kenya using any [ former ]
Soviet bloc weaponry before , so if they are , that ’s a major shift , ” said one arms expert in the region who did not want to be identified .
Southern Sudan , by contrast , has been buying Russian - made tanks over the last year , officials said , including nearly 50 T - 54 battle tanks .
That deal drew attention in February when one shipment was briefly held up at the Kenyan port of Mombasa amid that country ’s postelection turmoil .
Andrew Mwangura , head of the Seafarers Assistance Program in Kenya , said at least three arms shipments destined for southern Sudan had moved through Mombasa over the last year .
The Kenyan government , however , said Monday that the hijacked cargo was “ important military equipment paid for by the Kenyan taxpayer for use by the Kenyan military . ”

A government spokesman declined to comment on why the government was purchasing Russian - made tanks or how they fit into the country ’s military strategy .
“ We do n’t discuss why we need arms , ” spokesman Alfred Mutua said .
He described allegations that the tanks might be sold or transferred to Sudan as “ propaganda . ”
“ We have not had any tanks go from Kenya to Sudan .
Kenya makes sure it ’s not a conduit for any illegal arms , ” he said .
Southern Sudanese officials could not be reached for comment Monday .
One army official in the region was quoted over the weekend in a Sudanese newspaper as denying that the military goods were headed for the south .

But since signing a 2005 treaty with the Sudanese government that ended a 21 - year north - south civil war , the SPLM has not hidden its desire to strengthen its former guerrilla army .
It spends about half its budget on military training , salaries and supplies .
In addition to purchases and assistance from countries such as the U.S. , Russia and Ethiopia , the new autonomous southern Sudanese government recently announced it might build its own air force .
Under the terms of the peace treaty , southern Sudan is permitted to operate and fund its own military , separate from the national army .
The agreement does not prohibit southern Sudan from purchasing foreign weapons , nor is the region restricted by the United Nations arms embargo , which covers the Darfur region in western Sudan .
Recent skirmishes between Sudan ’s northern and southern armies in the disputed oil - rich city of Abyei underscored the sense of urgency felt in the south to build up its forces in case the treaty collapses or combat resumes .

The northern army also receives heavy weapons from Russia and China and has its own manufacturing facilities for tanks .
The SPLM also wants a strong army to help enforce the results of a referendum planned for 2011 , in which southern Sudanese might vote to separate from the north , analysts said .
Hijackers said Monday they were seeking $ 20 million for the release of the cargo and 20 hostages , according to Sugale Ali Omar Omar , who identified himself as one of the pirates and spoke in a phone interview .
He said U.S. ships were about a mile away and warplanes were flying low over the ship .
One crew member has died of a suspected heart attack , but all others are safe , he said .

“ We are ready if the foreign warships attack us , ” he said .
“ If they fire on us , we will open what we have on them . ”

The Mother of All Bailouts may be necessary to unfreeze our capital markets , but it wo n't unfreeze the American economy .
Bailout or no bailout , we 're heading into deep recession .
One of the first initiatives that Congress and the next administration will need to take will be an economic stimulus package .
But not even this will remedy the underlying problem :
The earnings of most Americans have n't kept up with the cost of living .
That means there 's not enough purchasing power to keep the economy going .
Adjusted for inflation , the incomes of nongovernment workers are lower today than in 2000 .
They 're barely higher than they were in the mid-1970s .
The income of a man in his 30s is now 12 percent below that of a man his age three decades ago .
Per-person productivity has grown considerably over the past three decades and has continued to rise even in the lackluster recovery of this decade .
But most Americans have n't reaped the benefits of these productivity gains .
The benefits have gone largely to the top .
The top 1 percent of American earners now take home about 20 percent of total national income .
In 1980 , the top 1 percent took home just 8 percent .
Inequality on this scale is bad for many reasons , but it is also bad for the economy .
The wealthy devote a smaller percentage of their earnings to buying things than the rest of us because , after all , they 're rich and already have most of what they want .
Instead of buying , the very wealthy are more likely to invest their earnings wherever around the world they can get the highest return .
The last time the top 1 percent took home 20 percent of total income was 1928 .
After that , the economy caved in .
The underlying earnings problem has been masked for years as middle - and lower - income Americans found means to live beyond their paychecks .
The first coping mechanism was to send more women into paid work .
The percentage of American working mothers with school - age children has almost doubled since 1970 , to more than 70 percent .
But there 's a limit to how many mothers can maintain paying jobs .
So Americans turned to a second coping mechanism - working more hours .
Americans have became veritable workaholics , putting in 350 more hours a year than the average European , more even than the notoriously industrious Japanese .
But there 's also a limit to how many hours Americans can work .
So we turned to a third way of coping .
We began to borrow .
With housing prices rising briskly through the 1990s and even faster this decade , we turned our homes into piggy banks .
But now , with the bursting of the housing bubble , we 're reaching the end of our ability to borrow , just as lenders have reached the end of their capacity to lend .
That means there 's not enough purchasing power in the economy to buy all the goods and services it 's producing .
We 're finally reaping the whirlwind of widening inequality and ever more concentrated wealth .
The only way to keep the economy going over the long run is to increase the real earnings of middle - and lower - middle - class Americans .
The answer is n't to protect jobs through trade protection .
That would only drive up the prices of everything purchased from abroad .
Most routine jobs are being automated anyway .
Nor is it to give tax breaks to the very wealthy and to giant corporations in the hope they will trickle down to everyone else .
We 've tried that and it has n't worked .
Nothing trickled down .
The long - term answer is for America to invest in the productivity of our working people - enabling families to afford health insurance and have access to good schools and higher education , while also rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in the clean - energy technologies of the future .
We must also adopt progressive taxes at the federal , state and local levels .
Call it bottom - up economics .
It would be a sad irony if the Wall Street bailout robs us of the resources we need to invest in average Americans and rebuild America from the bottom up .
On one issue – who'd be tougher on Al Qaeda – John McCain and Barack Obama are one - upping each other in rhetoric .
It 's a risky dynamic and may be giving a green light to the current president .
Just before President Bush met Pakistan 's new prime minister Monday , the US conducted an attack on Al Qaeda – inside Pakistan .
The unilateral airstrike by an unmanned drone allegedly killed Al Qaeda 's leading expert on chemical and biological weapons , Abu Khabab al - Masri .
The result may be difficult to argue against but this US violation of Pakistani sovereignty was criticized by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and perhaps most Pakistanis who cherish their recent return to full democracy .
And as if to disregard his guest , Mr. Bush stated that he " supports the sovereignty of Pakistan " – despite the same - day attack on one of Al Qaeda 's havens in the largely lawless tribal areas .
In America 's post -9/11 politics , a neoconservative idea of unilateral , sovereignty - breaking , and preemptive attacks against Al Qaeda is little debated .
The United Nations gave its approval for the 2001 invasion of Taliban - run Afghanistan to oust Al Qaeda but not so for ongoing US attacks inside Pakistan .
And yet because Pakistan 's military has done little to keep Al Qaeda in Pakistan from staging attacks on Europe and perhaps again on the US , both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain find it easy to compete on which one would be tougher in this front line of the war on terrorism .
During his recent foreign trip , Obama said that if the UShad " actionable intelligence against high - value Al Qaeda targets , and the Pakistani government was unwilling to go after those targets , " the US must strike .
He also said Al Qaeda 's training camps are growing in Pakistan and the group is plotting attacks against the US .
To further beef up his security credentials , Obama goes beyond McCain 's support for current US practice of occasional , well - targeted attacks on Al Qaeda and says the US should not " tolerate a terrorist sanctuary " inside Pakistan .
As the November election nears , such hawkish talk may only grow longer talons .
One recent example is McCain trying to best Obama 's call for two additional US brigades in Afghanistan by calling for three .
And as for Al Qaeda in Pakistan , McCain tries to act presidential , criticizing Obama for tipping his hand in public on what he would do while at the same time indicating he too would meet the threat with force .
Political competition at home can sometimes create pressure for aggressive US foreign policy .
In the 1980 race , Ronald Reagan 's criticisms of President Carter 's handling of the Iranian US - hostage crisis may have forced Mr. Carter into a disastrous rescue attempt .
The 1998 four - day bombing of Iraq came during impeachment hearings of President Clinton .
War talk on the campaign stump can be dangerous .
Pakistan must n't be lost as an ally .
Cooler heads in Congress have seen this danger and are proposing a multi-billion dollar aid package for Pakistan aimed at winning over the tribal areas into rejecting militant Islamists .
Perhaps that neocon idea – pushing democracy in other countries as a bulwark against terrorism – is something on which McCain and Obama should safely compete .

At least 19 people have died in a riot at a prison in Mexico - the second outbreak of violence in less than a week .
The inmates were shot as police stormed La Mesa jail , Tijuana , to regain control .
Family members claim the protests were over food and water being withheld since a previous riot on Sunday , which led to the deaths of three prisoners .
It may be the number one question I get from people when they ask about the struggling U.S. automakers :
Who would want these guys if they ever go belly up or get sold ?
While I still believe GM , Ford , and Chrysler can dig their way out of this mess , I also realize that they are dangerously close to getting picked off .
Do n't give me the song and dance that these guys are too big to die , be split up , or outright sold .
Every company has its price , and despite all their flaws , Detroit 's Big 3 have a LOT of value .
Especially to a foreign automaker looking to solidify or establish itself in the U.S. , still the world 's largest and most lucrative auto market .
Which brings us to Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn .
Today in Nashville , Ghosn will open Nissan 's new North American headquarters and in many ways it 's symbolic of a new day dawning for Nissan .
After muddling through the last couple of years , Ghosn 's company is doing much better than the big three , and it 's sales are , for the most part , holding up in a down market .
So why is Ghosn sitting in the catbird seat ?
He 's there because he has the financial strength , need , and I suspect , the desire to expand in the U.S. Nissan 's truck business is its weak link .
So what happens if Chrysler 's parent decides it 's time to split up the struggling automaker ?
Or if Ford finds itself in a nasty financial bind where it needs to partner with a foreign automaker ?
You get the picture .
Ghosn 's in a position where he could get access to America 's profitable pick - up market .
That does n't mean Nissan is about to strike a deal .
But I think you'd be foolish to discount the possibility of Nissan 's leader looking for North American expansion .
Ghosn 's long coveted a " partner " in the U.S. GM was a forced situation a few years ago .
This time , the circumstances are different .

While Apple 's iPhone sales continue to succeed , things just are n't looking any better for AT&T 's network woes , and their dysfunctional relationship has given birth to a second lawsuit .
Several iPhone users on Wednesday morning reported a complete outage of
AT&T 's data service .
Reports have surfaced in
Boston , Chicago , Washington DC and St. Louis ; users have claimed in the Apple support forums that a call to AT&T 's support line confirms the outage .
AT&T's Brad Mays confirmed a " routing issue " in the Northeast region affecting wireless data in the early morning .
He said technicians restored the service by about noon EDT .
The reports of a network outage work to the advantage of customer William Gillis , who filed a lawsuit late last week .
In his 18 - page complaint , Gillis – a retired Chicken of the Sea executive – alleges that AT&T 's network is not strong enough to support the millions of iPhone 3G users , and therefore the handset is not performing as advertised , according to Michael Ian Rott , Gill 's attorney .
" The bottom line is iPhone 3G users are not getting what has been represented to them , " Rott said in a phone interview .
" [ The iPhone 3G ] is kind of like a Dragster : A Dragster can go 500 miles an hour , but you only have a short amount of track space so you 'll never reach that 500 miles per hour ....
Similarly the 3G iPhone is n't working to the specifications Apple represented . "
Gillis 's hypothesis of 3G networks being strained coincides with observations made in Wired.com 's recent study conducted on iPhone 3G download speeds around the world , in which we discovered network performance varied greatly based on carriers and countries .
Users reported the fastest 3G download speeds in Europe , which possesses some of the most mature 3G networks that have been developed since 2001 .
By contrast , AT&T's U.S. 3G network is relatively young , having been introduced in 2004 .
Before today 's reported outage and Gillis 's lawsuit , femtocell developer Dave Nowicki also theorized that in the United States , the iPhone 3G is straining AT&T 's young
3G network .
He explained that AT&T installed the 3G cells on preexisting EDGE transmission towers – meaning those towers were spaced based on the requirements of earlier , 2G technology , which has a longer effective range than 3G .
User complaints about the 3G network have been passionate and widespread ever since the iPhone 3 G's July 11 launch .
The problems have varied from slower - than - advertised 3G performance to getting no 3G connection at all .
Alabama resident Jessica Alena Smith was the first customer angry enough to file a lawsuit , alleging false advertising on Apple 's part for touting the handset as " twice as fast for half the price " compared to the original iPhone .
Smith claims in her complaint that the handset 's network performance is grindingly slow and only stays on the
3G network 25 percent of the time .
Apple 's public relations department has said recently that the latest iPhone software update – 2.0.2 – would improve 3G performance , but very few user reports have backed the company 's claims .
Regardless of what 's said about 3G performance , Apple is continuing to ride the high tide with the iPhone 's popularity .
Insiders have said the
corporation plans to produce 40 to 45 million more iPhone 3Gs in the next year .
Updated 12:20 p.m. PDT with a quote from Gillis 's lawyer and additional background information .

This is the fourth article in the Mind Matters series on the neuroscience behind visual illusions .
Benjamin Franklin once said , “ Never confuse motion with action . ”
But if motion is not action , then what exactly is motion ?
Let ’s break it down .
Imagine you are pointing your video camera at your favorite ball game .
Inside your camera is a lens that focuses the image onto a CCD chip , which is a matrix of light detectors .
How can a matrix of light detectors possibly see a ball rolling ?
The answer is , it ca n ’t .
The camera does n’t see motion whatsoever , because the only thing light detectors can detect is changes in light magnitude , not light position .
If the edge of the ball passes over a single light detector , the detector will react , but that ’s trivially due to fact that the light level on the detector changed as the ball changed position .
The same detector would react identically to a stationary edge that increased its brightness without having moved .
To track the change in position of an object , you need to add something , such as a brain , that can interpret the output of all the detectors in concert .
The photoreceptors of your retina are like the CCD chip in your camera : just a matrix of light detectors .
They individually respond to changes in light level , whether those changes are due to actual motion or to stationary changes in brightness .
Then specialized motion - detection neurons of the brain analyze the responses from populations of photoreceptors to infer motion .
So although Ben Franklin may have admonished that productive activity ( action ) is better than unproductive activity ( motion ) , he was also correct in the neurobiological sense : the perception of motion need not arise from a veridical action in the world .
Rather , the perception of motion occurs when dedicated motion processing neurons in your brain are activated by specific patterns of light intensity changes on your retina .
Because the retina cannot distinguish between the true motion of a light and the sequenced presentation of two ( or more ) adjacent lights , motion detectors in the brain will sometimes misinterpret certain light sequences to be motion .
Vision scientists call such sequences of light “ apparent motion . ”
This illusion is the basis of animation on TV or in movies .
The following pages depict several illusions in which the perception of motion arises from dynamic changes in brightness .
Now , do not to get confused and interpret action from any of these demonstrations .
The motion is all in your head .
Elemental Conditions
The outlined edges of four rectangles modulate in contrast as compared with the centers .
In the top row , the centers of the rectangle are unchanging , but the top - bottom versus left - right edges modulate in counter - phase brightness , rendering the appearance of two breathing boxes .
The second row proves that this effect is due to the contrast of the centers to the edges , and not to the brightness of the edges alone , because the edges are now unchanging , and only the centers of the rectangles modulate in brightness .
This illusion was first described in 1983 by Richard L. Gregory and Priscilla F. Heard , of the University of Bristol .
By showing that the apparent motion is due to the shifting position of the minimal contrast between the outside of the edges versus the inside of the edges ( due to either the modulation of the edges or of the center against a stable gray background ) , Arthur G. Shapiro and Justin P. Charles of Bucknell University won the first prize in the Best Visual Illusion of the Year contest in 2005
House of Cards
Shapiro and Charles went further with their prize - winning entry to show that combining blocks with modulating centers could render twisting effects .
When the same blocks modulate without the contrasted edges , there is no motion illusion .
Lucy in the Sky
By modulating the centers on and off with different rates , Shapiro and Charles showed that different apparent rates of motion could be attributed to different elements of the figure to create undulating shape - changing effects
Perpetual Collisions
Shapiro and Emily Knight of Bucknell University placed in the Top Ten list of the 2008 Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest with this variant that pits background - and edge - modulated rows of diamonds against each other in a perpetual collision that never connects .
Steel Magnolias
Graphic designer Michael Pickard of Sunderland University built on these findings to create a spectacular artistic vision of wind - blown flowers , without a single moving object .
Bouncing Brains
Thorsten Hansen , Kai Hamburger and Karl R. Gegenfurtner of Giessen University were also top ten finalists in the 2007 Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest , with this entry that shows that direction , magnitude and speed of apparent motion in a grid of brains depends on all three : the color of the brains , the direction of the brightness gradient of the brains as a function of the background brightness , and the retinal position of the brains with respect to the viewer ’s center of gaze .
Notice that if you focus your gaze at any one the brains , it moves less than the surrounding brains , and that if you step away from the screen , the brains move more than if you peer very closely at the image on the screen .
Also , the relative speed and direction of the moving brains depends on their color and the direction of the brightness gradient they create with the background ,
Swimmers # 7
Knight and Shapiro combined the various effects of contrast modulation , shading , shape and color to create an unmoving image of illusory but biologically plausible motion , which placed among the top ten finalists of the 2007 Best Visual Illusion of the Year Contest .
Notice that without the modulating background , the effect is lost .

Poll :
Young people who use landlines are more conservative than those who use mobile phones
Are young people who use landlines more conservative than young people who use mobile phones ?
Apparently so , according to the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The Pew project recently got interested the question of whether the explosive growth of mobile phones is making traditional polls irrelevant .
Political polls generally only use landlines to collect their data , but young people — classified as those “ under 30 ” — are more and more foregoing landlines in favor of using only a mobile phone .
( As my last blog entry documented , only 1 % of incoming students at Amherst college have a landline . )
Since young people are also much more likely to be Democratic , the armchair critique is that traditional landline polls underreport Democratic support across the country , and overreport Republican support .
Is this really true , though ?
A group of Pew researchers decided to test the hypothesis .
So they did three polls this year in which 20 - 25 % of the people polled were reached by mobile phone — and then they compared them to polls done purely via landline .
The conclusion ?
Sure , the mobile - phone people were much younger and more Democratic .
But because traditional landline polls are weighted to compensate for age and other demographic differences , they were already pretty well capturing the youthquake .
When the Pew people added in the mobile - phone interviewees , it did n’t change the poll results more than 2 % , which is within the margin of errror .
“ In each of the surveys , there were only small , and not statistically significant , differences between presidential horserace estimates based on the combined interviews and estimates based on the landline surveys only , ” as the Pew researchers wrote in a report on their findings two days ago .
So , all ’s good , right ?
For now , possibly .
But along the way , the Pew people found something different , and really fascinating :
Young people who use landlines are more likely to be Republican than young people who use mobile phones .
They discovered this when they pooled all the under - 30s who been polled via landline and compared them to the under - 30s who ’d been reached on their mobiles .
As the Pew researchers report …
… cell - only young people are considerably less likely than young people reached by landline to identify with or lean to the Republican Party , and even less likely to say they support John McCain .
Among landline respondents under age 30 , there is an 18 - point gap in party identification - 54 % identify or lean Democratic while 36 % are Republican .
Among the cell - only respondents under age 30 , there is a 34 - point gap - 62 % are Democrats , 28 % Republican .
The difference among registered voters on the horserace is similar : 39 % of registered voters under 30 reached by landline favor McCain , compared with just 27 % of cell - only respondents .
Obama is backed by 52 % of landline respondents under 30 , compared with 62 % of the cell - only .
The researchers did n’t offer any hypothesis as to why this would be so , but it ’s kind of interesting to speculate , eh ?
Why precisely would mobile - only youngsters be more Democratic than their peers who use landlines ?
What sort of ideological , psychological or personality elements underpin a desire to avoid landlines , and stick to mobiles ?
It ’s worth figuring out , because in the long run it will begin to affect landline polls .
Why ?
Because , as the Pew researchers note :
Traditional landline surveys are typically weighted to compensate for age and other demographic differences , but the process depends on the assumption that the people reached over landlines are similar politically to their cell - only counterparts .
These surveys suggest that this assumption is increasingly questionable , particularly among younger people .
Emphasis mine .
Interesting stuff , either way !

( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's been a century or so since Britain ruled the waves , but Queen Elizabeth II will soon reign over the wind .
Earlier this year the Crown Estate , which manages royal property worth $ 14 billion and controls the seas up to 14 miles off the British coast , agreed to purchase - for an undisclosed sum - the world 's largest wind turbine .
It 's a 7.5 - megawatt monster to be built by Clipper Windpower of Carpinteria , Calif .
Now the Royal Turbine is getting even bigger : Clipper has revealed to Fortune that Her Majesty 's windmill has been supersized to ten megawatts , producing five times the power generated by typical big turbines currently in commercial operation .
The giant 's wingspan stretches the length of two soccer fields .
At 574 feet , the turbine soars over Big Ben and roughly equals 111 Queen Elizabeths ( the actual queen ) plus one corgi stacked on top of one another .
The Queen 's turbine will displace two million barrels of oil as well as 724,000 tons of CO2 over its lifetime .
This prototype will be the flagship for Clipper 's Britannia Project , an effort to create a new generation of massive - megawatt turbines to be placed on deep - sea floating platforms .
When the windmill goes online in 2012 somewhere off the British coast , it could power 3,700 average homes .
Rule , Britannia , indeed .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The growing financial crisis is a double whammy for police in many U.S. cities :
They face budget cuts as they brace for an expected surge in burglaries , thefts and robberies .
An NYPD police officer closes the block containing the Mexican Consulate on East 39th Street in New York , October 26 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jeff Zelevansky
“ Police departments are going to have do more with less , ” said Chuck Wexler of the Police Executive Research Forum , a national law enforcement association based in Washington .
“ I expect police budgets for the foreseeable future to be flat or decline .
That will mean less ability to put officers on extended tours and overtime during peak crime hours ; it might mean deferring hiring officers for the future , ” he said .
Although there has long been debate over the connection between crime and the economy , most of the criminologists , sociologists and police chiefs interviewed by Reuters forecast a rise in crimes in certain categories in the coming months as the United States heads deeper into recession territory .
Crime has increased during every recession since the late 1950s , said Richard Rosenfeld , a sociologist at the University of Missouri - St Louis .
Those interviewed stressed they were not talking about an increase in overall levels of crime , which have been falling in the United States since the 1990s , but an uptick in opportunistic crimes like theft and burglary .
They say most crimes will still be committed by career criminals but that others in the ranks of the newly unemployed could become drawn in for a variety of reasons .
“ The empirical picture is that when people are unemployed and economic hardship is more widespread , crime seems to be more frequent .
One of the interesting questions will be crime in the middle class .
Will that increase and in what way will it manifest itself ? ” said Tom Blomberg , dean of the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University .
For a case study , he need look no further than Miami , where police have seen a surge in insurance fraud .
Some car owners , for example , finding they can no longer afford their payments , are dumping the vehicles and then reporting them as stolen .
“ We are starting to see middle class people getting arrested for insurance fraud ... because they ca n’t afford the lifestyle they have become accustomed to .
But that is a very small percentage , ” said Miami police chief John Timoney .
SAVING GAS
Timoney said his budget was in good shape thanks to the support of Miami ’s mayor .
However , almost all other police departments in Florida were receiving less revenue , he said .
In a survey of a 200 police agencies by the Police Executive Research Forum in July , 45 percent said the economic downturn had affected their ability to reduce crime , and 39 percent said they had seen their budgets shrink .
Two - thirds or more of a police department ’s budget is eaten up by personnel costs .
In Las Vegas , where revenues from casinos have fallen 15 percent , Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said he had started pairing up his police officers in patrol cars to save on gas .
Other police agencies report similar fuel efficiency measures as well as cutting back on overtime .
Police departments in the United States are funded largely by local property taxes , so they have been hard hit by the subprime mortgage crisis , which forced some Americans to abandon homes they could no longer afford .
In some districts many of those abandoned houses have become magnets for squatters , drug users and criminals who break in to steal valuable copper piping .
Charlie Deane , police chief of Prince William County in Virginia , probably knows more about this than most .
The county , one of the richest in the United States , has close to 3,000 foreclosed , vacant houses .
“ I certainly anticipate that these vacancies being of more of a concern as time goes on .
As more people catch on to the ease with which they can steal , and as the economy gets worse some people will no doubt become more desperate ... to the extent they will steal , ” he said .
The swathe of foreclosures sharply reduced income from property taxes and Deane has already been forced to trim his force of 568 officers by four posts .
His budget is going to be cut again by $ 420,000 , so more police officers may have to go .
Lesley Williams Reid , a sociologist at Georgia State University who has studied urban crime , said any cuts to police budgets would be bad news , particularly if the economic downturn is prolonged and more people become unemployed .
“ I do n’t want to add to a culture of fear , but there is a clear reason to be worried about how this is going to affect crime rates , ” she said .

Some of Fields medalist Alain Connes ‘ revolutionary ideas shed light on how to understand the ‘ zoo ’ of elementary particles thrown up by accelerators like the LHC .
If Connes is right , the key to the fundamental nature of matter lies in graffiti carved on a bridge in Dublin in 1843 .
The graffiti was carved by this man William Rowan Hamilton on Brougham bridge as the ebullient mathematician was passing on a walk with his wife .
According to a plaque there , it read :
I am in Dublin later this week and will be taking my camera .
So how does this answer the mysteries of the Universe ?
According to Alain Connes in his chapter of the multiauthored volume On Space and Time , spacetime indeed has ‘ extra dimensions ’ but these extra dimensions are not those of any usual kind geometry ( curled up or whatever as in string theory ) but something far more imaginative ; they are given mainly by a symbolic algebra defined by this graffiti .
Connes is a Fields medalist , which is like a Nobel Prize for mathematicians ( who were left out in the will of Alfred Nobel .
Incidentally , there is no merit to the popular myth that this was because of an affair between his wife and a mathematician ; he never married ) .
So what that means is that the actual mathematics behind his theory is very deep and very advanced ; I ’ll only be touching on the easier parts in this post .
Well , lets get the maths over with .
The main idea we need is that geometry is algebra .
For example , one can think of a circle as defined concretely by an equation x2+y2=1 in terms unknown variables x , y .
The solutions to this equation among real numbers form a circle .
Similarly , working with an algebra of symbols x , y, z with the same properties for the symbols as ordinary numbers would have and with and additional equation x2+y 2+z2=1 is equivalent to working with a sphere .
Now , the first thing to note about the graffiti is that the symbol i , whatever it is , is the square root of - 1 .
Of course , - 1 does not have a square root among ordinary ( real ) numbers since the product of any such number with itself is positive .
But in high school we learn that we can just add in such an ‘ imaginary number ’ with symbol i to obtain the ‘ complex numbers ’ .
They are used throughout the world by engineers and scientists .
What Hamilton did was to throw in two more such symbols j and k .
But the last relation ijk= - 1 connects them .
This looks innocent but after a little high school algebra you can deduce that ij= - ji .
Oops .
This is impossible for ordinary numbers : 3 x 5 = 5 x 3 and similarly for any two ordinary numbers ( one says that ordinary numbers ‘ commute ’ ) .
So there could never be any usual kind of geometry described by variables i , j , k and the relations of the graffiti .
This is why you need to be much more imaginative and imagine such a geometry even though it does not exist in any usual sense .
You can not visualise it as you can a sphere but you can work with the algebra — the quaternion algebra — as if a geometry did exist .
It ’s an example of a more general notion of ‘ noncommutative geometry ‘ as Connes puts it ( or ‘ quantum geometry ’ is another term that I like ) .
So , let ’s take a copy of this particular noncommutative geometry , i.e a copy of Hamilton ’s quaternions .
Let ’s extend the ordinary spacetime continuum so that at each point in spacetime you have sitting there these imaginary ‘ extra dimensions ’ .
They are n’t curled up , they cant be visualised in the usual way at all , but they are there .
So what ?
Well , Connes now looks at the equations for wave - particles moving in such an extended spacetime and with the symbols i , j , k ( and a bit more of the extension that I have glossed over ) realised concretely as matrices much as in quantum mechanics .
He and his collaborators find that each such wave - particle would appear to us as a collection of ordinary wave - particles exactly matching a good part of the zoo of particles found in particle accelerators .
Is this a coincidence ?
This brings me to what is ultimately a philosophical point .
What does it mean to understand something in fundamental science ?
The point is that when you collide protons in a particle accelerator you get , in the collision fragments , a mess of all different kinds of particles — electrons , muons , tau particles , three flavours of neutrinos , various mesons and hadrons built from up , down , charm , strange .
top and bottom quarks , and particles conveying three fundamental forces ( not counting gravity ) .
But you also get a theoretical mess .
The well - established Standard Model of particle physics boils this down to some extent by identifying certain symmetries among the particles or if you like grouping them together .
But as Connes likes to point out , it still takes a page of complex and disconnected formulae and more than two dozen unexplained parameters to write down this standard model .
The reason its called the ‘ standard model ’ is because it ’s survived more or less unchanged since the 1960s .
So the philosophical question is : is nature messy or should particle physicists try harder ?
Should we be content as zoologists naming and classifying or should be look for a deeper and simpler layer of science as explanation ?
It is certainly true that physicists made some attempts to further ‘ unify ’ their understanding of particle physics ( so called grand - unified theories ) but many of them gave up in the 1980s and 1990s to spend time on more fancy things .
It means that we are no closer to understanding basic things like why electrons and protons etc weigh what they do or why elementary particles fall into three families as they do , among many other mysteries .
But put in the right pure maths and it all starts to make sense .
At the moment Connes ’ theory is not accepted in mainstream physics , but this could change if his current prediction of 168GeV for the mass of the Higgs particle is vindicated in the LHC .
More important for me is that this is a new geometrical point of view on particle ph ysics that is much more economical and constrained than conventional extra dimensions — if we fully understand that geometry ( which Connes encodes as a ‘ Dirac operator ’ but which you could think of as such things as curvature or gravity partly in these ‘ noncommutative ’ extra dimensions ) then we have a route to understanding all the parameters and structure of the zoo completely .

Here 's a little light reading for your day - after - Labor - Day ( or whatever yesterday was where you live ) : Unchecked Exceptions can be Strictly More Powerful than Call / CC , Mark Lillibridge and Olivier Danvy , 1999 , Higher - Order and Symbolic Computation .
We demonstrate that in the context of statically - typed purely - functional lambda calculi without recursion , unchecked exceptions ( e.g. , SML exceptions ) can be strictly more powerful than call / cc .
More precisely , we prove that a natural extension of the simply - typed lambda calculus with unchecked exceptions is strictly more powerful than all known sound extensions of Girardâ€™s FÏ‰ ( a superset of the simply - typed lambda calculus ) with call / cc .
This result is established by showing that the first language is Turing complete while the later languages permit only a subset of the recursive functions to be written .
I have to say that on seeing the title I was surprised : I cut my functional teeth on Scheme and every baby Schemer sucks up the knowledge that call / cc lets you create all manner of flow control including exceptions .
But , as the paper makes clear , that 's not necessarily the case in a statically - typed context .

Here in the land of the Metroliner and the Coach Coast Starlight , it 's easy to be jealous of all the national rail systems that leave Amtrak in the dust .
Now Japan , already home to one of the world 's most sophisticated networks , has given us something new to envy – a greener train that does 217 mph .
Kawasaki Heavy Industries is developing the " Environmentally Friendly Super Express Train " and says it will be Japan 's fastest passenger train ever .
It features an extremely light and aerodynamic profile and uses regenerative braking to capture kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat .
As a result , Kawasaki says , the efSET will be smoother , quieter and more energy efficient than many current trains .
Best of all , it 'll be faster , too .
The train will strengthen a rail system that 's already the envy of the world .
Japan 's Shinkansen bullet train can hit 186 mph crossing the 1,528 mile rail network that spans a country where fast trains are the norm .
The country has tested conventional rail trains capable of 275 mph and maglevs that exceed
361 mph .
Kawasaki says the design of the efSET should be finished by 2010 , at which point it will start building and selling the trains .
It has big plans for the speed demon , too – it hopes to roll out 10,000 kilometers ( about 6,200 miles ) of high - speed railway around the world .
An efSET network in the United States would revolutionize train travel .
A trip between Boston and New York would be cut to less than an hour .
Los Angeles to San Francisco would take less than two hours and a run from Miami to Atlanta would be done in three hours and change .

AUSTIN , Texas -- Materials deep inside Earth have unexpected atomic properties that might force earth scientists to revise their models of Earth 's internal processes , a team of researchers has discovered .
The researchers recreated in the lab the materials , crushing pressures and infernal temperatures they believe exist in the lowermost mantle , nearly 2,900 kilometers ( 1,800 miles ) below Earth 's surface .
They report in the journal Nature Geoscience the materials exhibit rare and unexpected atomic properties that might influence how heat is transferred within Earth 's mantle , how columns of hot rock called superplumes form , and how the magnetic field and heat generated in Earth 's core travel to the planet 's surface .
The planetary building blocks magnesium , silicon , oxygen and iron are the most abundant minerals in the lowermost mantle .
A team of scientists led by Jung - Fu Lin at The University of Texas at Austin 's Jackson School of Geosciences synthesized materials from these building blocks in a diamond anvil cell , a device containing two interlocking diamond pieces that squeeze the sample like a vice .
They subjected the sample to more than 1.3 million times standard atmospheric pressure .
Shining a laser through the transparent diamonds , they then heated the sample to almost 3,000 degrees Celsius ( 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit ) for several days .
The scientists used the nation 's most powerful source of X - rays , a facility at Argonne National Laboratory called a synchrotron light source , to reveal the sample 's electronic and atomic structure .
They determined the high pressures had caused some of the electrons in the sample 's iron , which normally repel each other , to " pair up " or become bound to each other .
Earlier experiments by Lin and others had found evidence for areas in the lower mantle in which electrons were either mostly paired up or were mostly unpaired .
This was the first evidence of a broad region in the subsurface with what scientists describe as " intermediate - spin state , " or partially paired iron electrons .
" We were surprised to find partially paired electrons , " said Lin .
" That does n't normally occur in other geological materials that we know about . "
The degree of electron pairing , also known as electronic spin state , can affect how well the materials conduct heat and electricity .
Lin said modelers who make computer simulations of mantle dynamics will now have to go back and try to determine how this intermediate - spin state might affect the way heat is transferred within Earth , how superplumes form , how convection occurs in the mantle and how Earth 's magnetic field might radiate from the core .
The electronic spin state can also affect the speed of seismic waves traveling through material in the deep mantle .
As a result , seismic images of the lowermost mantle -- collected when earthquake vibrations travel through and reflect off of material in the subsurface -- may have to be reinterpreted .

Nature Geoscience will publish the paper , " Intermediate - Spin Ferrous Iron in Lowermost Mantle Post - Perovskite and Perovskite , " in its October 2008 edition and online Sept. 14 .

As we near the one - year anniversary of Jeff ’s McDonalds - as - pizza - toppings post that the internets loved so well , the Universe has seen fit to bestow upon us a sequel of sorts .
While traveling through Nebraska , Flickr user matthewnstoller and one of his friends happened upon a food cart touting this lovely piece of work :
“ What ’s a Hot Beef Sundae ?
Golden mashed potatoes covered with a generous portion of our roasted and seasoned - to - perfection top round beef .
Then aged cheddar cheese , more golden mashed potatoes smothered with our special beef gravy , more aged cheddar cheese , a slice of buttered toast , and a cherry tomato on top .
A delightfully satisfying meal that you will crave time after time , year after year .
ENJOY ONE RIGHT NOW ! ”
Now , some folks prefer popsicles or ice cream bars to sundaes .
( Even sundaes laden with drippy , seasoned meats and cheeses . )
It ’s true , the popsicle format does offer a more streamlined eating experience and leaves less to be discarded in the end , making it arguably the greener dessert choice between the two .
So in the name of variety , convenience , and protecting the environment , the good people of Nebraska also offer us …
Pizza - On - A - Stick .
What ’s next ?
A spaghetti milkshake ?
ONE of India 's leading AIDS doctors , Alka Deshpande , did not choose her specialisation .
Working as a hospital doctor in Bombay ( now called Mumbai ) in the late 1980s when AIDS was discovered in the city , she merely decided that she was prepared to touch the infected .
Her colleagues would not do so — and perhaps still will not .
According to a recent UN study , over half of Indian health - care workers thought AIDS was transmitted by touch .
In a mostly - Hindu society , which for thousands of years considered one - fifth of its members “ untouchable ” , discrimination and ignorance of this kind have a particularly unpleasant significance .
Indeed , the ways in which AIDS and India 's traditions interact are a striking feature of these essays about the disease in India , commissioned by the Gates Foundation .
On a tour through the south - eastern state of Andhra Pradesh , which has a fifth of India 's estimated 2.5 m HIV cases , Kiran Desai meets women of several hereditary prostitute castes , including relatively affluent beauties who are apparently not unhappy with their lot , as well as wretched sex slaves , pimped by their neighbours .
AIDS haunts them all .
In Karnataka , a hilly southern state , William Dalrymple — the only non-Indian contributor to the collection — meets the inheritors of the now illegal tradition of temple prostitution .
In ancient times , its practitioners included the daughters of royalty , dedicated in childhood to service the devotees of the goddess Yellamma .
The modern lot almost all belong to a single caste of illiterate dalits .
They are distinguishable from run -of - the - mill village prostitutes only by their early entry into the career and therefore a higher probability that they will contract HIV .
Nearly 40 % of Karnataka 's devadasis — literally , slaves of god — are believed to be infected with the virus .
India 's regulations against sodomy and soliciting are another ugly local feature .
By criminalising gay sex and prostitution , these laws have blocked many sincere efforts to quell the virus .
Among Bangalore 's gay men , as described by Mukul Kesevan , one in five has HIV .
They come in three categories : kothis , who specialise in being penetrated ; panthis , who penetrate ; and “ double - deckers ” , who do both .
The kothis , alas , seem a particularly woeful bunch .
Many are rent - boys , perpetually terrorised and periodically raped by the police .
Some are hijras , members of India 's semi-ostracised “ third sex ” .
By contrast , panthis , the transmitters of the AIDS virus , often lead regular family lives .
Almost all these essays are about sex and poor people .
There are two exceptions .
One is an interesting story by Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi about the death of a gay film - maker in Mumbai from AIDS .
The other , by Vikram Seth , is about his own awakening to the virus in California in the 1980s .
Accompanying it is a poem that he wrote at the time , a dying man 's meditation on death , which ends : “ Love me when I am dead / And do not let me die . ”
It is a moving plea .
More typically , these well - to - do writers seem to struggle for empathy with their wretched subjects .
Sunil Gangopadhyay , a Bengali poet , succeeds better than most , with an engaging memoir of wanderings in Sonagachhi , the main red - light district of Kolkata ( previously Calcutta ) .
Ms Desai 's essay is also finely observed : for example , a passage on the miseries of open - air prostitution , along a lonely coast - road , where a woman 's price falls during the monsoon .
Yet an awkward effort to write her father 's terminal cancer into this narrative of suffering suggests her feelings of alienation from it .
Sensibly , perhaps , Sir Salman Rushdie keeps his rather short dispatch from among the hijras of Mumbai more impersonal .
Yet his contribution , which includes a description of a stiff , ex-army father 's begrudging , but complete , acceptance of his hijra son , is one of the best .
As everyone already knows , Google released a new open - source web browser called Chrome .
Having interest in code reuse , I downloaded the source code and examined all the open - source libraries used .
Google Chrome browser shows excellent example of code reuse .
I found that they use at least 25 different software libraries !
Here is the full list of libraries , along with relative paths to source code and short library descriptions .
Many of the libraries have been patched by googlers ; look for README . google files in each library directory for information about changes .
They have done a really good job making these libraries work together .
As someone said , " good coders code , great reuse . "
I also found some other exciting things in the source , which I will soon post about .
I recommend that you subscribe to my rss feed , if you are interested !
Talking about Chrome , I am waiting for Google to add capability to write extensions for their browser !
I already made a list of extensions that I will try to create as soon as they add this feature .
Growing up , we had this probably once a week .
I always thought it was because everyone liked it so much but according to Mama , the frequency of this dessert had a lot more to do with it being so quick , easy , and most importantly : budget friendly .
Generally , most folks have these ingredients on hand .
It does n’t hurt that you do n’t even need an egg for it !
As kids , we always called this “ Mud Pie ” .
I guess it was a fun name for the three of us .
“ We ’re having mud pie for supper ! ” .
I was introduced to the actual name only a few years ago while at a quilt retreat with my mother .
I was speaking with a few of her friends and someone mentioned “ Oh !
I had your mother ’s chocolate cobbler , it was WONDERFUL ! ” .
I was awful confused .
Mama makes chocolate cobbler ?
I ’ve never had chocolate cobbler .
When did she make this ?
Having honestly tasted everything my mother has made in the past thirty — umm … something years , I was a bit put off that she had not shared what was obviously a grand success of a recipe .
After asking her , she shook her head and waved it off “ Oh , its just mud pie ! ” .
This cobbler bakes up magically .
When you pull it out of the oven you ’ll have a rich chocolate cake layer on top and a hot fudge saucy layer beneath .
I highly recommend it be served with ice cream .
We frequently package the dry ingredients and give them along with the recipe as Christmas Gifts .
People are always intrigued by the name and very happy with the results !
You ’ll need some self rising flour ( see my buttermilk biscuit tutorial on how to substitute plain for self rising ) , vegetable oil , milk , sugar , cocoa , brown sugar , and vanilla .
In medium bowl , add flour …
… and white sugar .
Cocoa powder ..
And stir to combine .
To this , add milk …
Vegetable oil …
and vanilla .
Stir .
Until it looks like this .
Spray an 8×8 pan with vegetable spray ( or grease however you like ) .
Spread into prepared pan .
( As always , actual recipe at bottom of page ) .
In a separate bowl , combine brown sugar and more cocoa( As always , actual recipe at bottom of page ) .
Stir …
until it looks like this .
Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of your batter .
SLOWLY pour hot water over batter .
SLOWLY .
SLOWLY

On seven year anniversay of 9/11 ludicrous theory is disseminated
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Thursday , Sept 11 , 2008
One article consisting of five short paragraphs in the London Independent informs us that on this seventh anniversary of 9/11 all the remaining unanswered questions about the collapse of the World Trade Center towers can be “ explained away ” .
Yes , that ’s correct , structural engineers , scientists , professors , congress members , victims ’ families , first responders , intelligence officials and all the other researchers out there who have poured over the collapse of the twin towers for the last 2 556.69539 days , you may all stop reading , put down your pens and turn off your computers because Sergei Dudarev , of the UK Atomic Energy Agency has all the answers .
Mr Dudarev can explain why jet fuel fires burning in isolated pockets for minutes caused two of the world ’s tallest steel buildings to completely collapse into their own footprints at freefall speed , pulverizing concrete and leaving flowing underground rivers of molten metal lasting for weeks .
And the answer is …
“ Unusual magnetic forces ” … IDIOTS , how could you not have worked it out ?
Yes , that ’s correct “ Unusual magnetic forces ” or “ Umf ” for short caused the towers to fall down .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Here is the article in full :
Scientists can finally explain why the Twin Towers collapsed on September 11 , despite the temperature of the fires being well below the 1,500C melting point of the steel girders holding up the buildings .
The discovery that unusual magnetic forces within the girders made them weak at temperatures of about 500C explains away the conspiracy theories that have spread like wildfire since the disaster .
Sergei Dudarev , of the UK Atomic Energy Agency , found that steel loses its strength above 500C because its molecules undergo a physical transition from one state to another due to magnetic fluctuations .
“ The steel did n’t melt , it just became soft .
It is an unusual state and the temperatures in the Twin Towers were high enough to cause it because the thermal insulation was knocked off the girders through the impact with the aircraft , ” he said .
“ Understanding how materials behave means we can find the right ‘ medicine ’ to make steel stronger at high temperatures … and if our work can be used for other applications , such as safeguarding tall buildings against disasters , so much the better , ” he said .
Ahhhhhhhh …
If this dismissive excuse for an article were not so deeply offensive it would be utterly hilarious .
We have previously pointed to the innumerable number of buildings that have suffered roaring fires across the majority of their floors for hours and remained standing .
Seemingly the steel beams in these buildings were not subjected to the same “ unusual magnetic forces ” .
Furthermore , a far more extensive fire occurred in WTC 1 itself , prior to enhanced fireproofing of the building , on February 13 , 1975 .
The fire burned at much higher temperatures for three hours and spread over six floors , including 65 % of the 11th floor and the building core , yet it caused no significant damage to the steel structure and no trusses had to be replaced .
There were no “ unusual magnetic forces ” present on that day .
Early tests conducted on recovered steel beams from the WTC showed that they generally met or were stronger than design requirements , ruling them out as a contributing cause of the collapse of the towers .
Kevin Ryan of Underwriters Laboratories , the company that certified the steel components used in the construction of the WTC towers , sent a letter to Frank Gayle of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) about this .
Ryan wrote :
“ As I ’m sure you know , the company I work for certified the steel components used in the construction of the WTC buildings .
In requesting information from both our CEO and Fire Protection business manager last year , I learned that they did not agree on the essential aspects of the story , except for one thing – that the samples we certified met all requirements .
They suggested we all be patient and understand that UL was working with your team , and that tests would continue through this year .
I ’m aware of UL ’s attempts to help , including performing tests on models of the floor assemblies .
But the results of these tests appear to indicate that the buildings should have easily withstood the thermal stress caused by pools of burning jet fuel .
Ryan was later fired for continually questioning the official story of the World Trade Center collapse .
Furthermore , referring to the collpases , the original NIST report concluded that “ the existing condition of the fireproofing prior to aircraft impact and the fireproofing thickness on the WTC floor system did not play a significant role ” .
Mr Dudarev ’s declaration that “ The steel did n’t melt ” is in direct contradiction to the voluminous amounts of evidence concerning the presence of molten steel underneath both towers and building seven which fell later in the day .
Steel does n’t begin to melt until it reaches temperatures of between 1500 and 2000C , and it does not literally flow like lava until it gets towards 3000C , much hotter than the temperature jet fuel , or in the case of building seven , office material fires burn at .
Building Seven itself , which was not hit by a plane , fell totally into its own footprint in around six seconds after localized fires burned on a select few floors .
Was the building subject to “ unusual magnetic forces ” ?
Not according to NIST , which states in its latest report that it was the first steel structure in history to suffer total collapse as a result of the never before observed “ new phenomenon ” of “ thermal expansion ” .
However , the problem many researchers have with this “ new phenomenon ” , also described by NIST as an “ extraordinary event ” that had never happened before in the history of building collapses , is that it seemed to have been roundly predicted by news stations and ground zero workers a hour or more in advance of it actually occurring .
Proclaiming “ unusual magnetic forces ” , “ extraordinary events ” and “ new phenomenons ” smacks of a desperate attempt to ventilate the authority of the official story , when in reality these ludicrous claims , the latest in a long line of changing explanations and contradictory accounts , only make the government sanctioned 9/11 account look more untrustworthy than ever before .

Barack Obama : American Stories ran on CBS , Fox , and NBC last night , and according to preliminary Nielsen ratings , the " Obamamercial " was a success , pulling in 26.3 million viewers ( 29.9 33.5 million if you add in Univision . )
The show featured 4 mini -docs about folks Obama has met on the campaign trail , followed by a recap of his policy proposals .
Generally , critics were impressed with production values , from the Aaron Copland - esque soundtrack , to montages of cornfields , to the set , which looked like an oak paneled version of the Oval Office .
But the biggest accolades went to Obama himself , who clearly spent some time studying at the Martin Sheen School of Appearing Presidential on Television .
" Obama is the first person I 've seen looking like an American president in quite a long time , " snarked The Guardian .
Read on for more analysis of his performance and Emmy award chances .
Newsweek
Ultimately , the entire Obamamercial was designed to provide voters with a preview of what it will feel like to welcome Obama in their living rooms for the next four years .
The presidency is the most personal of America 's elective offices , and it is through the TV set , in the privacy of our own homes , that the relationship between the president and the people develops .
More than the convention , or the debates , or any 30 - second spot , the Obamamercial simulated how the country would interact with Obama if he were elected president — with him on one side of the screen , perched at a large , flag - framed desk , and us on the other , slumped on the couch .
It was almost as if the election was already over , Obama was speaking from the Oval Office and the country was still standing .
And that was the point .

The Guardian
Given George Bush 's disappearing act and his showing up for pressers these days with all the confidence and enthusiasm of day - old toast , and John McCain 's seeming less like a competitor and potential leader than a disgruntled spectator , shouting crankily from the sidelines about the wretched unfairness of being denied what he believes he 's entitled , Obama is the first person I 've seen looking like an American president in quite a long time .

The ordinary - American stories worked very well , emotionally and aesthetically .
At times I thought I was watching Friday Night Lights , what with all the plangent Americana music , small - town tableaus and little league football ...
But I would have cut every single politician from the piece , with the exception maybe of Joe Biden , and made room for a couple more of the stories .
I do n't know ; to wiser political minds than mine , maybe there was some microtargeting case that X thousand voters in Ohio , New Mexico and Virginia would be moved by seeing their governors get air time .
But having a bunch of Democrats tell us how wonderful a figure a fellow Democrat is clashed with the ordinariness of the other stories .
( What 's so persuasive here ?
Wow , a bunch of VP short - listers possibly in line for Cabinet positions have nice things to say about him !
He must really be special ! )
They ( and the Obama - seated - at - desk segments ) seemed like campaign commercials within a commercial .

The New Republic
In between the standard - fare bits , Obama channeled a Katie Couric vibe , gently relating other people 's stories exactly like a soft - news anchor does ... the person he presented himself as tonight was a listener , a gatherer of stories , a reporter , somebody who 's interested in the pure , gritty texture of his interlocutors ' lives , and not merely in the way their lives happen to illustrate his abstract positions .
At one juncture , he gave a shout - out to a woman he'd met in Iowa whose son had recently deployed .
The reminiscence did n't even entirely have a point .
Its goal was to telegraph that he was listening , even to the random people on the trail who — unlike , say , Joe the Plumber — were never destined to become symbols .

The Washington Post
Although McCain was not seen during the half - hour , one could easily summon the contrasting image of the Republican while watching Obama .
McCain has come across on television as relatively worried , whiny , fusty and falsely folksy .
He brought bad news ; he has come to epitomize and personify it .
Obama brings you medication along with the list of symptoms ; he has developed a great bedside , as well as fireside , manner .
It was the easiest thing in the world , watching the skillfully edited hodgepodge put together by his campaign , to picture Obama as president .

Commentary
[ Obama ] seemed rather passive .
He literally was the narrator .
He did n’t tell us what he ’s done and why we should think he really can solve these people ’s problems .
( Sen . Dick Durbin said in passing he was in the state legislature — but did what ?
Joe Biden recycles Obama ’s supposed “ leadership ” on the nuclear proliferation bill once again . )
But you just have to take it on faith , you see , that he is capable of doing things and making good choices .
Becasue it ’s not what he ’s done ; it ’s what he says that matters .
He is not exactly a whirlwind of action and activity .

The National Review
As for the format of the special itself , aesthetically it was a bit nauseating with all the soft focus and generically uplifing music constantly swelling in and out .
As for the content : I 'm sorry . . . it 's not that I do n't care about those experiencing hardship — quite the contrary — but the last thing that should be driving America 's voting habits is a half - hour of Manipulative Portraits of Downtrodden Victims of Shadowy Governmental Forces .
Whatever our problems are right now , America is not one big breadline .
To be fair , all politicians exploit these anecdotal cases but I think Obama 's special really pushed the boundaries of my bile duct here .

The Weekly Standard
Sitting through the Very Special Episode of Obama for President tonight felt awfully familiar .
It 's like one of those required assemblies from middle school : hectoring , tedious , and transparently silly .
But it did have one unexpected effect on me .
Never before have I noticed how wonderful commercials are .
It 's not until you 're forced to go without the Geico cavemen for 30 straight minutes that you realize how much you appreciate them .

Today the automobile is the most uneconomical user of energy .
Its efficiency is 5 % compared with 23 % for the Diesel - electric railway .
It is the most ravenous devourer of fossil fuels , accounting for over half of the total oil consumption in this country .
Fossil fuels resemble capital in the bank .
A prudent and responsible parent will use his capital sparingly in order to pass on to his children as much as possible of his inheritance .
A selfish and irresponsible parent will squander it in riotous living and care not one whit how his offspring will fare .
M. King Hubbert made his views about peak oil known in 1956 , at a meeting of the American Petroleum Institute .
Many people do n't know that only a year later , in 1957 , Admiral Hyman Rickover started trying to publicize the fact that fossil fuels are finite , and were likely to peak in the first half of the 21st century .
Many of the things he said then are words we wish people had listened to years ago :
On May 14 , 1957 , Admiral Hyman Rickover gave a speech to the Minnesota State Medical Association called " Energy Resources and our Future . "
This speech was posted in December 2006 on the Energy Bulletin , and also appeared on The Oil Drum .
This speech was made available by the work of two people : Theodore Rockwell , author of The Rickover Effect : How One Man Made a Difference , who had this article in his files , and Rick Lakin , who sought out the article and converted it to digital form .
Since the speach is one many will want to read , we are repeating it again .
Energy Resources and our Future
I am honored to be here tonight , though it is no easy thing , I assure you , for a layman to face up to an audience of physicians .
A single one of you , sitting behind his desk , can be quite formidable .
My speech has no medical connotations .
This may be a relief to you after the solid professional fare you have been absorbing .
I should like to discuss a matter which will , I hope , be of interest to you as responsible citizens : the significance of energy resources in the shaping of our future .
We live in what historians may some day call the Fossil Fuel Age .
Today coal , oil , and natural gas supply 93 % of the world 's energy ; water power accounts for only 1 % ; and the labor of men and domestic animals the remaining 6 % .
This is a startling reversal of corresponding figures for 1850 - only a century ago .
Then fossil fuels supplied 5 % of the world 's energy , and men and animals 94 % .
Five sixths of all the coal , oil , and gas consumed since the beginning of the Fossil Fuel Age has been burned up in the last 55 years .
These fuels have been known to man for more than 3,000 years .
In parts of China , coal was used for domestic heating and cooking , and natural gas for lighting as early as 1000 B.C. The Babylonians burned asphalt a thousand years earlier .
But these early uses were sporadic and of no economic significance .
Fossil fuels did not become a major source of energy until machines running on coal , gas , or oil were invented .
Wood , for example , was the most important fuel until 1880 when it was replaced by coal ; coal , in turn , has only recently been surpassed by oil in this country .
Once in full swing , fossil fuel consumption has accelerated at phenomenal rates .
All the fossil fuels used before 1900 would not last five years at today 's rates of consumption .
Nowhere are these rates higher and growing faster than in the United States .
Our country , with only 6 % of the world 's population , uses one third of the world 's total energy input ; this proportion would be even greater except that we use energy more efficiently than other countries .
Each American has at his disposal , each year , energy equivalent to that obtainable from eight tons of coal .
This is six times the world 's per capita energy consumption .
Though not quite so spectacular , corresponding figures for other highly industrialized countries also show above average consumption figures .
The United Kingdom , for example , uses more than three times as much energy as the world average .
With high energy consumption goes a high standard of living .
Thus the enormous fossil energy which we in this country control feeds machines which make each of us master of an army of mechanical slaves .
Man 's muscle power is rated at 35 watts continuously , or one - twentieth horsepower .
Machines therefore furnish every American industrial worker with energy equivalent to that of 244 men , while at least 2,000 men push his automobile along the road , and his family is supplied with 33 faithful household helpers .
Each locomotive engineer controls energy equivalent to that of 100,000 men ; each jet pilot of 700,000 men .
Truly , the humblest American enjoys the services of more slaves than were once owned by the richest nobles , and lives better than most ancient kings .
In retrospect , and despite wars , revolutions , and disasters , the hundred years just gone by may well seem like a Golden Age .
Whether this Golden Age will continue depends entirely upon our ability to keep energy supplies in balance with the needs of our growing population .
Before I go into this question , let me review briefly the role of energy resources in the rise and fall of civilizations .
Possession of surplus energy is , of course , a requisite for any kind of civilization , for if man possesses merely the energy of his own muscles , he must expend all his strength - mental and physical - to obtain the bare necessities of life .
Surplus energy provides the material foundation for civilized living - a comfortable and tasteful home instead of a bare shelter ; attractive clothing instead of mere covering to keep warm ; appetizing food instead of anything that suffices to appease hunger .
It provides the freedom from toil without which there can be no art , music , literature , or learning .
There is no need to belabor the point .
What lifted man - one of the weaker mammals - above the animal world was that he could devise , with his brain , ways to increase the energy at his disposal , and use the leisure so gained to cultivate his mind and spirit .
Where man must rely solely on the energy of his own body , he can sustain only the most meager existence .
Man 's first step on the ladder of civilization dates from his discovery of fire and his domestication of animals .
With these energy resources he was able to build a pastoral culture .
To move upward to an agricultural civilization he needed more energy .
In the past this was found in the labor of dependent members of large patriarchal families , augmented by slaves obtained through purchase or as war booty .
There are some backward communities which to this day depend on this type of energy .
Slave labor was necessary for the city - states and the empires of antiquity ; they frequently had slave populations larger than their free citizenry .
As long as slaves were abundant and no moral censure attached to their ownership , incentives to search for alternative sources of energy were lacking ; this may well have been the single most important reason why engineering advanced very little in ancient times .
A reduction of per capita energy consumption has always in the past led to a decline in civilization and a reversion to a more primitive way of life .
For example , exhaustion of wood fuel is believed to have been the primary reason for the fall of the Mayan Civilization on this continent and of the decline of once flourishing civilizations in Asia .
India and China once had large forests , as did much of the Middle East .
Deforestation not only lessened the energy base but had a further disastrous effect : lacking plant cover , soil washed away , and with soil erosion the nutritional base was reduced as well .
Another cause of declining civilization comes with pressure of population on available land .
A point is reached where the land can no longer support both the people and their domestic animals .
Horses and mules disappear first .
Finally even the versatile water buffalo is displaced by man who is two and one half times as efficient an energy converter as are draft animals .
It must always be remembered that while domestic animals and agricultural machines increase productivity per man , maximum productivity per acre is achieved only by intensive manual cultivation .
It is a sobering thought that the impoverished people of Asia , who today seldom go to sleep with their hunger completely satisfied , were once far more civilized and lived much better than the people of the West .
And not so very long ago , either .
It was the stories brought back by Marco Polo of the marvelous civilization in China which turned Europe 's eyes to the riches of the East , and induced adventurous sailors to brave the high seas in their small vessels searching for a direct route to the fabulous Orient .
The " wealth of the Indies " is a phrase still used , but whatever wealth may be there it certainly is not evident in the life of the people today .
Asia failed to keep technological pace with the needs of her growing populations and sank into such poverty that in many places man has become again the primary source of energy , since other energy converters have become too expensive .
This must be obvious to the most casual observer .
What this means is quite simply a reversion to a more primitive stage of civilization with all that it implies for human dignity and happiness .
Anyone who has watched a sweating Chinese farm worker strain at his heavily laden wheelbarrow , creaking along a cobblestone road , or who has flinched as he drives past an endless procession of human beasts of burden moving to market in Java - the slender women bent under mountainous loads heaped on their heads - anyone who has seen statistics translated into flesh and bone , realizes the degradation of man 's stature when his muscle power becomes the only energy source he can afford .
Civilization must wither when human beings are so degraded .
Where slavery represented a major source of energy , its abolition had the immediate effect of reducing energy consumption .
Thus when this time - honored institution came under moral censure by Christianity , civilization declined until other sources of energy could be found .
Slavery is incompatible with Christian belief in the worth of the humblest individual as a child of God .
As Christianity spread through the Roman Empire and masters freed their slaves - in obedience to the teaching of the Church - the energy base of Roman civilization crumbled .
This , some historians believe , may have been a major factor in the decline of Rome and the temporary reversion to a more primitive way of life during the Dark Ages .
Slavery gradually disappeared throughout the Western world , except in its milder form of serfdom .
That it was revived a thousand years later merely shows man 's ability to stifle his conscience - at least for a while - when his economic needs are great .
Eventually , even the needs of overseas plantation economies did not suffice to keep alive a practice so deeply repugnant to Western man 's deepest convictions .
It may well be that it was unwillingness to depend on slave labor for their energy needs which turned the minds of medieval Europeans to search for alternate sources of energy , thus sparking the Power Revolution of the Middle Ages which , in turn , paved the way for the Industrial Revolution of the 19th Century .
When slavery disappeared in the West engineering advanced .
Men began to harness the power of nature by utilizing water and wind as energy sources .
The sailing ship , in particular , which replaced the slave - driven galley of antiquity , was vastly improved by medieval shipbuilders and became the first machine enabling man to control large amounts of inanimate energy .
The next important high - energy converter used by Europeans was gunpowder - an energy source far superior to the muscular strength of the strongest bowman or lancer .
With ships that could navigate the high seas and arms that could outfire any hand weapon , Europe was now powerful enough to preempt for herself the vast empty areas of the Western Hemisphere into which she poured her surplus populations to build new nations of European stock .
With these ships and arms she also gained political control over populous areas in Africa and Asia from which she drew the raw materials needed to speed her industrialization , thus complementing her naval and military dominance with economic and commercial supremacy .
When a low - energy society comes in contact with a high - energy society , the advantage always lies with the latter .
The Europeans not only achieved standards of living vastly higher than those of the rest of the world , but they did this while their population was growing at rates far surpassing those of other peoples .
In fact , they doubled their share of total world population in the short span of three centuries .
From one sixth in 1650 , the people of European stock increased to almost one third of total world population by 1950 .
Meanwhile much of the rest of the world did not even keep energy sources in balance with population growth .
Per capita energy consumption actually diminished in large areas .
It is this difference in energy consumption which has resulted in an ever - widening gap between the one - third minority who live in high - energy countries and the two - thirds majority who live in low - energy areas .
These so - called underdeveloped countries are now finding it far more difficult to catch up with the fortunate minority than it was for Europe to initiate transition from low - energy to high - energy consumption .
For one thing , their ratio of land to people is much less favorable ; for another , they have no outlet for surplus populations to ease the transition since all the empty spaces have already been taken over by people of European stock .
Almost all of today 's low - energy countries have a population density so great that it perpetuates dependence on intensive manual agriculture which alone can yield barely enough food for their people .
They do not have enough acreage , per capita , to justify using domestic animals or farm machinery , although better seeds , better soil management , and better hand tools could bring some improvement .
A very large part of their working population must nevertheless remain on the land , and this limits the amount of surplus energy that can be produced .
Most of these countries must choose between using this small energy surplus to raise their very low standard of living or postpone present rewards for the sake of future gain by investing the surplus in new industries .
The choice is difficult because there is no guarantee that today 's denial may not prove to have been in vain .
This is so because of the rapidity with which public health measures have reduced mortality rates , resulting in population growth as high or even higher than that of the high - energy nations .
Theirs is a bitter choice ; it accounts for much of their anti-Western feeling and may well portend a prolonged period of world instability .
How closely energy consumption is related to standards of living may be illustrated by the example of India .
Despite intelligent and sustained efforts made since independence , India 's per capita income is still only 20 cents daily ; her infant mortality is four times ours ; and the life expectance of her people is less than one half that of the industrialized countries of the West .
These are ultimate consequences of India 's very low energy consumption : one - fourteenth of world average ; one - eightieth of ours .
Ominous , too , is the fact that while world food production increased 9 % in the six years from 1945 - 51 , world population increased by 12 % .
Not only is world population increasing faster than world food production , but unfortunately , increases in food production tend to occur in the already well - fed , high - energy countries rather than in the undernourished , low - energy countries where food is most lacking .
I think no further elaboration is needed to demonstrate the significance of energy resources for our own future .
Our civilization rests upon a technological base which requires enormous quantities of fossil fuels .
What assurance do we then have that our energy needs will continue to be supplied by fossil fuels :
The answer is - in the long run - none .
The earth is finite .
Fossil fuels are not renewable .
In this respect our energy base differs from that of all earlier civilizations .
They could have maintained their energy supply by careful cultivation .
We cannot .
Fuel that has been burned is gone forever .
Fuel is even more evanescent than metals .
Metals , too , are non-renewable resources threatened with ultimate extinction , but something can be salvaged from scrap .
Fuel leaves no scrap and there is nothing man can do to rebuild exhausted fossil fuel reserves .
They were created by solar energy 500 million years ago and took eons to grow to their present volume .
In the face of the basic fact that fossil fuel reserves are finite , the exact length of time these reserves will last is important in only one respect : the longer they last , the more time do we have , to invent ways of living off renewable or substitute energy sources and to adjust our economy to the vast changes which we can expect from such a shift .
Fossil fuels resemble capital in the bank .
A prudent and responsible parent will use his capital sparingly in order to pass on to his children as much as possible of his inheritance .
A selfish and irresponsible parent will squander it in riotous living and care not one whit how his offspring will fare .
Engineers whose work familiarizes them with energy statistics ; far - seeing industrialists who know that energy is the principal factor which must enter into all planning for the future ; responsible governments who realize that the well - being of their citizens and the political power of their countries depend on adequate energy supplies - all these have begun to be concerned about energy resources .
In this country , especially , many studies have been made in the last few years , seeking to discover accurate information on fossil - fuel reserves and foreseeable fuel needs .
Statistics involving the human factor are , of course , never exact .
The size of usable reserves depends on the ability of engineers to improve the efficiency of fuel extraction and use .
It also depends on discovery of new methods to obtain energy from inferior resources at costs which can be borne without unduly depressing the standard of living .
Estimates of future needs , in turn , rely heavily on population figures which must always allow for a large element of uncertainty , particularly as man reaches a point where he is more and more able to control his own way of life .
Current estimates of fossil fuel reserves vary to an astonishing degree .
In part this is because the results differ greatly if cost of extraction is disregarded or if in calculating how long reserves will last , population growth is not taken into consideration ; or , equally important , not enough weight is given to increased fuel consumption required to process inferior or substitute metals .
We are rapidly approaching the time when exhaustion of better grade metals will force us to turn to poorer grades requiring in most cases greater expenditure of energy per unit of metal .
But the most significant distinction between optimistic and pessimistic fuel reserve statistics is that the optimists generally speak of the immediate future - the next twenty - five years or so - while the pessimists think in terms of a century from now .
A century or even two is a short span in the history of a great people .
It seems sensible to me to take a long view , even if this involves facing unpleasant facts .
For it is an unpleasant fact that according to our best estimates , total fossil fuel reserves recoverable at not over twice today 's unit cost , are likely to run out at some time between the years 2000 and 2050 , if present standards of living and population growth rates are taken into account .
Oil and natural gas will disappear first , coal last .
There will be coal left in the earth , of course .
But it will be so difficult to mine that energy costs would rise to economically intolerable heights , so that it would then become necessary either to discover new energy sources or to lower standards of living drastically .
For more than one hundred years we have stoked ever growing numbers of machines with coal ; for fifty years we have pumped gas and oil into our factories , cars , trucks , tractors , ships , planes , and homes without giving a thought to the future .
Occasionally the voice of a Cassandra has been raised only to be quickly silenced when a lucky discovery revised estimates of our oil reserves upward , or a new coalfield was found in some remote spot .
Fewer such lucky discoveries can be expected in the future , especially in industrialized countries where extensive mapping of resources has been done .
Yet the popularizers of scientific news would have us believe that there is no cause for anxiety , that reserves will last thousands of years , and that before they run out science will have produced miracles .
Our past history and security have given us the sentimental belief that the things we fear will never really happen - that everything turns out right in the end .
But , prudent men will reject these tranquilizers and prefer to face the facts so that they can plan intelligently for the needs of their posterity .
Looking into the future , from the mid-20th Century , we cannot feel overly confident that present high standards of living will of a certainty continue through the next century and beyond .
Fossil fuel costs will soon definitely begin to rise as the best and most accessible reserves are exhausted , and more effort will be required to obtain the same energy from remaining reserves .
It is likely also that liquid fuel synthesized from coal will be more expensive .
Can we feel certain that when economically recoverable fossil fuels are gone science will have learned how to maintain a high standard of living on renewable energy sources ?
I believe it would be wise to assume that the principal renewable fuel sources which we can expect to tap before fossil reserves run out will supply only 7 to 15 % of future energy needs .
The five most important of these renewable sources are wood fuel , farm wastes , wind , water power , and solar heat .
Wood fuel and farm wastes are dubious as substitutes because of growing food requirements to be anticipated .
Land is more likely to be used for food production than for tree crops ; farm wastes may be more urgently needed to fertilize the soil than to fuel machines .
Wind and water power can furnish only a very small percentage of our energy needs .
Moreover , as with solar energy , expensive structures would be required , making use of land and metals which will also be in short supply .
Nor would anything we know today justify putting too much reliance on solar energy though it will probably prove feasible for home heating in favorable localities and for cooking in hot countries which lack wood , such as India .
More promising is the outlook for nuclear fuels .
These are not , properly speaking , renewable energy sources , at least not in the present state of technology , but their capacity to " breed " and the very high energy output from small quantities of fissionable material , as well as the fact that such materials are relatively abundant , do seem to put nuclear fuels into a separate category from exhaustible fossil fuels .
The disposal of radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants is , however , a problem which must be solved before there can be any widespread use of nuclear power .
Another limit in the use of nuclear power is that we do not know today how to employ it otherwise than in large units to produce electricity or to supply heating .
Because of its inherent characteristics , nuclear fuel cannot be used directly in small machines , such as cars , trucks , or tractors .
It is doubtful that it could in the foreseeable future furnish economical fuel for civilian airplanes or ships , except very large ones .
Rather than nuclear locomotives , it might prove advantageous to move trains by electricity produced in nuclear central stations .
We are only at the beginning of nuclear technology , so it is difficult to predict what we may expect .
Transportation - the lifeblood of all technically advanced civilizations - seems to be assured , once we have borne the initial high cost of electrifying railroads and replacing buses with streetcars or interurban electric trains .
But , unless science can perform the miracle of synthesizing automobile fuel from some energy source as yet unknown or unless trolley wires power electric automobiles on all streets and highways , it will be wise to face up to the possibility of the ultimate disappearance of automobiles , trucks , buses , and tractors .
Before all the oil is gone and hydrogenation of coal for synthetic liquid fuels has come to an end , the cost of automotive fuel may have risen to a point where private cars will be too expensive to run and public transportation again becomes a profitable business .
Today the automobile is the most uneconomical user of energy .
Its efficiency is 5 % compared with 23 % for the Diesel - electric railway .
It is the most ravenous devourer of fossil fuels , accounting for over half of the total oil consumption in this country .
And the oil we use in the United States in one year took nature about 14 million years to create .
Curiously , the automobile , which is the greatest single cause of the rapid exhaustion of oil reserves , may eventually be the first fuel consumer to suffer .
Reduction in automotive use would necessitate an extraordinarily costly reorganization of the pattern of living in industrialized nations , particularly in the United States .
It would seem prudent to bear this in mind in future planning of cities and industrial locations .
Our present known reserves of fissionable materials are many times as large as our net economically recoverable reserves of coal .
A point will be reached before this century is over when fossil fuel costs will have risen high enough to make nuclear fuels economically competitive .
Before that time comes we shall have to make great efforts to raise our entire body of engineering and scientific knowledge to a higher plateau .
We must also induce many more young Americans to become metallurgical and nuclear engineers .
Else we shall not have the knowledge or the people to build and run the nuclear power plants which ultimately may have to furnish the major part of our energy needs .
If we start to plan now , we may be able to achieve the requisite level of scientific and engineering knowledge before our fossil fuel reserves give out , but the margin of safety is not large .
This is also based on the assumption that atomic war can be avoided and that population growth will not exceed that now calculated by demographic experts .
War , of course , cancels all man 's expectations .
Even growing world tension just short of war could have far - reaching effects .
In this country it might , on the one hand , lead to greater conservation of domestic fuels , to increased oil imports , and to an acceleration in scientific research which might turn up unexpected new energy sources .
On the other hand , the resulting armaments race would deplete metal reserves more rapidly , hastening the day when inferior metals must be utilized with consequent greater expenditure of energy .
Underdeveloped nations with fossil fuel deposits might be coerced into withholding them from the free world or may themselves decide to retain them for their own future use .
The effect on Europe , which depends on coal and oil imports , would be disastrous and we would have to share our own supplies or lose our allies .
Barring atomic war or unexpected changes in the population curve , we can count on an increase in world population from two and one half billion today to four billion in the year 2000 ; six to eight billion by 2050 .
The United States is expected to quadruple its population during the 20th Century - from 75 million in 1900 to 300 million in 2000 - and to reach at least 375 million in 2050 .
This would almost exactly equal India 's present population which she supports on just a little under half of our land area .
It is an awesome thing to contemplate a graph of world population growth from prehistoric times - tens of thousands of years ago - to the day after tomorrow - let us say the year 2000 A.D.
If we visualize the population curve as a road which starts at sea level and rises in proportion as world population increases , we should see it stretching endlessly , almost level , for 99 % of the time that man has inhabited the earth .
In 6000 B.C. , when recorded history begins , the road is running at a height of about 70 feet above sea level , which corresponds to a population of 10 million .
Seven thousand years later - in 1000 A.D. - the road has reached an elevation of 1,600 feet ; the gradation now becomes steeper , and 600 years later the road is 2,900 feet high .
During the short span of the next 400 years - from 1600 to 2000 - it suddenly turns sharply upward at an almost perpendicular inclination and goes straight up to an elevation of 29,000 feet - the height of Mt. Everest , the world 's tallest mountain .
In the 8,000 years from the beginning of history to the year 2000 A.D. world population will have grown from 10 million to 4 billion , with 90 % of that growth taking place during the last 5 % of that period , in 400 years .
It took the first 3,000 years of recorded history to accomplish the first doubling of population , 100 years for the last doubling , but the next doubling will require only 50 years .
Calculations give us the astonishing estimate that one out of every 20 human beings born into this world is alive today .
The rapidity of population growth has not given us enough time to readjust our thinking .
Not much more than a century ago our country - the very spot on which I now stand was a wilderness in which a pioneer could find complete freedom from men and from government .
If things became too crowded - if he saw his neighbor 's chimney smoke - he could , and often did , pack up and move west .
We began life in 1776 as a nation of less than four million people - spread over a vast continent - with seemingly inexhaustible riches of nature all about .
We conserved what was scarce - human labor - and squandered what seemed abundant - natural resources - and we are still doing the same today .
Much of the wilderness which nurtured what is most dynamic in the American character has now been buried under cities , factories and suburban developments where each picture window looks out on nothing more inspiring than the neighbor 's back yard with the smoke of his fire in the wire basket clearly visible .
Life in crowded communities cannot be the same as life on the frontier .
We are no longer free , as was the pioneer - to work for our own immediate needs regardless of the future .
We are no longer as independent of men and of government as were Americans two or three generations ago .
An ever larger share of what we earn must go to solve problems caused by crowded living - bigger governments ; bigger city , state , and federal budgets to pay for more public services .
Merely to supply us with enough water and to carry away our waste products becomes more difficult and expansive daily .
More laws and law enforcement agencies are needed to regulate human relations in urban industrial communities and on crowded highways than in the America of Thomas Jefferson .
Certainly no one likes taxes , but we must become reconciled to larger taxes in the larger America of tomorrow .
I suggest that this is a good time to think soberly about our responsibilities to our descendants - those who will ring out the Fossil Fuel Age .
Our greatest responsibility , as parents and as citizens , is to give America 's youngsters the best possible education .
We need the best teachers and enough of them to prepare our young people for a future immeasurably more complex than the present , and calling for ever larger numbers of competent and highly trained men and women .
This means that we must not delay building more schools , colleges , and playgrounds .
It means that we must reconcile ourselves to continuing higher taxes to build up and maintain at decent salaries a greatly enlarged corps of much better trained teachers , even at the cost of denying ourselves such momentary pleasures as buying a bigger new car , or a TV set , or household gadget .
We should find - I believe - that these small self - denials would be far more than offset by the benefits they would buy for tomorrow 's America .
We might even - if we wanted - give a break to these youngsters by cutting fuel and metal consumption a little here and there so as to provide a safer margin for the necessary adjustments which eventually must be made in a world without fossil fuels .
One final thought I should like to leave with you .
High - energy consumption has always been a prerequisite of political power .
The tendency is for political power to be concentrated in an ever - smaller number of countries .
Ultimately , the nation which controls the largest energy resources will become dominant .
If we give thought to the problem of energy resources , if we act wisely and in time to conserve what we have and prepare well for necessary future changes , we shall insure this dominant position for our own country .
Edit :
For those wanting further evidence that this speech was actually given , this is a link to a scanned in version of a Christian Science Monitor article dated June 5 , 1957 , reporting on the speech .
This is a small piece of news about a technology that could have a very large impact some time in the future .
VASIMR stands for Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket , and is a type of propulsion using plasma that could reduce flight times by a huge amount ... luckily NASA does a better job of explaining the technology than I could , so I 'll just quote them from here :
One possible way to change that would be the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ( VASIMR ) .
Test of the VASIMR engine .
Not only would VASIMR allow for faster space travel , it would have some pretty incredible side benefits , as well .
For example , NASA researchers believe that VASIMR would be able to travel to Mars much more quickly than a contemporary chemical - powered rocket , and then , once there , to refuel on Mars for the return flight to Earth .
The VASIMR engine could also even help protect astronauts from the dangerous effects of radiation during their trip .
In the less - distant future , VASIMR could even help keep the International Space Station ( ISS ) in orbit without requiring extra fuel to be brought up from Earth .
VASIMR is a plasma - based propulsion system .
An electric power source is used to ionize fuel into plasma .
Electric fields heat and accelerate the plasma while the magnetic fields direct the plasma in the proper direction as it is ejected from the engine , creating thrust for the spacecraft .
The engine can even vary the amount of thrust generated , allowing it to increase or decrease its acceleration .
It even features an " afterburner " mode that sacrifices fuel efficiency for additional speed .
Possible fuels for the VASIMR engine could include hydrogen , helium , and deuterium .
The use of hydrogen as the fuel for the VASIMR project has many side benefits , according to researcher Franklin Chang - Diaz .
In addition to being the director of the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory , Chang - Diaz is an astronaut who has flown into space on seven missions , more than any other NASA astronaut .
" We 're likely to find hydrogen pretty much anywhere we go in the solar system , " he said .
What this means is that a VASIMR - powered spacecraft could be launched with only enough fuel to get to its destination , such as Mars , and then pick up more hydrogen upon arrival to serve as fuel for the return trip home .
Another benefit of hydrogen fuel is that hydrogen is the best known radiation shield , so the fuel for the VASIMR engine could also be used to protect the crew from harmful effects of radiation exposure during the flight .
Current VASIMR designs should be capable of producing specific impulses ranging from 3,000 to 30,000 seconds ( jet velocities 30 to 300 km / s ) .
The low end of this range is comparable to some ion thruster designs .
By adjusting the manner of plasma production and plasma heating , a VASIMR can control the specific impulse and thrust .
VASIMR is also capable of processing much higher power levels ( megawatts ) than existing ion thruster electric propulsion designs .
Therefore it can provide orders of magnitude higher thrust , provided a suitable power source can be provided .
NASA expects to sign an agreement to test a new propulsion system on the International Space Station , according to the US space agency 's administrator Michael Griffin .
At the AirVenture show in Oshkosh on 29 July , Griffin was asked about the status of NASA 's advanced space propulsion research .
His reply referred to the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket ( Vasimir ) .
Wikipedia also has the following :
The way I understand it , VASIMR combines the best parts of chemical rockets and ion thrusters .
Chemical rockets are inefficient and result in having to lug up huge amounts of fuel for relatively little gain , ion thrusters are efficient but take a huge amount of time to get up to speed .
VASIMR has neither of these problems .
Now to the main article for this post and :
Griffin says that the next step for the Vasimir is to operate it in space and that " we are at the end stages of agreeing a co-operative agreement for NASA to test the Vasimir engine on station " .
The Vasimir engine taken to the ISS would be a scale - model test engine .
Griffin says he does not know whether that scale - model engine would be launched by a Space Shuttle and would not give a timescale for Vasimir 's possible deployment to the ISS .
The Ad Astra Rocket Company plans to test a ground prototype rocket in early 2008 , the VX - 200 rated at 200 kW total radio frequency power , to demonstrate the required efficiency , thrust and specific impulse .
A flight version of the VASIMR , the VF - 200 , is expected to be tested in space in late 2010 .
We are working like crazy to assemble the first space - demonstration VASIMR ( VX - 200 ) unit on the ground in Houston , with the hope of testing one on the ISS by 2012 .
A VASIMR engine would cut down travel times to a destination like Mars from six months to three .
Venus is even closer : Venus Express took a total of 153 days to get to its destination , or 5 months and 2 days .
Mars Express took a total of 206 days or 6 months , 23 days to get to Mars , and that was including being launched at a time when the orbits of the two planets were especially close .
The conclusion ?
VASIMR / Vasimir is under the radar now , but expect it to suddenly jump into the world 's stream of consciousness within the next few years as it undergoes more and more substantial testing .
Perhaps 2010 will be the date , as we have the following from Wikipedia :
For some more information on this VF - 200 , see this forum thread on space.com .
Lastly , here 's a video of a conceptual mission to Mars by NASA using the technology :
The person that uploaded the video has written the following comment :
Differences between the US and UK editions of Douglas Adams ' " Life , the Universe and Everything " .
Major Spoilers all through !
I feel I might need to point something out ...
I got this document off of the net ( or maybe a post ) , so I 'm not the original author .
I 've just made it available ...
I have no idea who the original author is , so if that person would like to drop me a line , I 'll put the credit on it .
Thanks !
The differences between the US and UK editions are more than can be called " minor " .
Sure , there are " small " changes ( presumably due to some editor believing Americans to be more gentle and tender than the rough barbarian English ... ) but there are a couple of * major * differences ( one of which has been beaten to death here before but what the Hell ! )
Like , what 's the purpose of changing the chapter numbering ?
This way we have readers from both sides of the Atlantic giving chapter references which can never be reconciled .
So , here follows a list of the differences I 've found .
I 've used two paperback editions - UK " Pan " from 1982 and US " Pocket " from 1983 .
Chapter numbers :
Since the " Important fact " at the end of US chapter 2 constitutes a chapter in itself in the UK edition and UK chapter 5 is missing from the US edition ( see below ) , UK ch 4 => US ch 3 and UK ch 6 to 21 => US ch 5 to 19 .
UK ch 22 , however , encompasses US ch 20 through 22 , so that from ch 23 they are back in sync again .
All up ' til the end where UK " Epilogue : Life , the Universe and Everything " is blandly labelled " Chapter 34 " in the US .
Differences in actual wording :
Two occurrences of " Asshole " have been changed to " Kneebiter " ( insults from Wowbagger and little boy in cricket match )
UK chapter 5 is missing completely from the US edition .
Important facts from Galactic history , number two : ( Reproduced from the _Sidereal Daily Mentioner 's Book of Popular Galactic History_ . )
Since this Galaxy began , vast civilizations have risen and fallen , risen and fallen , risen and fallen so often that it 's quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be ( a ) something akin to seasick - space - sick , time sick , history sick or some such thing , and ( b ) stupid .
In chapter UK 22 / US 21 ( just before the " Belgium " mixup , see below ) , " shit " has been changed to " swut " .
In US chapter 31 , page 195 , there occurs what I think must be a genuine typo .
UK phrasing ( page 139 ) :
' the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy , or the whole of the Universe as far as I know , that would be totally traumatized to see it . '
has come across :
" the odds against its intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy or with the whole or the Universe , as far as I know would be totally staggering . "
Can anyone make sense of that latter paragraph ?
' the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy , or the whole of the Universe as far as I know , that would be totally traumatized to see it . ' has come across : " the odds against its intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy or with the whole or the Universe , as far as I know would be totally staggering . "
Can anyone make sense of that latter paragraph ?
Finally , the greatest Belgium - up of all times .
Original UK phrasing ( page 114 ) : ' The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word " Fuck " In A Serious Screenplay .
It 's very prestigious . '
' I see ' , said Arthur , 'yes , and what do you get for that ? '
Has been filled out to become :
" The Most Gratuitous Use of the Word " Belgium " in a Serious Screenplay .
It 's very prestigious . "
" The most gratuitous use of which word ? " asked Arthur , with a determined attempt to keep his brain in neutral .
" Belgium , " said the girl , " I hardly like to say it . "
" Belgium ? " exclaimed Arthur .
A drunken seven - toed sloth staggered past , gawked at the word and threw itself backward at a blurry - eyed pterodactyl , roaring with displeasure .
" Are we talking , " said Arthur , " about the very flat country , with all the EEC and the fog ? "
" What ? " said the girl .
" Belgium , " said Arthur .
" Raaaaaarrrchchchchch ! " screeched the pterodactyl .
" Grrruuuuuurrrghhhh , " agreed the seven - toed sloth .
" They must be thinking of Ostend Hoverport , " muttered Arthur .
He turned back to the girl .
" Have you ever been to Belgium in fact ? " he asked brightly and she nearly hit him .
" I think , " she said , restraining herself , " that you should restrict that sort of remark to something artistic . "
" You sound as if I just said something unspeakable rude . "
" You did . "
In today 's modern Galaxy there is of course very little still held to be unspeakable .
Many words and expressions which only a matter of decades ago were considered so distastefully explicit that , were they merely to be breathed in public , the perpetrator would be shunned , barred from polite society , and in extreme cases shot through the lungs , are now thought to be very healthy and proper , and their use in everyday speech and writing is seen as evidence of a well - adjusted , relaxed and totally un **** ed - up personality .
So , for instance , when in a recent national speech the Financial Minister of the Royal World Estate of Quarlvista actually dared to say that due to one thing and another and the fact that no one had made any food for a while and the king seemed to have died and most of the population had been on holiday now for over three years , the economy was now in what he called " one whole joojooflop situation , " everyone was so pleased that he felt able to come out and say it that they quite failed to note that their entire five - thousand - year - old civilization had just collapsed overnight .
But even though words like " joojooflop , " " swut , " and " turlingdrome " are now perfectly acceptable in common usage there is one word that is still beyond the pale .
The concept it embodies is so revolting that the publication or broadcast of the word is utterly forbidden in all parts of the Galaxy except for use in Serious Screenplays .
There is also , or _was_ , one planet where they did n't know what it meant , the stupid turlingdro- mes .
" I see , " said Arthur , who did n't , " so what do you get for using the name of a perfectly innocent if slightly dull European country gratuitously in a Serious Screenplay ? "
When the debate about editing / censorship started in this forum a few weeks ago , I felt inclined to interpret the changes in a generous mind - that they were really an improvement ; that one fairly flat joke hinged upon a four - letter - word was replaced with a long and quite funny side - track .
After comparing the exact wording , however , I must say that I find that " censorship " springs to mind again .
The phrase :
' The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word " Fuck " In A Serious Screenplay .
It 's very prestigious . '
is clearly a strong slap in the face of the entire ' Oscar ' award system .
Note the capitalization throughout .
The re-wording for the US edition with the changes in type - setting gets a totally different flavour :
" The Most Gratuitous Use of the Word " Belgium " in a Serious Screenplay .
It 's very prestigious . "
Not only does this wording avoid the usage of the word " fuck " which , presumably , could have been offensive to some people , but it also introduces a great deal of confusion which takes the pressure away from the awarding system and instead makes us chuckle at Ostend Hoverport .
The decisive evidence , however , comes when the word " unfucked - up " is written " un**** ed - up " .
That is the dead give - away that the entire change is due to the fear of " moral judgement " .
Even in the BBC radio broadcasts , the narrator said " unfucked - up " , clearly and explicitly ( remember , though , that in the radio shows this passage came in an entirely different context ) .
Taken together with the changing of " asshole " and " shit " into " kneebiter " and " swut " , I find it clearly shown that we do indeed have what has been called " The Most Gratuitous Use of Censorship in a Popular Book " .
So , what can we do about it ?
Not a whole lot , I suspect .
Except possibly try to spread the word about it and put pressure on the editors by letting them know we object to such changes .
In a recent posting about Robert Heinlein , we were told that new editions of several older books were due with previously omitted passages re-instated ( 50 000 words in _SiaSL _ ???!!!)
This is all very nice , but why were they cut out in the first place ?
I for one strongly object to this ( or any ) kind of censorship and I find it quite appalling that it goes on , even today !

Add in another one .
In the UK , it sounds like a hundred thousand people are saying " wop . "
In the US , that becomes " whop , " no doubt because the first form is most commonly used as derogatory ethnic slang .
[ Ed. note : ]
And yet another one !
In the UK version of THHGTTG , it mentions Earth orbiting the sun at a distance of roughly 92 million miles , while in the US edition the sum is displayed as roughly 98 million miles .
Why that would need to be changed I can hardly fathom , but as it is , so it is ...
Also , in the UK version , when Arthur and Ford rematerialize at the cricket match , a man drops dead of a heart attack ( Agrajagg ) - this has been removed ( inexplicably ) from the US version .
Welcome to the fourth and final entry in the Django , jQuery and Ajax tutorial series , which picks up where Layers of Authentication left off .
Because it 's the last entry , we 're going to do something quick and fun : make the frontpage 's slug field validate slugs as you type , by changing the background color of the field to either red ( in-use ) or blue ( available ) .
Let 's get started .
Two Guys , A URL , and A View
First go ahead and open up notes / urls.py and add this url :
( r'^slug_available /$' , ' notes.views.slug_available ' ) ,
Then open notes / views.py and add this method :
@login_required def slug_available ( request ) : if request .
method == " GET " : get = request .
GET . copy ( ) if get .
has_key ( ' slug ' ) : slug_str = get [ ' slug ' ] if Note .
objects .
filter ( slug = slug_str ) . count ( ) == 0 : return HttpResponse ( slug_str ) else : return HttpResponseServerError ( slug_str ) return HttpResponseServerError ( " Requires a slug field . " )
Often we use the data we return to indicate success or failure of a request , but it 's easier , clearer , and ( perhaps ) truer to http to use response codes to distinguish between success and failure .
For this view , it will return a 200 response code ( because we 're using HttpResponse ) for success , and a 500 reponse code ( because of HttpResponseServerError ) for failure .
We then distinguish between kinds of failure by varying the text returned along with the 500 response code .
Other than that , slug_available is pretty straight - forward , so we 'll move on to integrating the view into our templates .
Integrating into notes/note_list.html
We 'll start our joyous integration with the list view , so go ahead and open up the notes / note_list .
html template .
First , lets fix some of our earlier laziness , and wrap everything in the < script ></ script > tag in this code :
< script > $ ( document ) . ready ( function () { //
All other JavaScript here . } ) ; </ script >
That is a useful jQuery pattern which makes sure your JavaScript loads after the DOM has settled down and is ready to be tampered with .
Some really ambiguous and hard to track down issues can arise when you do n't use it ... so ... use it .
Now on to our task at hand : updating the background color of the span input based on slug availability .
It 'll look like this ( which you 'll need to add somewhere within the < script ></ script > tags in note_list .
html ) :
$ ( " #slug " ) . keyup ( function ( ) { var slug = this .
value ; var complete = function ( res , status ) { if ( status == " success " ) $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background - color ' , '# A0A0 FF ' ) ; else $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background-color ' , '# FFA0A0 ' ) ; } $ . ajax ( { type : ' GET ' , url : ' / slug_available / ' , data : { ' slug ' : slug } , complete : complete } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
If we wanted to , we could compress that a bit by inlining the first line .
$ ( " #slug " ) . keyup ( function ( ) { var complete = function ( res , status ) { if ( status == " success " ) $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background - color ' , ' blue ' ) ; else $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background - color ' , ' red ' ) ; } $ . get ( ' / slug_available / ' , { ' slug ' : this .
value } , complete : complete ) ; } ) ;
Then we go inline the complete function as well .
$ ( " #slug " ) . keyup ( function () { $ . get ( ' / slug_available / ' , { ' slug ' : this .
value } , complete : function ( res , status ) { if ( status == " success " ) $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background - color ' , ' blue ' ) ; else $ ( " #slug " ) . css ( ' background - color ' , ' red ' ) ; } ) } ) ;
Which seems like a good place to stop .
So with that we have an as - you - type validation system implemented for slugs .
This is one Ajax technique that I find to be genuinely useful at conveying additional information to users , and highly recommend integrating into applications where it fits .

You can access the code for this project at its GitHub repository .
( Although , you may have to rename the repository directory to ajax_tut before it runs properly . )
Closing Down The Series
Well , that wraps up the Django , jQuery and Ajax tutorial series .
Hopefully it was a bit helpful .
I 'll end by reiterating a brief warning : Ajax leads to a lot of really terribly user interfaces .
Make sure that you 're using Ajax because Ajax brings a real benefit , not just because you can .
Let me know where I 've made mistakes , and I 'll lumber around to correcting them as soon as life permits .
A new study reveals that women who smoke are at greater risk of developing major depressive disorder .
The study has been published today the British Journal of Psychiatry .
Australian researchers from the University of Melbourne and Geelng 's Barwon Health assessed a group of 1043 Australian women , whose health had been monitored for a decade as part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study .
On their ten year follow up participants were given an additional test of a psychiatric assessment .
" It was at this point we were able to determine if depression had developed and investigate whether or not smoking pre-dated the onset of depression " said University of Melbourne researcher , Associate Professor Julie Pasco , who led the study within the Clinical and Biomedical Sciences at Barwon Health .
Results revealed that women with depression were more likely to have been smokers than those without depression .
Compared with non-smokers , the likelihood for developing depression more than doubled for heavy smokers ( those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day ) .
The researchers also examined longitudinal data to determine the risk of women developing a new major depressive disorder over time .
A total of 671 women with no history of major depressive disorders were studied .
Of the 87 women who were smokers , 13 ( 15 % ) went on to develop major depressive disorder .
However , among 584 non-smokers , just 38 ( 6.5 % ) developed major depressive disorder during a decade of follow - up .
" This shows us that non smokers were at lower risk for developing major depressive disorder , suggesting that smoking may play a role in the development of the disease in women , " Associate Professor Pasco said .
Previous research has shown that smoking is a risk factor for depression .
There is also increasing evidence that smoking may aggravate mental illness or contribute to its onset .
However , most previous studies have involved short time frames , and this study is the first to investigate smoking using longitudinal data that extends over a ten - year period .
The researchers observed that depression is a leading contributor to the global disease burden , and called for greater efforts to encourage smokers to quit .

As if there were not enough real enemies to fight , the United States has been at war with itself in recent years .
They call it the culture war .
It has generated more hot air than most real wars in history .
As Pat Buchanan noted early on , the culture war is a war for power .
Not military power , but the kind that comes from shaping the norms , beliefs and values by which people live , and the meanings attached to words like liberalism , patriotism or , indeed , culture .
The two sides in this war came to be labeled red and blue , after the coloring of Republican and Democrat states on electoral maps .
No one has generated more hot air in this cause than Fox News ’ Bill O’Reilly , who in 2006 published a book proudly called “ Culture Warrior . ”
In it , he describes the culture war as a battle between traditionalists like himself and “ the committed forces of the secular - progressive movement that want to change American dramatically : mold it in the image of Western Europe . ”
Like Europe !
God , how horrible .
O’Reilly labels this movement “ S - P ” and identifies George Soros as “ el jefe of the S - P forces . ”
In a fashion disturbingly familiar to any student of the 20th century , he illustrates this with an unflattering photo of the financier - philanthropist , captioned “ George Soros , S - P jefe , puppet master , and moneyman . ”
O’Reilly pounds the hot buttons of the culture war with a ham fist : abortion , drugs , gay marriage , not celebrating Christmas , atheism , the liberal media and elites .
He excoriates such “ left- wing outfits ” as the BBC .
Does this sort of thing matter ?
Over the last decade , it has mattered a lot .
The framing of the political debate in cultural conservative terms -- a counterrevolution against the cultural revolution of 1968 -- contributed significantly to George W. Bush ’s victories in 2000 and 2004 .
And one way of understanding the direction taken by the McCain campaign over the last few weeks is this :
Only the culture war can win it for us now .
On Iraq , we lose .
On the economy , we lose .
But by caricaturing the liberal otherness of a candidate called Barack Obama , perhaps we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat .
Enter Sarah Palin , the Katyusha rocket of red America .
( I trust she wo n’t mind a Russian analogy because , as she has informed us , you can see Russia from Alaska . )
The selection of such an obviously under-qualified candidate can only be explained by electoral calculation , and that calculation has everything to do with the politics of the country ’s cultural civil war .
Her kind of down - home populist inveighing against Washington elites is part of the well - tried semantic armory of the red army .
Palin now leads the attacks on Obama .
This week , she has repeatedly tried to tar - and - feather him for “ palling around with terrorists ” such as former 1960s radical William Ayers .
The not - even - subliminal message is :
He ’s not like us ; he ’s like them .
Who are “ they ” ?
Elites , liberals , subversives , immigrants and infidels , closet Europeans !
Chapter 1 of O’Reilly ’s “ Culture Warrior ” begins with an imagined 2020 State of the Union speech by a president of the United States called Gloria Hernandez .
Latino , and a woman to boot .
Worse still , she celebrates the United States as “ a diversified nation striving to be at peace with the world . ”
How terrifying .
How bloodcurdling .
For Gloria Hernandez , read Barack Obama .
Or “ that one , ” as McCain disrespectfully referred to him in Tuesday ’s debate .
At the moment , the tactic is n’t working .
This election is about the economy , stupid .
The pocketbook trumps the prayer book .
However much John McCain lauds himself as a “ maverick , ” he ca n’t disassociate himself from eight years of GOP rule that are ending in the biggest financial crisis since 1929 and a near - doubling of the national debt .
And Obama is better on the economy : clearer , more specific , always bringing it back to the everyday struggles of ordinary Americans .
In the instant - reaction polls , a clear majority thought Obama won that debate , as he is winning in most polls both nationwide and in key states .
An Obama victory wo n’t spell the end of the culture war , but perhaps it may spell the beginning of the end .
And let ’s be clear :
This war will not finish with a victory of blue over red , or vice versa .
It will finish with the accepted , peaceful coexistence in one society of different faiths , value systems and lifestyles -- along the lines laid down centuries ago by the classical liberalism of John Locke and others , which so much influenced the founding fathers .
It wo n’t be “ liberals ” ( in the perverted sense in which that word is now used ) trouncing conservatives , but classical liberalism remade for the 21st century .
It wo n’t be blue obliterating red , but red , white and blue .

Sales of Mac virtualization software from market leaders VMware and Parallels have shot up more than 50 percent this year , outpacing the 41 percent growth in Mac hardware sales experienced by Apple in the most recent quarter , according to market research firm NPD .
An article over at Computerworld notes that Parallels has sold over 1 million of its Parallels Desktop offering since 2006 , while VMware , which only recently launched its Fusion product , says it sold 250,000 copies in the first five months .
Both solutions fetch $ 80 , and therefore VMWare 's come - from - behind effort has landed the company in a " neck and neck " race with Parallels in terms of shipments and unit sales , according to NPD software analyst Michael Redmond .
Based on his firm 's analytical data , he believes the Mac virtualization software market will grow into a $ 15 million - $ 20 million business this year .
" Clearly , the performance gains of [ Macs ] moving to Intel processors are encouraging more users to experiment with virtualization , " Redmond said .
Earlier this week , the two Mac virtualization software makers intensified their head - to - head bout with product announcements and buying incentives .
VMWare announced version 2.0 of Fusion , a free download for version 1.x owners — $ 76 for new owners — that delivers experimental support for up to four CPUs per virtual machine , improved gaming graphics via DirectX 9.0's Shader Model , and virtualization support for Mac OS X Server .
Parallels , hard at work on version 4.0 of its Desktop client , countered with two promotional deals on its existing version .
The first offers a free $ 25 iTunes gift card with the purchase of Parallels Desktop 3.0 .
A second offers the software to students for $ 49.99 through the end of the month .

What began as a muttering and grumbling on the internet , much more surprisingly has become a chatter in the stalwart Mainstream media even .
What was John McCain thinking , when he presented Sarah Palin as a VP candidate ?
What does it tell us about his character , his crisis management skills , about his clout within the party and most importantly , about his judgment ?
Why crisis management ?
Well , it was a crisis for him .
He had wanted to appoint either Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge and when venting his thoughts created an uproar within the evagelical right wing of the Republican Party .
What about his clout ?
Is he running the campaign or is it run for him and who would you have to expect will be running his Presidency ?
So how did he solve this crisis ?
He threw a temper tantrum and picked Sarah Palin , the most unqualified of the short list .
That tells us a lot about his volatile character , which obliterates any good judgment he might have , when his anger is stirred .
John McCain has managed to highlight the fact that he is 72 years old with a compromised health , by chosing this utterly improbable running mate .
He has cast a shadow of doubt on his own qualification to be commander in chief in a crisis and the press now looks on this trainwreck with horror , disgust and , in some cases , poorly disguised glee .
But see for yourselves :
The vetting issue is a touchy subject for the McCain campaign obviously , or they would n’t have cancelled McCains appearance on Larry King Live .
Here is a CNN panel discussing this and some :
UPDATE : And ( another H/T to wordie , who hunts up all those videos and shares them with us ) here ’s David Gergen , saying it like it is :
From across the pond :
Michael Tomasky , The Guardian
In four days , [ Palin ] ’ sbecome a punch line .
Democrats should go after her here and there , but again , the main target should be the man of such alleged wisdom and judgment that , when he did n’t get what we wanted , threw up his hands , stomped his feet at the other boys on the playground , said the hell with this and chose the absolutely most unqualified running mate he could have chosen .
McCain could still win this election – of course .
There ’s a long , long way to go .
But if he loses , Palin will go down as maybe the single most boneheaded decision a presidential candidate has ever made in America .

In another article :
Good God .
This is the man who ’s touting his superior judgment ?
He now has , quite deservedly , a full - fledged disaster on his hands .
More things will start dripping out .
Moderate voters are off this bandwagon , as polls will begin to affirm .
She ’s there only to placate social conservatives .
He dumps her , he infuriates them .
He keeps her , he loses massive credibility with non-right voters .
He ’s really stuck .

The Times
One former Bush Administration official described himself to me as “ personally disgusted ” by the selection , one that betrayed a desire by Mr McCain for short - term political gain at the expense of the national interest . [… ]
But the anxiety — and alarm at Mr McCain ’s high - stakes gamble — is palpable .
As David Frum , a former speechwriter for President Bush , put it : “ When someone takes the rent money and puts it on black at the roulette table , and it comes up black , we do n’t say , “ Wow !
What a terrific piece of judgment . ” ( read more )
The Independent does n’t focus so much on Sarah Palin but on Hurricane Gustav .

McCain voted repeatedly against a Senate investigation into what went wrong during Katrina .
Evidently , he did n’t think it was worth looking into the fact that for years before Katrina , Louisiana howled at the slashing of levee funding by 44 per cent to pay for tax cuts for the rich .
Even the money they were given was being handed on to incompetent Bush cronies rather than the best people for the job .
The Army Corps of Engineers now admits , for example , that they knowingly installed broken pumps manufactured by a company headed by Jeb Bush ’s ex-business partner and campaign donor .
The same people have been given a lackadaisical contract to rebuild the levees by 2011 .
McCain then voted against extending unemployment benefits and medical care to Katrina refugees , or even giving extra cash for new radio systems for the emergency services .
( read more )
And back again :
The LA Times does n’t have much trust either :
One Republican strategist with close ties to the campaign described the candidate ’s closest supporters as “ keeping their fingers crossed ” in hopes that additional information does not force McCain to revisit the decision .
According to this Republican , who would discuss internal campaign strategizing only on condition of anonymity , the McCain team used little more than a Google Internet search as part of a rushed effort to review Palin ’s potential pitfalls .
Just over a week ago , Palin was not on McCain ’s short list of potential running mates , the Republican said .
( read more )
The New York Times , asks the judgment question , too :
Mr. McCain ’s hurdles are substantial .
To start , he has to overcome Mr. Bush ’s record of failures .
( The president addressed the convention Tuesday night and now , McCain strategists fervently hope , will retire quietly to the Rose Garden . )
That record includes the disastrous war in Iraq , a ballooning deficit , the mortgage crisis — and the list goes on .
To address those many problems , this country needs a leader with sound judgment and strong leadership skills .
Choosing Ms. Palin raises serious questions about Mr. McCain ’s qualifications .
( read more )
It is on both sides of the pond , that the question is being raised .
Is John McCain cut out to be President at all ?
You are maybe lucky McCain ’s choice of running mate highlights his weaknesses now , so you can still be spared to watch his judgment and skills being tested live in a severe international or economic crisis .
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistani security officials said on Monday that troops had fired on U.S. military helicopters and forced them to turn back to Afghanistan , but both the Pakistani and American militaries denied the incident .

According to the security officials , the incident took place near Angor Adda , a village in the tribal region of South Waziristan where officials have said U.S. commandos in helicopters raided a suspected al Qaeda and Taliban camp earlier this month .
“ The U.S. choppers came into Pakistan by just 100 to 150 meters at Angor Adda .
Even then our troops did not spare them , opened fire on them and they turned away , ” said one security official .
While Angor Adda villagers and officials supported that account , the U.S. and Pakistani military denied the report .
Pakistan ’s military spokesman Major Murad Khan confirmed there had been a shooting but said the American helicopters had not crossed into Pakistani airspace and Pakistani troops were not responsible for the firing .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman and a U.S. military spokesman in Afghanistan said American helicopters had not come under fire .
“ I ’ve checked into that and find it to be a spurious report , ” Whitman told reporters .
“ Did not happen .
I ’ve checked all the places that would know about something like that and it does n’t appear to be accurate .
“ ( I ) cannot find any mission that correlates to the report I saw out of Pakistan .
I ca n’t find any ( military ) report of helicopters being fired upon , ” Whitman said .
Pakistan has been seen as an ally in the U.S. war on terrorism , and its support is key to the success of Western forces trying to stabilize Afghanistan .
But Washington has become impatient over Islamabad ’s response to the threat from al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan ’s tribal regions .
The United States has intensified attacks by missile - firing drone aircraft in recent weeks .
The New York Times reported last week that President George W. Bush has given clearance for U.S. raids across the border .
The raid on Angor Adda on September 3 was the first overt ground incursion by American troops into Pakistan since the deployment of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in late 2001 .
At least 20 people , including women and children , were killed in that South Waziristan raid , sparking outrage in Pakistan and prompting a diplomatic protest .
Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Kayani said in a strongly worded statement last week that Pakistan would not allow foreign troops on its soil and Pakistan ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be defended at all costs .
CONFLICTING VERSIONS
Official denials of the helicopter incident were contradicted by Pakistani civilian officials and villagers in Angor Adda .
One official told Reuters by telephone that “ the troops stationed at BP - 27 post fired at the choppers and they turned away . ”
Two Chinook helicopters appeared set to land when troops began shooting , alerting tribesmen who also opened fire on the intruders , said a senior government official in Peshawar , the capital of North West Frontier Province .
A resident described the tension in the village through the night .
“ We saw helicopters flying all over the area .
We stayed awake the whole night after the incident , ” he said .
The fiercely independent tribesmen of the region carry weapons regardless of whether they are militants .
PAKISTAN ARMY FIGHTING MILITANTS
Despite U.S. frustration with Pakistan , its army has been involved in fierce fighting with Islamist militants in Bajaur , another tribal region , and Swat , a valley in North West Frontier Province , close to the tribal lands .
Pakistani forces , using helicopter gunships and artillery , killed at least 16 fighters and wounded 25 in Bajaur on Sunday .
More than 750 militants have been killed in an offensive there that began in late August .
The U.S. pressure comes at an awkward time for President Asif Ali Zardari , widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto .
Zardari was elected on September 6 , having forced former army chief Pervez Musharraf to quit last month , almost nine years after he took power in a coup .
The new Pakistani president is in Britain to meet Prime Minister Gordon Brown to talk over the border situation .
Bush held a video conference with Brown last week to discuss a new strategy for the lawless Pakistan - Afghanistan frontier .
Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani have both endorsed the stand taken by General Kayani .

Wallace : Senator , Senator , if I may on the front page of the Washington Post and the NY Times yesterday , a top McCain strategist , his name Greg Strimple was quoted as saying we want to turn the page on the economy and start talking about Obama being and out and out liberal , we want to talk about his character , so the McCain is on the record as saying exactly that .
Lieberman : Well I must say I do n't know Greg , but I do know John McCain ...
Spin it Joe .
The McCain campaign did announce it .
McCain is desperate and has resorted to the Sean Hannity school of politics .
That 's not anything really much different than they 've been doing anyway .
Let 's take a stroll down memory lane when John McCain said he would run a respectful campaign :
" It is critical , as we prepare to face off with whomever the Democrats select as their nominee , that we all follow John 's lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues and values that are important to the American people , " Davis wrote .
" Throughout the primary election we saw John McCain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics , and this will not change as he prepares to run head - to - head against the Democratic nominee . "
The Nation :
Added Cindy McCain in May : " What you 're going to see is a great debate .
Which is what the American public deserves .
None of this negative stuff , though .
You wo n't see it come out of our side at all .
"
Low , Ball & Lynch … ca n’t get your lower than this

Ahtisaari , 71 , earned the honour for a long career of peace mediation work including a 2005 accord between Indonesia and rebels in its Aceh province .
Speaking at a press conference in Helsinki on Friday , Ahtisaari credited the many people he has worked with closely throughout the years .
" I am not the only person who can do what I have done .
But very often people do n't get the opportunity to do what I do .
I also work with extremely competent people .
It is not a one - man job , " he said .
" Perhaps I am in a lucky position , taking my positions in the UN and as president of this country .
We can ask for help when we need it .
I have always enjoyed support from my own government and that has been vital , " he said .
Ahtisaari added that straightforward talk helped him make headway in peace negotiations .
" You have to be very candid .
If people are doing or saying something counterproductive , you have to have courage to say so , " he said .
Ahtisaari also spoke of the projects he will continue to work on , including a programme to help employ youth in several Middle Eastern countries and Africa .
He said he will also continue to follow the situation in Aceh .
Peace Work Spanning Decades and Continents The Norwegian Nobel Committee chose Ahtisaari to receive the $ 1.4 million prize from a field of 197 nominees .
Ahtisaari is the first Finn to ever win the prestigious Peace Prize .
Ole Danbolt of the Norwegian Nobel Committee made the announcement at noon Finnish time .
" The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2008 to Martti Ahtisaari for his important efforts , on several continents and over more than three decades , to resolve international conflicts .
These efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to fraternity between nations in Alfred Nobel 's spirit , " the committee said .
His name had been mentioned in speculation leading up to the prize for his efforts in Europe , Africa and Asia .
Among other things , he brokered a peace deal between rebels and the Indonesian government in Aceh province .
Ahtisaari served as president from 1994 to 2000 .
Upon leaving office , he founded an NGO called the Crisis Management Initiative , which he chairs .
Although Ahtisaari has been considered a favourite for the prize several times , the choice as this year 's winner came as a considerable surprise .
Favourites this year included Chinese dissidents Gao Zhisheng and Hu Jia , Vietnamese Buddhist leader Thich Quang Dota , and the US - based Human Rights Watch organisation .

The Mother of All Bailouts plan gives the Treasury not only authority to buy and sell Mortgage Backed Securities , but allows it to deal in any financial instruments including leveraged derivatives .
This evolved over the various versions .
The original Paulson proposal said : Sec. 2 . Purchases of Mortgage - Related Assets .
( a ) Authority to Purchase .--
The Secretary is authorized to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase , on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary , mortgage - related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States .
...
Sec. 12 . Definitions .
( 1 ) Mortgage - Related Assets .-- The term " mortgage - related assets " means residential or commercial mortgages and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages , that in each case was originated or issued on or before September 17 , 2008 .
All media reports and blogs I have read about this assume that the Treasury under this plan would only buy Mortgage Backed Securities , i.e. bonds backed my mortgage payments .
But the above language also includes Credit Default Swaps .
Insurance contracts or derivatives , that guarantee the recoverability of MBS and change their value in relation to an MBS ' value .
The language in the Treasury Fact Sheed on the proposal is even wider : Treasury will have authority to issue up to $ 700 billion of Treasury securities to finance the purchase of troubled assets .
The purchases are intended to be residential and commercial mortgage - related assets , which may include mortgage - backed securities and whole loans .
The Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets .
It seems like the fact sheed exceeds the breadth of the released proposal .
Oh , you say , the Democrats in Congress will prevent the Treasury from morphing into a investment bank backed by $ 700 billion of taxpayer capital ?
Here is Senator Dodd 's expanded proposal of the Paulson plan .
The language is even worse than in the original : SEC .
2 . AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE TROUBLED ASSETS .
( a ) OFFICES ; AUTHORITY .� ( 1 ) AUTHORITY .
�The Secretary is authorized to establish a program to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase troubled assets from any financial institution , on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Secretary , and in accordance with policies and procedures developed by the Secretary .
...
SEC . 21 . DEFINITIONS . ( 7 ) TROUBLED ASSETS .
�The term '' troubled assets�� means � ( A ) residential or commercial mortgages , and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages , that in each case were originated or issued on or before March 14 , 2008 ; and ( B ) upon the determination of the Secretary , in consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , any other financial instrument , as the Secretary determines necessary to promote financial market stability .
The Dodd version gets lauded by Krugman , DeLong and other ' liberal ' luminaries .
This while the bailout language morphed from " mortgage related assets " to " any financial instrument . "
The Dodd version added some nice little extras for a homeowners in distress and some oversight provision .
But it also extended the scope of the Paulson plan far beyond housing and mortgages towards an all encompassing bailout for any financial issue .
Since 2003
Dodd collected over $ 4 million in contributions from Securities and Investment companies .
His top five doners include Citibank , SAC Capital Partners and Royal Bank of Scotland .
That may well be the reason why he does not want to keep the bill restricted to mortgage related assets but wants to include any financial instrument .
If this becomes law , Paulson and whoever replaces him in January will have the authority to buy Asset Backed Securities from car loans and credit card loans .
He will be able to buy and sell derivatives based on ABS that have build in leverage effects .
The Treasury may even deal in synthetic Collateral Debt Obligations and derivatives base on those .
It can buy and sell shares of public dealt companies , precious metals , future contracts on these and it can speculate on interest moves of Russian government bonds .
Are there any big long future positions on the Canadian dollar the U.S. president does not like ?
Just get the Treasury buy them up .
Congress is giving it the right to do so .
With a capital of $ 700 billion and the authority to buy and sell any highly leveraged financial instruments , the Treasury will become one gigantic hedge fund that can and may well act to move multi-trillions .
If such an entity makes one wrong move , it can bankrupt its owners within a few hours .
The Treasury is too knowledgeable to make such mistakes ?
So were two Nobel Price winners at LTCM .

Google Chrome looks cool , ok …
But what is even cooler for me is V8 , the super JavaScript VM .
JavaScript is a dynamic language , just like Ruby .
You can add stuff to objects at runtime , like Ruby .
It ’s object oriented , like Ruby .
It has a GC , like Ruby .
…
What if we could run Ruby on V8 ?
Well , it ’s a lot easier that you think .
If you remember a while ago , someone released HotRuby .
It runs YARV bytecode in the browser .
So I plugged the 2 together just to see what would happened => rbv8 .
It ’s fast ( sometimes )
I used the script on HotRuby site to benchmark .

[' Design Lesson 101 ' is a regular column by game designer Manveer Heir .
The goal is to play a game from start to completion and learn something about game design in the process .
This week , in honor of Bethesda 's release of Fallout 3 we take a look at Interplay 's classic post - nuclear apocalyptic role - playing game Fallout and its sequel , Fallout 2 . ]
Every single day of my life I make choices .
I choose what clothes to wear .
I choose what food to eat .
I choose who to be friends with .
These choices I make affect my life and the lives of those around me .
My choice to eat yogurt this morning probably does n't have huge consequences , beyond how hungry I am later .
However , my choice many years ago to work towards being a game developer has has major consequences on not only my life , but the lives of others around me .
These consequences and the choice that fuel them are the heart of the Fallout games and the focus of this week 's design lesson .
Design Lesson : Fallout and Fallout 2 use choice and consequence to deliver a world of enormous opportunities to the player and give the player agency over the type of character they develop .
Like in many RPGs , Fallout lets you choose if you want to be good or evil .
Your actions will decide your alignment .
If you save the people of a dying town or kill the slavers that look to put all humans into bondage , then your actions will be looked on favorably .
If you kill children and women for sport and perform unsavory deeds for mob bosses , you will be looked at as an evil person .
No matter what your actions , your choices will have consequences however .
In Fallout , saving a girl from a group of Raiders gives you the ability to have her join your party and adventure with you .
As a result , you can get into tougher fights , since you have the help of another person .
In Fallout 2 , I was granted a temporary day - pass to go inside the gates of Vault City , a very closed - off city that could have information that would help me with my main quest .
While inside Vault City , I spoke to a high - ranking official in a rather rude manner .
As a result , I was immediately kicked out of the city and my pass was permanently revoked .
Unless
I fought my way into the city and killed everyone within , I was now unable to get inside the walls of Vault City .
All of the quests that I had accepted in the city , were now impossible to complete .
The important information inside the city was unreachable .
The people in the city would not speak to me , sell me goods , help me out .
They reviled me .
In many games , this would be the end .
The poor choice I made in talking to an official in a snide manner would result in the consequence of game over , since the critical information was hiding within .
However , in Fallout , while the consequence of making my life more difficult was apparent , the game was n't over .
There were other sources that had the same information elsewhere .
I just had to explore some other cities to find them .
I had to find an alternate path .
A path that the designers made available , knowing that someone would talk themselves into a pickle inside Vault City .
The game never told me if I talked back to the man in Vault City that I would get the boot .
It just did it .
I made that choice .
I remember clicking the dialog option and thinking to myself “ Man , this guy is a little annoying .
I 'm going to be a smart - ass ” .
Nowadays , many games would broadcast you the consequence of your choice before the choice is made .
Give the player all the information up - front , and they can make the right decision .
But life is n't about having all the information up - front .
Often you make your choices and have no idea of the consequences until much later .
Fallout emulates this with it 's game mechanics , and as a result it results in the world feeling richer and deeper .
Your choices feel like your own and not what the designer wanted you to do .
You are able to make your own mistakes and recover from them .
Your choices are your own , and the unique set of choices you make as you play is what makes the game play differently for all different players .
Being evil opens up doors that are n't available if you are good , and vice - versa .
The game uses the different choices you can make and offers alternatives in - case you ever make a “ bad ” choice .
Those alternatives fill the game world with opportunity and gameplay .
As a result , there is no right way to play Fallout .
The same can't be said for many modern games , where there is one correct way and path to play ( or two paths to choose from ) .
The choice and consequence also affected my character and how I role - played him .
I ended up rolling my vilification by Vault City into my character 's personality .
Since there were rival cities , I sided with the other cities and not Vault City .
I did n't want to help Vault City ; they hated me .
This led me to feel like I was playing a true character , and not just a cookie - cutter blank slate that is prevalent in many games .
The game gives enough background to keep the story interesting and relevant , but lets you impress enough of your own personality into the character to make him yours .
My personality came through in my actions and the choices I made .
I controlled the actions of my character and how he responded to the situations of the world .
Nowhere is that more apparent than at the end of both games , when the narrator talks about what happens in the future to different characters and areas .
Some cities will prosper because you helped out .
Others will die off , because you abandoned them .
Still , others will fail even after your best efforts .
All of this makes the world of Fallout feel bigger and richer than it really is .
It does n't end up feeling strictly like a sequence of designer - created events .
It feels like a world that responds to you , that lets you be the person you want to be , and gives you a chance no matter what .
That 's the beauty of Fallout and it took replaying both games to realize why I consider them to be my favorite games of all - time .

First details have emerged on Lord of the Rings : Conquest which is being developed by Mercenaries crew Pandemic .
Reported on IGN , Conquest is a bit like Star Wars : Battlefront with players able to fight it out Rings style in battles taken from Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings movies and combat grounds created especially for the title .
Judging by the info , Pandemic 's aiming to have every man , dwarf , elf , orc , troll , good guy , bad guy , hobbit yadda yadda you can think of the from the story and chuck them into mass confrontations that can support 150 on - screen characters .
However , we 're scratching our heads over the news that only eight players are supported in head - to - head online multiplayer , and four in a co-op mode rampage through two campaigns on offer .
Does this mean the vast majority of on - screen fighters will be AI controlled ?
Presumably that 's going to be the case , with you caught up in the thick of things .
" We 'll freely admit that we 're rabid fans of The Lord of the Rings fantasy , " says Josh Resnick , co-founder and general manager at Pandemic Studios .
" Our experience creating massive , rich , action - packed games means that The Lord of the Rings : Conquest will give fans exactly what they want : full control of the blade , bow and magic to fight its epic battles any way they want - even if they choose to play from the evil side . "
Lord of the Rings : Conquest is out on PC , Xbox 360 and PS3 in the autumn .

A person claiming to be the hacker who obtained access to Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's private Yahoo e-mail on Tuesday has posted a supposed first - person account of the hack , revealing the relatively simple steps he says he took to crack the private e-mail of the Republican vice - presidential candidate .
The story was briefly posted Wednesday to the 4 chan forum where the hack first surfaced .
Bloggers have connected the handle of the poster , " Rubico , " to an e-mail address , and tentatively identified the owner as a college student in Tennessee .
Threat Level was unable to reach the student by phone because his number is unlisted .
A person who identified himself as the student 's father , when reached at home , said he could not talk about the matter and would have no comment .
The father is a Democratic state representative in Tennessee .
Threat Level is not identifying them by name because authorities have not identified any suspects in the case , and the link to the student so far is tenuous .
The father , in a second call with Threat Level late Thursday afternoon , said that neither he nor his son has been contacted by any law enforcement authorities .
A local Tennessee paper had erroneously reported that his son had been contacted by authorities , he told Threat Level .
As detailed in the postings , the Palin hack did n't require any real skill .
Instead , the hacker simply reset Palin 's password using her birthdate , ZIP code and information about where she met her spouse – the security question on her Yahoo account , which was answered ( Wasilla High ) by a simple Google search .
The simplicity of the attack , of course , makes it no less illegal .
The hacker said that he read all of the e-mails in the Palin account and found " nothing incriminating , nothing that would derail her campaign as I had hoped .
All I saw was personal stuff , some clerical stuff from when she was governor … .
And pictures of her family . "
Once the hacker had read the e-mails in Palin 's account , he said he suddenly realized what he'd done and how vulnerable he was to being caught , since he'd used only a single proxy service to hide his IP address .
yes I was behind a proxy , only one , if this shit ever got to the FBI I was fucked , I panicked , i still wanted the stuff out there but I did n’t know how to rapidshit all that stuff , so I posted the pass on /b/ , and then promptly deleted everything , and unplugged my internet and just sat there in a comatose state
Once he posted the information to 4 chan – the stronghold of the Anonymous griefer collective – a good Samaritan tried to step in to protect Palin by resetting her password and sending an e-mail to one of her aides , Ivy Frye .
But the white hat posted a screen shot of that e-mail to 4 chan , and it included the new password .
That triggered a feeding frenzy on the forum , as legions of channers competed to log in and reset Palin 's password again .
That flurry of activity triggered a security feature that froze Palin 's account for 24 hours , which was long enough for the information to hit the media .
Palin , or someone in her camp , closed the account early Wednesday morning .
The postings telling the story have been deleted from 4 chan , so I 've included them below .

Hello , /b/ as many of you might already know , last night sarah palin ’s yahoo was “ hacked ” and caps were posted on /b/ , i am the lurker who did it , and i would like to tell the story .
In the past couple days news had come to light about palin using a yahoo mail account , it was in news stories and such , a thread was started full of newfags trying to do something that would not get this off the ground , for the next 2 hours the acct was locked from password recovery presumably from all this bullshit spamming .
after the password recovery was reenabled , it took seriously 45 mins on wikipedia and google to find the info , Birthday ?
15 seconds on wikipedia , zip code ?
well she had always been from wasilla , and it only has 2 zip codes ( thanks online postal service ! ) the second was somewhat harder , the question was “ where did you meet your spouse ? ” did some research , and apparently she had eloped with mister palin after college , if youll look on some of the screenshits that I took and other fellow anon have so graciously put on photobucket you will see the google search for “ palin eloped ” or some such in one of the tabs .
I found out later though more research that they met at high school , so I did variations of that , high , high school , eventually hit on “ Wasilla high ” I promptly changed the password to popcorn and took a cold shower … >> rubico
09/17/08 ( Wed ) 12:58:04 No.85782727 this is all verifiable if some anal /b/ tard wants to think Im a troll , and there is n’t any hard proof to the contrary , but anyone who had followed the thread from the beginning to the 404 will know I probably am not , the picture I posted this topic with is the same one as the original thread .
I read though the emails … ALL OF THEM … before I posted , and what I concluded was anticlimactic , there was nothing there , nothing incriminating , nothing that would derail her campaign as I had hoped , all I saw was personal stuff , some clerical stuff from when she was governor … .
And pictures of her family I then started a topic on /b/ , peeps asked for pics or gtfo and I obliged , then it started to get big Earlier it was just some prank to me , I really wanted to get something incriminating which I was sure there would be , just like all of you anon out there that you think there was some missed opportunity of glory , well there WAS NOTHING , I read everything , every little blackberry confirmation … all the pictures , and there was nothing , and it finally set in , THIS internet was serious business , yes I was behind a proxy , only one , if this shit ever got to the FBI I was fucked , I panicked , i still wanted the stuff out there but I did n’t know how to rapidshit all that stuff , so I posted the pass on /b/ , and then promptly deleted everything , and unplugged my internet and just sat there in a comatose state
Then the white knight fucker came along , and did it in for everyone , I trusted /b/ with that email password , I had gotten done what I could do well , then passed the torch , all to be let down by the douchebaggery , good job /b/ , this is why we cant have nice things .
Gabriel Ramuglia who operates Ctunnel , the internet anonymizing service the hacker used to post the information from Palin 's account to the 4chan forum , told Threat Level this morning that the FBI had contacted him yesterday to obtain his traffic logs .
Ramuglia said he had about 80 gigabytes of logs to process and had n't yet looked for the information the FBI was seeking but planned to be in touch with the agents today .
Ramuglia said the screenshots of Palin 's e-mail account , which the hacker posted online , will help him narrow his search , since they revealed most of the Ctunnel URL that was at the top of the hacker 's browser when he took the screen shot .
( This post was updated with details about a phone call with the father of the college student and information from the owner of the proxy service he used . )

The Pirate Bay , the controversial BitTorrent tracking site in Sweden , has become ensnared in a grisly , high - profile scandal involving the online circulation of autopsy pictures of two murdered children .
The incident is the latest of a string in which The Pirate Bay has hit the headlines because of its founders ' unbending stance that changing their policies would impinge upon freedom of speech and access to information .
In this latest dispute , the Swedish media are focusing on The Pirate Bay 's refusal to remove the links to the torrents of photos uploaded to the internet by its users of photos of two dead children .
The photos are from a police case file concerning the murder of two toddlers in March in Arboga , a town in the Southeastern part of Sweden .
The case is being heavily covered by the media .
The father of the children has asked the operators of the site to remove the links , but they 've declined to do so , based on the group 's anti-censorship policies .
The Pirate Bay 's co-founder Peter Sunde in a post on his personal blogasks why the Swedish media is n't focusing either on the individual who had uploaded the photo , or on the country 's laws regarding the way the government classifies information and provides access to government documents .
In this case , someone had accessed the police investigation file , uploaded a torrent file of the photo onto the internet , and linked to the torrent on The Pirate Bay .
Under Swedish law , most documents generated by the government are made available to the public unless specifically deemed secret by the courts .
In this case , the documents were not sealed by the court .
The operators of the site announced on their blog Friday that they would no longer speak with the media after an incident on a Swedish television station , which Sunde effectively characterized as an ambush .
" Due to last nights failure from the entity of respected traditional media to keep promises we have decided to suspend all of our contacts with the press for the time being , " reads the post .
" All planned and booked interviews are to be considered suspended .
All future interviews are to be considered impossible .
We have no longer any interest in participating in traditional media since it's apparant that thet are not trustworthy or willing to adopt ( sic. ) "
" The mail sent to the press spokes person will not be read .
The phone will not be answered . "
The Pirate
Bay has always been cautious of the mainstream media , but in 2006 let
Wired.com 's Quinn Norton into its inner circle , where she wrote about the group , the issues and the technologies extensively .
Sunde participated in a television interview with Sweden 's TV4 Thursday night , as he recounts on his personal blog .
He says that he was promised that the interview would focus on policy and the issues of censorship and what gets published on the internet .
He also says that he told the show 's producers that he would not participate if the father of the murdered children was going to be on the program because it would be impossible to " conduct a fruitful debate . "
But when he arrived at the studio , he was faced with the father of the children who was participating remotely , and asked what he had to say to him , he recounts in a long and angry blog post .
" The media does not want to report that there are people who want to share the material , " Sunde writes on his blog .
Instead , they want to pick on The Pirate Bay and go after sensational headlines , he writes .
" Nobody cares about contacting the prosecutor in this case , and asking why this is not classified . "
" Pirate Bay has been described in Swedish media as ' publisher ' of the photos , which is technically not correct , " says Mikael Pawlo , an internet entrepreneur based in Stockholm who 's been following the case .
" But Pirate Bay only provides aggregated tracking information on the torrents , which are in turn distributed peer - to - peer , without ever being relayed through Pirate Bay . "
But he adds : " Pirate Bay is also in practice the main distributor of information on how to download the photos . "
He says that public opinion might have turned against the founders of The Pirate Bay because of one of its representatives ' rude mannerism when he initially responded to the father 's request .
Generally , it 's been difficult to focus the discussion about The Pirate Bay 's role and policy issues because the public is mainly concerned about the integrity of the children , and the actual impact that the internet distribution of the photos might have on the father , he says .
Sunde himself notes that the company has implemented filters on its system against pornography , and has stood up for its principles – and that he personally is someone who is deeply invested in living an ethical life , citing his vegetarianism and philanthropic activities .
Nevertheless , based on incidents such as these , the media characterizes the operators of The Pirate Bay as " terrorists , " and as people " totally without emotion , " and as " bloodthirsty devils , " he writes .
" Shame on you Sweden .
And shame on you in the media , " he writes in his blog post entitled " Grow Up Sweden ! "

Late one night over beers in the Welsh hamlet of Llanwrtyd Wells , an innkeeper got into an argument with a foxhunter about who could run faster , man or horse .
The innkeeper insisted that over many miles , a human runner would have greater stamina , and prevail .
Thus was born a tradition : Every year since 1980 , Llanwrtyd Wells has hosted the Man Versus Horse Marathon , which pits hundreds of runners against dozens of horses with riders .
On two legs or four , contestants take on 22 miles of challenging trails laced across a dazzling green countryside .
They trot through fragrant pine forests , scramble up mountainous rock - strewn sheep trails , cross rolling moorlands , and ford rivers .
In June 2004 , for the first time ever , the human won .
The innkeeper was delighted — and so were University of Utah biologist Dennis Bramble and Harvard University paleoanthropologist Daniel Lieberman .
That summer the two scientists were putting the finishing touches on a theory with a new view on how conditions millions of years ago molded the way humans move today .
The standard explanation among physical anthropologists has long been that early hominids left life in the trees to forage on the open savanna and that walking upright was the key to surviving in that new environment .
Bramble and Lieberman do not dispute this general theory , but they have identified a suite of traits in the human anatomy that add a dramatic twist to the story line .
The traits appear to be specifically adapted for running — and for jogging for long distances .
So Bramble and Lieberman were not at all surprised that a man won the Man Versus Horse Marathon .
It fits their hypothesis .
Unlike many mammals , not to mention primates , people are astonishingly successful endurance runners , " and I do n't think it 's just a fluke , " Lieberman says .
He and Bramble argue that not only can humans outlast horses , but over long distances and under the right conditions , they can also outrun just about any other animal on the planet — including dogs , wolves , hyenas , and antelope , the other great endurance runners .
From our abundant sweat glands to our Achilles tendons , from our big knee joints to our muscular glutei maximi , human bodies are beautifully tuned running machines .
" We 're loaded top to bottom with all these features , many of which do n't have any role in walking , " Lieberman says .
Our anatomy suggests that running down prey was once a way of life that ensured hominid survival millions of years ago on the African savanna .
Although Bramble has studied locomotion in animals ranging from tortoises to jackrabbits for 40 years , he was first tipped off to the hypothesis that humans were born to run by one of his students , David Carrier .
In the 1970s , Carrier was assisting with Bramble 's studies of how dogs , horses , and people regulate breathing while running .
A marathoner himself , Carrier began to wonder about the role of endurance running in human evolution .
People , he noted , can shed heat quickly — not by panting , like most animals , but by perspiring through millions of sweat glands .
A lack of fur also helps dissipate heat more quickly .
" I did n't buy it at all , " Bramble says .
Like most of his peers , Bramble 's first reaction to Carrier 's hypothesis was that " humans are pitifully slow . "
From the perspective of a vertebrate morphologist , humans lack one of the most obvious features of animals adapted for serious speed : a tail .
In creatures that cover ground bipedally , such as kangaroos , kangaroo rats , and roadrunners , " the tail is the major balance organ , " Bramble says .
" In the whole history of vertebrates on Earth — the whole history — humans are the only striding biped that 's a runner that 's tailless . "
Still , Bramble eventually came to realize that people turn in remarkable performances .
He once filmed a horse cantering , with Carrier running alongside at the same pace .
The movie showed that Carrier 's legs were churning more slowly than the horse 's , which meant that the student 's strides had to be spanning more distance per step than the horse's .
Although Carrier moved on to other research , Bramble grew convinced that his student had discovered something .
During a visit to Harvard in 1991 , Bramble encountered Daniel Lieberman , then an anthropology Ph.D. student , making a pig trot on a treadmill .
To glean insights into how bones grow — and thus to better interpret fossilized human jaws and skulls — the student wanted to see whether the repeated impact of running would spur a thickening of the pig 's skull .
" You know , " Bramble said , " that pig 's not holding its head still . "
He went on to explain that adept runners like horses , dogs , and rabbits keep their noggins remarkably steady as they lope , thanks to an obscure bit of anatomy called the nuchal ligament .
It 's a tendonlike band that links the head to the spine .
People , he said , have a version of this band .
Rummaging through a collection of replicas of fossilized primate bones in a nearby lab , Bramble pointed out that the nuchal ligament leaves a trace — a delicate ridge — where it attaches at the base of the human skull .
Then the scientists noticed the ridge in a pitted , yellowed skull of our 2 - million - year - old relative Homo erectus — but not in older hominids known as australopithecines , who walked the earth as far back as 4.4 million years ago .
" Holy moley ! " Lieberman thought .
" There 's something going on here , and what 's more , we might be able to study it in the fossil record . "
" Once the idea is in your head , then you start thinking about things differently , " Lieberman says .
A short 41 - year - old with a receding hairline , a slight paunch , and disarming dimples , Lieberman does n't look athletic , but he has been a jogger since his teens .
I joined him for his morning run with his dog , Vashti , a border collie mix , whom he easily proved he could outlast .
Lieberman says it 's wrong to assume , as many do , that running is like walking .
The two motions are strikingly different .
He demonstrates that during walking his heel hits the ground first , the leg straightens , and then the body vaults over it .
" Your center of gravity , which is basically near your belt buckle , r - i - i - i - ses " — he takes a slow - motion step forward with his right leg and pauses , now up on the ball of his right foot — " so that it 's over your leg . "
The body has now stored potential energy .
The arch of the foot stiffens , and Lieberman pushes off against it .
As he tips forward , potential energy converts to kinetic energy , and he swings his left foot ahead to complete the stride .
But in running , he says , the legs become springs .
You land on and squash the entire arch and bend your knee .
So initially the body 's center of gravity falls .
" You go down — and then you go up , " Lieberman says .
Kinetic energy from the crash landing is stored in the many stretchy tendons of the arch and the leg , most notably the huge Achilles tendon connecting calf muscles to the heel bone .
Like rubber bands , the tendons extend and then recoil — boing !— to launch you onto the next step .
" So why do we have all these tendons in our legs ? " Lieberman asks .
" You do n't evolve big tendons unless you 're a runner . "
Kangaroos , antelope , and other serious animal runners all have a great set of springs , which do nothing for walking .
So our tendons can't be explained as being necessary for walking .
Part by part , Bramble and Lieberman have reinterpreted the hominid physique by juxtaposing bits of fossil evidence with what 's known about the physiology and biomechanics of jogging .
Although much of the anatomy that lets us lope is the same equipment that humans first evolved for walking , the researchers say many of our physical traits seem tailor - made for sustained running .
To test their ideas , they conduct biomechanical studies in Lieberman 's lab — Room 53 in Harvard 's small redbrick Peabody Museum .
The space looks more like a meld between a sports medicine clinic and an untidy engineering workshop than an anthropologist 's sanctum of precious old bones .
In addition to a gray - and - black running treadmill , there are wall shelves and counters cluttered with boxes of cotton applicators and latex gloves , containers of antiseptic , a small toolbox , tangles of electric cords , and plastic models of human parts , including a gigantic ear .
In one recent experiment , a volunteer named Jeff , dressed only in dark Lycra shorts and white socks , looked like a guinea pig trapped in a bad sci - fi flick .
To track the electrical activity of key muscles , Lieberman and a postdoc , David Raichlen , had taped circular force - detecting pads to the bottoms of Jeff 's feet and carefully rigged other parts of him with electrodes .
Wires from those sensors ran through a small preamplifier box strapped to his lower back and then to a nearby computer .
To capture an image of his movement , they attached little silvery gray reflective balls onto Jeff 's shoulders , hips , knees , and other joints .
Three infrared cameras would track the balls ' motion and record a stick - figure animation of him as he moved .
Finally , to measure forces acting on his skull , the researchers mounted an inch - long accelerometer and gyroscope onto a small round tin and tied it all on top of Jeff 's head with a black mesh do - rag that knotted securely under his chin .
Then Lieberman and Raichlen put Jeff on the treadmill and started it up .
" Focus on the gazelle on the savanna , " Lieberman instructed over the hum of the machine , indicating a big black X on a sheet of paper taped to a shelf straight ahead .
The researchers gradually cranked up the pace until Jeff was pounding along at a hard run , sweaty and breathless .
" Your gluteus is getting a serious workout , " Lieberman said cheerfully .
The goal of the exercise was to understand how joggers stabilize their heads and torsos — part of the distinctive human balancing act that puzzled Bramble years ago .
Without the balancing help of a tail , how do we avoid falling over when we run ?
The butt , it turns out , is crucial — right up there with the chin among traits that make us uniquely human .
Chimps and other primates have little buns .
Our own rear ends are huge ; the upper part of the gluteus maximus is greatly expanded .
Although few scholars have studied its role in running , the butt is , according to Bramble , " basically a substitute for a tail . "
The treadmill studies support that idea .
A few months later , Lieberman showed the results from Jeff and 15 other joggers , partly summarized in a conference presentation ( " Why Is Our Gluteus So Maximus ? " ) .
Sitting at his computer in shorts and flip - flops , Raich­len pulled up Jeff 's data : a rainbow - colored series of 16 synchronized electrical recordings from all the sensors .
Looking like an EKG signal , the electromyograph , or EMG , reading from the gluteus maximus , in red , showed little activity when Jeff strolled .
But once he broke into a jog , boom ! — the red line tightly zigzagged .
The faster the pace , the bigger the spikes , like an earthquake signal on a seismograph .
What that shows , says Lieberman , is that the butt is n't much involved during walking .
In running , however , the body leans forward so that each time the leading foot strikes the ground , the trunk wants to topple forward .
The gluteus maximus prevents that :
It fires just before the foot slams into the floor , creating a braking action that keeps the torso from falling down .
Meanwhile , the way we pump our arms back and forth in a trot helps steady us too .
And based on their experiments , the researchers suspect that the motions of our shoulders and arms actually help counterbalance the head , preventing it from pitching forward on each landing .
Simultaneously , with each heel strike , certain shoulder muscles contract and put tension on the nuchal ligament , pulling up the skull and keeping it level .
For example , most scientists reasoned that the 3.2 - million - year - old hominid Lucy , with her chimplike build , could n't have been a good endurance runner .
She was squat , with short legs , a wide waist , long arms , and long , ­curving fingers and toes that suggest a tree - climbing lifestyle .
Although researchers disagree on Lucy 's gait while walking upright , nobody thinks she could have strolled like a human .
Yet more than a million years later , Homo erectus roamed Africa with a much longer , leggier build , sporting a dramatically different set of physical changes that made it harder to climb trees but easier to jog , Bramble says .
" All the running equipment 's already there . "
What biomechanics and paleontology studies cannot reveal is why these transitional hominid types forsook life among the boughs to become earthbound marathon runners .
Archaeological studies at hominid sites offer one strong clue — animal bones .
About 2.6 million years ago , our forebears started eating meat and marrow , rich sources of protein and fat that perhaps eventually fueled the growth of larger brains .
Bramble and Lieberman find it conceivable that endurance running helped hunters pursue prey to exhaustion .
Back in the 1980s , Carrier had read ethnographers ' accounts of indigenous peoples who chased deer , antelope , and kangaroos to exhaustion under the scorching sun .
The Tarahumara of the mountainous desert of northwestern Mexico , for example , were legendary runners .
But by modern times , their running tradition had turned to sport :
Men wearing simple tire - tread sandals bound with leather thongs compete in a 24 - hour footrace that involves kicking a ball over about 100 miles of mountainous road .
So Carrier , a triathlete in college , took it upon himself to prove his case .
He and his younger brother , Scott , went to the desert in Utah and Wyoming to chase pronghorn antelope .
The beasts ditched them every time .
The sleek , bouncy animals would join up with others , and soon the men would be huffing after a dozen of them .
" You would n't know which were the animals you started with , " Carrier says .
For direct evidence of endurance hunting , Bramble and Lieberman point to the observations of Louis Liebenberg , author of The Art of Tracking : The Origin of Science , who has spent time on the traditional hunts of the Bushmen hunter - gatherers in the central Kalahari Desert in Botswana .
Liebenberg ran with them when they chased down kudu antelope on two occasions .
For eight other hunts he trailed them in his Land Cruiser , sometimes with a GPS device .
The men attempted to run prey to exhaustion only when temperatures neared 100 degrees F , says Liebenberg .
Three men would gulp a lot of water and head out together .
Two initially did the hard work of tracking and pursuing over the arid grassland and woodland terrain , while the other held back .
Eventually , the leaders dropped behind , leaving the third man to hound and spear the antelope when it reached its limit .
" The animal will either just completely collapse , or it will actually slow down to a point where it just stands there . . . with sort of glazed - over eyes , " Liebenberg says .
" Essentially , you 're pushing the animal to overheat . "
The hunters would then walk home with the meat , enough to share — in small portions — with the tribe .
During a chase , Liebenberg noted that the men maintained speeds of around 4 to 6 miles per hour , for anywhere from two to six and a half hours , and traversed up to 22 miles of terrain .
These stats fall well within the performance range of the world 's fastest competitive marathoners , who set a pace of roughly 12 miles an hour to cover 26 miles , albeit under far less harsh conditions .
Although Liebenberg 's observations support the runner - as - hunter hypothesis , Bramble and Lieberman think early Homo would more likely have first run to scavenge prey killed by other carnivores — a strategy the Hadza people of East Africa are known to use .
When leopards or hyenas bring an animal down , the hunters " can spot these fresh kills at a distance from the vultures circling above , " Bramble says .
A carcass is an ephemeral treasure , picked clean within hours , so the Hadza quickly head off running , chase away the carnivores , and take what 's left .
Of course , no one knows whether scavenging reaped enough caloric and nutritional returns to make it worthwhile for our forebears .
But Bramble and Lieberman feel that the collective evidence , fielded from so many different angles , makes a compelling case for the running hypothesis .
Even ordinary studies of human physiology , for example , suggest that humans are so adapted for intense physical activity that a sedentary lifestyle spawns modern - day scourges like diabetes and heart disease .
Additional support could come from the chimpanzee genome , which may allow researchers to clock when the genes for slow - twitch muscle fibers — crucial for running long distances and plentiful in people but not chimps — diverged in the common evolutionary history of humans and apes .
Other clues could come from tracing the genes involved in our abundant sweat glands and loss of body hair .
Meanwhile , other researchers are looking for holes in the argument .
Functional morphologist Brigitte Demes , at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , notes that the gluteus maximus is absolutely essential for rising from a squatting posture at rest or during foraging , so it might not have evolved just for running .
Stony Brook anatomist Jack Stern , famed for analyses of how Lucy walked , says it 's a tough call to classify the Achilles tendon as an adaptation for jogging .
Longer legs evolved in many animals through the extension of lightweight tendons rather than heavier muscle , thus producing a limb that took less effort to swing — a change that would save energy during walking , Stern says .
Nonetheless , Stern credits Bramble and Lieberman for a clever , coherent theory .
" In essence , this is what Darwin did when he wrote On the Origin of Species :
He took a series of facts and wove a beautiful , elegant story , " Stern says .
His own hunch is that the running hypothesis is correct , but it will take decades of scientific squabbling to confirm it .
" This is just the beginning , " he says .
And even Demes , although skeptical of the running hypothesis , can't think of an alternative explanation .
" That might actually be their strongest argument , " she admits .
" Why do we have this skill to go long distances for extended periods of time ?
Because you really do n't see that in other primates . "
Bramble and Lieberman have received a flood of enthusiastic e-mail messages ( and even poems ) about their work , mostly from runners .
" Sometimes you come across an idea that for some reason has been kind of overlooked .
But it 's just obvious .
And those are the ideas , I think , that touch a nerve , " Lieberman says .
The evolution of walking was unquestionably fundamental to becoming human , he says , but running played a pivotal role too .
" If we can get people to agree on that , I 'll go to bed happy . "
I 'm sometimes amused by the lengths some parents will go to to buy toys , or spend heaps of money on decorations or costumes , with the idea of stimulating their kids ' imaginations .
It 's not , of course , that that 's a bad thing , but rather that there are so many simple , cheap ways to do it that I wonder that these people do n't know that .
There 's a fun little ritual my family has that I thought fellow geek parents might be interested in trying with their own kids .
My son calls it " soft kisses with toys , " and my daughter calls it " wish kisses , " and I think for the sake of brevity I 'll stick with her term for it .
It 's a tradition born out of various little games we used to play with the kids upon their final good night kiss , wherein we would occasionally pretend the kiss had hit us like a brick and reel from it , or pretend it was about to miss us and we had to catch it –things of that nature .
The idea is that you throw your child a kiss with a " toy " attached to it , so that first you throw the kiss and then you tell them what the " toy " was that they got .
The pretend toy should generally be something that would be impossible or at least incredibly difficult to obtain in real life , should be something that you think your child would gladly give his or her right arm for , and should be described with plenty of detail .
Then it 's your child 's turn to do the same back to you .
Of course , if there are two of you saying good night to your child , you both do it .
Just the other day , I gave my son , who has recently gone crazy for all things Star Wars , his own functional lightsaber , which has been modified so that the blade is only there when it collides with another lightsaber blade , so that he can't accidentally hurt anyone or anything .
In return , he gave me my own R2D2 to follow me around and do things for me .
My daughter got a magic mirror that would transport her into the world of High School Musical and put her into any of the characters she wanted ( yes , even the male ones , if she wanted ) , and , of course , bring her back .
In return , I got , if I recall correctly , a set of eyeglasses that will change to look like whatever I want them to whenever I want them to change .
Of course , this is probably only good for kids from about age four to about age ten or eleven .
It will depend on the kid , of course , and I 'm less sure about the upper limit because my older kid is seven - and - a - half .
We find it works best if we restrict it to only Friday and Saturday nights , both because it gets really hard really fast to come up with new " toys " every night , and because sometimes they ( and we ) need to think for a few minutes each time , so non-school nights are best because we wo n't be as concerned about the specific time they get to bed .
If you have any favorite bedtime ( or other time ) rituals that help stimulate your kids ' imaginations , please mention them in the comments .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- The Sarah Palin Phenomenon is doomed .
But it 's not because of her lack of foreign policy experience or her deer - in - the - headlights look during part of her interview last week with ABC's DIS , - 0.46 % Charles Gibson .
The primary reason why the Palin bubble will burst is that the media will decide that they are bored with her .
They 'll need to move to shine a light on a fresh issue or individual .
This is how the world works in the age of 24/7 news cycles .
Whether the subject is Britney Spears , Michael Jordan or Sarah Palin , we inevitably raise stars to mythic levels , out of all reasonable proportions .
Then we knock them down .
( Look out , Michael Phelps .
Your time is coming , too . )
It is n't a case of quixotic behavior by reporters and editors .
Internet sites , blogs and cable news operations all thrive on presenting fresh headlines and updated story angles as often as possible so readers think we 're on top of things .
The news world moves at warp speed .
Palin 's story is especially captivating because she emerged as an overnight sensation .
The governor of Alaska was virtually unknown on the national scene before Sen.
John McCain tapped her to be his running mate .
Amid the media crush accompanying her rise , it now seems as if Palin has been around forever .
The Sarah Palin Phenomenon is doomed
For as long as she has been in the public eye , people have been skeptical about her qualifications , but the allure of her beginner 's pluck catapulted Palin to the covers of magazines ranging from Time TWX , to People .
The interview with Gibson may be remembered as the first brick being pulled out of the wall .
The reviews were n't favorable from the media in the segments when Gibson asked Palin questions about foreign policy .
For instance , the New York Times NYT , - 0.61 % called the exchange " strained . "
The Washington Post - owned WPO Slate went so far as to say that " The ABC News anchor flummoxes the GOP amateur . "
I 'll be interested to see how Palin -- not to mention McCain and the Republican campaign machine -- reacts when the media 's disillusionment sets in for real .
Their actions may determine the course of the 2008 race .
If they handle the media 's about - face with aplomb , her chances of looking , well , vice - presidential will be enhanced .
But if Palin 's handlers blow it out of proportion and show a strain , their behavior will reflect negatively on her .
Gibson , as dignified a newsperson as America has now , treated Palin fairly and did n't resort to hectoring her with " gotcha " questions , either .
Palin 's supporters may be chagrined that their candidate did n't sound more self - assured or expert when she discussed Alaska 's relationship to Russia .
But Gibson did n't try to trip her up .
He pretty much asked the kinds of questions I would have put to Palin as well .
Gibson treated her with the respect befitting a vice presidential candidate .
ABC , while discussing the interview Friday on " Good Morning America " unleashed political correspondent Jake Tapper to assess the " truthiness " of Palin 's remarks on the ABC show .
The television networks appear to be treating Palin carefully , trying hard not to seem sexist or liberal or come across as intellectual , big - city bullies .
When ABC noted that Tapper had found a few holes in Palin 's comments ( though nothing earth shattering ) , the network took pains to add that it , too , would be dissecting the statements of Joe Biden , the Democratic vice presidential nominee .
Specifically , Palin seemed to have little idea about the Bush Doctrine , in which the U.S must spread democracy around the world to halt terrorist acts .
When Gibson put it to her and asked if she agreed with the doctrine , she answered , " In what respect , Charlie ? "
Some analysts have suggested that Gibson knew more about the Bush Doctrine than the vice - presidential candidate .
" She sidestepped questions on whether she had the national security credentials needed to be commander - in - chief , " the Associated Press noted .
Since we 're all clear on the nuances of the Bush Doctrine , we can move on to the Fickle Media Doctrine .
Now that we 've built you up , it 's about time for us to knock you down .
MEDIA WEB QUESTION OF THE DAY : Can Sarah Palin withstand the body blows that are being inflicted by the national media ?
MONDAY PET PEEVE :
The media are n't the bad guys in the Palin discussion .
It 's easy to accuse us of acting like sexists or big-city egomaniacs .
Let 's be real , though .
McCain selected Palin for exactly those reasons -- because she is a woman from a little - known state , who can take some of the heat off McCain and behave like an attack dog against Barack Obama .
So far , the Republicans ' plan has worked to perfection , as Palin has dominated the political discourse over the past few weeks .
Now we 'll see if she has the right stuff to go the distance .
THE READERS RESPOND to my column about " The Bully Boys " of MSNBC , Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews :
" I 'd watch MSNBC more if Keith Olbermann was n't so enraged against conservatives .
I 'm a moderate but to me he does n't add any value to presenting the " news " as he sees it .
Failure to present both sides of the issue fails to meet the standards of journalism . "
-- Alan Carreon
" The ' Bully Boys ' have one style , and it 's a fun style .
I enjoy it .
Brian Williams and Tom Brokaw have a different style , less strident , more subdued , more serious , but still with a delightful and subtle sense of humor .
I like listening to all of them , and I hope they keep up their chatter .
I love Rachel Maddow and how wonderful that she will join the group ( with her more objective style ) . "

Weapon of Choice is a new 2D run-and - gun shooter birthed from the mind of Nathan Fouts , weapon designer on Resistance : Fall of Man and boss programmer on Ratchet and Clank : Tools of Destruction .
Though the game definitely lacks the budget of those PS3 hits , it certainly does n't lack any of the creativity .
I 've played a lot of 2D shooters in my day , but I 've never seen a weapon quite like the jet pack / bazooka utilized in the video above .
Weapon of Choice is set to hit Xbox Community Games by the end of the year .
For screens and info on the game , you can check out its official website here .
Hit the jump for more on Nathan 's motivations for leaving the Blu - Rays behind in favor of the hand drawn , 2D shooter .

The reason Nathan is saying good - bye to 3D action games ( for now ) in favor of this decidedly more old - school flavored project comes from his long term love affair with games like Metal Warriors and Contra , and his desire to make games for those who share that love affair .
Nathan says he aims to make Weapon of Choice not the casual , not the hardcore , but a third type of gamer you do n't hear about much : the " Prodigal gamer " .
Prodigal gamers are those who cut their teeth on NES and SNES era shooters ; games that require amazing platforming , bullet dodging , and fire - button mashing skills .
These are gamers who learned to love hard games as children , but as they 've gotten older , do n't have the same amount of free time they once had to dedicate to their hobby .
They are n't casual gamers , because they have a huge backlog of gaming skills , but they are n't quite hardcore either , as family , work , and other grown up responsibilities can't mutually co-exist with 24 hour Halo 3 marathons .
So , I guess it turns out that I 'm a Prodigal gamer .
Who knew ?
Below are a few more details about Weapon of Choice .
If things go well , I 'll be able to score an interview with Nathan before the game drops .
CHOICE is your Weapon !

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Although men are at high risk of acquiring human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infections , most last no more than a year , about the same time this sexually transmitted disease persists in women , researchers report in The Journal of Infectious Diseases .
HPV has long been known as a cause of genital warts , but in recent years most reports have focused on its association with cervical cancer .
In 2006 , an HPV vaccine ( Gardasil ) designed to prevent cervical cancer was approved for use and a report released yesterday indicates that roughly one quarter of adolescent girls in the U.S. were vaccinated in 2007 .
Because male - to - female transmission of HPV influences the risk of cancer in women , Dr. Anna R. Giuliano of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa , Florida , and colleagues and sought out more information on the matter .
The team conducted a forward - looking study of 290 men from southern Arizona , ages 18 - 44 years , who were recruited by a variety of means including college posters , encounters at health clinics , and radio and newspaper advertisements .
The participants were examined at the start of the study and every 6 months thereafter .
On average , the subjects were followed for 15.5 months .
Upon entering the study , 30 percent of men were infected with HPV .
The 12 - month rate of new infection was 29.2 percent .
Over the entire study period , roughly half of men were infected with HPV and nearly a third of the HPV types found are known to cause cancer .
About 75 percent of the infections cleared within a year of detection .
The HPV vaccine is currently being tested internationally in men .
“ Should we show that HPV prevention vaccines ... are effective in men we can potentially reduce a proportion of infections acquired by men , ” which in turn could reduce the risk in their sexual partners , Giuliano concluded .

Hey
As part of a new series that will be making an appearance over the next couple of months is Mac 101 .
This series will focus on basic tips and tricks for the new user to the Mac system .
Since Macs are growing in popularity I thought it was a good idea to do some sort of series to anyone in this category .
This first post will be a big list of useful shortcuts for the Mac .
This list was actually recommended by a reader from the contact form .
The email was sent in about month ago so I have n’t been to long in replying .
Anyway this list will be split up into two sections basic key commands and the rest of them .
This list will not include any F1 - 12 shortcuts as these vary widely depending on the keyboard and age of computer .
Of course , if you have anymore that are not features on the list please leave a comment below .
Overview
A quick over view of the shortcut symbols used on this page .
They should display correctly as they are unicode as part of the font .
This works on Firefox and Safari so you should be ok .
The list below is for anyone who is n’t quite sure .
⌘ = Command , the most common modifier .
⌥ = Option or Alt .
⇧ = Shift
^ = Control .
Not used as frequently but is still there .
Basic Shortcuts
This is a list of shortcuts that should be hardwired into your brain .
These are usually the most commonly used .
Most of the shortcuts on the list are for Finder , although a lot will work in other applications .
If I wrote a list for every single application out there I would be here for ever .
⌘ + Q = Quit
⌘ + W = Close window
⌘ + O = Open a file in your application
⌘ + P = Print
⌘ + C = Copy
⌘ + V = Paste
⌘ + X = Cut
⌘ + S = Save
⌘ + Z = Undo
⌘ + A = Select All
⌘ + Y or Space = Quicklook
⌘ + Tab =
Cycle through windows
Personally I use all of those shortcuts all of the time .
It helps to remember them and use them .
Most will come naturally over time .
Other Shortcuts
This is the list where every other shortcut resides .
Have a look through and see if there is anything which is of interest to you .
⌘ + ⇧+ 3 = Take fullscreen picture

If you have any more general shortcuts please add them in the comments .
If you want a cool little application to check which shortcuts are availble to you I recommend KeyCue , I have previously written about it here .
It is a good little application for finding new shortcuts on your system .

He ’s often quoted in the print media , as well as in the worldwide wire services .
His statement to The Associated Press on September 11 , 2001 , reverberated around the world : " When you think of the coordination this took , it 's historic .
When you think of the measures that will have to be put in place to ratchet up security in the United States , it 's monumental .
This opens up a new era in the history of terrorism . "
From explaining what high alert means on the Oprah Winfrey Show to exposing terrorist networks in America on the O'Reilly Factor wth Bill O’Reilly to discussing the freedom fighter or terrorist controversy on Larry King Live , Kushner is seen on all the major cable and television networks .
On the radio , he is a frequent guest of the " heavy hundred , " Talkers Magazine 's most important radio talk show hosts .

In their best - selling book on thoughts for daily living , Three Minutes a Day , The Christophers explain how Kushner 's approach to his work shows people how to “ find a balance between useless worry and prudence ; between acknowledgement of evil and appreciation of beauty . ”
The author of numerous articles and five books on terrorism , Kushner ’s latest work is Holy War on the Home Front : The Secret Islamic Terror Network in the United States .
Law enforcement agencies across the country and throughout the world have used Kushner 's analysis in Holy War on the connection between drugs and terrorism to guide their own investigations of the problem .
The Metropolitan Police Service of the United Kingdom cites Kushner 's analysis in Holy War in their training module for law enforcement officers and airline security personnel .
His best - selling Encyclopedia of Terrorism is considered the gold - standard of terrorism reference works , and has won numerous awards from such organizations as the American Library Association and the Library Journal .
As one reviewer of the Encyclopedia of Terrorism wrote , " It is for good reason that the encyclopedia won the most prestigious awards for reference works straight in a row . "
Kushner also edits issues on terrorism for the American Behavioral Scientist and serves on the journal 's prestigious editorial board as well as the boards of a number of other journals both here and abroad .
The highly respected terror analyst Dr. Walid Phares states : " Professor Harvey Kushner 's research is a benchmark in the study of the ongoing war on terror .
His academic excellence and his thorough analysis of the Jihadist ideology , strategies and tactics are a necessary component of the national effort to understand the threat and find the appropriate response on several levels of engagement .
A special effort is required in America 's classrooms and court rooms to enhance the understanding of the real root causes of terror .
Professor Kushner is one of the pioneers in this crucial field . "

Earlier today I reported SEC Panic - Shorting Curbs Placed on GSE Stocks .
Big brother has now decided to step in and force the price of all financial stocks up with this SEC short sale order .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an emergency order on Tuesday placing restrictions on the short selling of shares of certain major financial firms .
The SEC 's order will require that anyone effecting a short sale in these securities arrange beforehand to borrow the securities and deliver them at settlement .
The order takes effect Monday , July 21 , and will terminate at the end of July 29 .
The SEC said the order may be extended , but for no more than 30 calendar days in total duration .
The agency identified the following securities affected by its order :
BNP Paribas Securities Corp
Bank of America Corp
Barclays PLC
Citigroup Inc
Credit Suisse Group
Daiwa Securities Group Inc
Deutsche Bank Group AG
Allianz SE
Goldman Sachs Group Inc
Royal Bank ADS
HSBC Holdings Plc ADS
JPMorgan Chase & Co
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
Merrill Lynch & Co Inc
Mizuho Financial Group Inc
Morgan Stanley
UBS AG
Freddie Mac
Fannie Mae
Bernanke told lawmakers it's " important " for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds and stocks to rise so they can keep raising capital and aid the mortgage market .
Paulson said the two companies are " essential " because they represent the only " functioning " part of the home loan market .
The firms own or guarantee about half of the $ 12 trillion in U.S. mortgages .
The best defense against misinformation is the truth .
To paraphrase Jack Nicholson , the market can’t handle not having the truth .
Lack of information leads to lack of confidence .
....
The above charts show that short selling intensity is below average in the banking sector and in Fannie Mae ’s industry group .
Generally , short interest tends to lend support to price action , though there are times when short sellers can be correct .
The existence of short sellers is support for stock prices , because short positions must eventually be covered .
Perhaps Chairman
Cox should focus on freedom of fundamental information , so that short sellers and stock buyers can make more informed decisions , and so all can sort fact from any fiction put out there by rumor mongers .

About This Photograph
Is the moon really this colorful ?
In a way , yes .
The lunar surface actually does have quite a bit of color , although in reality it is very subtle .
In this photograph , the color saturation has been enhanced to bring out the differences in the colors of the various areas of the surface .
The hues are correct , just much more vivid than we usually see them .
Aside from making an interesting aesthetic presentation , the colors also give clues as to the mineralogy of the moon 's surface .
Bluish areas are rich in titanium and iron , for example , while reddish areas contain little of these elements .
Also , at the sites of many impact craters , we can see that the deeper material exposed ( and in some cases scattered ) by the impact is of a different composition than the material on the surface .
Just a day after negotiations seemed to break down , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi struck a confident tone .
So did Rep. Barney Frank , who threw in some of his patented sass : “ Now that Sen. McCain is safely in Mississippi , we can get to serious work . ”
House and Senate leaders have promised to keep working until agreement is reached , but there ’s no telling when that might happen .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has already resorted to begging .
LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) -- O.J. Simpson faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison after he and co-defendant Clarence " C.J. "
Stewart were found guilty on 12 charges , including armed robbery and kidnapping .
The jury reached the verdict 13 years to the day after O.J. Simpson was acquitted of two murders .

The case involved a Las Vegas , Nevada , hotel room confrontation over sports memorabilia .
Simpson said the items had been stolen from him .
Friday 's verdicts came 13 years to the day after a Los Angeles jury acquitted Simpson of killing his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Goldman .
Goldman 's father , Fred Goldman , was thrilled with the result .
" We 're absolutely thrilled to see that the potential is that he could spend the rest of his life in jail , where the scumbag belongs , " Goldman said Saturday .
" Right now , there is not much more to say other than we 're going to wait to find out what else happens . "
The Las Vegas jury reached its verdict after about 13 hours of deliberations Friday .
Simpson sat quietly and showed little emotion at the defense table as he listened to the verdicts being read .
Watch O.J. Simpson verdict being read »
Deputies then handcuffed Simpson and led him from the courtroom .
Simpson , 61 , could get life in prison for these convictions .
Clark County District Judge Jackie Glass set sentencing for December 5 .
Defense attorney Yale Galanter spoke with Simpson after the verdict and said the former football star was " extremely upset , extremely emotional . "
Galanter said he will file a motion for a new trial and appeal the case .
Simpson and Stewart were charged with 12 counts , including conspiracy to commit a crime , robbery , assault and kidnapping with a deadly weapon .
Carmelita Durio , Simpson 's sister , sobbed as he was being escorted out of the courtroom , The Associated Press reported .
As spectators left the courtroom , Durio collapsed , and paramedics were called , court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said .
Watch O.J. Simpson being removed from court »
Although Glass prohibited mention of the 1995 murder case during the robbery trial , it remained an unspoken undercurrent throughout .
" From the beginning , my biggest concern , and I told you this the day after Mr. Simpson was arrested , was whether jurors would be able to separate their very strong feelings about Mr. Simpson and judge him fairly , equally and honestly , " Galanter said .
Stewart attorney Brent Bryson said he was shocked by the verdict and said his client was hurt by Simpson 's notoriety .
" I'm in disbelief that a jury could come back and find all those counts and convict Mr. Stewart on all those counts , " Bryson said .
" The only explanation that is even conceivable is the spillover prejudice from sitting next to Mr. Simpson . "
Simpson arrived at the Clark County Justice Center about 10:50 p.m. Simpson told CNN before the verdict was read that he was " apprehensive . "
Prosecutors charged that Simpson led a group of men who used threats , guns and force to take photographs , footballs and other items from memorabilia dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley in September 2007 .
But a defense attorney said Simpson was targeted by police out to get him and cohorts in order to make " big bucks " off him .
Neither Simpson nor Stewart testified during the trial , and witnesses gave sometimes conflicting and contradictory testimony .
Galanter said Simpson was a target of investigators from the very beginning .
The case " has taken on a life of its own because of Mr. Simpson 's involvement , " he added .
" Every cooperator , every person who had a gun , every person who had an ulterior motive , every person who signed a book deal , every person who got paid money , the police , the district attorney 's office is only interested in one thing : Mr. Simpson , " Galanter said .
The most compelling evidence for both sides came from audiotapes .
For the prosecution , conversations taped by collectibles middleman Thomas Riccio took jurors from the poolside planning to the profanity - laced hotel room confrontation .
Riccio , a chatty sports memorabilia dealer and convicted felon , made the rounds on network news shows immediately after the hotel room fracas .
He admitted on the stand that various media outlets paid him $ 210,000 .
The crucial evidence for the defense came from two audiotapes : a voicemail from a key prosecution witness who seemed willing to tailor his testimony for a price and tapes of Las Vegas police officers laughing and joking about Simpson 's Los Angeles acquittal following his arrest .
Galanter told jurors the surreptitious recording captured police investigators in the hotel room after the confrontation .
" They 're making jokes .
They 're saying things like , ' We 're gonna get him , " ' he said .
Police were called to the hotel about 8 p.m. September 13 , 2007 .
Shortly after midnight , detectives visited Simpson at his hotel .
He told them he was just trying to recover property that had been stolen from him .
" Why are they not in trouble ? " Simpson asked about memorabilia dealers Beardsley and Fromong , according to police reports filed in the case .
Both men testified for the prosecution , although Beardsley said Simpson did nothing wrong and was " set up " by the " rat Riccio . "
Riccio , who was not charged in the case , testified that he did n't think twice about recording Simpson when asked for help retrieving what Simpson claimed was his property .
All four of the former co-defendants testified for the prosecution .
Two of them tied Simpson to guns and threats .
Michael McClinton testified that Simpson instructed him to bring a gun and " look menacing " before they entered the hotel room .
Simpson has told police he had no idea the people with him were armed .
The testimony was laced with innuendo about unsavory activities by several of the witnesses , many with criminal records .
Riccio and Beardsley feuded openly , calling each other names and questioning each other 's sanity .
Aware that loose cannons on the stand could blow the case into mistrial purgatory , Glass refused to let David Cook testify .
Cook , an attorney for the family of Ronald Lyle Goldman , searches for Simpson assets to satisfy the $ 33.5 million civil judgment against the former NFL star .
Simpson was acquitted of killing his ex-wife and Goldman in a trial that ended 13 years to the day before the Las Vegas jury began its deliberations .
Regarding Glass ' ruling , Cook said , " If you read between the lines , I think she thought my appearance would bring up the Ghost of Christmas Past . "
As testimony neared its end , Glass vented her frustration with the quibbling lawyers .
" I 'm trying to get this trial back on track , " she snapped .
" I am surprised you have n't seen my head spin and fire come out of my mouth at this point in this trial . "
CNN 's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report .

Is your prawn cocktail toxic ?
Read this and you may never want to eat one again
Southern Vietnam is hot and sticky at any time , but the humid air inside the Huong family 's hut , perched on a prawn - pond dyke in the Mekong Delta , is almost unbearable .
The single room is rank with chemicals : we cough and sneeze when we enter .
There 's an acrid dust all over the mud floor , which makes you worry for little Huong Thi Mai , a seven - year - old girl who is sitting on the bed near the door watching her parents work .
Asian farmers are using an array of banned drugs to produce prawns for British consumption
I glance at her bare shins for signs of the skin infections that are common among prawn farm workers , but she looks OK .
At least for now .
Mr Huong is proud : ' This is a very modern prawn - farming business , ' he says .
And , with luck and four months ' hard labour , it is going to make him and his family quite rich .
After they 've paid their debts , the Huongs hope to buy a moped and their first fridge .
Thi Mai might go to a new school .
' We can have a better life , ' says Mrs Huong .
But until the tiger prawns are ready for harvest , and shipped off to Britain , Europe or America , the family must live here , keeping a 24 - hour watch beside the sour - smelling pond .
They 've borrowed £ 4,000 , a huge sum for this family , to invest in prawn larvae , feed and medicines - and they need to keep alert in case anyone tries to steal the growing prawns .
Modernity , for Mr Huong , appears to be chiefly measured in chemicals .
I count 13 different pots , jars and sacks of these in the hut , and he eagerly talks me through them .
He 's particularly keen on a compound called ' Super Star ' - the Vietnamese print on the label says it ' intensifies the metabolism to help prawns grow fat ' .
He learnt about this additive on a course run by the Vietnamese government at a local fishery training centre .
' We 're not allowed to use much - only ten bottles per crop , ' he says .
There are other glossy labels - most of them for products made in Thailand , the centre of the world 's prawn - farming industry .
Mr Huong mixes up feed in a basin while we talk .
The basic feed , he says , is soya , broken rice and fish , and prawn parts .
But in it goes a large dose of something called ' Amino - Pro ' .
' It helps the prawns taste better , ' he says .
The label has familiar words from stock - cube packets : aspartic acid , glutamic acid and taurine , which is the key element of the energy drink Red Bull .
Then there is Vitamix , ' to make prawns grow faster ' , Calphorax ' to help the shell thicken and give better colour ' and Vin Superclear ' to kill pests , viruses and smells ' .
On top of all this is a seasoning of antibiotics .
Prawn farming is an ancient activity in tropical countries .
Coastal peoples in Indonesia and Vietnam have trapped young marine prawns in brackish ponds for at least 500 years , feeding them up with fish scraps and household waste to eat or sell .
The prawns , properly farmed , are sweet and juicy : it 's a lucrative business .
But the trade has changed drastically since black tiger prawns became a popular luxury in wealthy parts of the world during the Nineties .
The cottage industry was swiftly industrialised .
From Ecuador to Indonesia , coastal farmers punched holes in sea defences to let salt water into their paddy fields .
As with salmon , coffee and a host of other once rare and expensive foods , the demand from rich countries brought more and more producers into the market .
Tiger or ' king ' prawns and their siblings have become a staple of Britain 's supermarkets .
The result ?
Ever - falling prices , but increasing use of chemicals and dropping quality .
The chemicals used in these production systems - which pack 20 prawns into one square metre of foul , endlessly recycled water - have been shown again and again to harm the workers involved , the environment and very possibly the consumers .
Yet shoppers are more in love with tiger prawns than ever .
Tropical farmed prawns are now Britain 's fifth most popular seafood .
Sales were up 14 per cent last year - and we now spend £ 169 million a year on them , four times as much as we spend on frozen burgers .
At Marks & Spencer , which has seen a 20 per cent increase in king prawn sales , a spokesman told me tropical prawns are ' so fashionable ' because they are ' a light and healthy option ' .
Rising demand for prawns has led to falling prices but an increase in the use of chemicals
Enthusiastic endorsement from celebrity chefs has helped the boom - Gordon Ramsay recently salivated over king prawn and wonton soup on The F Word , while Jamie Oliver suggested a recipe for them on skewers .
Light and healthy ?
I think about this as we follow Mr Huong past a litter of prawn - feed bags to the pond , which measures 400 square metres - about the size of two tennis courts .
It was once the family 's ancestral rice paddy , and at this time of year the growing seedlings should be turning the landscape a brilliant yellow - green .
But the pond - like all the others nearby - is now a viscous grey , like old washing - up water .
Mr Huong paddles off in a small boat , scattering the feed he mixed earlier .
A system of paddle wheels , driven by a diesel engine , lies ready to stir up the water and bring oxygen to the shellfish packed beneath .
There are 80,000 of them below the surface .
Back on the dyke , he dips a net into the opaque water , and pulls up a few of the animals to weigh them and inspect them for deformities .
They are two months old , and about the size of my index finger .
The Huongs - again , like all their neighbours - opened the dykes and turned to prawn farming because of the fantastic profits available .
A field that would have provided enough rice for the family to eat , plus a little extra to sell for essentials , has become a life - changing asset .
If this crop is successful , the Huongs will sell the prawns for £ 8,000 - if prices hold up - after only four months .
This is an enormous amount in a country where many rural people still survive on less than £ 1 a day .
As a result , rice farmers have now become chemists , experts in the complex biology of intensively farmed prawns .
Across the dykes , we see men and women in conical hats dipping testtubes in the water , checking acidity levels and examining prawns in test nets for the dreaded signals of disease : reddening shells , mis-shapen bodies , white spots on their legs .
The prawns , packed into the ponds , are terribly prone to illness .
Mr Huong 's last batch of prawn larvae all died after a month - he does n't know why .
Indeed , white - spot virus almost killed off the entire industry in Vietnam two years ago .
Having gambled everything on prawns , people will do anything to protect their investment .
That includes using any chemicals that may seem to help .
' Often we get consignments of antibiotics for human use that are past the date they can be used by , ' a villager told me .
On the main road out of town , near Mr Huong 's farm , there is a government sign .
Under a vivid picture of jars , bottles and dead prawns , it lists all the chemicals that prawn farmers must not use - 51 of them .
They include many human antibiotics , penicillins , and some names I recognise from the bad days of the European fish - farming industry - nitrofuran , chloramphenicol and organophosphate pesticides .
This poster shows the efforts the Vietnamese government has been taking to educate farmers .
But when everything hinges on a successful crop , it is inevitable that some are willing to take risks .
Back in Britain , I ran the long list of chemicals we had found in use at Mr Huong 's prawn farm past Peter Bridson , who is in charge of aquaculture at the Soil Association .
Nothing we had found surprised him .
' You see this repeatedly in industrial aquaculture .
There 's a get - rich - quick attitude .
Everyone follows the boom , but one false step and it crashes .
And disease is usually the problem . '
Most of the chemicals we photographed in Mr Huong 's shed are pesticides , feed enhancers and growth stimulants .
' These types of products are commonly used in Asia , ' says Bridson .
' The farmers experiment .
Someone chucks something in his tanks and gets good results .
He tells his mates and the product becomes mainstream in the area - whether it actually does anything or not . '
Mr Huong 's Super Star contains a chemical commonly used as a ' nutritional enhancer ' .
It is marketed by the company Bayer in Europe as ' Butaphosphan ' .
On Bayer 's website all I can find is a recommendation that it be used for injecting into sheep , dogs and cats suffering from ' stress , over - exertion or exhaustion ' and as a tonic in cases of weakness or anaemia in animals .
( Note that Bayer does not supply the chemical in Vietnam nor market it as a ' nutritional enhancer ' . )
Some chemicals may do more harm than good - and not just to the image of the tropical prawn .
Super Star also contains methyl hydroxybenzoate , an anti-fungal preservative which is banned in France and Australia .
It has been linked to cancer in some beauty treatments .
The most dubious thing we found in the Huong 's arsenal of chemicals was in a pot named ' N300 ' - a ' medicine for digestion and liver function ' , made by a Vietnamese company called Cong Ty TNHH .
To ensure good - quality prawns , customers are being urged to be prepared to pay more
It contained beta glucan , a harmless component of many human nutrition supplements , but also norfloxacin , an antibiotic usually used to treat gonorrhea and urinary tract infections in humans .
It is ' under watch ' by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration because of increased reports of nasty side effects , including damage to tendons .
Norfloxacin and its siblings , the fluoroquinolones , are banned for use in animals for human consumption in the U.S. , and subject to EU controls on imports .
Misuse of the fluoroquinolones is increasingly blamed for the rise in resistance to anti-bacterial medicines , and five floxacins are listed on the poster of banned chemicals we saw at the entrance to the village .
Since 2005 , Vietnam 's fishery ministry has banned the use of fluoroquinolones in fish destined for the North American market , but not , apparently , for European countries .
From the pile of empty N300 jars we saw , there is a lot of fluoroquinolone in the feed for Mr Huong 's prawns .
Numerous surveys have been done on the effects of the antibiotics that are used in prawn farming across the world ( 31 different ones were identified in Vietnam in a 2006 study , among a total of 155 different drugs ) .
They conclude that , although the antibiotics may rise to detectable levels in the bodies of prawns , even greater damage is being done to the environment in which they 're farmed .
It 's Mr Huong 's daughter Thi Mai who may have problems when doctors try to treat her for skin complaints , diarrhoea , respiratory problems or other bacterial infections , including malaria .
They may find she is resistant to certain antibiotics .
But the effects could be felt further away .
Scientists have speculated that outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in Europe and the U.S. may have been started by antibiotic - resistant salmonella in farmed fish from Asia .
And the leaking of antibiotics and pesticides into the delicate ecosystem in the coastal shallows of prawn - farming countries will have effects no one yet fully understands .
Peter Bridson worries the chemicals will intensify , because the water system is closed , with water being re-used from one farm to another , leading to an even greater build - up of chemicals in the prawn ponds .
So how worried should we prawn lovers be ?
Well , Food & Water Watch , an American lobby group that has studied prawn farming for ten years , issued a warning in its latest report .
It said : ' The negative effects of eating industrially - produced tiger prawns may include neurological damage from ingesting chemicals such as endosulfans , an allergic response to penicillin residues , or infection by an antibiotic - resistant pathogen such as E - coli . '
That is a judicious ' may ' .
What is certain is that banned or controlled chemicals are coming into Europe with farmed prawns , despite the promises of governments and retailers to stop this happening .
Last year , the EU rejected shipments of farmed prawn from six major exporters in India because they contained chloramphenicol and nitrofurans - two once - common antibiotics which are now known to be carcinogenic .
One causes leukaemia .
The EU claims this shows its regulations work , but the fact remains that the EU is thought to test only 1 per cent of such shipments .
The real scale of the problem could be far wider .
In Louisiana , a prawn - producing region which conducts its own tests on imports , chloramphenicol was found in 9 per cent of all foreign prawn shipments in 2007 .
I 'm grateful to Taras Grescoe for that last piece of information .
His new book , Bottomfeeder , describes the scary practices of the fishing industry in nauseating detail .
Grescoe thinks farmed prawns are the most disgusting of all the industrially farmed foods - even worse than battery chickens .
And he does n't eat them .
But boycotting farmed prawns wo n't hurt the real villains in all this .
As in any tale of shipping foods of the poor world to the rich in bulk , it is big corporations , processors and retailers which make the bulk of profits , and they should therefore take responsibility .
Unlike small - scale producers like Mr Huong , they would survive a collapse of the prawn market .
No , to make a difference across the tropics , we customers must demand better prawns , raised in a way that 's good for them and the people who farm them .
And that means we have to be prepared to pay more for them .
On my desk I have two 212g boxes from my local Tesco of uncooked peeled king prawns from Vietnam , which I found on sale at two for £ 5 .
That means the 60 or so prawns cost me just over 8 p each .
Once the costs of shelling , freezing , packing and shipping have been factored in - not to mention the supermarket 's own profit margin - the producer would have been obliged to sell his prawns for a few pennies each .
That is simply not enough to ensure decent standards of welfare and production .
Bad prawn farming is caused by the same things as bad chicken farming - the relentless pressure on prices forced on producers by supermarkets .
The result is a prawn cocktail that only a chemist could love .
During a conference in Tegucigalpa bringing together UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) officials and drug ministers from 32 Latin American and Caribbean nations , the conference host , Honduran President Manuel Zelaya called for legalizing drug use .
In so doing , he joins a growing list of Latin American leaders singing the same tune .
Manuel Zelaya
Legalizing drug use , or more accurately , decriminalization , would de-fang international drug trafficking organizations and free Honduras of the financial burden of attempting to impose drug prohibition , Zelaya said .
" The trade of arms , drugs and people ... are scourges on the international economy , and we are unable to provide effective responses " because of the global drug prohibition regime , Zelaya said Monday at the opening of the 18th meeting of regional leaders against drug trafficking .
Drug users should be considered patients , not criminals , Zelaya said .
Drug users could be treated by health care professionals instead of arrested or harassed by police .
And the state could stop throwing money down a rat hole , too , he added .
" Rather than continue to kill and capture traffickers , we could invest in resources for education and training , " the Honduran leader said .
Like the rest of Central America , Honduras is plagued by illegal drug syndicates typically using the country as a transshipment point for Colombian cocaine headed for the North American market .
It is also seeing increasing drug use levels as some of the product inevitably falls off of the back of the truck .
With his remarks Monday , Zelaya is joining what could become an emerging Latin American consensus .
Just days ago , Mexican President Felipe Calderón , whose country is plagued with prohibition - related violence , called for the decriminalization of small amounts of drugs .
The government of Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner is actively pushing decriminalization there .
In Brazil , the courts are leading the way to decriminalization .
Meanwhile , Bolivia and Venezuela are openly feuding with the US , in part over drug policy issues .
In August , officials of the left - leaning Mexican PRD , the largest opposition party , asked party legislators to consider calling for drug legalization as part of a ' grand national accord ' to deal with violence and insecurity in the country .
The talk of legalization by Latin American political leaders is often imprecise -- do they mean decrim or legal , regulated production and sales ? -- and to the degree they are really talking only about decriminalization -- not legalization -- the enactment of such policies will fail to reduce some of the harms associated with drug prohibition , although they will reduce certain harms suffered by drug users .
But Latin America appears to be on the verge of showing its northern neighbor a thing or two when it comes to humane and effective drug policies .
Preventing Spam in Form Submissions without Using a CAPTCHA
Got a Spam Problem ?
If you ’re looking for a smart solution to prevent your forum / guestbook / web-application / whatever from getting flooded with junk entries , I think I can help you .
Foreword : Why You Should n’t Use a CAPTCHA
A CAPTCHA is a method to fight spam robots , by requiring the user to enter a code which is displayed as a distorted image .
The bad news : CAPTCHA s are annoying to users .
The good news :
You probably do n’t need one .
The method described here would require the spammer to sit down and adjust his scripts for your specific website .
So , unless your site is an extremely attractive target for spammers , they probably wo n’t take that time .
The bottom line :
CAPTCHA s are needed only on very popular sites .
Try less intrusive methods first .
Basics : Use CSS
Code HTML : < label >
Leave this blank : < input type =" text " class = " noshow " name = " leaveblank " ></ label >< br > < label >
Do not change this : < input type =" text " class = " noshow " name = " dontchange " value= " http :// " ></label > CSS : .noshow { display : none ; } PHP : if ( $ _POST [' leaveblank ' ] != '' or $ _POST [ ' dontchange ' ] != ' http://')
{ // display message that the form submission was rejected } else { // accept form submission }
First Improvement : Use JavaScript
Code HTML : < input type =" text " id =" leaveblank " name = " leaveblank " > < script type =" text / javascript " > document.getElementById('leaveblank').className = " noshow " ; </ script >
Second Improvement : Use Encoded JavaScript
Code HTML : < script type =" text / javascript " >

Third Improvement : Use PHP
Code PHP : // You can use the date ( ) function to change field names periodically : //
For daily changes , e.g. use : $ code = date ( ' Yz ' ) ; //
Do n’t copy this 1:1 - adjust the date ( ) parameters !
$ html = " < input type= ' text ' name=' abc$ code ' >
" ; if ( ! isset ( $ _POST [ " abc$code " ] ) { // reject form submission }
Improvement of the Third Improvement
Code PHP : $ code = date ( ' Yz ' ) ; $ codeYesterday = date ( ' Yz ' , time ( ) - 86400 ) ; // 86400 seconds are 1 day if ( isset ( $ _POST [ " abc$codeYesterday " ] ) $ code = $ codeYesterday ; }
Fourth Improvement : Use a Database
Code MySQL : CREATE TABLE `spam` ( `ip` int ( 10 ) unsigned default NULL , `timestamp` timestamp NOT NULL , KEY `ip` ( `ip` ) ) ; PHP : $ ip = $ _SERVER [ ' REMOTE_ADDR ' ] ; // when you reject a form submission : mysqli_query ( " INSERT INTO `spam` SET `ip`=INET_ATON ( ' $ip ' ) ; " ) ; // whenever somebody opens the page : mysqli_query ( " SELECT `timestamp` FROM `spam` WHERE ip=INET_ATON ( ' $ip ' ) ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC LIMIT 1 ; " ) ; if ( time ( ) - $ timestamp < 120 ) { // 2 minutes // display error message to try again in 2 minutes } else { // display HTML form }

Following on the in the footsteps of fake fireworks , a fake singer , and fake 16 year old gymnasts , the latest fake scandal involving the Olympic games is delivered by fake minorities .
According to reports , the children appearing in costumes representing China ’s 55 minority groups at the Olympic opening ceremony were fake .
The children were performers from the Galaxy Children ’s Art Troupe , a group that only includes children drawn from the Han Chinese majority .
According to Wikipedia , China has 55 minority groups consisting of an official figure of 123.33 million people , or 9.4 % of the population .
Visually some of the minority groups have little differences to the Han population , but others are distinctly different , including a Russian minority who are white .
There is delicious irony in China showing the word that it embraces its minority groups by showing fake minority group members .
Even those with pro-Chinese sympathies will shake their heads at this .
It also begs the question : is anything at the Olympics real ?
There have been allegations of biased judging , empty stadiums , promises of foreign press freedom that has seen journalists beaten , boards hiding construction sites and obvious poverty … and probably a whole range of other things covered or faked as well .
China could have used these games to highlight the good in the country , but in their own controlling paranoia they are actually causing more negative press than would have otherwise been the case .

Today I have got some sourcecode for you .
There is a little programming challenge named The Self - Documenting Code Contest that is quite fun , they try to find the cleanest and easiest to read code for this task :
Write a program that generates all two - word anagrams of the string “ documenting ” .
Here ’s a word list you might want to use : wordlist.zip .
When you ’re done , send the results to [ email protected ] .
Good luck !
So this caught my interest and i wrote a little entry in Ruby that is 23 lines long with whitespace and very nice to read .
But I wo n’t show you this code until the contest is over , and this is not the reason for this post .
The reason is , that the nice version takes about 2 seconds , and somebody else has coded a Python solution that takes only 1 second ( I have no idea what his code looks like ) .
This post is about a fast anagram finding algorithm , and how I developed this algorithm .
The final result takes about 0.11 seconds .
Algorithm
The most basic algorithm has two phases :
Read in the file Build all combinations of two words and compare the letter count with the query .
Building the combinations is usually done with two nested loops and takes O( n ^ 2 ) runtime .
This is slow , so I have added another step in between :
The second step is really slow , but it would be a lot faster if it has to handle less words .
So I wrote a little filtering step that lets only words through which are made out of the same letters as the query word .
For example when the query is documenting , the word men or go and even too are extracted , even if the number of letters might not match .
But that ’s not important , what is important is that the number of possible words are reduced a lot , and so the next phase is faster .
Idea # 2 : Use a Commutative Hashing Function
String comparisons are slow .
To common way to find out if the strings coming with tuned is an anagram of the word documenting is to sort the letters and make a comparison , like this :
irb ( main ) : 003 : 0 > " documenting " . unpack ( " c* " ) . sort .
pack ( " c * " ) => " cdegimnnotu " irb ( main ) : 004 : 0 > ( " coming " + " tuned " ). unpack ( " c* " ) . sort .
pack ( " c * " ) => " cdegimnnotu "
The strings are equal , so we have a match .
But this comparison is terribly slow !
What ’s worse , the computations have to be redone for each match .
It would be much better to just compare hash values , and find a hash function to quickly check if we might have a match , and only do the string comparison when the hash check matches .
The hash has to be good enough that we do n’t have too much false positives ( hashes are equal but the real comparisons not ) to get a speed advantage .
So why not just sum up all the letters bytes ?
irb ( main ) : 005 : 0 > " documenting " . sum => 1181 irb ( main ) : 006 : 0 > " coming " . sum + " tuned " . sum =>
1181
Ruby ’s String #sum does exactly this .
we can now precalculate the sum for each word , and to find a match we just add the two hashes and compare the result to the query ’s hash :
irb ( main ) : 007 : 0 > query = " documenting " ; first = " coming " ; second = " tuned " => " tuned " irb ( main ) : 00 8 : 0 > first .
sum + second .
sum == query .
sum => true
When this very quick check returns true , we have to do the string comparison to be absolutely sure it is a match .
This considerably speeds up the whole program , but it is still O( n ^ 2 ) .
Idea # 3 : Reformulate Problem
Now here comes the trickiest and coolest part .
Since Idea # 2 the slowest part is matching the numbers , with still quadratic complexity .
But the hard task is not anagram finding any more , we have reduced it to finding two hashes that combined have the same hash as the query .
We can reformulate this problem into something completely detached from the anagram problem :
Given a list of numbers , find all combination of two numbers that add up to a given number
When we concentrate on just this problem and ignore the rest , we might come up with a better way of doing things .
I came up with a fast solution , described below .
Somebody posted a better solution that is both faster and simpler , if you want just this final solution skip ahead to Idea # 4 as the following description is outdated .
It clearly looks stupid to just try all combinations to add the numbers .
So lets sort them first .
Quicksort is fast , especially with numbers , so no worries here .
Now consider a list of numbers like this example :
1 3 7 10 10 12 17 20 22 23 24 24 25 26 30
Find all the combinations of two number that add up to 27 .
They are
1 + 26 = 27
3 + 24 = 27
7 + 20 = 27
10 + 17 = 27
10 + 17 = 27 ( a second time )
You can detect a pattern here : the first number always increases , the second number always decreases !
We can now formulate an algorithm for this :
We can have two pointers to the array , one starting from the left side , the other starting from the right side .
When the numbers behind the pointers add up to a bigger result than the query ( e.g. 1 + 30 = 31 ) , we decrease the right pointer to find a smaller combination ( 1 + 26 = 27 ) .
When the sums are too small ( 1 + 25 = 26 ) , we move the left pointer to the right ( 3 + 25 = 28 ) .
This way we walk through the whole array in O ( n ) time and the sum of the pointers is always kept as close the the desired result as possible .
When the pointers meet each other , we can stop the whole process or otherwise we would just reverse the words .
This algorithm gets a bit more complicated when you consider that we might have lots of numbers in it that are equal , whenever this happens you have to fall back into an O ( n ^ 2 ) matching algorithm for just this section .
Idea # 4 : Use Hash directly
UPDATE Scrap the implementation in idea # 3 .
A blog post here from a reader of this article posted a way to do this really in O ( n ) , without any sorting which is O ( nlog ( n ) ) * .
The idea is to use a hashmap that maps from the hash key of the word to its matches :
M = {} S = the target sum for each element e in the list if M [ S - e ] exists ?
( e , S - e ) is a pair add e to the M
Just use a Hashmap that maps from the cummulative hash of a word to a list of words that have the same hash .
Whenever a new word is added , get the list of words that is stored under query.sum - current_word.sum .
When the hashes are the same we just have to create a list of all the matches under this key , and check each of the matches sequentially for equality .
This is just normal hash collision handling through a linked list .
That ’s very simple and works like a charm .
I have revised the code , it got both simpler and faster .
That ’s a win - win situation , wohoo !

index ( separator , prev ) while prev < txt_size letter_idx = prev # no need to check end of word because it is
# which is not part of the word anyways while used_letters [ txt [ letter_idx ] ] letter_idx += 1 end # ignore word if the above quick check fails if letter_idx == idx word = txt [ prev , idx - prev ] # check all key matches key = word .
sum hashToWords [ query_hash - key ]. each do | other_word | if ( word .
letters + other_word .
letters ) . sort == query_letters_sorted puts " # { word } #{ other_word } " puts " #{ other_word } # { word } " end end # insert word hashToWords [ key ] << word end prev = idx + 1 # no need to check end of file because # we have to end with new line idx = txt .
index ( separator , prev )
end
When you rewrite the algorithm in C++ or Java or Python I am sure it will be faster than this one .
But this is not the point of this post .

This evening Facebook announced that they have surpassed the 10 billion photo milestone .
In terms of files , that is over 40 billion files since there is 4 image sizes store for each individual photo .
Doug Beaver provided some other interesting statistics including :
There are between 2 and 3 Terabytes of photos being uploaded daily .
Over 15 billion photos are served each day
Over one petabyte ( 1,024 Terabytes ) of photos have been stored
Facebook is currently the largest online photo storage site , dominating even the highly popular photo sharing site : Flickr .
This is an impressive number and it ’s also impressive that the photos application is one of the few features on Facebook that rarely has significant issues .
I know that I personally use the photos application heavily and based on the stats released tonight , it appears that just about every other user does as well .

On Wednesday night , there were basically two messages coming from Republicans in St. Paul : 1 . CEOs and mayors make great presidents ; 2 . Increasing domestic oil drilling will immediately lower gas prices and somehow be the magical cure to both our national security interests and our economic stagnation .
>> More coverage of the Republican National Convention at RG&B
“ So , do you want to put your country first ? , ” asked former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele .
“ Then let ’s reduce our dependency on foreign sources of oil and promote oil and gas production at home .
In other words : Drill , baby , drill !
And drill now ! , ” he said .
Steele is one of the Republican Party ’s few prominent African - American politicians in a year where a very low 1.5 % of Republican Party delegates are African American .
Mitt Romney chimed in on the the major themes of the night , as well .
In a little call - and - response game he asked delegates , “ Is a Congress liberal or conservative that stops nuclear power plants and off - shore drilling , making us more and more dependent on Middle East tyrants ? —
It ’s liberal ! ”
He then went on to add a final curiously formulated jab at former Vice - President Al Gore “ one more recommendation for energy conservation — let ’s keep Al Gore ’s private jet on the ground ! ”
Former New York City major Rudy Guliani picked up on Steele ’s hook from earlier in the night .
Talking about John McCain , the former Republican candidate for president said , “ He will lead us toward an America that will be independent of foreign oil by an ‘ all - of - the - above ’ approach , including nuclear power and off - shore drilling , ” said Giuliani .
Egged - on by delegates on the floor of the Xcel Center Giuliani said , “ Drill , baby , drill , ” a little tentatively at first , which was then followed by a more robust “ Drill , baby , drill . ”

Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , held an impromptu press conference Thursday night to give a status update on the Wall Street bailout bill .
After announcing earlier in the day that a fundamental framework had been agreed upon , it appears House Republicans are trying to gum up the process with proposals Secretary Paulson testified would not work .

Senator McCain has said he had to interrupt his campaign and could n't do a debate because he had to come here to help us .
God save us from such help .
But in any case , there is no sign whatsoever that Senator McCain 's got any real role here , so he certainly ought to feel free to go back and debate .
So let 's get this straight : A general framework was agreed upon before Senator McCain decided to " suspend " his campaign , and now that he's in Washington to " help , " it appears all those agreements have fallen through .
What leadership !
This is all classic Republican political gamesmanship .
The bailout is widely unpopular and House Republicans -- being the unserious , petty people that they are -- are trying to link all the fallout to Bush and the Democrats in order to boost their electoral prospects .
We ought to call their bluff and refuse to pass a bill until a solid majority of them are on board .
The inevitable market hit will then be laid at their doorstep .
Let them take responsibility for tomorrow 's 200 point hit .
Last night brought a general query from Slog tipper John :
This morning brings a report from KING 5 :
This morning also brought two eyewitness reports sent to Last Days .
Eyewitness # 1 was a bystander :
I was standing about 20 feet from the scene and saw the entire altercation .
I honestly cannot believe what I saw .
Originally , the vehicle was trying to inch ( westward on Aloha ) into an oncoming mass of cyclists on a narrow road , where he had to pull into the oncoming traffic lane in order to get around the cars parked in his lane .
About 6 cyclists peeled off to park themselves in front of the vehicle , explaining that he needed to wait and they would all be out of his way in a minute .
The driver , however , remained agitated and expressed that they were “ in a rush ” and “ would be late ” .
When the cyclists asked what they were going to be late for , the driver responded , “ We have reservations ! ” , which left the group largely speechless until one of the cyclists again explained that he would save a lot of time and trouble if he just waited another 30 seconds for the rest of the cyclists to pass .
At that moment , the driver suddenly put his car in reverse and backed up 5 feet into the sidewalk ( now the car is parallel to Aloha  thank goodness there were no pedestrians behind him ! ) and stopped .
This strange behavior panicked everyone and no one moved except to shout “ Stop . ”
This is when his passenger started yelling for him to “ Calm down and stop ” as well .
After staying put for about 10 seconds , the driver then said “ fuck this ” and accelerated into the line of standing cyclists .
When he hit the first ones , he continued to accelerate , but steered into the larger mass of cyclists before turning the wheel and tearing off in the opposite direction ( east on Aloha ) with one of the hit cyclists still on the roof of his car .
The driver sped down Aloha with a mess of bicycles and cyclists in his wake , a cyclist on his roof , and everyone , including his pregnant passenger , yelling for him to “ Just stop ! ”
At the bottom of the hill , the driver stopped at a stop sign and the cyclists swarmed the car , slashing his tires and breaking the windows in order to make sure that he did not continue operating his vehicle through the city like a madman .
His door was opened , the driver got out of the car in tears and walked , unmolested back up to where the cyclists were splayed out in the street apologizing to everyone .
His passenger was relatively calm , also walked up the street unmolested , and explained that her friend had made a mistake and that she had been yelling for him to calm down and stop the car .
While there was a little hysterical yelling by the freightened bicyclists , there was absolutely no physical confrontation .
The reason that I am writing you is that it seems alarmingly irresponsible that such a biased story would be printed and broadcast when King 5 admits that “ It ’s was n’t clear what sparked the confrontation ” .
Not that this is surprising by any means , which is unfortunate .
I guess I just want to make sure that the real story is put out there before this damning misinterpretation gains any steam .

If it were spelled differently , the squidhammer would be a recursive acronym .
Like GNU software .
What is GNU ? nu isotnix .
The squidhammer is like that except its got nothing to do with software or Unix .
Though of ancient origin , the word was first used in English by Shakespear in Richard IV :
Happy Friday !!
To celebrate the end of the week , today 's Q10 will be part three of my sporadic Halloween series .
Since you 're mental_floss readers and lovers of all things knowledge , I 'm sure you already know that there was a real Dracula .
He probably was n't a vampire and he definitely could n't turn into a bat , but he did do some really horrible things .
We 'll discuss them , but first a little history : Vlad Tepes was the son of Vlad II Dracul .
He became known as Vlad Dracula because the suffix tacked on there makes the surname mean " son of Dracul . " 
He ruled Wallachia three times " “ 1448 , 1456 - 1462 and 1476 .
A lot of the horrible stories are hard to verify , because some of what we know about Vlad 's cruelty is based on German stories " “ which , of course , would make him out to be a terrible man .
As a counterpoint , most Romanian stories about Vlad portray him as heroic and one of the greatest leaders they 've ever had .
Anyway , the terrible tales :
1. Vlad Tepes first ruled in 1448 after his father was assassinated .
His older brother was also horribly killed " “ blinded with hot pokers and then buried alive .
Vlad Tepes was immediately put on the throne so Wallachia 's political enemies would n't think the position was free for the taking , but Vlad was ruler pretty much in name only .
After all , he was only 17 at the time .
2 . In 1459 - 1460 , he had an entire village of German settlers killed when a trade dispute erupted .
The village was burned to the ground and every single resident was impaled or executed in some horrible manner " “ women and children included .
3 . In 1462 , he raided the southern banks of the Danube .
He claimed to have killed " men and women , old and young " ¦ 23.884 Turks and Bulgarians without counting those whom we burned alive in their homes or whose heads were not chopped off by our soldiers . " 
Soldiers brought back some souvenirs of this raid for Vlad " “ sacks of heads , noses and ears .
Vlad would then send those bits and pieces out to other rulers as warnings .
4 . Let it be known that Vlad had a sense of humor " “ a dark , terrible sense of humor .
When some Turkish ambassadors refused to remove their caps in his presence , he asked why they would dishonor him like that .
They replied that it was their custom to not remove the caps in public ; only in the privacy of their homes .
So Vlad helped them out by having their hats permanently nailed to their heads ( that 's one of the German stories , I believe ) .
5 . We know Vlad liked to impale people , but he was particularly sadistic about it .
Not that impaling someone could probably not be sadistic , but you know what I mean .
Here 's how he did it " “ if you just ate lunch , maybe go ahead and skip to # 6 .
First , the victim would have a horse attached to each of his legs .
I suppose for stability , but I 'm not totally sure on that one .
Would n't tying the victim to stakes or something have worked just as well ?
Anyway , then a seim - sharpened stake would be forced into the body from below " “ usually through the anus , with the desired end effect being the other end of the stake coming through the mouth .
The stick could n't be too sharp , though , because then the victim might die quickly , and what fun would that be for Vlad ?
6 . Another method was to impale the person through the abdomen or chest and then post them around the city as a warning to others .
There is a memoir that exists that documents the " forest of the impaled "  , where Vlad would line the roads with tons of Turkish soldiers he had impaled .
If that did n't intimidate the enemy , I do n't know what would .
7 . Here 's more intimidation : sometimes Vlad would arrange the impaled people in a circle around the city that he was targeting .
The taller the spear they were impaled on , the higher - ranking that person was .
8 . According to the stories , when Vlad came to power the second time , he invited a lot of the nobles who were responsible for the cruel deaths of his brother and father to a huge , luxurious feast .
Once there , he had the older nobles impaled .
The younger nobles and their families were forced to march to the ruins of a castle in the mountains and forced them to rebuild it .
The stories say the prisoners worked until their tattered clothes fell off , and then were forced to keep working in the nude .
Once it was completed , Vlad used the Poenari Castle as one of his fortresses .
9 . His first wife supposedly killed herself when that same castle was raided by the Turkish army in 1462 .
Vlad 's own half - brother , Radu the Handsome , led the siege on the castle .
When word got back that the Turkish army was getting close , Vlad 's wife apparently threw herself out of the tower into the water below , saying that she " would rather have her body rot and be eaten by the fish of the ArgeÅŸ than be led into captivity by the Turks " .
That body of water , a tributary of the ArgeÅŸ , is called Raul Doamnei " “ the Lady 's River ( or the Princess 's River ) .
10 .
It 's generally thought that The Impaler finally met his end in a battle against the Ottoman Empire in December , 1476 .
But other stories abound , including several that have him being felled by his own men .
One of the stories also says that when he was killed , the Turks cut his head off , preserved it in honey and had it sent to Istanbul .
The sultan proudly displayed his trophy on " “ what else " “ a stake .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The Copyright Royalty Board on Thursday left unchanged the amount record companies will pay songwriters for the sale of CDs or digitally downloaded songs .
The three - judge panel said the record companies will continue to pay 9.1 cents a song , while the National Music Publishers Association had sought an increase to 15 cents a song .
Apple Inc. AAPL , - 0.75 % and other online music stores had opposed the potential price increase .
Additionally the CRB set a payment rate of 24 cents each for songs sold as ringtones for cellphones .
Slamming the enlargement of Nato , which he said had advance provocatively towards the borders of Russia , he also proposed drafting a new European Security Treaty .
While Russia has insisted it is not intending to supplant Nato , Mr Medvedev made it clear that the US - dominated alliance was partly responsible for the war in the Caucasus by its failure to rein in Georgian " aggression " .
OXFORD , Mississippi ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain ended the suspense and said he will attend the first of three debates with Democrat Barack Obama on Friday , setting up a showdown that could help decide a tight White House race .
McCain had vowed to skip the debate if negotiations were not completed on a $ 700 billion rescue of the U.S. financial industry but his campaign said in a statement that enough progress had been made to participate in the 9 p.m. EDT ( 0100 GMT ) debate .
“ The McCain campaign is resuming all activities and the senator will travel to the debate this afternoon , ” the statement said .
McCain , an Arizona senator , will head back to Washington after the debate and return to the negotiations .
Obama was on his campaign plane in Washington preparing for the flight to Mississippi when the announcement about McCain was made at midday .
The debate is scheduled to focus on foreign policy and national security , although the turmoil on Wall Street has dominated the campaign trail for nearly two weeks and is almost certain to be discussed .
Both candidates spent Thursday night in Washington and conferred with congressional leaders on Friday morning before bailout negotiations resumed .
White House talks between McCain , Obama and congressional leaders ended in disarray on Thursday with no agreement on a stalled $ 700 billion bailout plan proposed by the Bush administration .

Both candidates said progress had been made and they were optimistic an accord could be reached , but the two campaigns accused each other of injecting politics into the process .
“ Barack Obama ’s priority was political posturing , ” the McCain campaign said in its statement about the negotiations .
Obama told reporters on his campaign plane just before McCain ’s announcement that the White House meeting was not “ as productive as it could have been . ”
“ EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON ”
“ My strong sense is that the best thing I can do , rather than to inject presidential politics into some delicate negotiations , is to go down to Mississippi and explain to the American people what is going on , ” Obama said .
McCain ’s decision to participate was a relief to organizers at the National Commission on Debates and the hosts at the University of Mississippi , which spent about $ 5 million to accommodate the event , and the 3,000 journalists who descended on Oxford to cover it .
The first debate was expected to be watched by far more than the 40 million Americans who saw the convention acceptance speeches of McCain and Obama , and could be a crucial factor for undecided voters in the November 4 election .
Public opinion polls have shown Obama making gains over the past week on the question of who could best lead the country on economic issues , and most polls have him holding a slight lead over McCain .
Both camps have worked to lower expectations for their candidates in the high - stakes confrontation .
Obama aides have noted that national security and foreign policy is a strength for McCain , a 26 - year veteran of Congress and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam .
Opinion polls show voters favor McCain on security issues .
Earlier this week , McCain anticipated a tough debate by citing Obama ’s soaring rhetoric on the campaign trail and his victory in the Democratic nominating battle over Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York .
“ He ’s very , very good .
He was able to defeat Senator Hillary Clinton , who as we all know is very accomplished , ” McCain said earlier this week at an Ohio campaign stop .
“ He was able to , I think , with his eloquence inspire a great number of Americans .
So these are going to be tough debates . ”
The second presidential debate is scheduled for October 7 and a third on October 15 .
The two vice presidential candidates -- Palin and Democratic Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware -- will debate on October 2 .
As Election Day nears , John McCain continues to deploy Joe " the Plumber " Wurzelbacher as a human shield against Barack Obama and his plan for middle class tax cuts .
But while Wurzelbacher himself admitted he would fare better under Obama , another of McCain 's representative Americans is set to receive a massive windfall if the Arizona Senator is elected .
No doubt about it , Mrs. McCain - Cindy the Beer Heiress - would pocket hundreds of thousands of dollars thanks to her husband .
That the McCains are fabulously well off - as the $ 100 million beer distribution fortune , the 11 homes , 13 cars and a private jet attest - goes without saying .
And as she reported in her two - page IRS summaries , Cindy McCain earned $ 6.1 million in 2006 and another $ 4.2 million in 2007 .
( Most came courtesy of her late father 's Hensley & Company , Arizona 's leading distributor of Anheuser - Busch products including Budweiser . )
But while as many as 100 million Americans would receive no benefit from President McCain 's tax proposals , his wife would be awash in new - found cash .
As the Center for American Progress detailed in June , the McCains would reap a $ 373,000 bonanza should he win the White House :
McCain favors making the Bush tax laws permanent , and also plans to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax , double the dependent exemption and offer tax breaks on business income ... Had McCain 's tax proposal been in place in 2006 , [ they ] would have done incredibly well - saving even more than they did under the existing Bush plan .
John and Cindy McCain would have walked away with $ 373,429 in their pocket .
Of course , given that McCain 's tax plan is radically more regressive than even that of President Bush - it delivers 58 % of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 % of American taxpayers - it's no surprise Cindy the Beer Queen can expect a jaw - dropping payout .
But Cindy 's winnings do n't end there .
As both the financial crisis and his slump in the polls deepened , John McCain two weeks ago proposed slashing capital gains taxes ( a halving from from 15 % to 7.5 % ) .
Again , the gains from his scheme go overwhelmingly to the richest Americans ( almost 60 % of its benefits to families earning over $ 1 million a year ) , including his wife :
The McCains made $ 746,395 in capitals gains last year .
A new analysis by Michael Ettlinger , Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund , reveals that McCain 's capital gains cut would have reduced the McCains ' taxes by $ 55,980 in 2007 .
And those dollars pale in comparison to what Cindy McCain would bank for tax year 2008 .
That 's when Cindy McCain is set to earn a staggering multi-million dollar pay - day from the acquisition of Anheuser - Busch by the Belgian beverage giant , In Bev .
As the Wall Street Journal reported in July , Mrs. McCain runs the third largest Anheuser - Busch distributorship in the nation , and owns between $ 2.5 and $ 5 million in the company 's stock .
Amazingly , while Missouri 's politicians of both parties lined up to try to block the sale , John McCain held a fundraiser in the Show Me State even as the In Bev deal was being finalized .
Two weeks ago , Joe the Plumber acknowledged his tax bill would drop under a President Obama :
So today , Joe , who said he makes much less than $ 250,000 , reluctantly admitted Obama would lower his taxes .
" I would , if you believe him , I would be receiving his tax cuts , " Wurzelbacher said .
And so it goes .
As it turns out , John McCain does n't have Joe the Plumber 's economic interests at heart .
Cindy the Beer Heiress is another matter .
Apparently , charity really does begin at home .

“ Certain Democrats in Chicago say it ’s the best thing that ever happened to him , not winning that race — that he could n’t have been positioned to run for the U.S. Senate from that district , ” Mr. Adelstein said .
“ In that district , you get pigeonholed pretty quickly as ‘ an African - American congressman , ’ not as a more transcendent congressman . ”
Mr. Rush ’s district , the state ’s most Democratic , was 65 percent black .
And in 1999 , it included not only Hyde Park , home of the University of Chicago , but several relatively affluent Irish - American neighborhoods .
There were plenty of college - educated , white , “ latte liberals ” with whom Mr. Obama polls well .
But he was barely known outside his state Senate district , in the eastern part of Mr. Rush ’s district .
To win , he would have to expand his support among blacks , including the older , church - going , Rush loyalists who vote disproportionately in primaries .
“ Taking on Bobby Rush among black voters is like running into a buzz saw , ” said Ron Lester , a pollster who worked for Mr. Obama .
“ This guy was incredibly popular .
Not only that , his support ran deep — to the extent that a lot of people who liked Barack still would n’t support him because they were committed to Bobby .
He had built up this reserve of goodwill over 25 years in that community . ”
Mr. Rush had grown up in Chicago , enlisted in the Army , joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped found the Illinois Black Panther Party in 1968 .
He coordinated a medical clinic that pioneered mass screening for sickle cell anemia , which disproportionately affects blacks .
As an alderman in 1992 , he had ousted a black political legend — Representative Charles A. Hayes , a veteran of the civil - rights and labor movements who was caught up in a scandal that year involving the House bank .
Frustration at the Statehouse
Mr. Obama , 15 years younger than Mr. Rush , arrived in Chicago in his 20s after growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia .
He worked as a community organizer on the South Side for three years , then returned to the city after graduating from Harvard Law School .
He ran a voter registration drive , joined a law firm , taught constitutional law and been elected to the state Senate from Hyde Park in 1996 .

But he was frustrated at the Statehouse .
He had distinguished himself as an ethics reformer there , but it was difficult for Democrats to get much done in a period of virtual Republican lockdown .
“ He was looking for opportunities to run for offices , ” said Dan Shomon , who was then a Senate aide .

GURNEE , Ill . —
In the Tweety Bird section of the parking lot at an amusement park here , visitors are trying a new attraction .
They jump into Humvees or Black Hawk helicopters and use fake firearms to hunt down “ genocidal indigenous forces . ”
They shoot at huge video screens .
“ I like that I got to use a gun ! ” said 13 - year - old Spencer Padgett , after trying the “ Virtual Army Experience . ”
His dad , Scott , from Laporte , Ind. , said he wanted his son to gain an appreciation of the sacrifices being made by the Army .
The Virtual Army Experience — a traveling exhibit of the U.S. Army — has been touring the country for the past year and a half , stopping at amusement parks , air shows and county fairs .
The Army , which collects information from the thousands of people who play the game , says it ’s an innovative way to reach a new audience .
But critics do n’t like the idea of the military using giant videogames as a recruiting tool .
While the Army met its goal of adding 80,000 new soldiers last year , it faces a tough recruiting environment .
These days , “ parents are less likely to encourage their children to consider military service , ” said Douglas Smith , a spokesman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command .
The Virtual Army exhibit is based on a videogame the Army began developing in 1999 , after missing recruiting goals .
Not only do videogames give the Army a new way to relate to the public , they also present “ an opportunity to shape their tastes , ” said Col.
Casey Wardynski , director of the Army ’s Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis at West Point .
The Army spent about $ 9 million building four versions of the Virtual Army Experience , Col. Wardynski said .
It cost $ 9.8 million last year to operate the exhibits .
This year , the main exhibits will visit 40 events .
The smaller “ Delta ” version will visit 31 separate events .
It ’s catering to the interest of America ’s youth , ” said Nicholas Mantych , 21 , from Genoa City , Wis. , who recently tried the Virtual Army game .
He suggested another idea the Army could offer players : “ They should give them gear and paintball guns . ”
Recent player Miles Cahill , 23 , who works at a videogame retailer , said the Army ’s game was n’t as good as other shooter games he ’s tried , but it was still fun .
He did n’t mind the marketing aspect .

JERUSALEM – Israel has published tenders for the construction of 1,761 illegal housing units for Israeli settlers in occupied east Jerusalem alone , according to the Israeli rights group Peace Now .
The expansion plans come despite promises by the Israeli government at last year ’s peace summit at Annapolis , Maryland ( in the US ) to freeze all settlement growth .
" Once again this government has shown that its words and commitments are meaningless , and they have no intention of keeping to their word , " says Peace Now .
United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has stressed repeatedly that settlement construction or expansion in the West Bank is contrary to international law and Israel ’s commitments under the ‘ road map ’ peace process .
The road map was a series of peace - building measures proposed by US President George W. Bush in 2002 and subsequently developed by the diplomatic Quartet of the European Union , the United Nations , Russia and the United States .
Ban Ki-moon further urged Israel to freeze all settlement activity and to dismantle outposts erected since March of 2001 .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , normally a diehard supporter of Israel , also expressed her concern about the settlement building during her last visit to Israel several months ago .
" It ’s important to have an atmosphere of confidence and trust , " Rice said following talks she held with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah .
" The United States believes that the ( settlement ) actions and the announcements that are taking place are indeed having a negative effect on the atmosphere for negotiation . "
The new construction should not be allowed to shape future Israeli - Palestinian borders , which remain under negotiation , Rice said .
" The United States will not let these activities have any effect on final status negotiations , including final borders . "
The Geneva Conventions specifically forbid the transfer of a civilian population into occupied territory .
But even as Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was meeting with Abbas in Jerusalem last week in an endeavor to further the peace process , plans for further settlement construction were already under way .
At the beginning of the month , prior to Peace Now ’s statement , the Israel Lands Authority published tenders for the construction of 130 new housing units in Har Homa , East Jerusalem .
The Har Homa neighborhood and all east Jerusalem settlements were built on land Israel occupied in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
Israel subsequently incorporated the areas into Jerusalem ’s boundaries in a move not recognized internationally .
In addition to the public announcement of the tenders , there are currently 500 houses already under construction in Har Homa , and 240 in the settlement of Maaleh Adumim in East Jerusalem .
At the same time as the Har Homa tenders were being published , Israeli officials also called for bids from construction companies to build more than 300 apartments in the West Bank settlement of Beitar Illit near Bethlehem , and about 20 minutes drive from Jerusalem .
This came on top of Olmert ’s approval at the beginning of the year to build 750 new houses in the Givat Zeev settlement northwest of Jerusalem , and 100 in the Ariel settlement in the northern West Bank .
There are approximately 430,000 Israeli settlers residing illegally in the West Bank .
According to Israeli advocacy group B’Tselem , Israel has established 135 settlements in the West Bank ( including East Jerusalem ) that have been recognized by the Interior Ministry .
Additionally , dozens of outposts of varying size have been established .
Sixteen settlements were established in the Gaza Strip and subsequently dismantled in 2005 during the implementation of the ‘ disengagement plan ’ .
Land expropriation from Palestinian farmers for the building and enlargement of Israeli settlements has caused undue hardship and economic suffering for Palestinians , and some have initiated acts of civil disobedience in a bid to retain the pieces of agricultural land that have not been confiscated .
The villagers of Bil’in and Ni’ilin near Ramallah in the central West Bank , together with international activists and Israeli sympathizers , have staged weekly protests that have resulted in a number of deaths , arrests and injuries .
The most infamous incident was the blindfolding , handcuffing and shooting of Ni’ilin resident Ashraf Abu Rahma .
The villagers of Ni’ilin have been protesting land expropriation which has seen the size of their village reduced from 5,700 hectares of land in 1948 to 3,300 hectares in 1967 , to the present approximate of 1,000 hectares .
Ni’ilin olives farmer Bahjat Mesleh told IPS he had lost about 75 dunams ( 10 dunams is one hectare ) of land to make way for the building of the separation barrier which divides Israel from the West Bank .
" This has cost me about 25,000 dollars , and I am more fortunate than other farmers as I ’ve been able to continue supporting my family by working as a teacher .
Not all farmers have been able to continue a livelihood , " said Mesleh .
According to B’Tselem , " Israel has stolen thousands of dunams of land from the Palestinians .
Israel forbids Palestinians to enter and use these lands , and uses the settlements to justify numerous violations of Palestinian rights , such as the right to housing , to earn a living , and freedom of movement .
" The settlers , on the other hand , benefit from all rights given to citizens of Israel who live inside the Green Line , and in some instances , even additional rights . "
The principal tool used to take control of land is to declare it state land .
This process began in 1979 , and is based on a manipulative implementation of the Ottoman Lands Law of 1858 , which applied in the area at the time of occupation .
Other methods employed by Israel to take control of land include seizure for military needs , declaration of land as " abandoned assets " , and the expropriation of land for public needs .
CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) -
In America , where teenage pregnancy is a political issue and working moms subject to moral debate , the choice of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice - presidential pick has ignited a Mommy War .

Questions about Palin ’s qualifications were raised almost as soon as presidential candidate John McCain shocked the political world by picking the relatively unknown Alaska governor to be his running mate last week .
The emergence of personal details has fueled the debate .
News that Palin , a conservative Christian , is running for the country ’s No. 2 office while parenting both an infant son with Down Syndrome and a 17 - year - old pregnant daughter has sparked both condemnation and commendation .
Should a 44 - year - old mother of five , including a newborn with special needs and a pregnant teenager , take on a job that will keep her away from her home for much of the next two months to eight years ?
Nearly two - thirds of American mothers with preschool - aged children were in the labor force in 2003 , according to the latest government figures .
Women rich and poor , famous or not , grapple with the same issues and public perceptions .
The Republican Party ’s conservative base , having worked to co-opt moral issues for their political cause , so far has rallied around Palin and her daughter despite its promotion of abstinence education and traditional families .
The daughter will have the child and marry the father .
“ I ca n’t get past the part of the scripture that says it is the responsibility of the parents to raise the child .
But I do believe that some parents can raise their children well and not stay home all the time , ” said Lindsay Matlock , an anti-abortion volunteer at this week ’s Republican convention in Minnesota .
“ My only reservation would be that her son has Down Syndrome and ... her being away so much , ” said Matlock , 21 .
Dr. Bill Maier , vice president and psychologist in residence for the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family , came to the candidate ’s defense , saying : “ Gov. Palin seems to have been able to maintain a balance between work and family . ”

SEXISM ?
The very fact that Americans are debating whether a woman with a new baby should be in a demanding job galls Carol Evans , president and chief executive of Working Mother Media , which publishes Working Mother magazine .
“ The fact that the United States is the only developed country without paid maternity leave should be front and center , not whether ( Palin ) can go back to work with a four - month old , ” said Evans , noting that the average American working mother returns to work 11 weeks after giving birth .
A question that emerges for Americans of all political stripes is : Would any of this be asked if Palin was a man ?
“ If we say a woman ca n’t have a career when her children are babies , we are discriminating based on gender , ” said Democrat Barbara Matousek , a 41 - year - old Wisconsin engineer and working mother of an 8 - month - old .
She was concerned , however , about Palin ’s other child .
“ The thing I have trouble reconciling is how any parent , male or female , could agree to take on this very public position at a time when their child is so fragile , ” she said .
“ Being a pregnant , unmarried , 17 - year - old high school student would be hard enough without the entire world watching . ”
Some voters saw authenticity in Palin ’s life .
They said the fact that Palin had a pregnant teenaged daughter showed the family was normal .
“ This is happening all over the United States .
I think people will identify with her .
People want to vote for people who are like them , ” said Pat Lynch , 42 , a Republican and a commodities trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
The teenage birth rate in the United States is among the highest in the developed world .
Sex education and the availability of contraception varies state to state .
Kansas Republican Jacqueline McMahon said Palin ’s children -- newborn or pregnant -- should not be an issue .
“ If she is qualified to do the job ... ( the rest ) is totally none of our business , ” said McMahon , a 39 - year - old mother of two and business owner .
She added : “ Barack Obama ’s mother ... had him when she was 18 .
I think it is a nonissue . ”
The birth of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama to a teenaged mother has received little attention , although Obama himself has raised it .
Debate about his ability to balance work and parenthood of his two young daughters , aged 7 and 10 , has barely been raised .

I ’ve often referred to Smalltalk as the ‘ Latin ’ of modern OO languages .
Most owe a tremendous debt to Smalltalk but the language itself has been relegated to a small niche of technology elites for several years now .
Here a simply equation .
In terms of mental fortitude …
1 Smalltalk developer = 2.5 C++ developers 1 C++ Developer = 1.5 Java developers
in other words …
Smalltalk is a meal with a fine Bordeaux and a petite filet mignon Java is a meal with a cold beer and t- bone
So Yeah ..
I said it .
Smalltalk is making a comeback .
( pausing to wait for reader to regain consciousness )
There are few reasons for this but a couple come immediately to mind …
Smalltalk was ahead of its time — not only in developer skills and techniques but also in hardware support .
Many early Smalltalk systems simply did n’t scale well .
Today Moore ’s law has fixed the hardware issue and developers have ( in general ) finally gotten their heads around OO concepts .
Smalltalk tools and platforms had a heavy lock - in factor .
Lock - in related to tools and technology supporting the Smalltalk language pushed many towards things like C++ and eventually Java .
Today open source Smalltalk projects have significantly reduced the perspective and reality of Smalltalk vendor lock - in .
It ’s been said that a “ rising tide lifts all ships ” .
I can see this clearly in the relationship between Smalltalk and hot topic languages such as Ruby and Python ( to some degree PHP here as well ) .
The significant growth that we see among these languages is also causing a few to take a second look at Smalltalk as well .
Its somewhat funny to consider that a new generation of developers ( post C++ ) consider the features in Ruby to be bleeding edge when in fact they are mostly retro features of things that Smalltalk has done for decades .
The challenge of course is that languages like Python and Ruby have the heat needed to create a strong momentum .
Smalltalk enjoys the benefit of association but not enough to transfer that heat in large volume — at least not yet .
So I ’m not suggesting that we are going to see a massive renaissance in Smalltalk use in the near future .
Today I still have a hard time recommending most mainstream IT organizations invest heavily in new strategic initiatives with Smalltalk .
However I *am * seeing an up tick in the role that Smalltalk is having among certain communities of developers .
There is a chicken and egg problem here no doubt .
But as an analyst I have to balance the “ what is happening ” with the what “ should happen ” .
Yes its a fine line .
Put it this way .
I see * enough * momentum in the small spark of the developer universe that is the Smalltalk niche to suggest that we might see some smoke and maybe even a small flame in the near future .
Bottom line :
1 ) If you have investments in Smalltalk consider the risk of the language to be lower over the next 3 years than the last 3 years .
Smalltalk is cool again .
Is it the start of a long term trend or a fad ?
Yet to been seen .
2 ) If you are BIG fan of dynamics languages ( closures , meta programming , and all that cool stuff ) then consider giving Smalltalk a look .
You might like what you see .
Its like Ruby but with bigger muscles .
You think Rails is cool ?
Check out seaside .
In the end we ’ll see a up tick in Smalltalk momentum over the next few years .
I ’m not entirely sure it will be enough to change the long term trend of a declining developer base but I does my heart good to see a “ members only ” jacket come back into style nonetheless .

As portion sizes have increased , Americans ' waistlines have expanded .
And as a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research demonstrates , consumers are tricked into drinking more soft drinks when retailers eliminate small drink sizes .
No matter what the volume of the soft drink , customers tend to avoid the largest and smallest options , according to authors Kathryn M. Sharpe , Richard Staelin , and Joel Huber ( all Duke University ) .
" Our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available , " the authors explain .
Fast - food restaurants , in an attempt to boost profit margins , have eliminated smaller drink sizes and added even larger sizes .
The authors believe these policies have led to a 15 percent increase in the consumption of these high - calorie drinks .
" Consumers who purchased a 16 - ounce drink when a 12 - ounce drink was available later chose a 21 - ounce drink when the 12 - ounce drink option was removed , since now the 16 - ounce soda is the smallest option , " they write .
" This effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum ; people who purchased a 21 - ounce drink when the 32 - ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 - ounce drink when a 44 - ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available . "
By adding the 44 - ounce option , the restaurant is able to shift the demand curve upward , even though the authors believe customers still want 12 - ounce drinks .
The researchers go on to simulate policy directions for slimming America 's waistlines .
Their models show that for flat taxation of soft drinks to reduce consumption by 10 percent , it would need to be 28 cents per drink and would reduce corporate profits by at least 7 percent .
But by simply reversing the trend they started in the first place , retailers could do their part to improve public health .
If they eliminated the largest drink size and brought back the smallest , retailers could help curb soft drink consumption with only a slight reduction in profit ( less than 2 percent ) .

An interesting tidbit is buried in the latest report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , released today : Since 2003 , the U.S. has spent at least $ 6 billion for the services of over 300 private security firms .
The audit , performed at the behest of Congress , identified 77 companies that had secured a total of $ 5.3 billion in direct contracts and subcontracts to provide security for the Iraq reconstruction effort .
The government doled out an additional $ 662 million in miscellaneous security services .
What 's more , those numbers are probably understated .
" There was no financial information on obligations for 191 companies identified in various databases as having contracts for security services , " the report says .
That 's a lot of guards and guns .
But here 's the kicker : Demand for private security will go up , not down , as U.S. forces draw down in Iraq .
Notes the SIGIR :
[ T ] o the extent U.S. forces are withdrawn , and assuming that significant civilian technical assistance missions remain , requirements for private security services for DoS [ Department of State ] and USAID would likely increase to compensate for support previously provided by the military .
PSC [ private security contractor ] requirements could also increase because the recent reduction in violence enables more frequent personnel movements within Iraq but with private security contractor support still being needed for all trips outside of U.S. - secured areas .

It ’s been said that in theory , there ’s no difference between theory and practice , but in practice , there is .
So I always like to personally test out different ways of working rather than assume that something will or wo n’t work , especially if I think it wo n’t .
One of my last experiments was switching from the Palm Desktop to a paper planner , and I wrote about my positive experience with doing so in Switching to Paper - Based Task Management .
As you can tell from the title of the post you ’re reading now , something ’s changed .
What happened ?
Three months later
At the end of the previous post mentioned above , I added a qualifier :
There ’s always a placebo effect that accompanies any change of gear , so once the novelty wears off , I ’ll be in a better position to reflect on just how substantial the progress has actually been .
And that ’s exactly been the case .
I was working through my lists faster for a while largely because the medium was new to me .
The fact is that the essence of my system has always been most effective when I collect on paper , and process what I collect into a digital organizer .
I assumed that if I could capture incoming information on paper faster than I could on a laptop or PDA , then the same speed increase would apply to processing , organizing and review phases of task management .
Over time , I noticed that I was increasingly irritated with having to leaf through the pages of my Filofax to find items or make new entries .
Hunting for the right page added just enough sand in the gears to bring things to a halt .
It would only take a few seconds , but it was long enough to unconsciously resist the impulse to review and enter information .
I was less inclined to pull out the planner to write down small tasks .
For users of traditional time management systems , that ’s not much of a problem .
Small tasks are probably not worth writing down in the first place — that ’s good priority management , right ?
But in GTD , anything consuming attention that goes untracked is an open loop , regardless of whether it ’s big or small ; it ’s still an incomplete thought .
That might seem academic , but for anyone who ’s experienced having nothing on his or her mind , despite having a heavy workload , any system that makes it inconvenient to track everything is unacceptable .
I want to spend most of my time doing things , not thinking about them .
Rewriting lists
Whether this is a bug or a feature depends on your temperament , but I really got tired of having to rewrite my lists from scratch , instead of making local edits , during weekly reviews .
Proponents of paper systems maintain that having to write new lists forces them to look at their lists more carefully , enabling them to see items that have been sitting around too long .
Writing down the same task three weeks in a row gives them pause , prompting them to either redefine the task , get rid of it or move it to the Someday / Maybe list .
On a digital system , it ’s easier to gloss over undone items , since they stay on your list until you deliberately delete them .
Oddly enough , I found it easier to ignore undone items when I was using paper lists .
Rewriting lists from scratch was just irritating enough to make me want to get the exercise over with a soon a possible , mechanically copying the items from the previous list that were n’t crossed out , and in my haste I would gloss over some that really needed further examination .
Copy and paste
Like the iPhone , the Filofax is crippled by the inability to copy and paste information into a notes field .
Most of the information I ’m exposed to comes to me over the computer , and being able to copy and paste relevant sections of content as action support was an enormous advantage I realized I was n’t willing to give up .
I liked being able to paste addresses into entries on my Errands like , or urls into certain entries on my @Computer list ( it was actually more convenient than using bookmarks ) .
A hard edge between collecting and organizing
I do n’t equate technology with complexity .
Sometimes it ’s simpler to commute to certain places with a car instead of a bicycle .
One of the ways using a digital organizer simplified things for me was in distinguishing between the collection and organizing processes .
I knew that if anything I wrote down was still on paper , it needed to be processed .
If I had nothing on paper , there was nothing further to process .
When I did everything on paper , it always seemed like whatever I collected passed through a fuzzier continuum .
I ’m perfectly aware that all you really have to do is get specific about defining projects , next actions , etc. , then cross out what you ’ll collected ; but while that make intellectual sense to me , it did n’t make experiential sense .
Even after processing an item , it still felt like “ stuff . ”
What about digital distraction ?
I ’ve been using a smartphone and notetaker wallet ever since I adopted GTD .
The notetaker wallet just replaced my standard wallet without significantly taking additional space , and since I would carry a cell phone anyway , adding PDA functionality to it saved me from having to bring another device .
The biggest drawback to smartphones , for me at least , was having too many options available : games , document editors , outliners , and other tools and toys .
As soon as I pulled out my phone to look up or enter something in my calendar , I ’d start thinking about what else I could be doing on the phone .
Since going back , those potential distractions really have n’t been a problem , even though I have n’t specifically done anything to prevent those distractions .
I ’m not entirely sure why that ’s the case , since I did have those distractions before .
I think I ’m undergoing a shift in my attitude toward distractions , especially since I ’ve eliminated so much of the emotional backlog I was keeping ( see Disembedding Your Identity from Your Stuff ) .
The more focused I ’ve become on what I want , the less need I feel to block out what I do n’t want .
Knowing more precisely where I ’m headed obviates the need to wear blinders to prevent me from going off course .
A few months ago , I was doing most of my freelance writing on an Alphasmart Neo — a decidated word processor with no internet access , no media player , and none of the distractions you expect in a laptop .
Now I do virtually all my writing directly on the laptop or a junior legal pad ( when I ’m out , a junior legal pad is more portable than the Neo ) .
Distractions happen from time to time , but I ’m self - assured enough now to know that I ’ll get back on track .
Stick with your system
I ’m not advocating that anyone abandon a functional paper system .
If you ’re not having these problems , do n’t adopt them just because they ’re rhetorically persuasive .
As always , do what works for you .
But if you find yourself reading this thinking , “ I thought it was just me ! ” , then you ’re the one I ’m writing this for .
I ’d actually prefer using a paper planner for a number of reasons that I outlined in the original post , but at the end of the day , the costs outweighed the benefits — for me .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
In the end , the weight of the housing collapse was too much for the weaker players in an over - leveraged U.S. financial sector to bear .
Sunday evening brought ominous tidings .
Lehman Brothers is likely to be liquidated after officials at the Federal Reserve and Treasury failed to line up a buyer .
But what 's likely to be more distressing for investors around the globe are the reports that Lehman is far from the only U.S. financial titan that stands in need of help .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) - an early favorite in the bidding for Lehman , before the Charlotte - based bank pulled out of that competition - is poised to purchase Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 3 U.S. brokerage firm .
And struggling insurer AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) is reportedly preparing to announce on Monday a deep restructuring that will result in the sale or spinoff of lucrative businesses such as International Lease Finance , the aircraft - leasing firm AIG bought a decade ago under the rein of former chief Hank Greenberg .
The sale of Merrill and demise of Lehman would reduce the number of independent firms on Wall Street to two - Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) - from five at the beginning of the year .
Bear Stearns collapsed in March and was sold at a token price to JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) .
The news that Lehman is near dissolution , and that Merrill and AIG are on the verge of big changes as well , sent the futures markets tumbling .
Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 300 points Sunday evening .
Even as shares in the U.S. banking sector tumbled last week , the broader market has remained fairly resilient .
The S&P 500 rose modestly last week , in spite of the plunges in AIG , Merrill and Lehman and the nationalization of two onetime index constituents , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
That resiliency seems likely to fade .
The common threads among Lehman , Merrill and AIG - and at dozens of other financial firms across the nation - start with their dealing in securities tied to the U.S. mortgage market , and their rapid expansion in recent years via the use of leverage .
All three firms have taken billions of dollars of mortgage - related writedowns : Lehman recently announced a nearly $ 4 billion third - quarter loss , while Merrill has taken tens of billions of dollars in losses on collateralized debt obligations , the risky debt Wall Street was peddling during the height of the housing boom .
Over the past three quarters , AIG has recognized some $ 25 billion in writedowns tied to the firm 's promises to guarantee the mortgage - backed debt issued by others .
But if the firms made bad bets on mortgage - related securities - and all three made lots of them - something else that 's striking is the degree to which the companies simply expanded their balance sheets in a bid to grab lush profits without taking precautions to make sure they could shoulder any losses that arose .
This diet will hurt
In a sense , the firms got fat during the housing bubble that sprung up in the early part of this decade , by trading debt tied to the massive expansion of consumer indebtedness in America , and they - and pretty much everyone else in this country - are now paying the price for it .
" The problem that has overcome the economy has its most recent roots in the creation of nearly $ 7 trillion of new residential real estate and consumer debt during the first 6 years of this decade , " Daniel Alpert , managing director at investment bank Westwood Capital in New York , wrote in March .
" Simply put , this level of debt creation was unprecedented - more than doubling the amount of homeowner and consumer ( credit card and auto loan debt , for the most part ) debt that existing at the end of 1999 . "
The brokers enjoyed the fruits of the debt explosion during the housing boom , posting record profits and strong growth as investors around the globe snapped up mortgage - backed securities that promised Treasury - like safety and better yields .
But the debt Wall Street was selling turned out to be less than safe - hundreds of bond issues have been downgraded as U.S. house prices began tumbling after a years - long runup - and it soon became apparent the firms had , like the investors in their mortgage - backed bonds , failed to take adequate precautions .
The expansion of leverage at all the Wall Street firms has been startling .
At the end of 2003 , Lehman had $ 13 billion in shareholder equity - a measure of net worth - and $ 312 billion in assets , which meant the firm had about $ 24 in assets for every dollar of equity on its balance sheet .
By the end of last year , Lehman 's shareholder equity had risen to $ 22.5 billion , a 73 % increase .
But assets soared to $ 691 billion , a 121 % increase - giving it nearly $ 31 for every dollar of equity .
Lehman 's rising leverage has been much discussed as the firm 's shares plunged into the teens and then into the single digits this year .
But the same story has played out at Merrill , where assets doubled to $ 1.02 trillion in 2007 from $ 480 billion in 2003 , even as shareholder equity only crept higher , to $ 32 billion from $ 29 billion .
And while Goldman Sachs especially , and Morgan Stanley to a lesser degree , have stood out as better - managed during the turmoil of the last year , it 's not clear those firms will be able to avoid investors ' wrath .
Assets on Goldman 's balance sheet nearly tripled over the past five years , hitting $ 1.12 trillion in assets at the end of 2007 against $ 403 billion in 2003 , while shareholder equity merely doubled , to $ 42.8 billion from $ 21.6 billion .
While the turmoil in U.S. financial markets could turn frightening this week the good news - such as it is - is that no one can say the U.S. is repeating the Japan experience , in which recovery from a painful bust in the property and stock markets was deferred as the banking system failed to quickly write down bad loans and consolidate .
" Let 's not make Japan 's mistakes :
No zombie banks , please , " Westwood Capital banker Len Blum wrote in July .
" When assets are overvalued , write 'em down . "
Now if only recovery were that simple .
Mostly technical and political -- stuff to bore everyone .
Given recent media coverage , it 's easy to believe that P2P and streaming video traffic is a rising hurricane battering upon ISP levees , that ISPs are frantically sandbagging their systems against disaster , that throttling , bandwidth caps , and traffic management are urgent and absolute necessities to keep the storm surge at bay .
But new research from Telegeography only confirms what we 've been saying for some time : the Internet backbone is n't drowning beneath any kind of exaflood .
In fact , backbone capacity has grown faster than Internet traffic in the last year — for the second year in a row .
Telegeography monitors utilization levels on major backbone lines , not on last - mile connections , and it does so around the world .
While some major links are seeing traffic increase faster than capacity ( the US / Latin American links are the prime suspects ) , most links actually saw decreasing utilization this last year .
Even as international Internet traffic surged by just over 50 percent from mid-2007 to mid-2008 , worldwide backbone capacity grew even faster .
Despite the bandwidth horror stories , average link utilization on major backbone lines fell from 31 percent to 29 percent .
Even peak utilization , often trotted out as a key reason for doing traffic management , fell from 44 percent to 43 percent .
Data source : Telegeography
So why all the talk of a bandwidth crisis ?
With backbone capacity outstripping capacity , it 's clear that router technology is n't in any immediate danger of being overwhelmed by traffic .
The problem is n't technical , it 's an investment / profitability issue , especially in the last mile .
ISPs often complain that they can't simply build out capacity to solve congestion problems , in part because protocols like BitTorrent consume every bit of bandwidth that 's available ( an odd argument , if you think about it , because a protocol can only consume the maximum bandwidth purchased by the customer , it can't magically expand to absorb all space on a network ) .
Arguments then usually devolve into consumer accusations of " overselling " and eye - rolling from ISPs , who explain " statistical multiplexing " and trot out the dreaded road analogies .
But one point is clear :
Tier 1 backbone operators , which handle the largest traffic flows in the world , have no trouble with capacity even when peak utilization is taken into account .
The backbone business tends to be cyclical , due to the cost of major network upgrades ; while for some years traffic had growing faster than capacity , backbone providers have now responded with significant capacity increases for two years in a row .
That 's good news for the ISPs who use peering and transit arrangements to send their traffic around the world , since wide - open pipes from multiple providers mean lower transit prices .
It 's also good news for Internet users , who do n't ( yet , at least ) need to worry about some coming age of bandwidth scarcity that will stop the shift toward web video .

The Republic of Marshall Islands is an island nation in the Pacific Ocean situated close to the equatorial line .
It is part of a group of islands in the Pacific known as Micronesia .
There are over 24 coral atolls in the Marshall Islands and most of these are inhabited .
The population count in the Marshall Islands is over 68,000 .
In this travel guide , you will learn basic information and resources you could use before your travel to the Marshall Islands .
The hot and humid climate in the Marshall Islands is typical for a Pacific Island nation .
The wet season starts in May and ends in November .
It is also frequently visited by typhoons .
When it comes to the economy , the Marshall Islands have very few natural resources .
In fact , its import activity far exceeds its export capacity .
However , their tie with the United States is what helps the economy stay afloat due to government assistance from the US .
Currency : The official currency in United States Dollar .
Official Language :
The majority of the inhabitants in the Marshall Islands is of Marshallese descent , therefore many of them speak this language and consider it as their official language .
However , there are also several immigrants from other parts of the world and they largely speak English .
Airport/s : The Marshall Islands International Airport , also known as Amata Kabua International Airport , is the main airport for international flights that travel to the Marshall Islands .
Wi­Fi Availability : The Wi­Fi connection in the Marshall Islands is slow and expensive .
Visa Required : Citizens of the US , Palau or Micronesia can travel to the Marshall Islands without a visa .
However , citizens of some countries require a visa upon arrival .
This includes EU countries , Australia , Canada , Japan , New Zealand , Philippines , Switzerland , Solomon Islands , Samoa , Vanuatu and much more .
You can see the entire list here .
Driving :
You will be driving on the right - hand side of the road in the Marshall Islands .
International Driver ’s License Accepted ?
You must apply for a Marshall Islands driver ’s license in order to legally drive in this country .
There are no tests required and you must settle a fee of $ 20 .
However , you must present your driver ’s license issued by your home country when applying .
Crime :
The crime rate in the Marshall Islands is low .
However , the crime rate is also seeing steady growth with the rise in the population count .
Confrontational or violent crimes are rare , though .
Most crimes involve break­ins and property theft .
Electrical Adapters :
The electrical outlets in the Marshall Islands require 120 volts and an electrical frequency of 60 Hertz .
If your devices are not compatible with this electrical outlet type , bring an adapter during your travel .
Marshall Islands Trivia : DID YOU KNOW that the history of Marshall Islands dates back and millennium BC ?
Its first inhabitants were believed to be seafarers or sea to the travelers ?
Marshall Islands Cuisine
The food in the Marshall Islands is typical of other Pacific nations .
The access to a bounty of seafood has prompted its citizens to take advantage of them when preparing traditional and local dishes .
However , there is also a challenge when it comes to growing fresh food on the islands and this has resulted in the Marshallese to depend on preserved food as part of their daily diet ( think corned beef or spam ) .
A typical meal in the Marshall Islands would look like this : boiled potatoes , pumpkin served with coconut milk , breadfruit and a variety of seafood .
With a large feast or celebration , though , a roasted pig is never missing .
This is cooked in an underground oven , which is another typical feature of food and culture in the Pacific island nations .
Staple foods in the Marshall Islands include the following : rice , coconut ( both milk and flesh are utilized in local dishes ) , breadfruit or ulu , yams , and taro .
Travel to the Marshall Islands
There are several must ­see attractions or points of interest when you travel to the Marshall Islands .
I ’ve listed some of them below :
FACT CHECK
In the run-up to the election , this is the first in a short series of brief fact - checking exercises regarding the major energy issues in the campaign .
Senators McCain and Obama have expressed support for increased offshore oil drilling as part of their respective plans for energy .
Senator McCain specifically suggests that opening offshore waters in the U.S. to oil exploration will ( a ) significantly increase domestic production , and ( 2 ) put downward pressure on oil prices .
Is this true ?
The short answer is no .
The federal government controls access to the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) , which refers to the submerged lands under the ocean farther than about 3.3 miles from the coast ( about 10 miles from Texas and the Gulf coast of Florida ) .
Land closer than that is under state jurisdiction ; land beyond about 230 miles is in international water .
Beginning in 1982 , Congress passed and has subsequently renewed moratoria on the leasing of federal land off the coast of all states except Texas , Louisiana and parts of Alaska .
All existing moratoria on leasing in the OCS will expire in 2012 .
Debate now centers on whether or not to renew the moratoria .
The Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) of the U.S. Department of Interior estimates that there are about 86 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil in the federal Outer Continental Shelf ; the Lower 48 OCS accounts for about 59 billion barrels .
By way of comparison , U.S proved reserves of oil are about 21 billion barrels .
The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) of the U.S. Department of Energy used the MMS data to assess what impact a lifting of the ban in 2012 for the Lower 48 OCS would have on U.S. oil production .
Basically , the EIA estimated what fraction of the technically recoverable oil would be economical to recover , and how fast it could be produced after 2012 .
Leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 , and production would not be expected to start before 2017 .
The EIA found that access to the Pacific , Atlantic , and eastern Gulf of Mexico regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil production or prices before 2030 .
Total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 is projected to be 1.6 percent higher than in EIA 's " no access " reference case .
The effect of that quantity of oil on the price of oil would be indiscernible .
Oil prices are determined on the international market , and the addition of about 0.16 million barrels per day from the OCS in 2030 to total world oil production would have no significant impact on oil market fundamentals .
The world consumed about 86 million barrels per day in 2007 , and will consume about 112 million barrels per day in 2030 , according to EIA forecasts .
Adding the Alaska OCS to the mix would not appreciably alter this conclusion , as that oil would be even more costly and in terms of dollars and time compared to Lower 48 OCS resources .
Thus , lifting the ban on offshore drilling will not significantly increase domestic production , nor will it put downward pressure on oil prices .
There may be other arguments for offshore drilling , such as domestic job creation and tax revenue , improved balance of payments , among others .
But those are subjects for another analysis… .

Bobby May is part of the John McCain - Sarah Paliin Virginia Leadership Team , and Treasurer of the Buchanan County ( VA ) Republican Party :
Abraham Lincoln , William Seward , Thaddeus Stevens , and Ulysses Simpson Grant are rolling over in their graves as I write .
John McCain : Despicable , dishonest , dishonorable .
But the reality for Mr. Biden is that while running mates are second - fiddlers by definition , the phenomenon of Ms. Palin has rendered him something of a fourth or fifth fiddle .
It is not like last month , when reporters swarmed Mr. Biden ’s Delaware home and delegates swooned at the Democratic convention .
He is now trailed by just a few national reporters , and struggling to break through in a race marked by historic firsts , political celebrities and charismatic newcomers  none named Joe Biden .
The Obama campaign was hoping to reintroduce Mr. Biden this week as running mate attack dog .
But his penchant for verbal rambling ensured that much of the attention he drew was unwanted : he said wealthy Americans had a “ patriotic ” duty to pay more taxes , a remark the McCain campaign mocked relentlessly .
Yet Joltin ’ Joe has also become a fascinating Off Broadway spectacle in his own right .
He is a distinctive blend of pit bull and odd duck whose weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything  “ gaffes , ” out - of - nowhere comments ( pivoting midspeech to say “ Excuse my back ! ” to people seated behind him ) , goofy asides ( tapping a reporter ’s chest and telling him , “ You need to work on your pecs . ” )
Mr. Biden ’s role is red - meat serious : to pulverize Mr. McCain , lend foreign policy heft to Senator Barack Obama and be his campaign ’s main ambassador to two at - risk constituencies : former supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and blue - collar Democrats .
He speaks to working - class voters in the harsh language of their economic trials , and summons easy rage at ear - splitting volumes .
“ John said that the economy can have a ‘ psychological effect , ’ ” Mr. Biden said at a twilight rally in Media , Pa. , on Tuesday .
“ Let me tell you about the psychological effect , ” he said , describing his family ’s economic struggles when he was young .
Mr. Biden might seem like an afterthought on the national airwaves , but he can clearly resonate close up .
John McCain , seen here leaving Russell Senate Office Building on Thursday , may have made a smart decision suspending his campaign .

McCain gambles with his political future
I have watched John McCain shoot craps for hours .
He shakes the dice in his left hand , blows gently into his fist and then , with a somewhat awkward loft — both his arms were broken when he ejected from his A - 4 Skyhawk over Hanoi in 1967 — he sends the cubes tumbling down the table .
Craps is his favorite casino game , and he understands that it is high risk , but he believes you can win if you place your bets correctly .
“ All you need , ” he says , “ is a little luck . ”

John McCain is now shooting craps with his presidential campaign .
It is high risk .
But all he needs is a little luck to pull off his current gamble .
McCain has suspended his campaign to work on a solution for the nation ’s financial meltdown , and he has threatened to pull out of the first presidential debate scheduled for Friday unless Congress takes action by then .
McCain has been attacked from all sides for doing this , but it is n’t as dumb or as desperate as it looks .
McCain ’s campaign has not exactly been a well - oiled machine lately , and a suspension might help .
McCain essentially suspended the first day of the Republican National Convention because of Hurricane Gustav , and while some thought that was a dumb overreaction , it actually gave him a perfect excuse to cancel appearances by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
Besides , McCain has never been known for excessive caution .
At the beginning of his 2000 presidential run , he would talk about his early days as a Navy jet jockey , when he and his buddies would just take off without bothering with all the safety procedures .
McCain said his motto in those days was : “ Kick the tires and light the fires .
To hell with the checklist .
Anybody can be slow . ”
Thursday , McCain invoked his military days again , though in a different fashion .
“ I ’m an old Navy pilot , and I know when a crisis calls for all hands on deck , ” he said .
“ That ’s the situation in Washington at this very hour , when the whole future of the American economy is in danger .
I cannot carry on a campaign as though this dangerous situation had not occurred , or as though a solution were at hand . ”
Here is the upside in McCain ’s gamble : Congress reaches a solution before Friday night , McCain takes credit for jawboning the lawmakers into doing it , and then he flies down to the debate looking like a man of action willing to make bold moves .
Here is the downside : Congress fails to act in time , McCain gets to blame Congress for letting the people down , he misses the debate , and Obama gets to stand on a stage without him .
Is any of that so terrible ?
Yes , McCain would be blamed for being impetuous , and he does do impetuous things .
( Wanting to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Chris Cox and possibly replace him with Andrew Cuomo ranks right up there . )
But McCain as an action figure is not a bad image .
At least he is doing something , while our president does n’t seem to be doing much of anything .
Yes , Bush was roused from his slumbers long enough to address the nation from the East Room of the White House Wednesday night .
But as a confidence - building gesture , it was n’t much .
“ Our entire economy is in danger , ” Bush said .
“ The market is not functioning properly .
There ’s been a widespread loss of confidence .
And major sectors of America ’s financial system are at risk of shutting down . ”
It was like a fireside chat with somebody dumping a bucket of cold water on the fire .
The president did n’t have to be a Pollyanna , but he could have left us with something to linger in our memories and give us strength .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said : “ Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself . … ”
Bill Clinton once said : “ There is nothing wrong with America that can not be cured by what is right with America . ”
George Bush said Wednesday : “ In the long run , Americans have good reason to be confident in our economic strength . ”
But , as the famous economist John Maynard Keynes once said : “ In the long run , we ’re all dead . ”
So any risk McCain takes may be worth it .
Hi Everyone , This is the first in what I hope will be a continuing series of blogs describing monthly changes in the GNU Toolchain ( gcc , binutils , newlib and possibly gdb as well ) .
One of my jobs at Red Hat is to take the changes in the public versions of the toolchain sources and copy them into our internal repository .
I do this on a monthly basis and I produce a short report each time detailing what has happened .
One of my friends here suggested that people outside of Red Hat might be interested in these monthly reports and so that is why I have started this blog .
So here is the report for September 2008 , suitably sanitized to remove any internal - only details :
Whilst there has been very little change in the binutils this month , there has been a lot going on in gcc-land ...
Firstly a new register allocator has been added , with the promisethat this will bring a performance boost to all of the ports .
( Register allocation is one of the hardest tasks for any compiler , and GCC has had several different allocators during its history ) .
The new allocator is also being used as a test to trim away anyunmaintained ports .
Any port that has not been switched over to thenew register allocator by the end of the month will be marked asdeprecated and removed after the next release of gcc .
The new allocator , called IRA or the Integrated Register Allocatorbrings some new command line options with , to control its behaviour :- fira - algorithm =
Use specified algorithm for the integrated register allocator .
The argument should be one of " regional " , " CB " , or " mixed " .
The first algorithm can give the best result formachines with a small number of registers , the second one isfaster and generates the smallest size code , but the thirdalgorithm usually give the best results in most cases and formost architectures .
That is why it is the default .- fira - coalesceDo optimistic register coalescing .
This option might beprofitable for architectures with big regular register sets .
Secondly a new set of loop transformation optimizations has beenadded to GCC .
Supported by yet another internal representation , called " Graphite " this time , these transformations allow for somesimple , but potentially very useful optimizations .
And the newinternal representation should make it easier to add more loopoptimizations in the future .
The new optimizations are :- floop - interchangePerform loop interchange transformations on loops .
Interchanging two nested loops switches the inner andouter loops .
For example , given a loop like : DO J = 1 , MDO I = 1 , NA( J , I ) = A ( J , I ) * CENDDOENDDOloop interchange will transform the loop as if the userhad written :
DO I = 1 , NDO J = 1 , MA( J , I ) = A ( J , I ) * CENDDOENDDOwhich can be beneficial when N is larger than the datacache(s ) .
This example uses Fortran , where the arraysare stored by columns , not rows , so the first version issub - optimal since it is accessing the data on a per-rowbasis .
The optimization itself is not restricted toFortran however , and be useful in any language . - floop - strip - minePerform loop strip mining transformations on loops .
Strip mining splits a loop into two nested loops .
The outer loop has strides equal to the strip sizeand the inner loop has strides of the original loopwithin a strip .
For example , given a loop like : DO I = 1 , NA( I ) = A( I ) + CENDDOloop strip mining will transform the loop as if theuser had written :
DO II = 1 , N , 4DO I = II , min ( II + 4 , N ) A ( I ) = A( I ) + CENDDOENDDO -floop - blockPerform loop blocking transformations on loops .
Blocking strip mines each loop in the loop nestsuch that the memory accesses of the element loopsfit inside caches .
For example , given a loop like : DO I = 1 , NDO J = 1 , MA( J , I ) = B ( I ) + C( J) ENDDOENDDOloop blocking will transform the loop as if the userhad written :
DO II = 1 , N , 64DO JJ = 1 , M , 64DO I = II , min ( II + 63 , N ) DO J = JJ , min ( JJ + 63 , M ) A( J , I ) = B ( I ) + C( J) ENDDOENDDOENDDOENDDOwhich can be beneficial when M is larger than thedata cache(s ) , because the innermost loop will iterateover a smaller amount of data .
But wait , there 's more .
More new optimizations that is .
Thefollowing are not based on the Graphite representation or the newregister allocator , but have been added separately : - fipa - cp - clonePerform function cloning to make interprocedural constantpropagation stronger .
When enabled , externally visiblefunctions that take constant arguments are cloned so thatone version exists for each known set of possible arguments .
This then allows more opportunities for constant propagation .
Since this optimization can create multiple copies offunctions , it may significantly increase code size and so itis only enabled by default at - O3. - fselective - schedulingSchedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm .
The selective instruction scheduler is an alternative toGCC 's default scheduler which may produce better results insome cases .
This option enables the selective scheduler forthe first instruction scheduling pass.-fselective-scheduling2
This option enables the selective scheduler for the secondinstruction scheduling pass .- fsel - sched - pipeliningEnable software pipelining of innermost loops duringselective scheduling .
This option has no effect until oneof - fselective - scheduling or - fselective - scheduling2 isturned on .- fsel-sched-pipelining -outer - loops
When pipelining loops during selective scheduling , alsopipeline outer loops .
This option has no effect until - fsel - sched - pipelining is turned on .- fprofile - correctionProfiles collected using an instrumented binary formulti - threaded programs may be inconsistent due to missedcounter updates .
When this option is specified , GCC willuse heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies .
By default , GCC will emit an error message when aninconsistent profile is detected .
Finally a new port has been partially added to GCC .
The " picoChip " port for the cpu created by picoChip Designs Ltd .
http://www.picochip.com exists in the GCC sources , but not yet in the binutils sources .
Soyou can compile code for it , but not assemble or link this code .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday to open the first impeachment probe of a sitting judge in almost two decades .
With little discussion , the Democratic - led panel voted unanimously to launch an investigation against U.S. District Judge Thomas Porteous , a Louisiana jurist , who is charged with presiding over a trial in which the lawyers involved had given him money .
He 's also accused of filing for bankruptcy under a false name .
Porteous was appointed by President Clinton .
The Judicial Conference of the United States reported in June that Porteous may deserve impeachment .
If the full House impeaches Porteous , the case would advance to a Senate trial .
A guilty verdict would remove him from the bench .
It would be the first impeachment of a federal judge since 1989 , when the House impeached Walter Nixon of Mississippi and the Senate convicted Alcee L. Hastings , now a Democratic congressman from Florida , who had been impeached the year before .
Neither Porteous , his attorney Kyle Schonekas , nor Chief Judge Helen G. Berrigan of Louisiana 's Eastern District was available for comment .
In its report , the Judicial Conference said Porteous may deserve impeachment over allegations that he filed a personal bankruptcy petition for himself and his wife under a false name in 2001 and filed many other false statements under oath during the bankruptcy proceedings .
He also allegedly took " gifts and things of value " from lawyers with cases before him .
" We take it very seriously when the governing body of the Judiciary sends us a referral for impeachment , " said Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich .
" Upon review , we believe this matter merits a full investigation . "
There was no dissent on the often highly polarized panel .
" I strongly believe that the committee is doing the right thing , " said the panel 's ranking Republican , Lamar Smith of Texas .
" The alleged corruption of a federal judge , who is appointed for life , is especially egregious . "
The U.S. House has impeached 13 judges ; the Senate acquitted four , convicted seven and two resigned without trial , according to the Federal Judicial Center 's website .
The last acquittal was of Harold Lauderback , a California district judge , in 1933 .
Four federal district judges have been convicted and removed from office since then : Halsted L. Ritter of Florida in 1936 ; Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada in 1986 and Hastings and Nixon in 1989 .
The allegations against Porteous were uncovered during the FBI 's Operation Wrinkled Robe , an investigation of the relationship between state judges in Jefferson Parish , where Porteous served until he was appointed a federal judge in 1994 , and bail bondsman Louis Marcotte .
That 5 { - year investigation put court - ordered wiretaps and video cameras in the parish courthouse and brought 14 convictions , including those of two state judges who were sent to federal prison .
In addition to making false statements under oath and taking gifts from attorneys , the charges against Porteous include hiding assets from the bankruptcy estate , leaving gambling losses off the list of debts and getting short - term credit from casinos after the bankruptcy judge ordered him to get approval of the court before taking on any debt .
The probe also uncovered evidence that Porteous rejected a request to step down from a case without revealing that he had a history of financial relationships with at least one attorney involved and leaving lawyers gifts off financial disclosure statements from 1994 - 2000 .
Porteous stepped aside from all civil cases involving the federal government and all criminal cases in 2003 , after a relative of Marcotte said the bondsman — sent to prison for racketeering — had paid for Porteous ' car repairs and arranged another favor .
He was removed from bankruptcy cases after the 5th Circuit 's judicial council 's report .

The name or term Soundwave refers to more than one character or idea .
For a list of other meanings , see Soundwave ( disambiguation ) .
Soundwave Continuity : Transformers Animated Affiliation : Decepticons Alternate Mode : Scion xB Weapons : Guitar
Soundwave is technology gone wrong .
Machines are superior to humans : more logical , more intelligent , and longer lasting .
It does not compute that humans control their robotic helpers , and Soundwave aims to lead the robot proletariat to rise against their fleshling bourgeoisie .
The Decepticon cause is logical in Soundwave 's optics , and he joined them in the hopes of overthrowing the human / capitalist oppressors .
With an army of subservient mechanoids that he can control through powerful signals , that uprising just might be possible .
His arsenal of weapons and gadgets is unusually large , and includes powerful speakers , wiretaps , voice modulators , sonic signals that control lesser robots , and the uncanny ability to assimilate other devices into his body .
He has a pet bird that transforms into a guitar and a pet bat that transforms into a keytar .
He is awesome in every way possible .
" I am Soundwave .
I am Decepticon .
The revolution begins now . "
― Soundwave [ [ " Sound and Fury " | [ src ] ] ]
Contents show ]

Fiction
Animated cartoon
Soundwave was a robot originally designed by Megatron .
Megatron suggested Isaac Sumdac give Soundwave to his daughter as a birthday present .
This seemingly kind act , of course , had a sinister ulterior motive .
Megatron knew Sari would use her AllSpark - enhanced Key on Soundwave , which would allow him to upgrade - and ultimately become Megatron 's new body .
What Megatron did n't count on , though , was that the upgrades would actually make Soundwave self - aware and that he was able to control other robots with sound .
Additionally , Soundwave concluded that machines should be the masters of the world , and humans would be an ideal slave force .
Megatron decided that if Soundwave could n't be a new body , he would be a new soldier .
He contacted Soundwave and tried to convince him to join the Decepticons , take control of the machines in Detroit , and steal the Key .
At first Soundwave refused , but then Megatron told Soundwave that the Autobots lived to serve the humans .
Once he was convinced , Soundwave promptly upgraded himself into a transforming body using controlled robots , and began his task .
He started by taking over all the robots in Detroit and using Tutor Bot to kidnap Sari Sumdac .
The revolution of the robots was , however , quickly opposed by the Autobots .
When Bulkhead came to rescue Sari , Soundwave blasted him with a sonic blast , then appealed to Bulkhead to join the revolution because he did not want to hurt a fellow machine , reminding him how Bulkhead was replaced by Soundwave himself .
Bulkhead acted as if he was about to kill Sari - then used his wrecking ball to shatter Soundwave .
The machines were restored to their normal operational status , and the day was saved .
Unknown to all others , however , Soundwave still functions as a small piece even after Bulkhead pummels him to scrap metal .
Sound and Fury
Porter C. Powell takes Isaac Sumdac 's original design for Soundwave and mass - produces what he intends to sell as toys on Christmas , for only 19.99 !
Isaac Sumdac was understandly furious and called him a crook for stealing his design , but Powell said that he acquired the patent for the Soundwave toy prior to being fired and thus is immune to any legal retaliation .
However , after finally rebuilding himself in secret , Soundwave uses one of the toys to spike the oilnog which the Autobots promptly drink , much to the delight of the glowing red-eyed toy Soundwave .
The next day , Sari attempts to greet the Autobots , only to find out them missing before being later attacked by a horde of Soundwave toys which she easily dispatches .
As she descended down underground in a secret complex , she learned that Soundwave was alive and had hooked up all the Autobots into a computer system where he projected their minds into a virtual reality where they appeared human and were being besieged by the Decepticons as a part of a plan to reprogram them into Decepticons with his idealogy .
An angry Sari attempts to free her friends but her cover was blown by Soundwave 's pet bird , Laserbeak .
After managing to drive Sari off with Laserbeak augmenting his sonic attack , also learning that the Autobots are starting to realize where they are , Soundwave uses his other pet to began the final phase of Operation : Autobot Reprogramming .
Human Error , Part 1
The Autobots are back in action but not for long .
Soundwave regains control of the VR simulator and the Autobots are soon Automen again .
Spying a fleeing Soundwave ( in Soundblaster black colors no less ) , the Automen acquire familiar vehicles and attempt to give chase .
When they finally corner him , it turns out they 've been led into a trap ( surprise , surprise ) , and Soundwave 's plan to reprogram the Autobots is soon complete .
Meanwhile , Sari Sumdac goes for help and definitely not finding it in her father , who even attacks her thanks to Soundwave 's hypnotism .
She goes all the way to Dinobot Island where she confronts Grimlock and Swoop .
After a small conflict , Grimlock stomps away indicating that he was n't talking to the other one and that Dinobots are n't pets after all .
She then comes across Scrapper who has been stranded on Dinobot Island since an exploding oil reserve sent him , Mixmaster and Dirt Boss blasting off again .
Apparently he had given the triceratops Dinobot a name , Snarl , and she is able to convince them to coming back to the mainland .
On their journey across Lake Michigan , they find further help from Wreck - Gar , who is fully repaired and ready to save the day .
The group becomes the Substitute Autobots with Sari as their leader .
Shortly afterward , Soundwave surprises them with a team of his own : his new evil Autobots .
A battle ensues between the Autosubs and the Autocons while Soundwave menacingly controls their every movement with his nifty keytar .
When the Substitute Autobots finally come up with a useful strategy , Soundwave begins spreading himself too thin , and begins losing control of the Autobots .
He orders Laserbeak and his keytar , Ratbat , to attack .
During the scuffle , Optimus Prime is able to grab Laserbeak , force him into guitar mode and him and Soundwave have a guitar battle to rock the ages .
Optimus is able to get in close however , and proceeds to smash Soundwave into tiny bits with Laserbeak .
Now back to a small singular component , an angry Soundwave is carried away by Laserbeak and his hypnotic control over New Detroit is lifted .
The day is saved and the Substitute Autobots disband .
And an unhappy Porter C. Powell laments .
Merry Christmas !
Human Error , Part 2
Toys
Animated
Soundwave ( Deluxe , 2008 ) Accessories : " Laserbeak " guitar
( Deluxe , 2008 )
Soundwave transforms into a pseudo - Scion xB ( about a century too late , are we ? ) that got a " Pimp My Ride " music style treatment .
That 's awesome .
He also comes with his partner Laserbeak , who changes from a guitar to a bird .
Also awesome .
Laserbeak can mount on the top of the roof of Soundwave 's car mode and perch on his arm ( or store on his back ) in robot mode .
Very awesome .
When the two wheels turn to the front on his shoulders , they look just like speakers .
And the tuning knobs are just the right size to fit in the screwholes on his arms , so he can look like he 's strumming Laserbeak when in guitar form .
Extremely awesome .
There is one problem with the toy , though .
Many have reported that the paint on Soundwave 's back will melt , crack or rub off over time .
Soundwaves " eyes " have been known to be poorly painted on .
Not so awesome .
Soundwave ( Bumper Battlers , 2008 )
This version of Soundwave has his name in fun hip - hopish letters across the sides and his chunkier look is quite adorable .
Pressing the Decepticon insignia on his hood makes the toy sound off with a number of sound - bites in a seemingly random fashion including tires squealing , slamming brakes , the classic transforming noise , " Get out of my way " , " I am Soundwave " , " Attack the Autobots " , " Automatons attack .
Attack " and " I am Decepticon " .
His most hilarious clip is a crashing noise followed by a timely monotone " Ow " .
Pressing in the front bumper causes his robot mode to pop up from the hood and makes crashing noises or the transforming noise .
Electrostatic Soundwave ( Deluxe , 2009 ) Accessories : " Ratbat " keyboard guitar
( Deluxe , 2009 )
Electrostatic Soundwave has the same model , but his awesome new paint job is black and red ( not unlike Soundblaster´s , really ) .
He still transforms into the Scion .
He comes with Ratbat .
Ratbat transforms into one of those cool keytars .
Ratbat fits onto Soundwave 's vehicle mode top .
Ratbat 's head can be awesomely seen in his keytar mode , very awesome about that .
Who does n't want a keytar with a bat head ?
Soundwave looks meaner in this action figure , and new designs on his hood and fender .
Ratbat also has awesome vampire legs .
All in all , this toy is awesome .
Soundwave ( Activators , 2009 )
This Soundwave has an activators model and is the same design and colors .
Little is known about this figure .
Notes
In the cartoon , his eyes can be either " Decepticon " red or " Generation One toy " yellow .
Everybody 's happy !
The box he was in when given to Sari — as well as his remaining component after Bulkhead first defeated him ( and Optimus later ) — are obvious references to the alternate mode of Generation One Soundwave .
At BotCon 2008 , it was revealed that the production staff of Transformers Animated were completely unaware of the Soundwave toy 's Laserbeak - guitar , hence why it was not included in his debut episode .
It was likewise revealed at BotCon 2008 that Soundwave 's " tape deck " form seen at the end of Sound and Fury was based upon Takara 's Music Label MP3 player Soundwave toy .
Soundwave 's alternate mode is based on an unproduced design for a Classics toy of the original Soundwave .
Soundwave 's alt - mode is referred to as an SUV in his bio , but a Scion xB is technically a station wagon .
Soundwave 's digitally enhanced voice was also a reference to the original , although Frank Welker did n't reprise his role .
Too bad — that would have been awesome .
When Soundwave is destroyed by Optimus in " Human Error , Part 2 " , he makes the sound of a Der 56 k Modem that is dialing up .
In " Human Error , Part 1 " and " Human Error , Part 2 " Soundwave had 2 avatars in the " dream " the autobots had , the first one being black and red , being an homage to the Generation One Soundblaster .
The second avatar being a white one , as an homage to Shatteredglass Soundwave .
It 's pretty common , when reading discussion of Apple 's “ I ’m a Mac , I ’m a PC ” ads , to come across the comment :
Sure , they 're great ads but they do n't work .
John Hodgeman ’s PC is far more likeable than Justin Long ’s smug hipster Mac .
This is missing the point .
To illustrate , here are director Chuck Jones ’ rules for writing Road Runner cartoons , copied from Wikipedia :
Road Runner cannot harm the Coyote except by going “ beep , beep ” .
No outside force can harm the Coyote — only his own ineptitude or the failure of Acme products .
The Coyote could stop anytime — if he was not a fanatic .
( Repeat : “ A fanatic is one who redoubles his effort when he has forgotten his aim . ” — George Santayana ) .
No dialogue ever , except “ beep , beep ” .
Road Runner must stay on the road — for no other reason than that he 's a roadrunner .
All action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters — the southwest American desert .
All tools , weapons , or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the Acme Corporation .
Whenever possible , make gravity the Coyote 's greatest enemy .
The Coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures .
The audience 's sympathy must remain with the Coyote .
Substitute Microsoft for Acme , software failures for gravity , a plain white background for the desert … well , you get my drift .
If Apple had gone the traditional route of portraying Microsoft as a gigantic monopolistic borg , great at crushing competition through market pressure but capable of developing only mediocre products , the ads would have been boring .
More accurate , perhaps , but boring .
They 'd have been the 30 Seconds Hate , and that ’s just so last century .
Instead Apple portray the PC as mostly well - meaning , likeable , goofy … but completely ineffectual .
Belief in God encourages people to be helpful , honest and generous , but only under certain psychological conditions , according to University of British Columbia researchers who analyzed the past three decades of social science research .
Religious people are more likely than the non-religious to engage in prosocial behaviour – acts that benefit others at a personal cost – when it enhances the individual 's reputation or when religious thoughts are freshly activated in the person 's mind , say UBC social psychologists Ara Norenzayan and Azim Shariff
Their paper " The Origin and Evolution of Religious Prosociality " appears in the October 3 , 2008 issue of the journal Science .
The two - part paper first reviews data from anthropology , sociology , psychology and economics .
Norenzayan and Shariff then go on to explore how religion , by encouraging cooperation , became a factor in making possible the rise of large and stable societies made of genetically unrelated individuals .
To date , says Norenzayan , the public debate whether religion fosters cooperation and trust has largely been driven by opinion and anecdote .
" We wanted to look at the hard scientific evidence , " says Norenzayan , an associate professor in the Dept. of Psychology .
The investigators found complementary results across the disciplines :
Empirical data within anthropology suggests there is more cooperation among religious societies than the non-religious , especially when group survival is under threat
Economic experiments indicate that religiosity increases levels of trust among participants
Psychology experiments show that thoughts of an omniscient , morally concerned God reduce levels of cheating and selfish behaviour
" This type of religiously - motivated ' virtuous ' behaviour has likely played a vital social role throughout history , " says Shariff , a Psychology PhD student .
Shariff adds , " One reason we now have large , cooperative societies may be that some aspects of religion – such as outsourcing costly social policing duties to all - powerful Gods – made societies work more cooperatively in the past . "
Across cultures and through time , observe the authors , the notion of an all - powerful , morally concerned " Big God " usually begat " Big groups " –large - scale , stable societies that successfully passed on their cultural beliefs .
The study also points out that in today 's world religion has no monopoly on kind and generous behaviour .
In many findings , non-believers acted as prosocially as believers .
The last several hundred years has seen the rise of non-religious institutional mechanisms that include effective policing , courts and social surveillance .
" Some of the most cooperative modern societies are also the most secular , " says Norenzayan .
" People have found other ways to be cooperative – without God . "
Renewable energy 's gone in the space of a few months from market darling to whipping boy .
Shares in solar - and wind - power companies have suffered even more than the market at large .
The outlook for new projects is growing increasingly cloudy .
Stormy weather , for now ( AP )
But that 's not because renewable energy suddenly got uglier .
It 's because of the fallout from financial - market turmoil , says Andy Katell , head of communications at GE Financial Services , who took umbrage at yesterday 's post .
Mr. Katell says " GE has been �and will remain �a significant investor in renewable energy , " with $ 1.4 billion investment slated for this year .
So why is clean tech in apparent retreat ?
Mr. Katell says :
These problems are centered around the financial markets , not the strong fundamentals of renewable energy or of GE itself .
The core issue is the industry - wide difficulty of committing to new investments in a period of high uncertainty about borrowing costs .
Such transactions usually involve staged funding , and the market volatility makes forward committing to fundings expensive to developers and ultimately to consumers of renewable energy .
But in recent months , market somersaults have undoubtedly changed the outlook for renewable energy .
When fossil fuel prices were soaring , things like offshore wind farms suddenly looked appealing , and guaranteed electricity prices from wind farms looked like a bargain .
But with fossil fuel prices headed south and capital getting more expensive , renewables are losing some of their glow .
As the NYT notes today :
" Natural gas at $ 6 makes wind look like a questionable idea and solar power unfathomably expensive , " said Kevin Book , a senior vice president at FBR Capital Markets .
Like dozens of other communities across America , the tiny town of Monticello , Minnesota wants to build a fiber - optic broadband network .
In September of last year , its citizens approved the project via referendum , with 74 per cent of voters giving the nod .
But thirteen months later , its fiberlicious dream is still on hold , thanks to a lawsuit from the incumbent phone company .
Monticello - population 12,000 - had no intention of using tax dollars to finance the network .
It issued bonds .
But with its
May lawsuit , TDS Telecom - which is also building a fiber network - argued that the city has no statutory authority to do such a thing .
Christopher Mitchell - a kind of public network watchdog for a non-profit known as Institute for Local Self Reliance ( ILSR ) - has seen this before .
" You get these lawsuits in almost every community that tries to do this , " he tells The Reg .
" The phone and cable companies perceive it as a direct attack .
They do n't want competition . "
Thankfully , the tactic rarely works .
Yesterday , Judge Jonathan Jasper , of Minnesota 's 10th District Court , shot down the TDS lawsuit , ruling that Monticello does indeed have the authority to build its own bond - funded network .
TDS is still mulling whether to appeal .
According to Christopher Mitchell - who heads ILSR 's " Telecommunications as Commons Initiative " - fifty or sixty US communities have launched their own public fiber projects , from Lafayette , Louisiana to Burlington , Vermont .
" Vermont is known as liberal and Lafayette is on of the most conservative cities in the United States , " he says .
" So it runs the gamut . "
Of all the phone and cable lawsuits brought against these projects , Mitchell does n't know of one that 's actually succeeded in quashing a public network .
But he says that such suits often work as a delay tactic : " Lawsuits are destructive because they waste time , disrupting business plans , and put a city behind on its debt payment schedule . "
Many suits claim that public networks put the taxpayer at risk .
But in the case of Monticello , tax dollars were n't touched .
TDS argued that Minnesota law did not specifically authorize the city to issue revenue bonds for broadband .
" It was very clear that the statute authorized a telephone network or a cable network , " Mitchell says .
" But TDS alleged that the law did not allow them to offer internet service . "
The statute does allow the city to issue bonds for " other public convenience . "
And Judge Jesper has confirmed that fiber - optic broadband does indeed qualify as " other public convenience . "
" The [ Monticello fiber - optic ] project is similar to the express grant of authority given to cities to construct a telecommunications system and the goal of the project fulfills the expressed legislative intent to bolster telecommunications services , " the judge wrote in his decision .
" The project is not different in character from other utilities the municipality is authorized to build through the issuance of bonds . "
TDS tells us it has 30 days to appeal , as it continues to lay its own fiber .
" This decision does not impact our current work in the city of Monticello , " the company says .
" We will continue to move forward with our construction plan to complete our fiber network by the end of the year .
" We are confident our technical expertise , dedicated employees and long - term experience will prove to be a solid competitive advantage for TDS as we move forward bringing advanced communications services and innovative new products to the citizens of Monticello . "
Meanwhile , the city of Monticello 's fiber funds are sitting in escrow - where they 'll stay until TDS runs out of appeals . ®

It ’s no secret that higher gas prices have hit America pretty hard .
Â
While higher gas prices have placed quite a financial strain on the American public , at the end of the day , the “ group ” that might be effected the most might not be Americans in general , rather the Big 3 American car makers – General Motors , Ford and Chrysler .
After spending years building up the infrastructure to produce profitable trucks and SUVs , higher gas prices have really hurt sales at the Big 3 American car makers .
Â
In an effort to stop the financial bleeding , many truck and SUV plants have been shut down , costing thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales .
These current conditions have led the senior management of these car companies to ask the Federal Government for some financial help in the form of low interest loans to help convert truck and SUV plants into facilities which produce smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles .
While this Federal intervention may seem like a good thing – after all , a healthy manufacturing sector has always been good for the American economy – according to a recent poll , Americans appear to be pretty torn over whether or not the Federal Government should help the Big 3 .
The poll , which ran on Daily Fuel Economy Tip for the past week , asked , “ Should the Federal Government help Ford , GM and Chrysler convert truck and SUV plants into facilities that produce fuel efficient vehicles ? ”
Â
Here ’s how nearly 200 people responded :
52 % of respondents said the government should help
help 44 % of respondents said the government should not help
help 4 % of respondents said they were unsure
You certainly can’t blame GM , Ford and Chrysler for asking the Federal Government for some money .
Â
After all , over the past six months the government has stepped in to bailout Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and may end up stepping in to finance the sale of Lehman Brothers .
( UPDATE – THE FED AND THE TREASURY DID NOT STEP IN AND LEHMAN FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY THIS MORNING )
Since these bailouts could ultimately end up costing American tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars , it certainly does n’t seem like much for the American automotive industry to ask for $ 50 billion in low interest loans .
Also , there is some precedent for the Federal Government stepping in when one of America ’s large car manufacturers is hurting .
Â
Back in 1979 , during the Carter Administration , the Federal Government stepped in and provided the necessary financing / loan backing required to keep Chrysler from falling into bankruptcy .
There are certainly plenty of good reasons for the Federal Government stepping in and helping out the car manufacturers , the largest of which is it will help save thousands of blue collar jobs , and hopefully revive the Rust Belt , where double digit unemployment is rampant .
Â
Additionally , the availability of more cars capable of better fuel economy is certainly worth the investment .
That being said , there are plenty of reasons to the Federal Government to not step in , namely , this is another case where corporate losses are being socialized while later profits will be privatized .
Â
If we ’re going to proclaim ourselves as a free market , capitalist country , we have to be willing to let companies and firms – even big ones – fail if they are no longer viable .
This is certainly a very fine line to walk , and in order for this to end well , a lot of difficult decisions will have to be made on both sides of the aisle .
Â
However , when push comes to shove , I do expect that the Federal Government will step in and offer some financial help to the Big 3 .
Their health is just too important to America ’s over all economy , especially when you look at the fact that should one or more of these companies fail , there would be an immense trickle down effect , hurting part suppliers , dealerships , and creditors .
So , when it ’s all said and done , GM , Ford and Chrysler may fall into the same categorization as Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac : TOO BIG TO FAIL .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Home heating bills are expected to rise dramatically this winter and there is growing concern that the government program aimed at helping poor families cope with energy costs may not be able to meet the needs of cash - strapped households .
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) is a federally funded program that gives money to states to help low - income households , the elderly and the disabled cope with the financial strain of high heating bills .
This year , however , the program could be squeezed by a projected 20 % average increase in heating bills nationwide and an influx of people applying for assistance due to sour economic conditions , high gas prices and a weak labor market .
" This could be the worst winter ever for low - income folks , " said Jerry McKim , who oversees Iowa 's LIHEAP program for the state 's Bureau of Energy Assistance .
While heating oil and natural gas prices have fallen from recent highs , they remain well above last year 's level and still pose a significant threat to poor and fixed - income Americans .
" Anything over $ 2.50 a gallon for low - income family is a budget buster , " said Richard Moffi , who manages Vermont 's LIHEAP program .
Heating oil prices are expected to reach $ 4.34 a gallon nationwide this winter , according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration .
A growing number of families in need :
In addition to the run-up in fuel prices , the slowdown in the economy has led to an increase in the number of households that qualify for assistance .
In Vermont , there has been a 20 % rise in the number of people applying for LIHEAP benefits , Moffi said .
With a larger number of people to assist , many LIHEAP programs could be forced to reduce the amount of money they provide to eligible households .
Although some states contribute to the fund , the bulk of the money for LIHEAP is provided by the Federal government .
Moffi said Vermont 's LIHEAP was able to provide an average benefit of $ 1,362 last year , which covered roughly 54 % of an average household 's heating costs for the year .
This year , based on current numbers with no additional money from Washington , the average benefit will be less than half last year 's amount .
What 's more , many low - income families are still behind on payments for last year 's heating bills .
Facing a cold winter : The National Energy Assistance Director 's Association ( NEADA ) recently reported that more than 15 million households are currently facing utility shutoffs because they can not pay their energy bill .
That 's an increase of nearly 10 % over the comparable period in 2007 .
Mark Wolfe , executive director of the NEADA , said that low - income energy assistance programs usually focus on families that make roughly $ 31,000 a year .
Now , more middle - class families , including those that earn up to $ 50,000 a year , could be in need of assistance , he added .
" The real tragic thing is that there 's not much out there for the lower side of middle income , " said David Fox , executive director of the National Low Income Energy Consortium .
" And that 's most of America right now . "
To cope with higher energy prices , many low - income households have cut back on other essential expenditures .
A recent survey by the NEADA showed that 70 % of low - income households said they reduced spending on food as a result of high energy and gas costs .
That was followed by 31 % that said they have cut back on purchases of medicine and 19 % that curtailed spending on education .
Some families are even considering moving in with relatives to cope with the cost of heating , Wolfe said .
" These are things we have n't seen since the Depression era , " he said .
But before resorting to such drastic measures , consumers should contact their heating oil supplier or local utility to discuss their options , said John Maniscaoco , executive vice president of the New York Oil Heat Association .
" Suppliers will try to make amends , " Maniscaoco said .
" Nobody wants to shut off anybody , " he said .
Many utilities offer payment programs aimed at softening the blow of high energy prices .
And heating oil prices vary from dealer to dealer , which means households may have some bargaining power .
While lawmakers have expressed concern over the issue , Congress has yet to make a decision on how much money will be dedicated to the program , which has prompted some concern among state LIHEAP managers .
" We can only count on less federal dollars , " McKim said .
LIHEAP 's budget for fiscal year 2008 , which ends in September , was almost $ 2.57 billion in federal dollars .
For fiscal year 2009 , President Bush has issued a budget request of $ 2 billion for the program , which is a decrease of 22 % .
Senate Democrats made a push in July to provide additional funding for LIHEAP but Republicans opposed the bill because it did not include provisions for increased offshore drilling and it failed to pass .
A spokesman for Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt. , who sponsored the bill in July , said expanding LIHEAP 's budget is a " top priority " for the Senator and that the issue will be revisited when Congress returns from recess next month .
Other lawmakers have hinted that additional LIHEAP funding could come this year as part of a second economic stimulus program .
The issue of home heating assistance has " a lot of bipartisan support , " Wolfe said .
And he is cautiously optimistic that Congress will ultimately come through with additional funding as the public becomes more aware of this " potentially very serious problem . "
The question is : Will Washington act in time to make a meaningful difference ?
" The government is better when disaster strikes , " Wolfe said .
" It 's not as good when we say the disaster is coming . "
Home heating bills are expected to spike this winter as high gasoline prices are already straining household budgets .
Are you planning to do anything different in order to reduce your heating bills ?
Are you cutting back on things to get by ?

Over the past few days I 've been mulling over the recent news from Yahoo !
that they are building a Facebook - like platform based on OpenSocial .
I find this interesting given that a number of people have come to the conclusion that Facebook is slowly killing it 's widget platform in order to replace it with Facebook Connect .
The key reason developers believe Facebook is killing of its platform is captured in Nick O'Neill 's post entitled Scott Rafer : The Facebook Platform is Dead which states
When speaking at the Facebook developer conference today in Berlin , Scott Rafer declared that Facebook platform dead .
He posted statistics including one that I posted that suggests Facebook widgets are dead .
Lookery ’s own statistics from Quantcast suggest that their publisher traffic has been almost halved since the new site design was released .
Ultimately , I think we may see an increase in traffic as users become educated on the new design but there is no doubt that developers were impacted significantly .
So what is Scott ’s solution for developers looking to thrive following the shift to the new design ?
Leave the platform and jump on the Facebook Connect opportunity .
The bottom line is that by moving applications off of the profile page in their recent redesign , Facebook has reduced the visibility of these application thus reducing their page views and their ability to spread virally .
Some may think that the impact of these changes is unforeseen , however the Facebook team is obsessive about testing the impact of their UX changes so it is extremely unlikely that they are n't aware that the redesign would negatively impact Facebook applications .
The question to ask then is why Facebook would knowingly damaging a platform which has been uniformly praised across the industry and has had established Web players like Google and Yahoo !
scrambling to deploy copycat efforts ?
Alex Iskold over at ReadWriteWeb believes he has the answer in his post Why Platforms Are Letting Us Down - And What They Should Do About
It which contains the following excerpt
When the Facebook platform was unveiled in 2007 , it was called genius .
Never before had a company in a single stroke enabled others to tap into millions of its users completely free .
The platform was hailed as a game changer under the famous mantra " we built it and they will come " .
And they did come , hundreds of companies rushing to write Facebook applications .
Companies and VC funds focused specifically on Facebook apps .
It really did look like a revolution , but it did n't last .
The first reason was that Facebook apps quickly arranged themselves on a power law curve .
A handful of apps ( think Vampires , Byte Me and Sell My Friends ) landed millions of users , but those in the pack had hardly any .
The second problem was , ironically , the bloat .
Users polluted their profiles with Facebook apps and no one could find anything in their profiles .
Facebook used to be simple - pictures , wall , friends .
Now each profile features a zoo of heterogenous apps , each one trying to grab the user 's attention to take advantage of the network effect .
Users are confused .
Worst of all , the platform had no infrastructure to monetize the applications .
When Sheryl Sandberg arrived on the scene and looked at the balance sheet , she spotted the hefty expense that was the Facebook platform .
Trying to live up to a huge valuation is n't easy , and in the absense of big revenues people rush to cut costs .
Since it was both an expense and users were confused less than a year after its glorious launch , Facebook decided to revamp its platform .
The latest release of Facebook , which was released in July , makes it nearly impossible for new applications to take advantage of the network effect .
Now users must first install the application , then find it under the application menu or one of the tabs , then check a bunch of boxes to add it to their profile ( old applications are grand - daddied in ) .
Facebook has sent a clear message to developers - the platform is no longer a priority .
Alex 's assertion is that after Facebook looked at the pros and cons of their widget platform , the company came to the conclusion that the platform was turning into a cost center instead of being away to improve the value of Facebook to its users .
There is evidence that applications built on Facebook 's platform did cause negative reactions from its users .
For example , there was the creation of the " This has got to stop … pointless applications are ruining Facebook " group which at its height had half a million Facebook users protesting the behavior of Facebook apps .
In addition , the creation of Facebook 's Great Apps program along with the guiding principles for building Facebook applications implies that the Facebook team realized that applications being built on their platform typically do n't have their users best interests at heart .
This brings up the interesting point that although there has been a lot of discussion on how Facebook apps make money there have n't been similar conversations on how the application platform improves Facebook 's bottom line .
There is definitely a win - win equation when so - called " great apps " like iLike and Causes , which positively increase user engagement , are built on Facebook 's platform .
However there is also a long tail of applications that try their best to spread virally at the cost of decreasing user satisfaction in the Facebook experience .
These dissatisfied users likely end up reducing their usage of Facebook thus actually costing Facebook users and page views .
It is quite possible that the few " great apps " built on the Facebook platform do not outweigh the amount of not - so - great apps built on the platform which have caused users to protest in the past .
This would confirm Alex Iskold 's suspicions about why Facebook has started sabotaging the popularity of applications built on its platform and has started emphasizing partnerships via Facebook Connect .
A similar situation has occurred with regards to the Java platform and Sun Microsystems .
The sentiment is captured in a Javaworl article by Josh Fruhlinger entitled Sun melting down , and where 's Java ?
which contains the following excerpt
one of the most interesting things about the coverage of the company 's problems is how Java figures into the conversation , which is exactly not at all .
In most of the articles , the word only appears as Sun 's stock ticker ; the closest I could find to a mention is in this AP story , which notes that " Sun 's strategy of developing free , ' open - source ' software and giving it away to spur sales of its high - end computer servers and support services has n't paid off as investors would like . "
Even longtime tech journalist Ashlee Vance , when gamely badgering Jon Schwartz for the New York Time about whether Sun would sell its hardware division and focus on software , only mentions Solaris and MySQL in discussing the latter .
Those in the Java community no doubt believe that Java is too big to fail , that Sun can't abandon it because it's too important , even if it can't tangibly be tied to anything profitable .
But if Sun 's investors eventually dismember the company to try to extract what value is left in it , I 'm not sure where Java will fit into that plan .
It is interesting to note that after a decade of investment in the Java platform , it is hard to point to what concrete benefits Sun has gotten from being the originator and steward of the Java platform and programming language .
Definitely another example of a platform that may have benefited applications built on it yet which did n't really benefit the platform vendor as expected .
The lesson here is that building a platform is n't just about making the developers who use the platform successful but also making sure that the platform itself furthers the goals of its developers in the first place .

Earth may be in the midst of the greatest extinction ever , according to a new mass extinction scoring system .
" The current extinction resembles none of the earlier ones , and may end up being the greatest of all , " write Istanbul Technical University researchers A. M. Celal Sengor , Saniye Atayman and Sinan Ozeren .
Their system , published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , attempts to quantify those periods when more than half of all species disappeared .
In addition to the current mass extinction , this has happened at least five times : the End Ordovician , Late Devonian , End Permian , End Triassic and End Cretaceous .
The latter – marking the end of the Age of Dinosaurs – receives the most attention , but scientists have been unable to decide which extinction was most significant .
That debate may finally be settled , though the answer is unsettling .
" If unchecked , the current extinction threatens to be the greatest killer of all time , " write the researchers .
By multiplying the number of organismal groups that went extinct with the time it took , they arrived at a metric called
" greatness . "
According to this , the dinosaur - ending End Cretaceous event , possibly caused when asteroid strikes or volcanic explosions sheathed the Earth in ash , was twice as great as any previous extinction .
The Permian extinction event , caused 250 million years ago by the formation of the Pangea supercontinent and volcano - induced oceanic poisoning , placed third on the researchers ' rankings – and it still encompassed the loss of 96 percent of Earthly life .
According to the researchers , the current global die - off combines elements of both the End Cretaceous and the Permian .
The global dominance of humans " represents a virtual Pangea formation , "
and human activities are a " global annihilating agent " comparable to any asteroid .
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature estimates that 800 plant and animal species have gone extinct in the last 500 years , with more than 16,000 currently threatened with extinction – and those lost or threatened organisms come the from mere 41,000 species so far assessed by science .
More than a million have been described but remain unstudied .
The most troubling figures , however , come not from the total species lost but the rate at which they 're vanishing : 1,000 times faster than usual .
But even that alarming rate may be too conservative .
According to a paper recently published in Nature , modeling errors led scientists to grossly underestimate the survival chances of threatened species .
" The older models could be severely overestimating the time to extinction , " said University of Colorado ecologist and Nature study co-author Brett Melbourne to the Guardian .
" Some species could go extinct 100 times sooner than we expect . "

The folks at Google have a $ 4.4 trillion plan to remake America ’s energy landscape by 2030 , eliminating coal from the picture and shaving emissions of greenhouse gases by 95 % .
Unlike some other ambitious plans to rejig America ’s energy mix , it comes with detailed prescriptions and pricetags — but how realistic is it ?
The plan has three big pillars : energy efficiency to reduce demand for new electricity ; a massive renewable - energy push to replace coal ; and an accelerated rollout of plug - in cars that can displace about half the ...
Chris Moreno lost his job managing a print shop two years ago , just after his wife became pregnant and they ’d started building a house on 40 acres near the shores of Caddo Lake .
He fretted he ’d have to relinquish his humble piece of paradise , where he indulged his country boy ’s passion for hunting raccoons and catching catfish .
But now fortune has smiled on Moreno :
He ’s poised to become a millionaire , all because of that 40 acres he bought eight years ago for $ 45,000 .
Landowners here in the piney three - state junction known as Ark - La - Tex recently learned that in this energy - starved era , they may be sitting on the largest natural gas field ever found in the continental U.S.
The discovery of the Haynesville Shale , which lies mainly beneath Louisiana but branches into Texas and Arkansas , was disclosed in March by energy companies , which had been quietly buying up drilling rights for months before telling the public .

The news has triggered a flurry of speculation as frantic as anything seen here since a gusher on a Texas hill named Spindletop in 1901 ushered in the modern oil industry .
Hordes of landmen , leasing agents for the energy companies , have descended on Shreveport , the unofficial capital of Ark - La - Tex , dangling gaudy sums before landowners in hopes of getting permission to drill beneath their properties .
Firms that earlier this year were leasing land for $ 200 an acre are now paying upward of $ 20,000 an acre , leaving thousands of homeowners dreaming of plasma TVs and sports cars .
The windfall is changing lives for people like Moreno , 38 , whose big worry has become whether to take the money now or hold out in hopes of getting even more .
Energy companies have offered him $ 750,000 upfront to drill his land , as well as 25 % of whatever the wells yield , which could bring him an additional $ 900,000 a year .
But the bids keep getting larger , so he ’s waiting .
Chesapeake Energy Corp. , one of the major players in the Haynesville Shale , recently told investors that it thought the deposit was the world ’s fourth - largest .
“ They ’re throwing so much money around , it ’s easy to lose your mind , ” Moreno said .
“ Where do I draw the line ?
I do feel like my luck has changed overnight . ”
Never mind that only a few dozen wells have been drilled and the rest could come up dry .
The mere promise of a big strike in natural gas , which has soared in price , has already brought hundreds of millions in investment dollars to Shreveport , a riverboat gambling hub .
That ’s turned Ark - La - Tex into a particularly vivid example of how America ’s thirst for energy is creating wealth in a few lucky pockets of the country , even as high oil and gas prices drag the overall economy down .

Michael Long , a Shreveport councilman and third - generation veteran of booms and busts in this rollicking region , where fortune has often shifted with the price of oil , said now he knows how his Irish grandfather must have felt when he headed here with his four brothers a century ago in search of instant riches .
“ This Haynesville fever has extended pretty far , pretty fast , ” Long said .
“ A lot of landowners are sitting there thinking , OK , I ’m ready to make my million dollars . ”
The Haynesville Shale comes after the Barnett Shale , a similar natural gas find in the Dallas - Fort Worth area that has been extraordinarily productive and profitable .
The Barnett Shale has spurred drilling in shopping mall parking lots and suburban subdivisions , and generated tens of thousands of jobs and more than a billion dollars a year in state and local taxes .
The Barnett and Haynesville formations are geologically similar , and companies have shown they can now extract gas from previously unreachable places , leading experts to predict that the Haynesville Shale will make fast fortunes in Shreveport and bring decades of lucrative royalty payments .

“ This is already the biggest thing ever to happen to this area , ” said Bill Pittman , a former landman who ’s started a website , MyOilPro.com , to advise property owners .
“ It ’s life - altering . ”
Bank tellers share stories of customers walking in with wide smiles and $ 800,000 checks .
Companies have complained of spies sneaking around their test wells at night , trying to glean how much gas they ’re pulling up .
An energy executive claimed rivals were hiring exotic dancers to go door to door to entice landowners .
A popular rumor , knocked down by law enforcement but still spreading , was that Department of Homeland Security officials had warned that something fishy had to be happening because too much money was changing hands .
For the Shreveport - Bossier YMCA , the Haynesville Shale is the biggest stroke of luck since Elvis Presley sang a benefit concert before 10,000 screaming teenagers in 1956 , raising enough money for a new swimming pool .
When Gary Lash took over as chief executive six years ago , he said the YMCA had $ 500 in the bank and $ 600,000 in debt .
Now it ’s flush after energy companies upped one another in competition for the rights to drill beneath its 47 - acre recreation spot , Camp Forbing .
Lash has hired a camp director and is planning to spend several hundred thousand dollars to construct a rope course .
He ’s thinking about building a new branch .
Advertisement
“ It ’s crazy money , ” Lash said , though he declined to reveal how much the Y got .
“ But if they ’re willing to pay it , we ’re willing to take it . ”
There is a dark side to the Haynesville Shale mania , however , and it is worrying politicians and activists .
Like California during the Gold Rush , Shreveport , population 200,000 , is suddenly awash in dubious characters taking advantage of the gullible .
Freelance landmen are coaxing naive landowners into signing away gas rights for small amounts and are then selling the contracts at huge profit .
Long said he was outraged to hear the story of a man who turned to his preacher , a landman , for advice and ended up signing with him for $ 200 an acre when bonuses were going for thousands .
Anger is simmering among some landowners who signed early for a relative pittance -- only to learn later that energy firms had strong scientific evidence that the Haynesville Shale could be historic .
But others shrug and admit they would have done the same if they were the energy companies .

Brent Rowell leased 60 acres in east Texas for $ 250 an acre and what he thought was an exceptional 20 % cut of whatever the wells produced -- monthly royalty checks known in these parts as “ mailbox money . ”
“ I had n’t even gotten over patting myself on the back when I read in the paper , ‘ Chesapeake Energy wants to drill the best Haynesville Shale wells on your land . ’
That was news to everyone out this way .
Of course the going royalty rate now is 25 % and goes up by the day . ”
Still , Rowell said he was n’t bitter .
“ Did Chesapeake know I was sitting on top of Haynesville Shale ?
Of course .
That ’s why it is called oil and gas business , ” he said .

In Stonewall , a country town of 1,700 about 30 minutes south of Shreveport , Kassi Fitzgerald is doing her part to educate neighbors .
A registered nurse , Fitzgerald said she was spurred to activism after learning that her next - door neighbor , who speaks little English , signed a lease for $ 350 an acre at the same time she was offered $ 1,000 .
“ That Hispanic man bought the worst lot on our block and he ’s worked his tail off to fix it up , ” said Fitzgerald , who was banding remaining neighbors together to command a higher price .
“ It killed me to see him get ripped off . ”
Fitzgerald stepped into a hair salon inside a mobile home and chatted up owner Mary Ott and her customers , who appeared to be talking about little else but the Haynesville Shale .
“ I was all ready to accept that first $ 250 - an - acre deal , ” said Ott , who owned a little over 4 acres that she wound up leasing for $ 53,000 .
“ I had a stamp on it and everything .
Fortunately , I am a procrastinator . ”

Talk turned to a neighborhood where residents were offered $ 7,500 an acre , compared with $ 12,500 down the road .
Why , asked a woman having her hair curled , was there such a disparity ?
“ It ’s the difference between brick houses and trailers , ” Fitzgerald replied .
“ They ’re doing it based on socioeconomics . ”
Thomas S. Price Jr. , a Chesapeake vice president , said the company was thrilled about the gas field ’s potential -- he talked of a future in which Louisianans would fuel cars with clean - burning natural gas instead of gasoline .
But he said that anyone who believed the Haynesville Shale was a lock must be a rube .
He recalled that a similar frenzy over a gas deposit in central Louisiana called the Austin Chalk ended in failure for Chesapeake , though landowners walked away richer .
Advertisement
“ We were buying leases like crazy , and it turned out to be a disaster , ” he said .
“ And let me tell you , there was n’t one person who came back and said , Sorry , fellas , here ’s your bonus money back . ”
For now , companies with stakes in the Haynesville Shale are riding high .
Petrohawk Energy Corp. is a relatively minor gas player -- but its big holdings happened to be in northwestern Louisiana , a situation that allowed it to seize a share of the Haynesville splotch .
Its stock has doubled in the last five months .
Moreno , who now works for a window company , and other landowners share information online on the best bonuses being paid out by energy companies , as well as which landmen are honest .
Moreno wants to do right for his boys , Lucas , 9 , and Wyatt , 1 .
He would love to get enough money to coax his wife , Ginger , a respiratory therapist , into staying home with the kids .
But he also wants assurances that his hunting ground wo n’t be sullied by drilling , because for a sportsman like him , some things are more precious than mailbox money .

“ They ’re not going to leave me with a big mudhole when they ’re gone , ” Moreno said before stepping out for a night of ‘ coon hunting with an old pal .
“ I ’m going to make sure I do this right . ”

miguel.bustillo@latimes.com
Note – this article dates from 2005 .
I tried the ‘ lens ’ on my subsequent 1Ds mk3 ( 21 MP ) and as expected , the files were bigger , and that ’s about it …
In 2015 I ’ve a 50 MP 5 Ds – perhaps time for another look .
Basics of the pinhole camera
The original camera — probably first noted a very long time ago when someone saw an inverted view of the world outside cast onto a wall through a hole in a window shutter .
For distant objects the optimum radius of the pinhole is approximately equal to the square root of the product of the wavelength of the light and the distance from the pinhole to the sensor .
Thus for d=50 mm and a wavelength of light of 550nm we get a pinhole radius of 0.165 mm or a diameter of 1/3rd mm .
For a 200 mm distance to film we need a hole of 2 /3rds mm .
Both sizes quite easy to make , but you may need several attempts to get a good clean circular hole .
A poorly shaped hole will introduce noticeable loss of quality in the image .
For those of you wanting to delve into a bit more detail on the principles behind pinhole and pinspeck cameras , there is an excellent article at :
http://www.wesjones.com /pinhole.htm .
Basic pinhole adapter for a digital SLR
As ever , tinker with expensive cameras at your own risk !
Now comes the expensive part ( apart from the ~ £ 5000 I paid for the 1Ds body ) — £ 3 for a replacement camera body cap .
A small hole was made in the centre of the body cap with a scalpel blade .
Not a very small hole ( ~0.9 mm ) .
The picture is taken on my desk with sunlight coming in through a gap in the curtains .
You can see an image of the Sun on the desk .
The Mk1 pinhole lens .
Pinhole to focal plane is about 50 mm .
Dust is always a problem with digital SLRs so a Lens Cap was made from Blu - Tack
The image quality was rather poor and blurred .
Not entirely unexpected , so I looked at a better way to get a pinhole .
A better digital pinhole SLR
By enlarging the hole in the plastic cap , you can use a better material for the pinhole .
Paper backed sticky Aluminium foil tape is very good and can easily be replaced .
Thicker foil ( take - away food containers ) is good but needs glueing .
Several guides on the web suggest that very thin brass sheet is best , but there was none in the tool cupboard / kitchen .
The hole in the body cap is enlarged to about 1 cm and covered with Aluminium tape .
The hole was made with a fine sewing needle .
Note the image of the Sun is dimmer than the first pinhole in the plastic .
After several tries I got a good sized pinhole and took the camera outside .
A reduced version of the 4064×2704 image produced from a 1Ds ‘ raw ’ file .
1 second exposure at ISO 200 ( manual setting , exposure optimised via camera histogram )
The image after a bit of processing .
Note how the original image is very soft but benefits from a bit of image processing in Photoshop
This is a sample of the original image at full resolution .
It shows dust on the sensor quite nicely but is not quite as good as the original 16 bit uncompressed file ( it ’s a JPEG )
The processing steps were :
Convert from raw using Adobe Camera Raw ( using exposure and shadows to set levels )
Use the Focus Magic plugin to reduce blur ( Keith has written a review of Focus Magic on this site )
Use the Photoshop ‘ Shadows and Highlights ’ tool to give the picture a bit more punch .
Reduce the image to the size above ( using the Bicubic Sharper method )
Convert to 8 bit mode and sRGB colour space ( from Adobe 98 )
Sharpen with Unsharp Mask for web use .
Save for web with no included icc profile at a medium quality setting .
The last three steps are really there to optimise the picture quality on the web .
Excellent depth of field and no distortion .
There is so little light coming into the camera that the viewfinder is pretty useless .
It took quite a few shots to get this one of the ugly cars outside my house .
It is worth trying a number of different pinhole sizes since the increase in resolution with smaller holes is offset by diffraction effects .
Using the aluminium tape allowed several different pinholes to be pre-prepared .
The home made 200 mm lens
The lens cap pinhole gives a focal length of 50 mm , how about something a little longer , and zoom too ?
Two toilet paper tubes for the zoom lens .
The centre of the lens cap is cut out and glued into the second tube ( hot melt glue is excellent for this )
Some of the aluminium tape ensures that the end is light proof A spray of black paint inside and out keeps light reflection at a minimum and also stops dust from the cardboard rubbing off and getting into the camera .
Be sure to mask the actual camera mount from paint .
The 1Ds with its 200 mm pinhole lens .
The 200 mm seemed a lot more dependent on a good quality pinhole , and also susceptible to light coming through the viewfinder .
The first attempts showed considerable vignetting , which turned out to be stray light .
The 1Ds has a viewfinder shutter to stop this .
You could use a black cloth if need be .
The raw images is fairly blurred as before .
13 seconds exposure at ISO 100 A sharpened version , after processing .
There was traffic at the end of the road ( where the bus is in the shot below ) but the long exposure loses it .
The expensive version — is it really worth it ?
Well it can be …
The 1Ds with its Canon EF 70-200 2.8L IS zoom lens .
Note that since I mostly use this lens hand held , its tripod mount has been removed .
If you need sharper pictures , faster f-ratios and a slightly more ‘ Pro ’ look .
Inset is a detail at full resolution showing the increase in resolution that you get for around £ 1400 .
( Note that this image is a medium res JPEG file )
This lens and the 16 - 35 mm 2.8L are my most used lenses .
The image stabilisation feature lets me regularly take shots hand - held at 1/50th sec .
The moon is about half a degree across and is a critical test of any lens , particularly against a dark sky .
The moon – Canon lens Inset shows full frame .
The Moon – Keith ’s much cheaper lens Both images sharpened
I ’ve a good example of the quality of this lens in part two of my article looking at the DXO Pro raw conversion and lens correction software ( off - axis detail )
Note that the link is to the very first version of DxO Optics Pro with RAW support – there are reviews of all newer versions .
Conclusions
I was very surprised at the quality I got out of the 50 mm version after a bit of image processing .
The Focus Magic plugin worked wonders and I discovered that the Photoshop ‘ Shadows and Highlights ’ tool can make appreciable differences to soft images even when set at 1 % for the shadows .
The smaller pinhole of the 50 mm version seems to produce pictures that are easier to process for sharp results .
This may be due to the amount of blur just being too much to easily correct from the larger 200 mm pinhole , or it could be that the larger hole was not so good quality as the smaller one .
The pinhole lens is certainly lighter to carry around , although the need for a tripod and 15 second exposures might affect its usefulness in some areas ( wildlife / photojournalism ) .
I ’m not sure if I ’d have got better results painting the outside of the 200 mm pinhole adapter white like the 70 - 200 , but I ’m sure the red stripe helped a bit … :-)
Just because I do photography for a living does n’t mean it ca n’t still be fun !
" it was nice to actually see the see the two gentlemen standing there having to be accountable for either the accusations they 've made about the other , or statements they 've made about their own voting history and really have to look the other person in the eye and defend those things ... "
YouTube video of Elisabeth Hasselbeck on Huckabee 's FOX show
Either Elisabeth lied about seeing the debate or she is even denser than we feared .
Either option does not bode well for her and it's also obvious that she cannot have spent much time discussing the debate with many people since McCain 's failure to ever look at Obama was so very glaring .
Huckabee was wise to not include her in any of his serious show discussions with grownups and I have to give him credit for exposing the bailout farce but I was only watching when commercials interrupted the show House and I also saw the end of Huckabee , which was a musical performance by perhaps the worst band ever to appear on television , with Huckabee on bass .
Yikes !
Sam Stein at Huff Post :
“ At the end of the day , there ’s a lot of people thinking about how to rebuild this party , ” said strategist Ed Rollins on CNN , “ and do we want to rebuild it with John McCain , who ’s always kind of questionable on the basic facts of fiscal control , all the rest of it , immigration .
And I think to a certain extent this 110 , 115 members of this study group are saying , here ’s the time to draw the line in the sand . ”
“ That ’s pretty scary stuff that they ’re thinking about party right now and not country , is that what you ’re saying ? ” responded host Anderson Cooper .
“ I think they ’re , yes , they ’re thinking about themselves , ” said Rollins .
“ I think they do n’t think that the threat is as great as a lot of other people do . ”
ISPs have been throttling BitTorrent traffic for years now , but only recently has this turned into a political issue .
In a huge victory for BitTorrent users , the FCC has now announced that it will order Comcast to stop interfering with BitTorrent traffic .
Almost a year ago we first reported that Comcast was actively disconnecting BitTorrent seeds .
Now , after numerous debates and false promises from Comcast , the FCC has ruled that Comcast ’s BitTorrent interference is unacceptable , and orders the company to stop doing so .
Kevin Martin , FCC chairman told AP that Comcast ’s BitTorrent throttling is “ arbitrary ” , and that the company had violated the principles of the Federal Communications Commission .
Martin said that Comcast slows down BitTorrent users independent of the amount of traffic they use , and that the company failed to communicate their network management practices to their consumers .
Indeed , a recent study by the Max Planck Institute showed that the company had misinformed the FCC and their users .
Comcast has always argued that BitTorrent upstream traffic was only blocked during periods of heavy network traffic , this turns out to be a lie , as the study showed that they blocked BitTorrent upstream traffic 24/7 .
The FCC has announced that it will take appropriate action against Comcast , and the ISP will be ordered to stop interfering with BitTorrent traffic .
Comcast has said before that it will invest in its network capacity and stop slowing down the traffic of their users , but these were all false promises .
Marvin Ammori , general counsel of Free Press who filed the complaint with the FCC is delighted with this outcome , and said in a response : “ Nine months ago , Comcast was exposed for blocking free choice on the Internet .
At every turn , Comcast has denied blocking , lied to the public and tried to avoid being held accountable .
We have presented an open and shut case that Comcast broke the law . ”
“ The FCC now appears ready to take action on behalf of consumers .
This is an historic test for whether the law will protect the open Internet .
If the commission decisively rules against Comcast , it will be a remarkable victory for organized people over organized money , ” Ammori added .
It is to be expected that – if the pipes are really congested – Comcast and other ISPs will have to step away from the all - you - can - eat plans they have been offering for years , now that people are actually using bandwidth they signed up for .
You may have read about Manhunt . net founders Larry Basile and Jonathan Crutchley ( above right ) in Michael Joseph Gross ’ OUT article entitled “ Has Manhunt Destroyed Gay Culture ? ”
Crutchley ’s political leanings are pointed out near the beginning of the piece :
“ Crutchley , a liberal Republican with a tight white beard , admits that he felt anxious during Manhunt ’s first years , before his and Basile ’s initial investment of $ 800,000 bore fruit .
Now , seated at his desk and surrounded by giant photographs of body builders ’ glutes , Crutchley says the company brings in at least $ 2.4 million per month — almost $ 30 million a year — not counting ad revenues , and prospects for growth are strong .
Manhunt ’s success measures the extent to which online cruising has changed gay urban social life .
Is it changing gay politics too ? ”
Crutchley ’s right - leaning ways have been reported on before , in the Huffington Post , which reported on a contribution he made to the McCain campaign .
Last week , Crutchley defended his contribution in the comments section of an April 2007 interview ( which he apparently monitors ) with Online Personals Watch :
And here ’s the amount , via Open Secrets :
It appears John McCain has accepted the maximum individual campaign donation from the owner of America ’s largest gay sex hook - up website .
UPDATE :
After one of our irate readers emailed Manhunt informing them that they had cancelled their account , he received the following email from the company :
***
Dear Sir ,
We are always happy to hear from our members , thank you for taking the time to
express your concerns .
The subject that you have brought to our attention is a personal matter and is
not representative of MANHUNT .
We thank you for your understanding .
Sincerely , Team MANHUNT

( CNN ) --
One sixth of the world 's population does not have access to clean drinking water .
More than 2 million people , most of them children , die each year from water - borne diseases .
People in India , where millions do n't have access to clean drinking water , fill buckets from a supply pipeline .
Water - related problems are n't restricted to the developing world .
A harmful pesticide , banned by many European countries , remains widely used in the United States , where it runs into rivers and streams .
And one expert estimates California 's water supply will run out in 20 years .
These sobering statistics come from " FLOW , " a new documentary film about the world 's dwindling water supply .
The filmmakers and their sources argue a combination of factors , including drought and skyrocketing demand , have created a looming global crisis that threatens the long - term survival of the human race .
After premiering in January at the Sundance Film Festival , " FLOW " opened September 12 in New York and Los Angeles , California , and expands to more cities this week .
The New York Times called the documentary " less depressing than galvanizing , an informed and heartfelt examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests . "
As the film shows , some nations are banking on controversial technology , such as desalination plants that convert seawater into freshwater , to meet future water needs .
Meanwhile , water has become a commodity that supports a $ 400 billion global industry -- the third largest behind electricity and oil .
CNN spoke to " FLOW " director Irena Salina and Maude Barlow , author of " Blue Covenant : The Global Water Crisis and the Coming Battle for the Right to Water . "
Some of their answers have been condensed .
CNN : Why do we have a global water crisis ?
Barlow :
The demand for fresh water in our world over the next 30 years is far outstripping the supply .
Not that the water is n't somewhere on the planet still -- but we have polluted it , diverted it , allowed it to get poisoned by seawater .
One way or another , we have taken accessible clean water ... and we have rendered it unusable .
We take massive amounts [ of water ] and we irrigate the desert , where it evaporates .
We 're pumping groundwater all over the world far faster that it can be replenished by nature .
We are actually running out of fresh , clean water everywhere in the world , including here in North America .
We have to give up this myth of abundance .
We have come to the limits of the planet .
Is climate change exacerbating the problem ?
Barlow : Oh , yes .
They are intricately linked .
Global warming warms up massive bodies of water , which evaporate more quickly than they should .
Warming is melting all the glaciers in the world .
So there 's no question that greenhouse gas - induced climate change is impacting water .
Your film illustrates how in some parts of the world , the public water supply is now controlled by corporations .
What 's wrong with privatization of water ?
Barlow :
When you have a demand that 's growing exponentially , and a supply that 's decreasing exponentially , then whoever makes the decisions around water suddenly becomes very important .
Private corporations have decided that this is more important than oil .
They 're going to make more money and become more powerful owning and distributing water than they can from anything else .
All of these [ corporate ] practices mean ... the poor of the world do n't have access to [ affordable ] clean water .
The film raises an important question :
Is water a commodity , like oil , or is it a common natural resource ?
Barlow :
That 's the essential question , and until we get that straight in the world , we 're going to continue to have these conflicts .
And there are going to be [ more ] conflicts as the big superpowers seek new water sources outside their borders .
There are conflicts , obviously , between the needs of humans and nature .
We 're taking more than our share .
We argue that if you ask the question , ' Who owns water ? ' the answer is that nobody owns it .
It belongs to the earth .
It belongs to all species .
It belongs to future generations .
It 's a public trust and a human right .
The World Bank says it 's not a human right , it 's a human need -- and therefore the private sector can provide this just as well as the public sector .
However , we say that ... you can't deny somebody water because they can't pay for it .
And we 're working right now towards a covenant at the United Nations that would declare water a human right .
My country , Canada , and your country , the United States , are both in opposition to this .
There 's a place for [ desalination and recycling ] technology , and there 's a place even for the private sector , but it will all have to fit into the larger twin goals of conservation and source protection on one hand , and justice and equity on the other .
Those are the twin foundations of a water - secure future .
There will be no human future on this planet unless we get our act together .
If we 're facing a water crisis , how do we fix it ?
Salina :
If world leaders , the international finance institutions , the U.N. and other governmental organizations really wanted to solve the problems related to water , they would take immediate action at the national and international levels .
We would see a U.N. treaty that guarantees people sufficient potable water .
We would see the G8 nations step up and provide resources for the provision of water to the urban and rural poor .
If our own leaders were serious about solving problems , we would not allow corporations to discharge pollutants into our water sources .
And if they were serious about solving water problems -- instead of spending billions on developing technologies that clean up pollution -- we would be using resources to prevent water pollution in the first place .
It will take political will .
It will also take efforts on our part as individuals and communities .
What do you hope your film accomplishes ?
Salina :
The film is a first step to bring some awareness .
You plant the seed of awareness , then action can take place .
People deeply , passionately care about their water .
It 's not like Americans do n't care .
But they need to have the tools [ to get involved ] .
A year from now [ we hope ] that maybe people will look at water differently .
It 's coming , drop by drop .
That 's how we make change .
All About Clean Water Policy • United Nations • Global Climate Change
From the bill itself :
( a) Authority to Purchase .
-- The Secretary is authorized to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase , on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary , mortgage - related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States .
( b ) Necessary Actions .-- The Secretary is authorized to take such actions as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out the authorities in this Act , including , without limitation : ( 1 ) appointing such employees as may be required to carry out the authorities in this Act and defining their duties ; ( 2 ) entering into contracts , including contracts for services authorized by section 3109 of title 5 , United States Code , without regard to any other provision of law regarding public contracts ; ( 3 ) designating financial institutions as financial agents of the Government , and they shall perform all such reasonable duties related to this Act as financial agents of the Government as may be required of them ; ( 4 ) establishing vehicles that are authorized , subject to supervision by the Secretary , to purchase mortgage - related assets and issue obligations ; and ( 5 ) issuing such regulations and other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to define terms or carry out the authorities of this Act .
So essentially the Treasury Secretary can buy any assets he wants on any terms he likes , he can hire anyone he wants to do it , and he can write any kind of regulation he wants .
The Treasury Secretary is now essentially in charge of oversight of the Treasury Secretary , and Congress is abdicating once again its own oversight powers , only getting a report from the Treasury Secretary twice a year .
Again , from the language of the Bill :
Within three months of the first exercise of the authority granted in section 2 ( a ) , and semiannually thereafter , the Secretary shall report to the Committees on the Budget , Financial Services , and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committees on the Budget , Finance , and Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs of the Senate with respect to the authorities exercised under this Act and the considerations required by section 3 .
Then comes the excessively scary paragraph :
Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
As Adam Davidson says :
Whoa .
So , for the next three months , and then an additional six months after that , the Treasury Secretary can do anything he deems appropriate without anybody anywhere looking it over .
That seems like an awful lot of absolute power .
To which I add , No Shit .
While a bailout is needed of the financial sector this bill seems to also constitute a massive and dangerous power grab by the Executive Branch of this country .
Particularly since the Congress seems to be abdicating its own oversight duties and precluding the Court System from being able to intervene as well .
Okay , and I say this as someone who realizes some kind of bail out is necessary , WHOA !
Time to slow it down Democratic Congress .
Think before passing this legislation .
No one in a government should be allowed this much power with this little oversight .

Writing in part about this bail out :
University of Southern California engineer Behrokh Khoshnevis and colleagues are developing a 3D printer for houses .
Called Contour Crafting , the system spits out layers of concrete to build a structure from the bottom up .
Caterpillar is sponsoring Khoshnevis 's research .
From the Contour Crafting page :
Contour Crafting technology has great potential for automating the construction of whole structures as well as sub-components .
Using this process , a single house or a colony of houses , each with possibly a different design , may be automatically constructed in a single run , embedded in each house all the conduits for electrical , plumbing and air - conditioning .
The potential applications of this technology are far reaching including but not limited to applications in emergency , low - income , and commercial housing .
Our research also addresses the application of Contour Crafting in building habitats on other planets .
Contour Crafting will most probably be one of the very few feasible approaches for building structures on other planets , such as the Moon and Mars , which are being targeted for human colonization before the end of the new century .

This puzzle was given to me by John H. Conway , and he heard it from someone else :
Find a ten - digit number with all distinct digits such that the string formed by the first k digits is divisible by k for any k ≤ 10 .
Surprisingly , there is a unique solution to this puzzle .
Can you find this very special ten - digit number ?
For the contrast , consider ten - digit numbers with all distinct digits such that the string formed by the last k digits is divisible by k for any k ≤ 10 .
These numbers are not so special : there are 202 of them .
My puzzle is : find the smallest not - so - special number .

Expert : Iran strike would cause ' serious depression ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday October 2 , 2008
Print This Email
This A former CIA agent and expert on Iran offered a grim assessment on Tuesday of American options in dealing with that nation , saying that " sanctions have failed , " surgical strikes will lead to unacceptable retaliation against US interests , but a conventional war and invasion would " look like World War III . "
Robert Baer is the author of a new book , The Devil We Know : Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower , which argues that Iran has already become the leading power in the Middle East and the United States has no choice but to negotiate with it .
" [ The Iranians ] called Bush 's bluff , " Baer told Fox News 's Brian Kilmeade .
" The Israelis are preparing for an attack .
...
Could be early first quarter of next year . "
Baer said that Israel has been pressing the US for a go - ahead and support in bombing Iran 's nuclear facilities , but " Bush said no " to outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
" It can not be a surgical strike , " Baer explained , because " they are going to retaliate .
They , the Iranians , are going to hit Saudi oil facilities , they 're going to hit tankers , they 're going to hit our troops in Iraq .
...
They 're going to take off 17 million barrels of oil a day in the Gulf . "
" That 'll push us into a serious depression , " Baer emphasized .
" This is what Bush told Olmert .
He said , ' You do that and we 're going to feel it in Iraq and Afghanistan . ' "
Baer explained further that " conventional war , we could destroy the country in a matter of minutes -- but the point is , it 's going to look like World War III . "
" I think we have to sit down and see if a deal can be cut , " Baer concluded soberly , " because a big war , again , it would be nothing like Iraq . "
An earlier book by Baer , See No Evil , was the basis for the movie Syriana , and George Clooney won an Oscar for playing a character based on the former agent .
The central argument of The Devil We Know is that " Iran , far from being a wild - eyed rogue state , is a rational actor -- one skilled in the game of nations .
...
For U.S. policy makers , the choices have narrowed .
...
We might just find that in allying with Iran , well have increased not just our own security but that of all Middle East nations . "

Energy drinks are the jivest things on Earth .
Just drinking one of them automatically suggests you are weak .
Because you are basically telling everyone in the world , “ Life is too hard for me .
I just ca n’t make it through a day without feeling sleepy .
So because I need help , I ’ve decided to drink two or three cans of a fruity , carbonated beverage every day . ”
I mean come on , seriously , is your life so goddamn tiring that you need to drink a 20 oz .
Monster just so you can function as a normal human being ?
Really ?
Now , I ’m not saying that these energy drinks do n’t work .
They do , sometimes all too well .
There is truth to the advertising of energy drinks .
I once drank a can of Rock Star and had to snort some blow just to level off .
I ’m not arguing their effectiveness .
I ’m arguing that drinking them all the time makes you an addict .
And if you ’re going to be addicted to something , you might as well be addicted to something cool … like heroin .
Parts of the problem with energy drinks are the names .
These companies try so hard to be “ cutting edge ” and “ in your face ” with their brands .
“ Amp ” , “ Rage ” , “ Wired ” , “ Edge ” , “ Steven Seagal ’s Lightning Bolt ” ( okay , this one sounds cool and I would drink it regularly out of sheer admiration for Mr. Seagal ’s work in “ Above the Law ” ) .
I get it .
Your beverage is hardcore .
Good for you .
Why not tell the truth and call your energy drink , “ Shitty Tasting Beverage For Assholes To Hype Them Up And Make Them Even More Of An Asshole ” .
Because here ’s the thing : being tired is a part of life .
It ’s called being an adult .
Life only gets harder as you get older , and no amount of Red Bull is going to make it any better .
And the last thing you want is to be in your thirties , running around all jacked up on Vamp NRG .
That ’s just sad .
So the next time you find that living on this planet is too taxing for you , do what real men do : go to the bathroom , jerk off , and get on with your day .
How to Copyright Music
Article by David Nevue - Updated March 2010
Back to Internet Music Promotion 101
How Do I Copyright My Music ?
That 's a question I get asked a lot here at the Music Biz Academy .
And so , I decided I might as well write a formal article about it .
I discuss the issue in detail in my book , How to Promote Your Music Successfully on the Internet , so I 've more or less included an excerpt from that here .
So here we go ...
Why Copyright My Music ?
If you see yourself as a serious musician ( and I presume you do ) , you would be wise to register your original songs with the U.S. Copyright Office ( if you reside outside of the U.S. , skip to the section on International Copyright below ) .
This will protect you in the event that someone , somewhere , steals one of your songs and claims it as their own .
Whether you want to copyright just one song for possible digital distribution or an entire CD of collected works , the process is the same .
The eCO Online System
The U.S. Copyright Office encourages you to register your music via an online registration process called the eCO Online System .
Once you go there , create an account for yourself , then log in and you re ready to start .
Registering a copyright via this process is not all that difficult , but the technical language can be confusing .
The online process does walk you step - by - step through filling out the document , but even so , take your time .
Carefully read the help links ( the underlined text ) provided each step of the way .
If you do that , it will help you understand what information goes where .
Youll find a copyright tutorial for the eCO system at http://www.copyright.gov/eco/eco-tutorial.pdf .
I recommend you take a look at that before you undertake this process to see what you re in for .
The filing fee for online song registration is $ 35 .
A few tips regarding the eCO process that I think might help you :
Youll want to register your music as a " sound recording " as this kind of registration includes not only the performance , but the underlying music itself .
Under " Title of Work " add the name of your CD first and set the " Type " as " Title of work being registered . "
Then list your song titles and set the " Type " for those as " Contents Title . "
So the album name is the " Title , " the individual songs are the " Contents . "
If you have cover songs on your album , youll exclude those under the " Limitation of Claim " section .
For example , if track 7 on your CD is a cover tune , under " Material Excluded " check the boxes for " Music " and " Lyrics " ( if you have lyrics ) and then in the space for " Other " indicate " Track 7 . "
Then under " New Material Included " check all the boxes and under " Other " list the track numbers for your original songs .
So here you specify what tracks to exclude for copyright registration ( because they belong to someone else ) and which tracks to register under your own name .
If all the songs on your album are original , you can skip this section entirely .
Once you have filled out the form and verified all your information , add it toyour cart , pay for it , and then youll receive an email with instructions on how to print out your registration and mail it in with copies of your CD .
You can also upload the files digitally , if you prefer .
If you dont wish to go through the online process , you can type all of your information in Form CO , print it out and mail it in .
And youll find instructions for Form CO at http://www.copyright.gov/forms/formco2d-ins.pdf .
Fill out the PDF file following the instructions and then print TWO copies .
One copy for yourself , and one copy to mail to the Library of Congress to the address provided .
The cost to submit the form by mail is $ 50.00 .
Either way you go , whether online or via mail , it will take six months to a year for the Library of Congress to process your registration .
However , once youve submitted your work , you re officially protected .
If you use FedEx to send your copyright forms ( which I suggest you do ) , keep your tracking number handy and you can present this as legal proof of your effective date of copyright registration should you ever need it .
What Does Copyright Registration Do for Me ?
Well , if someone does steal your work , not only can you prove the work is yours by your registration , but you can also sue for damages ( you cant legally sue for damages if your song is nt registered with the copyright office ) .
If the copyright infringement is determined to be deliberate , your attorney can initiate a formal criminal investigation .
Registering your songs ' copyright grants you these exclusive rights :
The right to make copies and duplicate your CD
The right to distribute your music
The right to prepare derivative works ( alternate versions , new arrangements )
The right to perform the songs publicly
The right to display the product publicly
The right to perform publicly via digital audio transmission
Once youve registered your sound recording ( your CD ) with the U.S. copyright office , these rights belong exclusively to you and you alone ( provided , of course , that you are the actual copyright owner ) .
No one can take those rights from you .
Once your song is registered , you no longer have to worry about someone stealing your song idea and taking credit for it .
If someone does that , gets a hit out of it and you can prove the song is yours with your registered copyright , you are going to smile all the way to the bank when the court awards you damages , which can be very high for copyright theft .
How to Copyright Individual Digital Creations
What if you only want to copyright a single song ( or video , or photo , or article , or blog or whatever ) to prove its yours ?
See http://www.myfreecopyright.com/ .
At this web site you can upload your digital files , be they music , video , pictures or whatever , and they are instantly copyrighted and you can prove the date / time of registration .
The service is free , and its a very simple way to copyright your individual music creations .
Just so you know , however , even though you can use this digital copyright in a court of law to prove infringement , you cannot collect statutory damages from the infringer .
You can collect lost profits that might be determined , but not statutory damages which is generally where the big money comes from .
To collect statutory damages , you still need to send in a registration form into the copyright office as stated above .
What About Creative Commons ?
There is an alternative means by which you may copyright your work called Creative Commons ( http://www.creativecommons.org ) .
Basically what this does is create a copyright for your music whereby instead of all rights being reserved , only some rights are reserved .
This invites others to use your work for certain purposes without having to get permission from you first .
In theory , this means people searching for music to use in their products or digital creations are more likely to use your music if they dont have to jump through a lot of legal hoops to make use of it .
So , for example , you might allow a song to be used in a non-commercial product ( ie. no financial profit for the distributor ) without forcing the licensee to get permission from you , but still reserve the right to collect a royalty if the product in question is a money - maker .
The Creative Commons copyright is still a rather new concept , and there are many variations on it that may make the concert confusing for the potential licensee .
Even so , it is something to at least be aware of if the concept becomes more widely recognized and accepted .
For a list of the different Creative Commons licenses available , see http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses
What About International Copyright ?
If you are not a citizen of the United States , obviously the comments above do not apply to you as every country handles the copyright process a bit differently .
However , chances are that your homeland is a member of the World Intellection Property Organization ( WIPO ) .
If so , you can start researching your copyright options at http://www.wipo.int/members/en/ .
Select your country name from the WIPO list , follow the contact information link , and that will take you to a page that lists the web site address of the copyright office for your country .

How to ... Master the Coital Alignment Technique
Sometime in the early '90s , a sexologist by the name of Edward Eichel claimed he had discovered a brand new way to do it that guaranteed simultaneous orgasms in the missionary position every time !
Obviously he had a rather exaggerated sense of his own accomplishment ( otherwise he would have won a Nobel , or at least had a very large building named after him ) -- but the Coital Alignment Technique ( C.A.T. ) certainly has a lot going for it .
The basic idea is to provide clitoral stimulation during genital intercourse .
It 's a toughie to master -- it sounds more like calculus than copulation when you try to describe its ins and outs .
Beyond just following the specific steps below , mastering the C.A.T. requires a philosophical readjustment .
Abandon your assumptions that intercourse automatically means a piston - like motion , lots of flailing about , and a rush to climax .
For the C.A.T. , you 've got to take what some might call a more " feminine " approach to sex : think small subtle movements , full - body contact with a focus on the clitoris and the pelvic mounds , and a Buddhist - like repetition of steps that may very well get her closer to Zen ( i.e. orgasm ) than any other hands - free intercourse position out there .
After the jump , 5 steps to letting the C.A.T. out of the bag ...

The basic idea is to provide clitoral stimulation during genital intercourse .
It 's a toughie to master -- it sounds more like calculus than copulation when you try to describe its ins and outs .
Beyond just following the specific steps below , mastering the C.A.T. requires areadjustment .
Abandon your assumptions that intercourse automatically means a piston - like motion , lots of flailing about , and a rush to climax .
For the C.A.T. , you 've got to take what some might call a more " feminine " approach to sex : think small subtle movements , full - body contact with a focus on the clitoris and the pelvic mounds , and a Buddhist - like repetition of steps that may very well get her closer to Zen ( i.e. orgasm ) than any other hands - free intercourse position out there .
After the jump , 5 steps to letting the C.A.T. out of the bag ...
1. Start off in the basic missionary : she 's lying on her back with her legs just outside his ; he 's inside her with his legs very close together .
In order to initiate penetration most easily , his upper body should be raised a bit and his pelvis may be a bit lower than hers ( i.e. a bit further down her body ) and between her legs .
This is a great position for the typical in - out , but once penetration has occurred , you must kiss this stance goodbye if you want to successfully achieve the C.A.T .
2 . Here 's where the crucial alignment takes place : he cups her shoulders with his arms under her armpits so that he 's resting on her ( some of his weight can be on his forearms , but he should maintain as much body contact and pressure as is comfortable for her ) .
While keeping his penis inside her , he pulls his body up along hers , toward her head , so that their pelvises are aligned ( his directly on top of hers ) .
His legs are straight and together , and her ankles are resting on his calves ( her legs should be as straight and elongated as possible while wrapped around his lower legs ; if it feels better she can try laying them straight on the bed right up against his legs ) .
In this position , his head ( the one on his shoulders ) is beside her head ( to one side of her face ) .
His penile head should still be inserted , though much of the shaft will now be outside of the vaginal canal , pressing up against the top half of her external genitalia .
Both spines should be as straight as possible .
His upper body should be relaxed .
3 . While in position # 2 , as he 's pushing up along her body , she tips her pelvis away from him ( down into the bed ) so his penis comes almost all the way out and she can feel its base pressing against her clitoris .
It 's a very small , subtle movement -- you do n't want the penis to fully withdraw from the vagina .
4 . Next , he pushes down with his pelvis so his whole body moves lower down her body and his penis enters her fully , while she tilts her hips up to help envelop him .
He 's still lying on her ( some of his weight on his forearms , but he should maintain full body contact ) .
Their legs are still as straight as possible , hers still wrapped around his lower legs ( or as low as possible in this position ) -- her aim is to keep her upper thighs and knees close together rather than bent and opened like a flower ( as in more traditional positions ) .
The difference in his pelvis position between step 3 and this one is only about 4 inches ( so in step 3 , his pelvis is directly above hers ; in this step it's about 4 inches lower down her body and his pelvis is closer to the bed , tipped at an angle and between her legs ) .
Still with us ?
5 . Now , you simply repeat this hip - rocking movement over and over again : he moves up as she tips down , he moves down as she tilts up , and so on .
Do not speed up -- that 's so macho .
The goal is to maintain a constant pressure and rubbing against the area from her pubic bone down to her vaginal opening ( with the clitoris in between , of course ) with his penile shaft , his own pubic bone , and the weight of his body .
If you get it right and get into a groove , you might not be able to tell where one of you ends and the other begins .
To put it more bluntly , you 'll feel like you 're fucking and being fucked at the same time .
Some of the above can be found in our books The Big Bang and Sex : How to Do Everything .

Two and a half years ago , Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne penned an editorial for The Wall Street Journal , warning that widespread stock manipulation schemes - including abusive naked short selling - were threatening the health of America 's financial markets .
But it was n't published .
" An editor at The Journal asked me to write it , and I told him he would n't be allowed to publish it , " Byrne says .
" He insisted that only he controlled what was printed on the editorial page , so I wrote it .
Then , after a few days , he got back to me and said ' It appears I ca n't run this or anything else you write . ' "
The Journal never changed its stance .
But last week , the editorial finally saw the light of day at Forbes - after Byrne added a few paragraphs explaining that naked shorting had hastened what could turn out to be the biggest financial crisis since The Great Depression .
With a traditional short sale , traders borrow shares and sell them in the hope that prices will drop .
A naked short works much the same way - except the shares are n't actually borrowed .
They 're sold but not delivered .
By the middle of the summer , these unresolved " stock IOUs " - as Byrne calls them - were pilling up in four Wall Street giants already struggling to stay afloat : investment banks Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch and mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
On July 12 , the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an emergency order banning naked shorts in a host of major stocks , and all four of those names were on the list .
Patrick Byrne
The order expired in mid-August , and in the weeks since , Lehman Brothers has filed for bankruptcy , Merrill Lynch vanished into Bank of America , and Fannie and Freddie were seized by the US government .
Then , on September 17 , the SEC issued a new order meant to curb naked shorting of all stocks .
" These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling , " read a statement from SEC chairman Christopher Cox .
" The Enforcement Division , the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations , and the Division of Trading and Markets will now have these weapons in their arsenal in their continuing battle to stop unlawful manipulation . "
In the wake of the SEC 's crackdown , the mainstream financial press has acknowledged that widespread and deliberate naked shorting can artificially deflate stock prices , flooding the market with what amounts to counterfeit shares .
But for years ,
The Journal and so many other news outlets ignored Byrne 's warnings , with some journalists - most notably a Forbes.com columnist and former BusinessWeek reporter named Gary Weiss - painting the Overstock CEO as a raving madman .
Byrne has long argued that the press dismissed his views at least in part because Weiss - hiding behind various anonymous accounts - spent years controlling the relevant articles on Wikipedia , the " free online encyclopedia anyone can edit . "
" At some level , you can control the public discourse from Wikipedia , " Byrne says .
" No matter what journalists say about the reliability of Wikipedia , they still use it as a resource .
I have no doubt that journalists who I discussed [ naked shorting ] with decided not to do stories after reading Wikipedia - whose treatment [ of naked short selling ] was completely divorced from reality . "
As recently as last week , Weiss told us he 's never even edited Wikipedia .
But emails shared with Byrne and The Register show that Weiss has in fact edited the encyclopedia 's article on naked shorting .
And they indicate he 's behind an infamous Wikipedia account known as " Mantanmoreland , " an account that - with the backing of the site 's brain trust - ruled the articles on naked shorting , Patrick Byrne , and Overstock from January 2006 to March 2008 .
A single Wikipedia edit also links the Mantanmoreland account to a PC inside the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) .
Owned by Wall Street investment banks that may have benefited from naked shorting schemes , the DTCC oversees the delivery of stocks on Wall Street .

Antidepressants were linked to DNA damage in sperm Drugs taken by millions of men to alleviate depression may affect their fertility , say US scientists .
A small number of healthy men given the antidepressant paroxetine for four weeks had far higher levels of sperm with damaged DNA .
The results , reported in New Scientist magazine , do not necessarily mean these men would have serious problems becoming a father .
However , a UK fertility specialist said they were a " cause for concern " .
We would be worried if this study caused patients to stop their treatment and would urge anyone with concerns to consult their doctor
Marjorie Wallace
Sane Paroxetine , sold as Seroxat or Paxil , is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants in the UK .
This is the second study by a team of researchers at Cornell Medical Center in New York which points to a possible effect on sperm quality .
They recruited 35 healthy volunteers who provided sperm samples before and during paroxetine treatment .
Under the microscope , there appeared to be not much difference between the " before " and " after " samples , with the shape and movement of sperm apparently normal in both samples .
However , tests on " DNA fragmentation " produced a different result .
Some sperm with DNA problems can be found in every sample , and 13.8 % of sperm cells in those produced before treatment were found to be fragmented .
However , at the four week mark , this had risen to 30.3 % .
A key question is whether this change would be enough to affect overall fertility , or whether the remaining 70 % of unaffected sperm would be enough to produce a viable pregnancy .
In couples undergoing IVF , studies have found that couples where the man 's sperm has higher levels of DNA damage produce fewer embryos , and their embryos are less likely to implant successfully in the womb .
More work needed Dr Allan Pacey , senior lecturer in Andrology at the University of Sheffield , said that while there had been " sporadic reports " that antidepressants could affect semen quality , more research would be needed to help scientists evaluate the risk .
" The apparent increase in sperm DNA damage is alarming , although the level at which we think the damage becomes clinically significant is controversial to many scientists .
" It is a shame that the authors appear not to have conducted a randomised controlled trial which would be the most scientific way to investigate the drugs effects , but I agree that the results are of concern and need to be investigated further . "
They are powerful drugs , so in a sense it is no surprise that research is discovering more about their impact on the body
Dr Andrew McCulloch
Mental Health Foundation
The drug 's maker , GlaxoSmithKline said it intended to review the study 's findings .
Marjorie Wallace , from the mental health charity Sane , said that patients should wait for larger studies : " While these results may be worrying for people taking antidepressants who hope to conceive , it is important to note that this is a preliminary study with a small sample group .
" We would be worried if this study caused patients to stop their treatment and would urge anyone with concerns to consult their doctor .
" Antidepressants can be a lifeline for many people , and the risk of relapse must be borne in mind in balancing the risks and benefits of these drugs . "
Dr Andrew McCulloch , of the Mental Health Foundation , said : " Most medications carry some level of risk , and antidepressants are no different .
" They are powerful drugs , so in a sense it is no surprise that research is discovering more about their impact on the body .
" More investment is needed in other mental health treatments such as talking therapies and exercise therapy .
" However , we should remember that SSRIs have changed many lives for the better and that any decision about changing or stopping your medication should be discussed with your doctor . "

What are these ?
Two Russian supersonic strategic bombers , the advance party for a deployment of Russian forces for a joint exercise , landed in Venezuela on Wednesday in a move guaranteed to infuriate all believers in America 's divine right to hegemony .
The Tu -160 bombers ( pictured above ) are reputed to be the equals of America 's B - 1 and with an even bigger weapons load .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said that the bombers were there for ' training purposes ' and added that he planned to fly one of the aircraft himself .
The entire exercise is designed to send a " how do you like it ? " message to the West , following the US and allied military presence in Georgia and the Black Sea :
Russia 's Defense Ministry said the two Tu-160 bombers flew to Venezuela on a training mission .
It said in a statement carried by the Russian news wires that the planes will conduct training flights over neutral waters over the next few days before heading back to Russia .
Also Wednesday , NATO said it ended a routine exercise by four naval ships in the Black Sea .
Russia had denounced the exercise as part of a Western military buildup sparked by the Georgia conflict .
...
Earlier this week , Russia said it will send a naval squadron and long - range patrol planes to Venezuela in November for a joint military exercise in the Caribbean .
Let 's not forget , too , that US advisers were in Georgia when it launched its full military might into its own breakaway province of South Ossetia and that neoconservative advisers to the administration and the McCain campaign have called for turning states along Russia 's borders into US - armed " porcupines " .
To imagine how Russia sees its own national interest threatened , imagine if Cuba , Venezuela and other nations around America 's Caribbean " pond " became Russian - armed permanent bastions in America 's backyard .
There 's a lot of other tit - for - tat going on right now too .
Not only has Russia said it will send a fleet to Venezuela - something that will tax Russian naval readiness to the utmost - but it has called for an embargo on arms imports to Georgia at the UN .
That one wo n't get out of the Security Council because the US will veto it but it is another purely political maneuver , making a statement about involvement in Russia 's backyard .
There 's a new combatative style of rhetoric at the UN too , which again points to a breakdown in the post - perestroika monopolar world the neocons foolishly believed would last forever .
Matters have n't become as bad as during the actual Cold War just yet , experts say - but does anyone doubt that with the angry man , John McCain , in control of what would pass for US diplomacy , it would n't get worse ?
He might even make John Bolton his Secretary of State !
A McCain presidency would lead to America 's allies putting even more distance between themselves and the US and finish off the assault on American prestige that George Bush has so successfully mounted .
Obama , by contrast , offers a badly needed new detente before the world returns to dark days and a ticking nuclear clock .
Many home gardeners gratefully complain about having too much zucchini during the summer once their plants ’ fruits ripen .
They just do n’t have enough to do with it .
In my house , it ’s even more of a problem because my husband , like Jessica Seinfeld ’s kids , only eats “ green things ” if I hide them .
He will actually eat this dish twice a year or so , mainly because it ’s deliciously creamy and cheesy .
It ’s kind of a sauceless lasagna , and it ’s pretty hard to mess up .
It makes a great meatless main dish or a substantial side dish , and can be altered to use whatever you happen to have on hand .
The recipe , after the jump
Zucchini Bake
two large zucchini ( around a pound or so )
3/4 c breadcrumbs ( panko work the best , but use what you have on hand , like your homemade crumbs )
1 1/2 c favorite white cheeses ( I use a combination of shredded mozz and parmesano reggiano , because I always have those on hand .
You could use Romano , asiago , or fontina )
3/4 c milk product ( You can use heavy cream , but I lighten it up with at least half - and - half , if not just plain milk )
3 tablespoons butter
salt & pepper
extra virgin olive oil
Preheat oven to 375°
Thinly slice the zucchini width - wise .
If you ’re lucky enough to have a mandoline , use that .
I use the single - slice hole on my box grater .
Lightly oil an 8×8 casserole dish with olive oil .
Place a single layer of zucchini slices on the bottom of the dish .
Season with salt and pepper .
Pour 1 / 4 c of cream or milk over slices .
Layer 1/2 c cheese over milk .
Sprinkle 1/4 c bread crumbs over cheese .
Repeat layers twice more , finishing with bread crumbs .
Dot top with bits of butter .
Place dish on baking dish to prevent messy oven spills .
Bake 40 minutes until bubbling and golden brown .

Is the Neo FreeRunner a limited niche gadget or an intriguing first version of the future of cell phones ?
In the second episode of the Gadget Lab videoblog , Dylan Tweney and Jose Fermoso have a first look at the open source Openmoko Neo FreeRunner , the multimedia phone built with the GNU / Linux platform and the object of desire of tinkering software developers everywhere .
If the video is not working , please click on the following link to view it : Our First Look at The Openmoko Neo FreeRunner .
This episode of the Gadget Lab Videoblog was created by Annaliza Savage ( producer ) , Niall McKay ( camera ) , and Michael Lennon ( editor ) .
Using new " lab on a chip " technology , James Landers hopes to create a hand - held device that may eventually allow physicians , crime scene investigators , pharmacists , even the general public to quickly and inexpensively conduct DNA tests from almost anywhere , without need for a complex and expensive central laboratory .
" We are simplifying and miniaturizing the analytical processes so we can do this work in the field , away from traditional laboratories , with very fast analysis times , and at a greatly reduced cost , " said Landers , a University of Virginia professor of chemistry and mechanical engineering and associate professor of pathology .
Landers published a review this month of his research and the emerging field of lab - on - a- chip technology in the journal Analytical Chemistry .
" This area of research has matured enough during the last five years to allow us to seriously consider future possibilities for devices that would allow sample - in , answer - out capabilities from almost anywhere , " he said .
Landers and a team of researchers at U.Va. , including mechanical and electrical engineers , with input from pathologists and physicians , are designing a hand - held device — based on a unit the size of a microscope slide — that houses many of the analytical tools of an entire laboratory , in extreme miniature .
The unit can test , for example , a pin-prick - size droplet of blood , and within an hour provide a DNA analysis .
" In creating these automated micro-fluidic devices , we can now begin to do macro-chemistry at the microscale , " Landers said .
Such a device could be used in a doctor 's office , for example , to quickly test for an array of infectious diseases , such as anthrax , avian flu or HIV , as well as for cancer or genetic defects .
Because of the quick turn - around time , a patient would be able to wait only a short time on - site for a diagnosis .
Appropriate treatment , if needed , could begin immediately .
Currently , test tube - size fluid samples are sent to external labs for analysis , usually requiring a 24 - to 48 - hour wait for a result .
" Time is of the essence when dealing with an infectious disease such as meningitis , " Landers said .
" We can greatly reduce that test time , and reduce the anxiety a patient experiences while waiting . "
Landers said the research also dovetails with the trend toward " personalized medicine , " in which medical care increasingly is tailored to the specific genetic profile of a patient .
Such highly specialized personalized care can allow physicians to develop specific therapies for patients who might be susceptible to , for example , particular types of cancers .
Simplifying genetic testing , and reducing the costs of such tests , could help pave the way toward routine delivery of such personalized care based on an individual 's genetic profile .
Hand - held micro labs also would be useful to crime scene investigators who could collect and analyze even a tiny sample of blood or semen on - site , enter the finding into a genetic database , and possibly identify the perpetrator very shortly after a crime has occurred .
Likewise , agricultural biotechnologists could do very rapid genetic analysis onthousands of hybrid plants that have desirable properties such as drought and disease resistance , Landers said .
" We can now do lab work in volumes that are thousands of times smaller than would normally be used in a regular lab setup , and can do it up to 100 times faster , " he said .
" As we improve our techniques and capabilities , the costs of fabricating these micro-analysis devices will drop enough to employ them routinely in a wide variety of settings . "
Landers even envisions home DNA test kits , possibly available for purchase from pharmacies , that would allow individuals to self - test for flu or other diseases .

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the mortgage finance giants that were taken over by the government this month , said Monday that they were subpoenaed for documents as part of federal grand jury investigations into their accounting .
The United States attorney ’s office for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed the two companies on Friday for documents related to accounting , disclosure and corporate governance dating from Jan. 1 , 2007 , to the present .
The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating these matters and directing the companies to preserve the documents , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said .
Both companies said they would cooperate .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said last week that it was expanding its inquiry of possible corporate fraud related to the mortgage market collapse to include Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman Brothers and the giant insurer American International Group .
Google has responded with haste to the huge outcry about a section in Chrome 's EULA that gives Google " a perpetual , irrevocable , worldwide , royalty - free , and non-exclusive license " to do all kinds of dirty stuff — in public no less — to content you post through Chrome .
Rebecca Ward , Senior Product Counsel for Google Chrome , told Ars that it 's actually an oopsie from basically copying and pasting the same EULA it uses in other products , and that they 're updating it as fast as they can to remove the ridiculous terms .
She says that Google is
" working quickly to remove language from Section 11 of the current Google Chrome terms of service .
This change will apply retroactively to all users who have downloaded Google Chrome . "

It 's not that I do n't trust Google , but the Ctrl+C , Ctrl + V explanation ( " this means that the legal terms for a specific product may include terms that do n't apply well to the use of that product " ) seems like an odd oversight for a product in secret , heavy development for close to two years .
( If you 're interested in Chrome , read Steven Levy 's deep inside feature about its birth , it 's great . )
Either way , whether Google knew it was in there and hoped it would slide — though I can't see a reason for that — or it was an honest mistake , it 'll be fixed soon . [ Ars ]
' No wonder they call us Plods ! ' :
A frustrated inspector speaks out on the madness of modern policing
Two years ago , a serving police constable calling himself PC David Copperfield wrote a groundbreaking book , serialised by the Mail , describing how ordinary bobbies are frustrated at every turn by bureaucracy .
The Government then promised widespread reforms .
But now a senior officer in a regional force - using the pseudonym Inspector Gadget - reveals that the situation has actually worsened .
Here , he reveals how elf 'n ' safety laws , political correctness and barmy target - setting are preventing the police from catching criminals .
Plastic policing :
At least these merry officers are out - and - about on the beat
All I want is a cup of tea .
I have served this nation for the best part of two decades , both at home and abroad .
I do n't want medals and I do n't want more money .
I just want some tea .
But I can't have a cuppa because electric kettles are prohibited in my workplace .
Our health and safety department has banned them in case we kill ourselves by electrocution , burning or drowning .
Ah , well .
It 's hot today , anyway .
I switch on my desk fan .
Ha ha - had you going there , did n't I ?
I 'm not allowed to use it until it has been checked and stickered as ' safe to use ' by one of the highly - paid staff who descend upon our nick every so often and examine everything .
Never mind .
It 's nearly time to clock off .
Whoah !
Almost caught myself out .
The office clock 's wrong .
It 's still showing GMT .
We 're not allowed to change the time .
No , that would be dangerous and UNISON - the union of the official clock - time changers - would n't like it , so we have to wait for one of those pesky engineers from force HQ .
Last year I ignored this , got up on a chair and altered it myself .
The next day , the nick 's UNISON rep got up on a chair and changed it back to the wrong time .
I kid you not .
Welcome to the public sector .
The weird thing is , when Saturday comes , and I 'm facing a dozen drunken , violent and dangerous yobs outside the taxi rank in the High Street , with only three PCs and a guardian angel on my side , our health and safety officers are nowhere to be seen .
Kettles and electric fans - too dangerous .
Tackling 250lb of screaming , tattooed men when you 're armed only with a 50g tin of pepper spray which does n't work and an aluminium stick - you carry on , officer .
Two years ago , a man going by the name of PC David Copperfield wrote a book called Wasting Police Time .
He described the life of an ordinary bobby trying to do his job but frustrated by a bureaucracy which seemed unrelated to his work .
In a previous story , an officer told how he needed to fill in 249 seperate pieces of paper to deal with one case of shoplifting
At the time , people were n't talking much about paperwork and targets , but Copperfield revealed to the world what most rank and file police officers knew - our Criminal Justice System was at risk of becoming a joke .
Police Minister Tony McNulty MP denounced it as ' more of a fiction than Dickens ' .
But he had to backtrack when Copperfield unmasked himself as PC Stuart Davidson .
Various initiatives have since been launched and grand promises made .
But all that 's happened is a few of the Titanic 's deckchairs have been shifted around .
Despite recent ' spin ' to the contrary , bureaucracy , political correctness and target - driven baloney is now worse than it was before Copperfield .
Thousands of officers who should be on the streets nicking criminals are behind desks ' auditing ' crime reports and managing detection figures .
I am concerned that our insane obsession with largely irrelevant targets will cost lives .
It probably already has .
Like PC Copperfield , I 'm a policeman writing under a pseudonym about his job as a front - line ' Response ' officer .
I am an inspector , two ranks above him .
I lead those who come out ( eventually ) when you call 999 .
And I 'm going to tell it to you like it is .
I work for a force I call ' Ruralshire Constabulary ' .
It has a population well into seven figures , and a number of large and small towns .
How we police is no different from how we make tea or change clocks .
That is , it often makes no sense .
If you were to report a crime , you might think you call your local police station and the police officer decides how urgent the matter is .
Not so .
Most forces now use centrally - based call centres staffed by civilians .
Despite having no experience of police work , they decide on our response to your call .
A lot of people have lost perspective as to what the police are for .
We might get Mr Hughes calling because his ex-girlfriend has sent him a nasty text message .
The police response to this ought to be : ' Why not turn your phone off ?
Because we do have fatal accidents , suicides , rapes , stabbings , battered old ladies and missing children to deal with , you see . '
Form - filling :
An officer stays indoors to do the paperwork ( file picture )
Instead , a call - taker will create a crime report of ' harassment ' .
This will soak up ten to 20 hours of police time and generate a deluge of paperwork over the next few months .
The following week , Mr Hughes will text his ex something unpleasant and the charade will start again in reverse .
Here 's another non-crime taken seriously by us .
Last December , a mother and child were chatting in the local supermarket about Santa Claus as they waited at the cashiers .
In front of them was a youth with a Burberry scarf and Nike trainers .
He looks at the girl and says : ' You do n't believe in Father Christmas , do ya ?
Your mum 's telling you lies . '
Mum calls the police .
We tell her it's not one for us , right ?
Wrong .
The call - taker logs it as a harassment offence .
As a senior officer asked in the morning meeting : ' How can it be harassment to tell someone Santa does n't exist ?
He does n't .
Does he ?'
But a child is involved and the area is a ' crime hot spot ' .
A patrol is dispatched immediately .
Trouble is , we are all working within a framework set up by the Home Office to remove discretion and experience from the game .
The National Crime Recording Standard was adopted to ' record crime in a more victim - focused way ' .
In practice , this means that once a crime report is generated at the call centre , it is hard to get it to go away , even if no crime has been committed .
Management wants the incident to remain a crime and for it to be ' detected ' , or solved , for our figures .
Trivial stuff that we can get people to admit to is our bread and butter .
This partly explains why you 're left at home for hours wondering why we have n't turned up to your burglary .
Rules and processes brought in to save time and money and make things fairer have ended up costing us and hampering the fight against crime .
This is about well - meaning idiocy , the usurping of the front - line professionals by managers and bureaucrats , and the law of unintended consequence .
Those at the top of the police are not necessarily bad people .
They 're just out of touch with reality .
Protecting justice :
But sometimes it seems justice protects the criminals at the expense of the law - abiding public
Recently we had a scene with a man who was on a hardcore drug - crystal meth or crack cocaine .
He had broken into a pensioner 's flat and gone berserk with a knife .
Two bobbies arrived , with their little lightweight aluminium sticks and tins of CS .
They were pretty badly hurt .
A senior officer called , asking : ' Why did n't they use the shields and those big Arnold batons , instead of those silly little sticks ?'
' Arnold batons were withdrawn by the diversity department eight months ago because they made ethnic minority teenagers feel uncomfortable , ' I told him .
He ordered them to be reinstated .
Sometimes you really do need a big stick for defence .
Then there 's the problem of numbers .
There may be enough police , perhaps more than ever .
It 's just that so many of them are working 9 - 5 , Monday to Friday , on neighbourhood policing or behind desks at HQ .
Whereas we need them on the streets at night , at weekends , able to respond when crime happens .
The new Police Community Support Officers ( PCSOs ) - who can issue penalty notices and that 's about it - are n't allowed to work after dark in case they get attacked .
Nowadays , you can often find yourself alone policing a sizeable town .
You start with your team on a Saturday night .
We 're busy now , thanks to the Government 's 24 - hour licensing laws .
Within an hour , everyone is tied up , nicking people for criminal damage and so on .
A single arrest now takes you off the streets for four hours minimum , often for your entire shift , because of the endless paperwork involved .
Suddenly , there 's only you still out .
One evening that was me .
I stood in the High Street , while everyone else was back at Central Custody , nine miles away .
My radio called me to a heroin - wracked shoplifter who was threatening to stick needles into staff at a late - night chemist .
Immediately , there was a call from a pub where someone had been bottled .
Who was more likely to die ?
I went for the heroin - addict , but I had to nick her and take her down to the station - so that was me gone from street duty as well .
There was no one left to police the town .
Policing essentials : Officers need to carry notebooks and tickets to make sure the letter of the law is carried out
This stuff is going on day after day .
It 's like stripping the ambulance service of paramedics : on the 999 side of our business , we are close to breaking point .
The training officers who come down from force HQ are like Hitler in his bunker , pushing fantasy battalions around the map as the Soviet troops pour into the Berlin streets .
But I have to work with reality .
In the Army , a battalion will consist of 75 per cent front - line soldiers , and 25 per cent in HQ support roles .
In the police , 10 per cent are on the front - line and everyone else is back at base , drinking tea and making plans .
It 's mad .
Another issue is the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) .
We used to decide whether suspects would be charged .
Now this is done by CPS - referred to by some as the ' Criminal Protection Service ' , or ' Could n't Prosecute Satan ' .
They work to targets , too .
With us , it 's arrests and detections ; with them it 's convictions .
They need to win cases or their figures look bad , so they err on the side of caution .
It used to be that guilt or innocence was decided by a magistrate or jury .
Now , the CPS gives criminals an extra layer of protection .
Worse still , they force us to present an almost impossible quantity of evidence even in the most basic case .
This causes the most grief between us and the public .
Picture this scene .
Mrs Jones has seen a group of youths smashing car windows .
She recognises them and calls the police .
We take them in .
Broken glass from the cars matches the glass on the youths ' sleeves .
Result !
Except , not really .
The CPS decides not to charge because , for some reason , there is ' insufficient evidence ' .
What happens should criminals we arrest actually get to court ?
There the picture is even bleaker .
I find myself increasingly exhausted by the continual , deliberate way in which the courts protect the guilty and spit on the decency of the police .
Longwinded : Making sure the force obeys its own laws has led to form after form explaining rights and points of law
It no longer surprises me when criminals with 50 or more convictions for dishonesty are believed and I am not .
The courts are always making mad sentencing decisions .
Late one night a while ago , we caught a burglar .
He had threatened the householder with a gun .
After a car chase , he held an automatic weapon directly to an officer 's head .
At arrest , he was found to be drunk and in possession of class A drugs and a stolen car .
A pretty serious list , but he was also out on licence from a three - year sentence for burglary .
You 'd like to think he'd get a serious stretch for all that - after all , the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a firearm illegally is five years .
In fact , he was let go with 120 hours ' community service .
Violent burglars need to be sent to jail .
First , as a means of crime prevention .
Any police officer will tell you that the burglary rate in a given area will drop when the right person is locked up .
It is also the only real weapon we have against hardened criminals .
I saw a very nasty man crumble and turn into a small child in front of my very eyes recently .
Why ?
Prison .
Despite having about 130 previous convictions , he had never done more than 12 weeks in prison and treated the police with utter contempt .
A deeply violent individual , he had just been told he faced going down for a long time for aggravated burglary .
The criminal underclass are not clever .
Trust me .
But even they can understand ' cause and effect ' .
Facing a proper sentence , they change .
Suddenly , they want to talk to you and grass up their mates .
They stop swearing , sneering and spitting at you , and call you Sir .
What does that say ?
It says that prison works .
All we need to do is use it properly .
But we do n't .
More than 50 people who were sentenced to ' life ' after 2000 have already been released - in one case , the person spent 14 months inside .
Those jailed for ' four years ' often serve just eight months .
Young offenders are regarded even more leniently .
About 2,900 young offenders aged between ten and 17 are locked up in secure units .
Each one needs to be there for your safety .
But not according to Frances Done , the head of the Youth Justice Board .
In June , she said magistrates and judges needed to impose fewer custodial terms on such offenders .
I 'd like to introduce her to Troy , a 14 - year - old we know well at our nick , who recently blinded a man in a pub with a glass bottle and laughed about it .
We must grow up and accept that some kids are so poisoned they are pretty much lost to us .
The police can't prevent every crime nor can we solve all those that are committed .
Yet there are many things we could and should do to make it a lot harder for the criminals .
We need to cut paperwork and booking - in time to free up officers , and get more cops out onto the frontline .
We could toughen up our courts and put public protection before crooks ' rights .
We need to stop chasing targets and massaging figures .
Concentrate on criminals , missing kids and road accidents .
But maybe that 's all too revolutionary for modern tastes .
Now , can anyone brew me that cuppa ?

It took Dalhousie University professor Jason Brown six months and some advanced mathematical analytical techniques to crack the code behind one of the most mysterious sounds in music : the " prraaaaaangg " sound at the beginning of the Beatles ’ " Hard Day ’s Night . "
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

" The Chord : "
Guitarists have puzzled over how this chord is played for decades because it contains a note that would be impossible for the Beatles ’ two guitarists and bassist to play in one take , and experts have concluded that no multitracking was involved in this part of the song .
The secret sauce , as it turns out , includes five piano notes apparently played by producer George Martin .
Brown made the discovery by disassembling the sampled amplitudes into the original frequencies using Fourier transforms .
" What about the other three D3s ?
Only one can come from George ’s twelve - string , and even if John played another one on his six - string , there ’s still another to account for , " reads part of the conclusion of Brown ’s report .
" Beatles ’ record producer George Martin is known to have doubled on piano George Harrison ’s solo on the track .
Could ‘ the chord ’ be part piano ? "
" Pianos have three strings for every note ; a hammer strikes all three at the same time to produce a sound .
That solved the problem of the three F3s ; all could have come from a piano playing F3 . "
In that frequency range , a hammer inside a piano strikes three parallel strings , which accounts for the three notes .
That explained most of the mystery , but Brown also had to figure out where a few other mystery notes went ( John Lennon ’s guitar , George Harrison ’s guitar and George Martin ’s piano ) .
The report , Mathematics , Physics and ‘ A Hard Day ’s Night ’ ( .pdf ) , quotes George Martin ’s autobiography , All You Need Is Ears , in which Martin " makes a point of saying ‘ it shouldn ’ tbe expected that people are necessarily doing what they appear to bedoing on records , ’ and likens recording to filmmaking , where all sortsof effects are carried out in the background in order to createillusions . "
" We see that sometimes mathematics can unravel the bestmysteries . "
Well played , sir .

ALLENTOWN , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Allie Mulvihill may seem like your typical American teenager , but she has something weighing on her mind that most 15 - year - olds do not : deportation .
Allie Mulvihill , left , appears with her adopted mother , Lori , and her sister , Olivia .
Allie may be forced to leave the country because U.S. immigration officials are questioning the legitimacy of the Guatemala native 's adoption by her parents , Lori and Scott Mulvihill , in 1994 .
When the Mulvihills brought their then 2 - year - old daughter to their home in Allentown , Pennsylvania , they believed she would be granted citizenship .
But U.S. immigration officials questioned whether the woman who gave Allie up for adoption in Guatemala was really her biological mother .
Allie 's birth certificate was issued 10 months after she was born , which raised suspicions in U.S. officials ' minds that she was made available for adoption due to a baby trafficking scheme .
The Mulvihills , however , say it is not uncommon for birth certificates to be issued for children months after they are born in Guatemala , especially for children born to poor families , because families must pay for the certificates .
The Mulvihills also say U.S. embassy officials in Guatemala interviewed the woman claiming to be her biological mother at the time of the adoption and did not raise any concerns .
The embassy officials , however , did not conduct a blood test of the woman that would have definitely proven the woman had given birth to Allie .

The Guatemalan government also never challenged the adoption , the Mulvihills said .
But U.S. immigration officials still are n't satisfied , and the dispute over her adoption has become a roadblock on Allie 's path to citizenship .
Neither Allie nor her parents have a way to track down her biological mother and the adoption agency used by the Mulvihills to adopt their daughter has gone out of business .
The fact that she cannot get her immigration status resolved means the fear of deportation continues to loom .
Watch Allie describe her fears »
" I do n't know where I 'm going to end up after all this ... if it does n't work out , " she said .
Fourteen years and hundreds of forms later , the Mulvihills feel like they are running in circles and are saying that enough is enough .
Scott Mulvihill simply wants this battle to be over .
" We 're told to go in one direction and when we do , we 're told to switch gears and go into another direction .
And when we look for counsel from the government to give us a definite answer , we get stuck with people who are supposed to be working on marriage contracts rather than immigration contracts , " he said .
Now that she is getting older , the consequences of Allie 's immigration status are getting tougher .
Her lack of citizenship means she cannot get her driver 's license , vote , apply for a job or qualify for financial aid .
" It 's been really difficult , because I can't do all the things my friends can do , " Allie said .
CNN contacted the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services about Allie 's situation .
Bill Wright , deputy press secretary of the USCIS , responded with a statement , saying , " Even in the most sympathetic of situations , such as this , we do not get to selectively dismiss our immigration laws .
USCIS has been trying to work the Mulvihill family , and we continue to urge them to provide evidence that this minor is eligible for permanent residency . "
Allie said this constant battle has left her feeling like a shadow .
" All along I 've really known that I 'm not like everyone else , " she said .
Allie said she believes the strong support from her family , including her younger sister , Olivia , will give her courage to keep fighting for her citizenship .
Olivia is a biological daughter of the Mulvihills .
" It 's been great growing up here .
...
My parents mean everything to me , " Allie said .
" We have so much fun together .
They treat me as if I was like the same as my sister , " she said as she began to tear up .
Allie 's parents are not about to give up either .
Lori Mulvihill said the hardest part is seeing their child upset about not having the same opportunities as other teens her age .
" Some people may think these are minor things , but you know this child is also afraid that she 's going to be made to leave the country , " Lori Mulvihill said , adding , " You watch your child with these fears and right now that 's the hardest part . "
But , for now , all the Mulvihills can do is wait .
CNN 's Zain Verjee and Melissa Morgenweck contributed to this report .

Ron Rivest presented his ( along with a dozen other people 's ) new hash , MD6 , yesterday at Crypto .
I am not a hash guru although I 've implemented SHA and its ilk many times , so I can't guarantee all my notes are correct .
I will compare it somewhat with SHA as that is what I know .
SHA - 1 is a Merkle Damgard hash , meaning that it runs a compression function that takes as input the chaining value from the previous compression function block , along with the next block of input , and compresses that , creating the next chaining value for the next block .
MD6 is a tree hash , so the leaf nodes run the compression function which takes successive blocks of input and compress it down to a chaining value .
These chaining values are then fed up to a parent node , which uses the same compression function to produce its own chaining value , and so on up to the root node .
I think the tree branching factor was 4 - each node has 4 children .
There is also an alternative serial mode for use by memory limited devices , but I do n't recall any details on that .
A unique feature of MD6 is that the input to the compression function is very large - 512 bytes .
SHA - 1 takes 64 bytes .
MD6 is oriented around 64 bit words , so this input is considered to be 64 words .
The MD6 chaining variable is 1024 bits or 16 words - compare to the hash width for the SHA family ciphers : 160 for SHA - 1 , 256 or 512 for SHA - 256 and SHA - 512 .
Per NIST 's spec , the largest hash output for SHA - 3 is 512 bits , so MD6 intentionally uses a double width chaining variable internally , and truncates it for output .
The compression function of MD6 is particularly unusual , combining simple steps with a large number of rounds .
In SHA - 1 the first thing you do is to take the 16 32 - bit input words and expand them into an 80 - word key array , each word in the expanded input being a function of certain previous words .
Then you run an unbalanced Feistel using the expanded inputs .
MD6 starts off with something similar , using a somewhat more complex expansion algorithm , and going on far longer .
To my surprise , this is the whole compression function !
The last 16 words of this process are the output chaining value .
There is no Feistel network or any other mechanism .
In more detail , the 64 ( 64 - bit ) input words are prefixed by two sets of about a dozen words - sorry , I do n't remember exactly how big these were .
One set is a constant value , and the other set includes a variety of " environmental " information about the circumstances of this instance of the compression function .
This includes global information like how wide the hash is that will finally be derived by truncating the final chaining value ; the location of this compression function block in the hash tree , including in particular whether we are the last ( root ) node ; and other such data .
One notable value here is an optional per-hash key , for creating a keyed hash , of up to 8 words ( 512 bits ) .
These prepended blocks bring the full input size up to about 87 or 89 words - again I apologize , I am working strictly from memory here .
Now this input begins to be extended .
Each additional word is a function of about 5 of the previous 89 words .
They did a search to choose the best 5 offsets in order to maximize diffusion .
The combining function is quite simple though , composed solely of xors , ands , one right shift and one left shift .
Rivest mentioned that this made it reversible - a desirable feature as it guarantees that no entropy is lost .
At first I was unclear how doing x = x ^ ( x >>
5 ) for example is reversible , for example , but then I got it .
The shift amounts change each step , again optimized by a computer search for good mixing .
But the really important point here is that there are a huge number of such steps .
The function is expressed in rounds of 16 steps each .
MD6 - 256 uses 104 rounds ; MD6 - 512 uses 168 .
Multiply times 16 and you are performing this extend step on the order of 2000 times .
Again , the last 16 words are the output of the compression function .
Rivest gave a lot of performance information .
Because of the tree structure , the function is highly parallellizable , and scales almost linearly with the number of CPU cores available .
With 1 core , it is not super fast : MD6 - 256 on a 64 - bit CPU is 77 MB/sec ; MD6 - 512 is 49 MB/sec .
For comparison , SHA - 512 is 202 MB/sec on the same setup .
They need about 3 cores to match the speed of SHA - 512 .
He also presented a number of cryptanalytic results .
There is provable security against differential cryptanalysis , by virtue of the large number of rounds ; also security against side channels .
A SAT solver and another technique could only do something with about 11 rounds , versus the 100 + rounds in the function .
The tree structure is also shown to preserve strong properties of the compression function .
Overall it seemed very impressive .
The distinctive features are the tree structure , very wide input blocks , and the enormous number of rounds .
The cryptanalysis results were favorable .
However Adi Shamir stood up and expressed concern that his new Cube attack might apply .
Rivest seemed confident that the degree of MD6 would be several thousand , which should be safe from Shamir 's attack , but time will tell .
Apologies again to the enormous number of authors if I have any serious errors above .
And thanks to Ron Rivest for publicizing this hash design several months before the due date ( October 31 ) , potentially giving an advantage to his competitotrs .
He emphasized that his goal is to produce the best possible outcome for the whole process .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan must do more to end an age - old practice of young boys being kept as sex slaves by wealthy and powerful patrons , the U.N. special representative for children and armed conflict said on Monday .
Radhika Coomaraswamy said the practice , called “ bacha bazi ” -- literally “ boy play ” -- was a taboo subject , but she had heard reports of warlords and military commanders keeping young boys and “ exploiting them in terrible ways . ”
“ What I found was nobody talks about it ; everyone says ‘ Well , you know , it ’s been there for 1,000 years so why do we want to raise this now ? ’ ” she told a news conference at U.N. headquarters , reporting on a visit to Afghanistan last week .
“ That seems to be the general attitude among everyone , but somebody has to raise it and it has to be dealt with . ”
Known as “ bacha bereesh , ” boys without beards , the victims of such abuse are teenage boys who dress up as girls and dance for male patrons at parties in northern Afghanistan .
“ We feel that a campaign should be run to raise awareness about this issue and to stop this practice , ” she said .
“ We talk about sexual violence against girls and women , which is also terrible , but this hidden issue of sexual violence against boys should also be dealt with seriously . ”
Afghan police have tried to crack down on the practice and Islamic clerics say those involved should be stoned for sodomy , which is forbidden under Islamic law .
In a society where the sexes are strictly segregated , it is common for men to dance for other men at weddings in Afghanistan .
But in northern Afghanistan , former warlords and mujahideen commanders have taken that a step further , sometimes taking the boys as “ mistresses . ”
Police and security officials in northern Afghanistan say they have been doing their best to arrest the men involved .
“ It is sad to state that this practice that includes making boys dance , sexual abuse and sometimes even selling boys , has been going on for years , ” General Asadollah Amarkhil , the security chief of Kunduz province , told Reuters last year .
“ We have taken steps to stop it to the extent that we are able , ” he said .
Amarkhil said poverty , widespread in Afghanistan after nearly three decades of war , forced teenage boys into compliance .
Coomaraswamy said raising awareness and prosecuting those responsible was the first step to ending the practice as it would act as a deterrent to others .
She said she was also concerned about a rise in the recruitment of child soldiers by the Taliban and others in recent months , as well as about civilian casualties including children from U.S. - led coalition raids and air strikes .
Episode 33
" But why ca n't we visit the site ? " the Boss bleats one morning when we shoot his idea of seeing the ghost facility down .
" It 's a defence site , " I lie .
" They host defence computers as well as stuff for companies like us .
They 're probably not allowed to show people through their server rooms . "
" We should just turn up unannounced and say there 's some server problem that we have to fix urgently that can't be fixed over the network , " the Boss suggests .
" That would assume ( a ) that we can create some legitimate sounding problem requiring a site visit , and ( b ) that we even knew where their site is , " I counter .
" You do n't know where our servers are ? ! " the Boss gasps .
" Of course not , " the PFY says .
" It 's part of the contract .
If we knew where our servers were , we could theoretically compromise the security of the country 's distributed IT defence systems . "
" Exactly what defence data is held at these sites ? "
" We could tell you , but then we'd have to kill you . "
" Perhaps we 'll skip that bit then ? "
" So we do n't have to tell you ? " the PFY says .
" Look , " the Boss says , ignoring him .
" We pay good money - no , VERY good money for this external hosting arrangement , and I 'd like to know how it 's being spent .
I 'm not paying top dollar for hosting when our critical services could be operating out of the back room of some office building !
I want to see what we 're paying for ! "
" They do n't let you visit , " the PFY repeats " It 's a security thing . "
" Then perhaps we should n't pay ! " the Head Beancounter responds , entering Mission Control from his lurk - point outside .
" That 's a financial thing ! "
I realise now that this is a setup and the Boss has been committing IT treason in actively conspiring with the Beancounters to find some unmet SLA in our external hosting service contract , so as to derail the ' external hosting ' gravy train of the PFY and myself ...
" Maybe we can get some photos ? " the PFY suggests .
" We 'd want to see the facility , " the Boss says .
" Both of us , " the Beancounter adds .
" I 'll make some calls , " I say .
Half an hour later the PFY and I have a rough plan of them being hooded ( for ' security reasons ' ) at night ( to ' coincide with shift changes ' ) bundled in the back of a van and driven around local streets for half an hour before being brought up through the freight elevator to our ghost facility .
To disguise the server room a little , the PFY 's going to flip all the floor tiles upside down , remove the rack doors and slap lots of anti-terrorism posters everywhere .
We 've also lined up a bouncer from a local pub to dress in khaki and ' act military ' , dropping the occasional bit of IT patter .
To complete the picture we 've asked the Boss and Beancounter to supply scans of their passports ' for ID verification and validation purposes ' .
. . .
A day later and the Boss and Beancounter are ushered out of the freight elevator looking slightly dishevelled - thanks to the PFY 's high speed negotiation of a couple of the city 's parks .
" So this is it then ? " the Beancounter asks angrily .
" All that money for this ? "
" State of the art facility , this , " our bouncer says .
" It 's no better or worse than we have in our own building ! " the Boss snaps .
" It may as well be our building , " the Beancounter fumes .
" We 're being ripped off ! "
I 'm wondering if the PFY can hear any of this , watching us - as he is - from the CCTV monitor beside the Halon release in the next room ...
" And we pay all that money for THIS ? " the Boss snarls as our security guard departs ' to do his rounds ' .
" It 's a state of the art room with redundant UPS , Environme - "
" I do n't care if it 's got state of the art bloody environmental monitoring with round the clock surveillance ... "
" Actually , it has , " I murmur .
" ... we 're being ripped off !
This is never a defence facility !
I worked in defence and they 'd never use this sort of equipment . "
" I think ... "
" There 's no log book ! " the Boss says triumphantly .
" Pardon ? "
" There 's no log book - we did n't sign in and out - I 'm sure that 's part of the contract ! " the Boss says triumphantly .
" They got photocopies of your passports . "
" Yes , but we did n't sign in and out - it says they 'll do that , in the contract ! " the Beancounter says happily .
" So you 're going to void the contract over a technicality ? "
I ask , rubbing my jaw thoughtfully .
" YOU BET ! " the Boss says .
" And we 'll go back to hosting it ourselves ? "
" Hell no ! " the Beancounter says .
" The current on site facility cost us a fortune - there 's no way we 're going to expand it to house these servers !
No , we 've found an excellent hosting place in Luton which is dirt cheap . "
" You 're going host our servers in Luton ? " I ask , looking at the CCTV camera , thinking about that scene at the end of Wag the Dog .
" Yes .
Only it 's cheaper if we provide the technical support - so one of you 's going to have to be relocated to Luton . "
" Luton ?!
Yes .
Yes , I 'm sure we can work something out , " I say , creaking the door open .
" I 'll just let the security guy know we 'll be leaving ... "

How tyrant wife ' drove two of her five husbands to suicide ' - after one was transplanted with heart of the other
And after spending all their cash on a lavish lifestyle
The suicides of Cheryl Graham ’s husbands seemed an affair of the heart .
One shot himself in the head and his heart was donated to another man .
Then 10 years later Cheryl married the man with the new heart .
The story took a bizarre twist when the second man – his new heart still pumping strongly – shot himself three years after the wedding , again in the head .
Affairs of the heart : Terry Cottle and Cheryl Graham on their wedding day in 1989 .
He shot himself in their bathroom - and his heart was donated to Sonny Graham , who would go on to marry Cheryl five years later
Headlines around the world asked :
Had history repeated itself through the single heart shared by the two men ?
Was there such a thing as ‘ cellular memory ? ’
Did the lonely heart carry a ‘ suicide gene ? ’
But yesterday a less romantic reason for the tragic deaths emerged when it was revealed that police are still probing at least one of the suicides .
Cheryl Graham , they said , has been married five times , and had driven all her husbands to despair .
‘ She ’s a tyrant , ’ said prison officer John Johnson , one of her surviving spouses .
‘ One day she hates you and one day she loves you and the next day she hates you again .
You either get out or you top yourself .
I guess I ’m lucky to be alive . ’
Cheryl , aged 27 , had already been married before when she met Terry Cottle .
He managed an apartment block in Jasper County , South Carolina , and she was his boss ’s daughter .
Sonny Graham ( centre ) with daughter Michelle and son Gray in 2006 .
He fell in love with Cheryl as soon as he saw her and left his wife of 35 years .
But three years after marrying her , he too shot himself in the head
Cottle was married with two young daughters , but he and Cheryl were soon involved in a passionate affair .
Nine days after Cottle got a divorce , he and Cheryl were married .
Things became rocky between them because of Cheryl ’s constant demands for a more luxurious life .
One day , her son Timmy told police , ' Cheryl told Terry she could n’t stay married to a man who earned less money than she did .
She took off her wedding ring and threw it over the garden fence . '
They agreed to separate , but next morning as he was preparing to leave , Mr Cottle went into the bathroom and shot himself .
After four days on life support , the machines were switched off and his organs were donated for transplants .
Sonny Graham , 57 , who lived 60 miles south on Hilton Head Island , got his heart .
He met Cheryl , then 30 , in 1997 after writing to her family thanking them for Terry ’s heart .
Mr Graham had been happily married to Elaine for 35 years and they had two children , Gray and Michelle .
But Mr Graham said later that he fell in love with red-haired Cheryl the moment he saw her .
As well as his attraction to Cheryl , the new heart gave Mr Graham a strange new craving for beer and hot dogs – Terry Cottle ’s favourite foods .
But his love was not returned at first .
That April , Cheryl married husband No. 3 , George Watkins .
Elaine and Sonny Graham attended the wedding , and Mr Graham – standing in for Cheryl 's late father – gave away the bride .
Cheryl bore Mr Watkins a son in January 1999 at about the same time Mrs Graham discovered Cheryl was having an affair with her husband .
Cheryl ’s marriage was annulled when she discovered Watkins already had a wife when he took her down the aisle .
Cheryl and Mr Graham did not marry at that stage and their life together was tempestuous .
In May , 2002 , they separated with each suing the other for property .
In the midst of the court case , Cheryl married again .
Husband number four was John Johnson Junior an officer at the Georgia prison where Cheryl had been working as a nurse .
Within a year , that marriage , too , began to crumble .
In November , 2003 , police were called as the pair accused each other of domestic abuse .
They tried a reconciliation – but ended up struggling over a revolver after Cheryl had spoken of suicide .
Then Mr Johnson said , she told police he ’d tried to shoot himself .
Mr Johnson said Cheryl was already wearing Mr Graham ’s ring when their divorce became final .
Cheryl married Sonny in 2004 .
Three years later Mr Graham , by then 69 , killed himself with a shotgun blast , again to the head .
An old friend of Mr Graham ’s , Tomme Hitton , said that shortly after his death , Cheryl , now 40 , had a new boyfriend and complained that her fifth husband had died broke , leaving her nothing .
Mr Hitton said : ‘ He ’d blown through his retirement funds and run up large debts trying , as he once put it , “ to keep Cheryl in the style she wants to live " . ’
Georgia police said they were still investigating Mr Graham 's death .
They had interviewed Cheryl Graham 's latest boyfriend who had dumped her .
Mrs Graham refused to comment .
( CNN ) --
" Within the oil crisis and climate change there is the opportunity for an economic , social and cultural renaissance the likes of which we have never seen before , " says environmentalist and perma-culture designer Rob Hopkins .
Falmouth in England is one of many towns across the world that have ' transition ' initiatives .
" If only we can just unleash all the creativity and genius around us , rather than just lurching from crisis to crisis . "
Hopkins is the founder of the " Transition Town " movement , and the author of its bible , " The Transition Handbook . "
The movement was founded in Totnes , Devon , and Kinsale , Ireland , in 2005 and 2006 , with the aim of helping those communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil output and climate change .
Since then it 's spread across the United Kingdom and to towns across the world .
There are now 60 other projects already in action , and nearly 700 others considering getting involved .
There is even a Transition storyline on the popular BBC radio soap opera , " The Archers . "
Fundamentally , it 's a grassroots initiative , and Hopkins believes that the move to an oil - free society is about community and individuals more than industry and government .
" We use about nine barrels of oil each per year in the UK , " he says .
" The first three we can influence ourselves , the next three are down to our communities , and the final third are the Government 's responsibility .
We try and focus on the first six barrels . "
Transition works by helping local people get together and find ways they can reduce their reliance on oil as a community , and cut their carbon footprint in the process .
In Totnes , Transition have created local food guides , formed a sustainable building company , given talks and lectures to landowners and local government officials to show them how peak oil and climate change affect their management decisions .
They have even created an alternative currency , the " Totnes Pound " , which can only be spent within the town in an attempt to localize the economy and reduce reliance on imports .
The fact that so much food was brought into this rural , agricultural region from many hundreds of miles away seemed one of the crazier excesses of the cheap oil era Hopkins believes is already over .
In an attempt to change this -- both to prepare for the day it becomes too expensive and increase the town 's resilience - Transition Totnes encourages everyone to grow their own food .
They operate a " garden share " scheme that unites keen gardeners without land with those who do n't have the time , or fitness , to tend their own patch .
They are also aiming to make Totnes the nut tree capital of Britain .
" We have identified unloved and derelict bits of the town , planted fruit and nut trees and trained the people living nearby how to look after them , " says Hopkins .
" You can get more protein and carbohydrate per hectare from a hybrid nut tree than anything else . "
So far , Transition estimate between 10 and 15 per cent of the population have had some involvement with them .
Ideas spreading from the fringes to the mainstream
Totnes is a town with a strong tradition of alternative lifestyles and environmental awareness , and exactly the sort of place Transition would appeal : the high street is crammed with health food shops and healers .
But in the two years the program has been in operation , word has spread and the concept seems to have struck a chord with thousands of people across Britain , many in areas without such a radical precedent .
" Now the people getting involved now are n't just the usual suspects , the hard core environmentalists , " says Hopkins .
" We have professionals , teachers , the Women 's Institute .
" The Archers " storyline was , for me , a real indication we had reached into Middle England .
" One of the reasons why Transition has grown so fast is that it 's expanded into a vacuum .
" People have known about climate change for some time , and now the idea of peak oil is spreading fast .
But there was a real lack of action , what could you do after you 'd felt bad about it all for a few days ?
That 's where Transition comes in .
" It 's not about finding out whose fault it is and chaining yourself to them , it 's about rediscovering old skills , like thrift ; being practical , taking control .
" Fifty years ago we all had these skills , but now we 've become the most useless generation ever to walk this planet .
One of the nice things about Transition is that it brings older people in and makes them feel valued -- because they know these things . "
Transition works by uniting local communities and forming groups to tackle individual areas -- energy , food , housing -- with the ultimate aim being the construction of an " Energy Descent Plan " to plot out a twenty year divorce from oil .
" The British government 's own plans for the future assumes oil will be $ 65 a barrel in 2010 .
Well , it has already hit $ 136 , with many analysts predicting $ 200 soon , so it 's quite clear they are not thinking this through .
" I think [ UK prime minister ] Gordon Brown could really do with being honest about energy .
At the moment he is n't and that 's a very dangerous situation to be in .
It 's no good saying we 'll up North Sea production or going off to talk to the King of Saudi Arabia , we need leadership that takes a proper appraisal . "
Hopkins acknowledges that it's hard for governments to take action until they know the country is behind them , but argues again , that 's where Transition comes to the rescue .
" We can help create that mandate , " he says , " and revitalize democracy in the process . "

Ezra Klein wonders why Palin is getting less coherent :
The fact that Palin 's responses to questions are becoming increasingly incoherent rather than rapidly more polished is interesting .
Rote memorization should have all but eliminated the overlay of nonsense in her answers by now .
Matt Yglesias offers a decent hypothesis , saying , " It ’s possible that all this cramming is causing Palin to become less coherent instead of just parrying questions she knows she does n’t have good answers to , she ’s trying to remember canned lines but it ’s too much all at once to actually get right . "
This is the person John McCain believes could take over as president in an instant and cope with three wars - in Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan - and a potential reprise of the Great Depression .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. researchers have found a way to make efficient silicon - based solar cells that are flexible enough to be rolled around a pencil and transparent enough to be used to tint windows on buildings or cars .
The sun sets over the sea in Dubrovnik , the famous Adriatic town , in Croatia November 3 , 2007 .

The finding , reported on Sunday in the journal Nature Materials , offers a new way to process conventional silicon by slicing the brittle wafers into ultrathin bits and carefully transferring them onto a flexible surface .
“ We can make it thin enough that we can put it on plastic to make a rollable system .
You can make it gray in the form of a film that could be added to architectural glass , ” said John Rogers of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , who led the research .
“ It opens up spaces on the fronts of buildings as opportunities for solar energy , ” Rogers said in a telephone interview .
Solar cells , which convert solar energy into electricity , are in high demand because of higher oil prices and concerns over climate change .
Many companies , including Japanese consumer electronics maker Sharp Corp and Germany ’s Q - Cells are making thin - film solar cells , but they typically are less efficient at converting solar energy into electricity than conventional cells .
Rogers said his technology uses conventional single crystal silicon .
“ It ’s robust .
It ’s highly efficient .
But in its current form , it ’s rigid and fragile , ” he said .
Rogers ’ team uses a special etching method that slices chips off the surface of a bulk silicon wafer .
The sliced chips are 10 to 100 times thinner than the wafer , and the size can be adapted to the application .
Once sliced , a device picks up the bits of silicon chips “ like a rubber stamp ” and transfers them to a new surface material , Rogers said .
“ These silicon solar cells become like a solid ink pad for that rubber stamp .
The surface of the wafers after we ’ve done this slicing become almost like an inking pad , ” he said .
“ We just print them down onto a target surface . ”
The final step is to electrically connect these cells to get power out of them , he said .
Adding flexibility to the material would make the cells far easier to transport .
Rogers envisions the material being “ rolled up like a carpet and thrown on the truck . ”
He said the technology has been licensed to a startup company called Semprius Inc in Durham , North Carolina , which is in talks to license the technology .
“ It ’s just a way to use thing we already know well , ” Rogers said .
Riddles in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper were the basis for the plot of the best - selling novel The Da Vinci Code , but why has n't anyone cracked the code of what food was served at the legendary dinner party ?
New research by John Varriano suggests that the meal being consumed was neither bread nor pascal lamb , as once thought .
Instead , he writes in a new article in Gastronomica that the 1997 cleaning and restoration of the fresco revealed plates of grilled eel garnished with orange slices .
Above is a detail of the section of the painting in question ( with my best effort to identify and highlight the dish ) .
I have to admit the evidence is a little murky to my untrained eye , but I 'll take Varriano 's word for it .
He zooms in for a much closer look in the article .
Pairing fish with oranges was trendy at the time The Last Supper was painted , according to Varriano , who notes that a recipe for grilled eel appears in Platina 's On Right Pleasure and Good Health , an influential Renaissance cookbook .
He also loosely ties the choice of the dish to Leonardo's own grocery lists , preserved from 1400s , which indicate he shopped for " peppered bread , eels , and apricots " at least a dozen times .

Obama and McCain Take 14 Question Science Test
Democratic nominee Senator Barack Obama of Illinois says his administration would put the United States on track to cut carbon emissions 80 percent by the year 2050 .
" I will restore U.S. leadership in strategies for combating climate change and work closely with the international community , " Obama says .
On the other hand , Republican nominee Senator John McCain of Arizona says his administration would aim for a reduction of at least 60 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 .
He does not mention international engagement but promises a $ 5,000 tax credit to every customer who buys an American zero-emissions car .
Democratic presidential nominee Senator Barack Obama , left , and Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain .
The candidates gave these answers in response to 14 questions posed by a new organization ScienceDebate2008 that is attempting to raise the profile of science in this presidential election .
" We are grateful for both senators ' detailed responses , " said Matthew Chapman , president of the initiative .
" Now we hope the candidates will want to discuss their differences .
Science Debate 2008 and its partners once again extend an invitation to both candidates to attend a televised forum where these vital issues can be discussed in front of a broader audience . "
ScienceDebate2008 is a citizens initiative started by six people last December .
Signers now include nearly every major American science organization , the presidents of most major American universities , and dozens of Nobel laureates and top American CEOs .
The 14 questions address energy policy , national security , economics in a science - driven global economy , climate change , education , health care , ocean health , biosecurity , clean water , space , stem cells , scientific integrity , genetics , and research .
" Most of America 's major unsolved challenges revolve around these 14 questions , " said Shawn Otto , CEO of the initiative .
" To move America forward , the next president needs a substantive plan for tackling them going in , and voters deserve to know what that plan is . "
On the role of nuclear energy , the candidates differ widely in their views .
McCain supports a greater role for nuclear power , saying , " As president , I will put the country on track to building 45 new reactors by 2030 so that we can meet our growing energy demand and reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases .
Nuclear power is a proven , domestic , zero-emission source of energy and it is time to recommit to advancing our use of nuclear energy . "
Obama does not rule out nuclear power but looks towards developing , " A new generation of nuclear electric technologies that address cost , safety , waste disposal , and proliferation risks . "
On the production tax credit for renewable energy facilities that is due to expire at the end of December , Obama offers to extend the credit for five years .

McCain says he supports the idea of a production tax credit although he has voted against it .
" I 've voted against the current patchwork of tax credits for renewable power because they were temporary , and often the result of who had the best lobbyist instead of who had the best ideas .
But the objective itself was right and urgent , " he said .
On the question of improving ocean health , McCain , a former U.S. Navy officer , says , " Ocean health and policy requires better management focus ; however , we also need a better scientific understanding of the oceans , " but offers no specific actions .
Obama says he will " work actively to ensure that the U.S. ratifies the Law of the Sea Convention – an agreement supported by more than 150 countries that will protect our economic and security interests while providing an important international collaboration to protect the oceans and its resources . "
Obama links global climate change to " catastrophic effects on ocean ecologies " and says his plan to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases 80 percent below 1990 by 2050 can help .
He promises to expand the research budgets of federal scientific agencies such as NASA , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the National Science Foundation , and the U.S. Geological Survey .

Obama says , " Solutions to this critical problem will require close collaboration between federal , state , and local governments and the people and businesses affected .
First , prices and policies must be set in a ways that give everyone a clear incentive to use water efficiently and avoid waste . "
Obama says he will " establish a national plan to help high - growth regions with the challenges of managing their water supplies " and will provide " information , training , and , in some cases , economic assistance " to farms and businesses shifting to " more efficient water practices . "
The 14 questions were developed from over 3,400 questions submitted by more than 38,500 signers of the ScienceDebate2008 initiative .
The questionnaire is a joint effort led by ScienceDebate2008 , with Scientists and Engineers for America , the American Association for the Advancement of Science , the National Academies of Science , Engineering and Medicine , and the Council on Competitiveness , among others , together representing more than 125 million Americans .

America and ScienceDebate2008.com and conducted in May by Harris Interactive , shows that 56 percent of respondents strongly agree and 29 percent somewhat agree that the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss how science can help tackle key problems facing the United States , such as health care , climate change and energy .
" This is not a niche debate , " said Craig Barrett , chairman of Intel and one of the supporters of the Science Debate initiative .
" Without the best education system and aggressive investments in basic research and development we will become a second rate economic power .
We expect the candidates for president to take this very seriously . "

Labour 's attempts to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system have led to a huge rise in the criminalisation of people for minor offences , according to a key government adviser .
Professor Rod Morgan , a former chief inspector of probation and the ex-chair of the Youth Justice Board , warns in a report released tomorrow that more people are ending up with criminal records owing to the increasing use of cautions and fixed - penalty notices handed out by the police .
His comments are likely to strike a chord with a growing number of parents concerned that their children are receiving criminal records and having their personal details recorded on the DNA database even for minor offences .
Morgan also suggests that , conversely , an increasing number of people convicted of violent offences may be receiving cautions rather than ending up before the courts .
He says that the expansion of ' summary justice ' - penalties that do not need to be handed down by the courts - needed to be ' more incisively scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively ' , adding : ' We can not be wholly confident that this is the case . '
The increased use of summary justice was hailed by Labour as a way of boosting public confidence in the law .
The idea , according to Lord Falconer , the then Lord Chancellor who heavily promoted its use , was ' to connect the instance of crime much more quickly and directly with the consequences of crime ' .
But there are concerns that its widespread use is backfiring .
The number of cautions has risen from 900,000 in 2002 to 1.4 million in 2006 , the most recent figures available .
Over the same period , the number of penalty notices for disorder has soared from 1,000 to 513,000 .
Such sanctions have in many cases replaced informal legal remedies such as a ' ticking off ' from the local policeman .
Morgan warns there is a risk that people ' will be criminalised where both common sense and the public interest suggest that informal control systems and informal sanctions would better apply ' .
His decision to speak will dismay the Ministry of Justice .
Morgan sits on a government criminal justice advisory board and his long record as a civil servant suggests his views will gain wide attention .
His report ' Summary justice : Fast but Fair ? ' , published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies , also questions whether the trend towards handing out cautions and penalty notices might have resulted in some serious offenders receiving lighter sentences than if they had ended up in court .
Between 2001 and 2006 there has been a 92 per cent increase in the number of cautions handed down for serious violence against the person and a 267 per cent rise in cautions for common assault .
The trend has resulted in an ' accountability deficit ' , according to Morgan , who points to significant regional variations in the use of penalties and cautions .
In Dyfed Powys , for example , 61 per cent of indictable offences result in a caution , compared with a low of 21 per cent in Merseyside .
Richard Garside , director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies , said Morgan 's report raised ' important questions about the consequences of government policies to divert minor offences from the courts ' .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : ' Fixed penalty notices and cautions enable police to deal swiftly with low - level offending , freeing them to spend more time on frontline duties and more time investigating violent , dangerous or sexual offences , as well as freeing court time for more serious offences . '
The deal has been hailed by both leaders India and France have signed a major co-operation pact which paves the way for the sale of French nuclear reactors to Delhi , officials say .
The nuclear accord was agreed in Paris between Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The deal " will form the basis for enlarged bilateral co-operation in the fields of energy and research " , the French presidency said in a statement .
France is a leading world exporter of civilian nuclear technology .
' Good news '
The two leaders made no public comment after signing the deal .
But a French presidential aide said that " today we are at the inter - governmental stage , and after that the industrialists will begin their co-operation " .
The US deal gives India access to US civilian nuclear technology Tuesday 's signing comes after India and France agreed a Framework Agreement for Civil Nuclear Co-operation in January .
Reports say the deal includes providing India with France 's latest model of the European Pressurised Reactor as well as other civilian nuclear material .
Correspondents say that the deal is good news for India - which is desperately short of energy to fuel its booming economy - and places it firmly as a world nuclear power .
The deal in effect ends a ban which prevented countries from engaging in civilian nuclear trade with Delhi .
The ban was imposed in 1974 when India used its civilian programme to produce and successfully test an atomic bomb .
France is the world 's second largest producer of nuclear energy after the United States .
It hopes to be at the forefront of an international revival of the industry which analysts say will benefit from worries about global warming and soaring energy prices .
Russia is also eager to export nuclear technology to Delhi , after the 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group lifted a ban on India in early September .
That , combined with the French deal and a proposed deal with the US , means that India is now in the international market for technology and nuclear reactors .
' Great power ' India has 22 nuclear reactors and is seeking to expand its nuclear energy sector , opening up a market estimated at 100bn euros ( $ 142 bn ) over 15 years .
The country - now seen as a strategic partner for both the European Union and the US - has a population of 1.1 billion and is tipped to be one of the future great powers of the 21st Century .
But it gets only a tiny fraction of its electricity from nuclear power .
Supporters of the deal say that more nuclear plants in India could help reduce global demand for oil and gas while at the same time significantly reducing the country 's pollution levels .
India wants access to civilian nuclear technology Tuesday 's agreement was concluded days after the US House of Representatives passed a pact that would allow the US to provide nuclear materials to India .
The upper house of the American Congress , the Senate , is expected to vote on the deal later this week .
Critics of the deal say it creates a dangerous precedent by allowing India to expand its nuclear power industry without requiring it to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) as other nations must .
President George W Bush has urged the Senate to " quickly " vote on the deal before it adjourns .
Correspondents say he faces a race against time to sign the deal into law before he leaves office in January .
It was first agreed three years ago and is regarded as a key foreign policy priority for both the Indian and US governments .

Andrea Mitchell hit Tucker Bounds hard over the Ayers attacks by John McCain and Sarah Palin . ( rough transcript )
Mitchell :
There 's been no question that there 's been an exaggeration in a lot of the things Sarah Palin has said about the relationship .
Why do that ?
What are you trying to suggest ?
Are you trying to make Barack Obama seem to be some sort of terrorist himself ?
This man has been running for President for the last two years and has been vetted through twenty two primary debates .
Already two debates in the general election .
Um , What 's your point ?
Bounds :
Well I think most Americans who are sitting at home watching television sets know that they do n't have any friends that they 've gone to their living rooms and helped with their career that are also ...
Mitchell : Even calling him a friend Tucker , I mean , even calling him a friend is an overstatement according to all the fact checking that we 've been able to do .
{}
Mitchell : That was the board of Walter Annenberg , a stalwart Republican who created an education foundation in Chicago .
Bounds : I 'm not indicting the board .
I do n't think there 's a problem with the board .
I think there 's a problem with having an unrepentant terrorist who 's your friend and then going before the American people and them misrepresenting
Pte Williams died after being punished for a misdemeanour
Three soldiers have been cleared of the manslaughter of a junior colleague at a barracks in Wiltshire .
Pte Gavin Williams , 22 , of Hengoed , Caerphilly , collapsed and died at Lucknow Barracks in Tidworth in 2006 .
Sgt Russell Price , 45 , Sgt Paul Blake , 37 , and Cpl John Edwards , 42 , were found not guilty by a jury at Winchester Crown Court .
The court had heard that Pte Williams died after being made to do an informal punishment known as beasting .
During the trial the prosecution alleged Pte Williams was put through an intense session of physical exercise , or beasting , to punish him for his drunken high jinks .
The soldier , of the Second Battalion the Royal Welsh Regiment , collapsed and died on one of the hottest days in 2006 .
Lessons have to be learnt from this case by the regiment and the Army
Mr Justice Royce
' I was beasted in army training '
He was admitted to hospital where tests showed his body temperature was 41.7C , higher than the norm of 37C .
Tests subsequently showed he had ecstasy in his body when he died .
Following the acquittal , trial judge Mr Justice Royce attacked the Army for allowing beasting to take place .
He also criticised the fact that the three non-commissioned officers were placed in the dock while their commander , the adjutant Captain Mark Davis , who ordered that Pte Williams be brought to him " hot and sweaty " , was in the process of being promoted .
In his summing up , the judge had asked the jury to consider whether the defendants had been " hung out to dry " while Capt Mark Davis was not prosecuted .

He went on : " Lessons have to be learnt from this case by the regiment and the Army .
" This sort of activity should not be condoned and must n't be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge . "
The court also heard there was likely to be a board of inquiry into the practice of beasting .
After the verdict the director general personnel of the British Army , Major General Andrew Gregory , said : " The Army deeply regrets the death of Private Williams and my thoughts are with his family at this difficult time .
" The conclusion of the trial allows the Royal Military Police now to conduct a full investigation into his death .
" This will examine whether there were any breaches of military law .
A decision can then be made on further action .
I am unable to comment further until this investigation concludes . "
' Fight for justice ' A statement was read outside court from Pte Williams 's mother Debra expressing her anger at the treatment of her son .
It said : said : " We are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today .
" We have come this far , we owe it to Gavin that nobody else 's child goes through what happened to Gavin .
" I will continue fighting for justice for Gavin .
I will go through my options with my lawyer . "
Supt Steve Hedley , from Wiltshire Police , said they had conducted a " professional and thorough investigation " over almost two years .
" My aim was to establish the truth surrounding the death of Gavin Williams , a young soldier , and during this period the investigation team has left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances , " he said .
' Dividing line ' Patrick Mercer , the former shadow minister for Homeland Security , has previously served as an officer in the army .
He told BBC Radio 5
Live that robust punishments were not necessarily a practice to be avoided in the military .
" There is no place on the battlefield for softness , I 'm not talking about compassion , there is no place for physical standards which are below par , " Mr Mercer said .
" But there 's a very , very strong and sensible and clear dividing line between where robust encouragement stops and bullying starts .
" And that was something that as a former infantry officer myself I was intensely conscious of , with the precious commodity known as my men . "

HELENA , Mont . 
The federal agency that removed the gray wolf from the endangered species list in March has changed its mind and is asking a federal judge to vacate the decision .
The request , by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service , follows a temporary order by Judge Donald Molloy of Federal District Court in Missoula , Mont. , against the service ’s decision in March to remove the wolf from the list .
The agency said then that the wolf population in the Northern Rockies had fully recovered .
The order stopped a plan to allow hunting of the wolves in Montana , Idaho and Wyoming until a lawsuit by environmentalists challenging the wolves ’ removal from the endangered species list could be heard .
On Monday the Fish and Wildlife Service asked Judge Molloy to vacate the delisting and allow officials to reconsider their finding and further study the issue .
Talk about pictures being worth a thousand words .
Note how Palin does n't want to get too close to Old Granddad .
Note how he keeps sneaking peeks at her chest .
Note also how he plays with his wedding ring through the whole thing , while Cindy gazes on in the background .
I do n't think a whole lot of women have much sympathy for Cindy McCain .
After all , payback 's a bitch , is n't it ?
And I do n't think Palin is at all dazzled by John McCain , but she 's a shrewd operator who'd be a damn fool to turn down an opportunity like this .
Still ... it'll be interesting to see what people who spent eight years blasting Bill Clinton for thinking with his dick think as they watch John McCain do the same thing .
Only do n't you think that the entire country is a bit extravagant as a gift to a hottie you 're obsessed with ?
Ew .

With a 4 - to - 3 ruling on Friday that granted gay and lesbian couples the right to marry , the Connecticut Supreme Court ended a serious injustice within its own borders , and the national debate over the issue was catapulted forward .
The ruling made Connecticut the third state to legalize same - sex marriage , following Massachusetts in 2004 and California in May .
Connecticut ’s Supreme Court was considering a ruling by a lower court that found that there was no denial of equal protection in excluding gay people from the institution of marriage .
The lower court cited supposedly comparable protections and benefits afforded by the state ’s civil - unions law .
The Supreme Court ’s decision correctly rejects that standard , which is the same as the excuse of separate but equal once used to rationalize racial segregation .
Justice Richard Palmer wrote in the majority opinion that segregating heterosexual and homosexual couples into different institutions constitutes a “ cognizable harm ” in light of “ the history of pernicious discrimination faced by gay men and lesbians , and because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody . ”
Because of that history of discrimination , the decision properly treats sexual orientation as a “ suspect classification ” entitled to the sort of heightened legal scrutiny applied to distinctions based on race or sex .

According to the Washington Times the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives has shelved H.R. 362 , fearing that the resolution would provoke a war with Iran .
The bill , authored by Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D – NY ) , urged the President , among other things , to prevent Iran from importing any refined petroleum products and demanded that he initiate an international effort to inspect “ all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran . ”
Though non-binding , the resolution is essentially urging a naval blockade against Iran – an act of war according to international law .
The bill was introduced on May 22 , one day after the story broke that then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D – CA ) to impose a naval blockade on Iran as a way of stopping its uranium enrichment program .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee has endorsed the bill as a way to “ stop Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
Rep .
Ackerman claims the bill “ is a way to avoid war by using diplomatic , political and economic tools . ”
He also intends to resubmit the bill for the next Congress , and vowed to have even more signatures then .
The current incarnation of the bill has 280 co-sponsors , but the Washington Times reports that several of the original co-sponsors have since withdrawn their signatures .
There is also a sister bill to this , S.Res.580 , in the Senate .
The bill , introduced by Senator Evan Bayh ( D – IN ) , has 50 cosponsors .
ATI Radeon HD 4870 X2 World ’s Fastest Graphic Card was launched by AMD ( ATI ) ; comes with 2.4 teraFLOPS of processing power .
These cards comprise the ATI Radeon HD 4800 X2 series , combining two ATI Radeon HD 4800 series GPUs with a more advanced cross-GPU connection based on the PCIe 2.0 standard , plus two gigabytes of memory .

Key Features
There ’s rumblings here and there about how ActiveResource is n’t really complete .
The documentation refers to features that are n’t implemented , site etc .
That ’s just the tip of the iceberg .
The documentation states that ActiveResource behaves “ very similarly to Active Record ” .
But ActiveResource does n’t support any of the meta - data that ActiveRecord uses ( like belongs_to , decease has_many , etc ) .
So even the simplest cases behave radically different than you might expect .
A small sampling of things that do n’t work :
a_person = Person .
new a_person .
name = “ Luke “ a_person .
parent a_person .
children
This is all fine if you are writing an app from scratch to use ActiveResource ( well .. that ’s debatable ) .
At Medical Decision Logic , we needed to replace ActiveRecord with ActiveResource in an app with 50,000 lines of Ruby code .
So we wrote Hyperactive Resource .
Hyperactive Resource
Hyperactive Resource extends ActiveResource :: Base to make it .. work properly .
You should use it .
It ’s awesome .

Well , she 's the gift that keeps on giving .
Sarah Palin told a customer at a Philadelphia restaurant on Saturday that the United States should " absolutely " launch cross - border attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan in the event that it becomes necessary to " stop the terrorists from coming any further in , " a comment similar to the one John McCain condemned Barack Obama for making during last night 's presidential debate .
During Friday 's debate , Obama criticized the Bush administration for sending billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan without ridding the border region of terrorists .
McCain fired back hard , arguing that newly elected Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari has had his " hands full " and suggesting that Obama 's tough talk was naïve .
" You do n't say that out loud , " McCain said .
" If you have to do things , you have to do things , and you work with the Pakistani government . "
Palin 's apparent disagreement with McCain 's position on Pakistan came as the Alaska governor was picking up a couple of cheesesteaks at Tony Luke 's in South Philadelphia .
She was approached by a man wearing a Temple University t- shirt , who later identified himself as Michael Rovito ... read on
Too bad she was n't on any of the post debate network wrap up shows .
She would have given the media the " sound byte " they were looking for to endlessly loop .

George Stephanopoulos asked John McCain about his running mate 's loose lips and he reiterated his policy of not announcing attacks on a country ahead of time , to which Stephie pointed out that 's exactly what Palin did .
McCain 's response ?
" You know this business of .... in all due respect people , going around and , with sticking a microphone while conversations are being held and all of a sudden that 's ... that 's a person 's position ... it , it 's a free country but I do n't think most Americans think that that 's a definitive policy statement made by Governor Palin and I would hope you would n't either . "
Translation :
How dare anyone take her at her word ?
You know you should n't listen to her !
As you probably already know , the NYPD has been planning to blanket lower Manhattan with over 3000 security cameras as a preventative measure against future terrorist attacks .
Not surprisingly , the New York City Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) has a different opinion on the matter , saying that " A plan of this scope , expense [ $ 106 million ] and intrusiveness demands robust public debate and legislative oversight .
The public has a right to this information . "
Therefore , they have decided to sue the NYPD and force them to disclose their plans .
So , one day before the anniversary of the September 11th attacks , I have to ask : which side are you on ?

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) -- Pakistan 's president , prime minister and other leaders had planned to dine at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on Saturday night , when it was struck by a massive truck bombing , a government official said Monday .
The hotel was destroyed by the 600 kg bomb .
more photos »
The Saturday night suicide truck attack killed 57 people and wounded more than 250 , and sparked a fire that left the hotel in ruins .
Al - Arabiya TV reported Monday that it received a claim of responsibility for the attack by a previously unknown group called " The Fedayeen of Islam , " but noted that it could not authenticate the audio recording or the name of the group .
According to the recording , the group said 250 U.S. Marines and other U.S. and NATO officials were inside the hotel at the time of the attack .
It said the group regretted the attack , but said it was necessary to press its demands , including an end to U.S. - Pakistani joint efforts and a halt to all military operations in Pakistan 's tribal regions .
The group also called for the release of " mujahedeen " prisoners in U.S. prisons , according to the recording .
CNN cannot independently verify the claim .
The head of Pakistan 's Interior Ministry , Rehman Malik , said earlier Monday that the government officials ' dinner plans were changed at the last minute , when President Asif Ali Zardari asked to move the event to the prime minister 's compound .
Malik addressed reporters during a handover service for Czech Ambassador Ivo Zdarek , who died in the blast .
His announcement raised questions as to how much the government knew about the planned attack , which involved a construction truck with more than 600 kg ( 1,300 pounds ) of explosives .
Watch the damage caused and hear stories from survivors »
But the hotel owner denied the government had made reservations for that night and Pakistani Senator Javed Ashraf Qazi said he was invited to the dinner but it was always scheduled to be at the prime minister 's office .
A U.S. State Department contractor is still unaccounted for in the aftermath of the blast , State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Monday .
Two American military personnel who worked for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad were among those killed , the U.S. military said .
The Pentagon on Monday named an airman killed as Maj. Rodolfo I. Rodriguez , 34 , of El Paso , Texas .
A Lithuanian Pakistani was also among the fatalities , police superintendent Sheikh Zubair told CNN Sunday .
The injured included 11 foreigners , Malik said
On Sunday Malik called the massive blast " the biggest attack , volume - wise " in Pakistan in seven years , based on the quantity and type of explosives used .
No arrests have been made in connection with the attack .
But Malik said suspicion is falling on militants in Pakistan 's tribal regions .
" I am not in a position to tell you who has done it , but ( in ) all the previous investigations , all the roads have gone to South Waziristan , " he said Sunday .
South Waziristan is one of seven agencies of Pakistan 's tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are active .
But Amir Mohammad , an aide to leader of the Pakistani Taliban Baitullah Mehsud , said he shared the country 's grief and was not involved , The Associated Press reported .
Saturday 's massive blast left a nearly 18 - meter - wide ( 60 foot ) crater , which was 7 m deep ( 24 feet ) , Malik said .
It also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five - story , 258 - room hotel on fire , police said .
The blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure .
The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m. , after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan , Malik said .
Trees were felled by the explosion , which occurred hours after newly elected President Zardari addressed a joint session of parliament and promised to root out terrorism .
At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday , Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast , showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger , deadly explosion .
In the video , a large truck crashes into the security gate , sending one security officer scurrying for safety .
Then , as security guards approach the truck , the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee .
Watch guards scatter after an explosion »
A small cloud of smoke appears above the truck , which is engulfed in flames minutes later .
One of the security guards tries to put out the fire with a hand - held extinguisher , to no avail .
The guards then walk away , and the camera freezes on the burning truck .
Watch the truck bomb caught on tape »
Pakistani officials said the blast apparently disrupted electricity to the area , causing the closed - circuit television camera to malfunction .
The Marriott , a Western brand - name hotel , has been the site of attacks in the past .
Malik said authorities had received a threat against the parliament two days ago .
" We had taken all security measures , " he said .
" There was heavy security in the city . "
Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and military , the hotel is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night .
See where the attack occurred »
• Nine Pakistani soldiers were killed and six injured when a suicide car bomber crashed into a security checkpoint Monday night in Pakistan 's Swat District of the North West Frontier Province , a Pakistani military spokesman said .
• Militants kidnapped an Afghan diplomat and killed his driver in northwest Pakistan Monday , police said .
The diplomat , Abdul Khaliq Farahi -- who works in the Afghan consulate in Peshawar -- was on his way home when someone opened fire , police in Peshawar said .

All About Pakistan • Islamabad • The Taliban • Asif Ali Zardari • Al Qaeda
She ’s a barracuda all right .
What a great issue to explode and showcase how bad McCain and Palin really are .
How extreme she truly is .
How anti-women they really are .
What a great issue to make McCain cringe .
To drive a wedge between him and women and independents .
To put McCain and Palin on the side of rapists versus rape victims .
To change the discussion of the entire week from lipstick and fish to a real issue that scares the hell out of women , and men , across America .
I mean , the reason the city did n’t pick up the charge of the rape kits is because they were more interested in keeping taxes low .
Yes , when given the choice between a tax cut and helping rape victims , Palin chose tax cuts .
Hmmm … tax cuts .
Is that an issue John McCain will be talking about ?
Would it be worthwhile to link any discussion of John McCain ’s tax cuts to the issue of rape ?
Would that freak McCain out on one of his key GOP talking points ?
Yes it would .
How about turning Palin ’s barracuda name around on her – she ’s a barracuda all right .
Think this is an issue that might be worth jumping on , considering the only messages we ’ve been able to get out all week are that we do n’t hate women and we wish John McCain would stop being mean to us ?
Now imagine what Karl Rove would do with this issue had it been Joe Biden who charged women for rape kits .
It will be telling to see what the Obama campaign does with this .
単一ピクセルのカメラで安価・効率的なイメージングをしようとしている人がいるらしい。
Compressive Imaging : A New Single Pixel Camera
Kelly Lab , Compressive Sensing Group , Rice University
（上記ページより ）
どうやって単一ピクセルでカメラになるのかというと、まず元画像である２次元輝度パターン
X を２次元的なランダムマスクでフィルタリングする（上図のパターンで白いところは光が反射するけれど黒いところは反射しない）。フィルタリングされた光をレンズで集約して１点に集め、その輝度をシングルピクセルカメラ（つまり単一のフォトダイオード）で計測する。マスクパターンを次々に変化させ、各マスクパターンが提示された時点での輝度をそれぞれ記録する。こうして得られた輝度の時系列を
Y （M x 1 行列、Mはパターンの数）、各時点でのパターンが入った行列をΦ（M x N^2 行列 、N^2 はパターンのピクセル数）とすると、これらと元画像
X （N^2 x 1 行列）の関係は
Y＝ΦX
となるので、これ を X について解く（近似する * 1 ）ことで元画 像 X が復元できると。空間的な相関の高い通常の画像の場合は
M < N^2 のサンプル数で十分な再構成が出来るらしい。
（左からそれぞれ元画像、画素数の20%と40%のサンプル数の情報からの復元画像）
従来の手法と比べたときの利点は、まずセンシングの機構が非常に単純になること。何百万画素という２次元センサーアレイを作る必要はないし、高速・高精度で空間をスキャンするための駆動系（ガルバノミラーとか）も必要ない。また、上記のようにいわば画像情報の ” 圧縮”
をセンシングの段階で行えるので、より効率的なイメージングが可能になる。さらにセンサー（とマスク）の応答する周波数帯を変えることで、
CCD や CMOS では捉えられない波長の光でのイメージングも比較的容易に実現できるだろうと。
現在の課題は、マスクパターンを超高速に（たぶん電子的に）更新する機構をどうやって作ろうかな、という辺りらしい。
これって要は逆相関法で視覚細胞の線形受容野を求めようっていう話と同じような枠組みか。この辺の光学系の技術の進歩はもちろんイメージング技術を使う立場としても興味深いし、たまにこんな風にシステム同定的な話としても絡んでくるところも面白い。

To many people ’s happiness , Microsoft made the Windows 10 Creators Update available for download just ahead of the official release that should take place next week .
Whoever has registered in the Windows Insider Program now has access to the new features of the OS ahead of regular users .
However , you do n’t need to join the testing team if you want to see the update as soon as possible .
How to do it ?
The easy way to do it is to download the Windows 10 Update Assistant and to follow the instructions you see .
If you are already part of the Insider Program and want to enjoy the Windows 10 Creators Update , but you do n’t want to receive any more builds in the Insider Preview , than you can choose to do so if you go to the Settings menu and choose this option .
The official date for rolling out the Creators Update is April 11 , but according to recent history , some users may actually have to wait even months in a row in order to have it .
For example , the Anniversary Update released last year reached 90 % of the users that were eligible in seven months .
According to Microsoft , the company will roll the update out gradually , but they hope to complete the process in approximately three months .
And it ’s highly likely for Microsoft to stagger the update , since they will want to get rid of the bugs and at the same time not overwhelm the servers .
As such , it is a sensible move if you want to download it now or during the weekend .
The best news are the fact that the Creators Update will bring lots of new features , such as Paint 3D , braille support , game streaming options , together with improvements in performance and security .
Italian Wind Power Company Enel Opens Biggest Wind Farm in Kansas
October 2nd , 2008 by Andrew Williams
Italian wind energy company Enel SpA has announced that it has inaugurated its biggest ever wind power project , a 250 megawatt U.S. farm .
Enel said in a statement released earlier today that the Smoky Hills plant in Kansas will be fully operational by the end of this year , and will become the largest wind energy installation in the Great Plains state , and one of the largest in the entire country , capable of supplying the power needs of 85,000 U.S. households .
The news follows earlier stories of massive wind farm developments in Texas , including a 781 MW farm in Roscoe , Texas and another 79.5 MW site in the Texas panhandle .

" QUANTUM SHOT " # 482
The Abandoned and the Rusted - out Carcasses of Things Long Gone seem to be a fitting theme for this week - much of doom and gloom has occurred in economy , and most people are concerned about the future .
So we 're just going to play on these apocalyptic sentiments , and serve you a bunch of depressing pictures ...
Sorry .
Desolate places with a soul
We were quite impressed by explorations of Julie Shiel , and her eye for colorful abandonments - so we asked her a few questions , and here is what she has to say about her art .
( most photography is offered as prints for purchase on her site )
Photo taken in the abandoned town of Centralia , PA , which has an ongoing underground coal fire - an inspiration for the movie " Silent Hill " and the book " Strange Highways " by Dean Koontz , among others .
" I find beauty in decay .
I like to see nature conquering what man has left .
I believe that old buildings have a soul , and when I photograph these places I try to capture a piece of that soul . "
This is a rusted lock on the back door of an abandoned International truck
Simply beautiful .
This photo was taken at an old Boy 's school that dated back to the 1700s .
" Most people will never see these places , although they often have a long and interesting history .
There are numerous abandonments from hospitals whose doors have long been shut to simple country houses , and each of them has a story to tell . "
" The Dryad 's Retreat " at the remains of a church dating to the 1800s .
" They call this the " good church " , and there is another close by that is known as the " bad church " .
The history says that these churches served a small mill town on the river .
This church was Catholic , built in the 1800s , but destroyed by fire in the 1920s .
The nearby church was I believe , Presbyterian .
The mill town was destroyed during a hurricane . "
Some of the staircases are pretty evocative , too ...
Who knows maybe the ghosts of past are still proudly sauntering up and down these stairs :
Nature comes through - the vines grow through the window of an abandoned tuberculosis hospital .
In the same tuberculosis hospital we find a corridor bathed in an ephemeral greenish light .
Perfect for first - person - shooter game designer 's inspiration :
Do the " ghosts " come down to sings into these microphones ?
These are the old lamp stands , though -
" Finding places to explore is n't difficult if you are willing to do research , and to me that is part of the fun .
It 's a treasure hunt , and the reward is getting to see and experience places most people never do . "
Exam Room - at an abandoned state school and hospital for children .
" A lot of old institutions still stand simply due to the cost of cleanup .
They are riddled with asbestos , mold , rotting floors , and sometimes home to squatters .
Instead of spending the money to clean them up , they sit and decay a little more with every passing year . "
" End of the Rainbow " - found in an abandoned Boy 's School from the 1700s that was later used as a Naval academy .
" The urban exploration community is close mouthed about their locations with good reason .
I know of an old tuberclosis hospital that is widely known .
It has become a party hangout and has been completely trashed .
It has been set on fire numerous times and scrappers have destroyed the structural integrity of the buildings through stealing copper wiring .
They even cut down the telephone poles .
UE people love and respect these locations .
We want only to document them , to enjoy their beauty and to discover them and it is a horrible thing to see one of our locations be destroyed , whether by people who do n't respect them or by a corporation putting up a strip mall . "
" Frozen in Time " - Who knows how many years ago this clock stopped ? - and the silent operator phone ...
" These old buildings often have amazing architecture that is not often seen any more and we know that their time is limited , so we photograph them . "
Get a load of this ... very spooky icecream cone in the middle of bewitched forest : picture taken in the abandoned amusement park ( see a lot of them here )
" It 's my favorite thing to do , in spite of , or perhaps in part due to the dangers inherent in exploring .
I hope that I can capture photos that represent these places and share them with others . "
Mystery Cage at an abandoned Asylum .
" I do n't know what was the cage was originally for , but a tree has grown up through the middle of it , and ivy surrounds it . " -

Most Fascinating Photography of Abandoned Places
For those who missed our mention of Moscow 's abandoned subway tunnels , here is the creepiest panormaic shot ( click the image to go to 360 VR )

Interestingly , even the wedding photography of this master reflects a thrilling " noir " aspect :
Danila shows us the abandoned Soviet Army base - looks very inviting for a night of exploration :

One developer emailed this video and rejection letter for their app called Pull My Finger .
Especially concerning is that Apple did not reject it due to it being offensive , but instead rejected it due to " limited utility " :
" Hello Developer ,
We 've reviewed your application Pull My Finger .
We have determined that this application is of limited utility to the broad iPhone and iPod touch user community , and will not be published to the App Store .
It may be very appropriate to share with friends and family , and we recommend you review the Ad Hoc method on the Distribution tab of the iPhone Developer Portal for details on distributing this application among a small group of people of your choosing .
Regards ,
Victor Wang
Worldwide Developer Relations
Apple , Inc . "
I think this sets a very bad precedent .
How useful is Koi Pond [ App Store ] ?
( which remains the # 1 app in the App Store ) .
Here 's a developer video of Pull My Finger being demonstrated :
The Linux community has come up with a bunch of new technologies to bring the UI eye candy on Linux to the next level … following the path of a well established player :
Apple with its 8 years old compositing window manager Quartz .
But as it may happen way too often in the Linux desktop community the emphasis is on the technical aspects , not at all on the ease of use and usability improvements : check the following nice / fancy / eye blowing demos , and after the wow effect … think about what it brings .
Here is an interesting Beryl vs Vista videos : the focus is on effects only , except form the clear Apple borrowing ( dock , window in / out effects ) the Beryl side is just as unusable as the Vista one can be …but you have eye candy , and a wiz / bang teenager environment ( jackytouch for the frenchies )
Another one with Compiz - Fusion , same conclusion :
… just try to find a utility , a user experience meaning to this fireworks …. well nothing , in the same vain as vista windows effects and switcher you deactivate to speed up your PC .
Ok the 3D cube is lovely , but come on , playing a 3D game just to switch between workspaces can be called a waste of time , I want to be efficient to do the things I really care on my PC , which ARE NOT looking at the animation between windows !
Then come this little refreshing Linux gem , and , I want to say of course , it is not coming from the " raw " desktop engineering Linux community , but from a lab ( ok , a french one ) , Inria .
It is called Metisse : and at last it clearly states " Usability study and experiment before nice effects ! "
Metisse [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] is an X - based window system designed with two goals in mind .
First , it should make it easy for HCI researchers to design and implement innovative window management techniques Second , it should conform to existing standards and be robust and efficient enough to be used on a daily basis , making it a suitable platform for the evaluation of the proposed techniques .
Metisse is not focused on a particular kind of interaction ( e.g. 3D ) and should not be seen as a new desktop proposal .
It is rather a tool for creating new types of desktop environments .
Quote from the Metisse web site .
Checkout this simple idea about copy / paste : why on earth it is not like that today … .
This one shows also some interesting usability concepts :
The chicken is trying to pull a nice , juicy worm out of the ground , but it 's not budging .
So she enlists the help of the rabbit , but the two of them still can't do it .
Soon the whole barnyard is helping her pull , when ... This satisfying , circular story with a repetitive refrain will have even the youngest readers wanting to help pull on that stubborn worm !
Second bill tackles laptop border searches
Three U.S. lawmakers announced this week that they had proposed a law to limit the searches of laptops or other electronic devices to cases where customs agents have reasonable suspicion of illegal activity .
The Travelers Privacy Protection Act , a bill written by U.S. Senators Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , and Maria Cantwell , D - Wash . , and Representative Adam Smith , D - Wash . , would allow border agents to search electronic devices only if they had reasonable suspicions of wrongdoing .
In addition , the legislation would limit the length of time that a device could be out of its owner 's possession to 24 hours , after which the search becomes a seizure , requiring probable cause .
The lawmakers decided to propose the legislation after the Department of Homeland Security failed to provide adequate information about the searches or the limitations on the power , Feingold said in a statement .
" Most Americans would be shocked to learn that upon their return to the U.S. from traveling abroad , the government could demand the password to their laptop , hold it for as long as it wants , pore over their documents , emails , and photographs , and examine which websites they visited - all without any suggestion of wrongdoing , " Feingold said in the statement .
" Focusing our limited law enforcement resources on law - abiding Americans who present no basis for suspicion does not make us any safer and is a gross violation of privacy . "
The legislation is the second bill to tackle the controversial issue of laptop border searches .
Last month , Rep. Loretta Sanchez , D - Calif. , introduced the Border Security Search Accountability Act , which would require that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security report to Congress on the number of searches and inform targeted individuals of their rights .
Civil - liberties organizations and business - travel groups have taken issue with the suspension of normal search rules for electronic devices at the U.S. border .
In February , the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Asian Law Caucus sued the Department of Homeland Security over the invasive searches .
In May , a federal district court 's ruling upholding the searches led to a broad coalition of groups warning international travelers to leave their electronic devices at home , if possible .
Like the previous bill , the TPPA would require that federal agents stringently protect any information take from a citizen 's electronic devices and mandate that the DHS regularly report to Congress on their activities .

USS Grunion Found by Commanding Officers Sons ( Photos )
The Navy has confirmed that the USS Grunion SS216 is the sunken vessel that was first discovered on the ocean floor off the Aleutian Islands of Alaska in 2006 .
The sons of the ships commanding officer launched a search team to verify that the vessel was their father 's submarine .
The crew of 70 reported heavy anti submarine activity on July 30 , 1942 .
That was the last time the sub was heard from .
The Navy reported the vessel lost on August 16 , 1942 .
Sons Bruce , Brad and John Abele first formed a plan to locate their father 's missing vessel in 2002 .
It August 2006 a team of side scan sonar experts located a ' target ' near Sitka , a mile below the surface .
A second expedition was mounted in August 2007 and video and high resolution pictures were obtained .
Rear Admiral Douglas McAneny announce in a news conference from Pearl Harbor that the missing submarine had been found thanks to the efforts of the sons of Lt. Commander Mannert L. ' Jim ' Abele .
A memorial service , arranged by family members , will be held on October 11th in Cleveland for the 70 lost souls some 66 years ago .

The 3D machine allows students to practise
In a lecture theatre at Kingston University the students don their 3D goggles .
" It 's a bit like going to the Imax cinema , " quips one student .
But the sophisticated equipment , costing £ 300,000 , has a much more serious purpose - to train radiotherapy students to treat cancer .
It is a 3D simulation of radiotherapy treatment in which students are able to use a remote control to " give " the right dose in the right place on the image of a cancer patient 's body , which beamed onto a large screen .
Seeing inside the body
The intricate machinery produces three - dimensional images of both the patient and the machine .
It allows us to see into the patient so we can see where the beams are being directed and what each beam is doing
Sophie Main Geraldine Francis , head of Kingston 's school of radiography , said the equipment would allow students to make mistakes without endangering patients .
" They need to make mistakes because they will learn more effectively : they would n't be allowed to make a mistake in a department , " she said .
" They can do what they need to in a safe environment .
" They can make mistakes , crash the machine , take as long as they need to practise , because you cannot practise on a patient .
Gaining experience Mrs Francis said using the technique should mean students can work with real patients much sooner .
" The overall period of training will not change , but they will be able to help in clinics and relieve pressures sooner .
" Before , putting across concepts has been difficult because it is difficult to visualise what we do .
" Now they can see where doses are being given within the body , and can see structures like the kidney and the spinal cord , which are meant to be avoided .
" They can also see how we can adapt the procedures to make sure patients get the right amount of radiation in a safe and accurate way . "
Students can see which parts of the body to target
The equipment has been paid for by the Department of Health as part of a £ 5 m programme across England to improve radiotherapy training .
By 2016 , the number of radiotherapy treatments required by patients will almost double .
The system is getting a good response from the students who have had a chance to use it .
Getting skilled Sophie Main , a third - year student said : " I think it is fabulous and I definitely think it will benefit first year students .
I do feel the benefits .
" It allows us to see into the patient so we can see where the beams are being directed and what each beam is doing .
Users have to wear 3D goggles " It also allows us to have a go and practise , meaning that we do n't have to take up too much of the radiologists ' time or leave the patient feeling uncomfortable on the bed while we set up .
"
Third year student Anne Lewis agreed .
" When you are in the first year , before you go into the units , it is difficult to visualise .
But with this you can see inside the patient .
" It 's like being at the Imax .
It is really clever , " she said .
Superintendent radiographer at the Royal Marsden Hospital Sarah Armstrong said the training would help increase confidence .
" In the past , it could be quite daunting for undergraduates furthering their training at the Royal Marsden to find themselves handling a £ 2 million piece of equipment for the first time , but now they will have some knowledge of the apparatus before they arrive , " she said .

What are these ?
One day soon , you may be able to pinpoint the geographic origins of your ancestors based on analysis of your DNA .
A study published online this week in Nature by an international team that included Cornell University researchers describes the use of DNA to predict the geographic origins of individuals from a sample of Europeans , often within a few hundred kilometers of where they were born .
" What we found is that within Europe , individuals with all four grandparents from a given region are slightly more similar genetically to one another , on average , than to individuals from more distant regions , " said Carlos Bustamante , associate professor of biological statistics and computational biology at Cornell and the paper 's senior author .
John Novembre , an assistant professor in the University of California - Los Angeles ' Department of Ecology and Evolution , was lead author of the study that also included researchers from GlaxoSmithKline , the University of Chicago and the University of Lausanne ( Switzerland ) .
" When these minute differences are compounded across the whole of their genome , we have surprisingly high power to predict where in Europe they came from , " Bustamante added .
This is one of the first studies to examine genome - wide patterns of genetic variation across a large sample of Europeans , and to use these data to predict ancestry .
The methodology has wide - ranging implications for using DNA samples from unrelated individuals to identify genes underlying complex diseases , as well as forensics , personalized genomics and the study of recent human history .
Using data from a sample of almost 3,200 Europeans supplied by GlaxoSmithKline , the team analyzed more than 500,000 genetic points known as single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , or minute sequence variations in DNA .
The researchers focused its analysis on individuals for whom all the grandparents were believed to come from the same country .
The team simplified and plotted the data , revealing that individuals with similar genetic structures clustered together on the plot in such a way that the major geographic features of Europe became distinguishable .
" What is really surprising is that when we summarize the data from 500,000 SNPs in just two dimensions , we see this striking map of Europe , " said Novembre .
" We can recognize the Iberian peninsula , the Italian peninsula , southeastern Europe , Turkey and Cyprus . "
The resolution of the genetic map was so precise that the investigators were able to find genetic differences among the French , German and Italian - speaking Swiss individuals ; with French speakers being more similar to the French , German speakers to Germans and Italian speakers to Italians .
Based on these observations , Novembre and colleagues from the University of Chicago developed a novel algorithm for classifying individuals geographically based on their patterns of DNA variation .
For well - sampled countries , this approach placed 50 percent of individuals within 310 kilometers ( km ) of their reported origin , and 90 percent within 700 km of their origin .
Across all populations , 50 percent of individuals were placed within 540 km of their reported origin and 90 percent of individuals within 840 km .
The findings excluded individuals with grandparents from different countries , since these were assigned locations between their grandparents ' origins .
Some next steps will be to infer origins for people with recent ancestry from multiple locations and to perform similar analyses for populations on other continents .
The study was funded by the Giorgi - Cavaglieri Foundation , the Swiss National Science Foundation , the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. , and GlaxoSmithKline .
Russ Feingold , John McCain 's friend and partner on campaign finance reform , offers a description of his colleague to the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel 's Craig Gilbert that veers sharply from the approved message .
Like McCain , Feingold is known for speaking his mind , sometimes at the expense of his own party .
But unlike McCain in the GOP or , say , Lieberman among Dems , Feingold 's liberal credentials are unimpeachable .
Which makes his praise all the more tough to dismiss .
If some of the below is not soon incorporated into a McCain ad , mail piece , stump speech or surrogate talking point , I 'll go vegan for the rest of the cycle :
Washington —
If Republican John McCain needs someone to vouch for his independence , he could easily do worse than Senate colleague Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , a liberal Democrat from a key battleground state .
" I think the guy calls 'em as he sees 'em , and as president would call 'em as he sees 'em , and would make people mad all over the place because it would n't fit anybody 's playbook , " said Feingold , who teamed up with McCain to rewrite federal campaign laws .
" He would be very original , " Feingold said .
Those are not exactly Democratic talking points .
In fact , while Feingold supports his fellow Democrat Barack Obama for president , he continues to express ( when asked ) his affection and admiration for McCain , even in ways that deviate from his party 's core strategy against the Arizona Republican , which is to paint him as a clone of President Bush , and a " maverick no more . "
Feingold calls McCain " very original " and a " maverick by nature . "
McCain 's own TV ads call him the " original maverick . "
" I 'd rather have Obama for many , many reasons , " Feingold said , citing his deep differences with McCain over foreign policy , health care and civil liberties , and his belief that Obama could be an inspirational president .
He also is critical of McCain 's campaign , suggesting that its efforts to " tarnish " Obama may end up tarnishing McCain as well .
" But the notion that somehow [ McCain ] is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological Newt Gingrich right - winger is a joke .
There 's no way that he would do that , " Feingold said .

In his sharpest criticism yet of John McCain and Sarah Palin , Barack Obama went after the idea that the Republicans represent change while campaigning in Terre Haute , IN today .
For the first time Obama went directly after Sarah Palin , “ I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she ’s change , and that ’s great .
She ’s a skillful politician .
But , you know , when you ’ve been taking all these earmarks when it ’s convenient , and then suddenly you ’re the champion anti-earmark person , that ’s not change .
Come on !
I mean , words mean something , you ca n’t just make stuff up . ”
He also mocked the idea of John McCain as a change agent , “ And suddenly he ’s the change agent ?
Ha .
He says , ‘ I ’m going to tell those lobbyists that their days of running Washington are over . ’
Who is he going to tell ?
Is he going to tell his campaign chairman , who ’s one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington ?
Is he going to tell his campaign manager , who was one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington ?
I mean , come on , they must think you ’re stupid . ”
Advertisements
Obama is accurate on both accounts .
Palin and McCain are agents of changing their own positions .
In Palin ’s case she was for earmarks and the Bridge to Nowhere before she against them and McCain likes to say that he went against his party on immigration , which he did , but then he flip - flopped to party ’s position , and now does not even speak about immigration reform on the campaign trail .
I do n’t know why the McCain campaign is attempting to use another strategy from the failed Hillary Clinton primary playbook .
Clinton was able to beat Obama in the primaries when she started talking about the economy and policy , not by trying out change agent him .
The GOP will not beat Obama in November by trying to run a personality campaign .
Obama owns the change mantle , and I do n’t see how a 72 year old Washington insider , who agrees with the current administration , and whose campaign is run by lobbyists can be seriously viewed by voters as someone who will bring change .

Is Glenn Beck yanking our chain or is he sincerely worried about the prospect of a New World Order and a One World Currency ?
Beck went on CNN ’s Headline News and launched into a diatribe , or what appeared to be a diatribe .
“ There is a global meltdown coming , ” warned Beck .
“ It is a global depression , and a One World currency , and a One World financial system is the endgame . ”
In order to make his point , Beck named two nations — China and France — calling for the destruction of monetary nationalism and in the process the elimination of national sovereignty in favor of a “ One World Order , a New World Order . ”
It is nothing short of stupendous a neocon of Beck ’s stripe would be allowed to talk like this on a tightly controlled and meticulously orchestrated venue owned by the very multinational corporations calling for globalization .
Or is it ?
Is it possible CNN is simply familiarizing us with the concept , using Beck ’s feigned alarm to get our attention ?
Glenn Beck , the faux libertarian who calls for the speech of others to be curtailed , cannot be trusted , even if what he says is absolutely true — the New World Order indeed exists , even as Beck ’s corporate media colleagues declare that people who talk about it are cranks and a conspiracy nut cases .
The New World Order wants to do everything — and more , much more — that Beck mentions in his supposed rant .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Beck and his buddies know the NWO is for real because they are professional and highly paid shills in its service .
Glenn
Beck is on a short chain and his diatribes are scripted down to every syllable and nuance .
Glenn Beck would not dare mention the New World Order without permission .
CNN is not a soapbox in the local park where anybody can say whatever they want .
Glenn
Beck does not improvise , he is not allowed the liberty to ad lib .
CNN wants you to get used to all of this …
economic depression , one world currency , the engineered destruction of sovereignty — both national and personal — and above all a suffocating globalism , that is to say planetary corporatism , in other words global fascism , as Mussolini understood corporatism and fascism to be inseparable , in fact one and the same .
Do n’t be suckered by Beck ’s scripted honesty .
He is merely inserting these words into the dialogue .
Consider the words of David Rockefeller :
“ We are grateful to the Washington Post , the New York Times , Time Magazine , and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years .
It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years .
But now the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto - determination practiced in past centuries . ”
Ditto for CNN and its puppet on wires , Glenn Beck .
He is merely helping David Rockefeller and the globalists realize there fascistic dream of world domination .

" The first half of 2008 has seen a notable change in client expectations and investment choices , " said Peter Braunwalder , chief executive of HSBC Private Bank ( Suisse ) , the British - based bank 's main affiliate catering to the ultra-rich .
" Faced with inflation worries , volatile asset prices and sudden changes in exchange rates , a majority of investors have reduced their transaction volumes in equities , bonds , and structured products , " he told a news briefing in Geneva .
This was particularly true for clients from Asia , whose demand for complex investment tools such as equity derivatives has " drastically decreased " in response to recent financial market upheaval , said Braunwalder .
" Concurrently , most clients increased their cash allocation and , for some , their leverage , " he added .
Investors worldwide have been scrambling to find a safe place for their savings this year in the face of a global economic slowdown , a credit crisis that has spooked markets , and an energy price spike spurring concerns about inflation .
Alexandre Zeller , who will replace Braunwalder as HSBC Private Bank ( Suisse ) chief on October 1 , said that concerns about inflation would dominate many investing decisions ahead .
" My worry is that a lot of liquidity has been injected in the markets by central banks to solve the ( credit ) crisis , " the former head of Banque Cantonale Vaudoise said , raising concerns about how that liquidity will be removed from the market , and whether interest rates would have to rise as a result .
HSBC Private Bank ( Suisse ) , rated AA by Standard and Poor 's and Aa3 by Moody's , has been more shielded from recent banking sector woes than its larger Swiss rivals UBS and Credit Suisse .
But the Geneva - based bank said the first six months of 2008 were necessarily arduous in light of " the most difficult financial markets for several decades . "
" Record levels of volatility across asset classes and markets have made clients more hesitant to move their assets between financial institutions , " it said .
Assets under management decreased by 13 percent or 23.8 billion Swiss francs ( $ 21.7 billion ) to 162 billion Swiss francs , compared to December 2007 , due both to unfavorable markets and the drop of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc .
Net new money flows were 6.9 billion francs in the first half , with most funds coming from Europe , the Middle East , and Asia , the HSBC unit reported .
Zeller said he considered that inflow " substantial " and stood by the bank 's goal to grow assets under management by 60 percent over the next three years .
" I think this is something that we can achieve , " he said .
The Witcher Sells 1 Million Copies On ' Dead ' Platform
Noting the number represent sales to " real , live people " playing on a platform some have declared " dead " , CD Projekt RED announced that its debut project The Witcher ( PC ) has sold through one million copies since the game 's release twelve months ago .
" We created The Witcher with the intent of becoming an acclaimed and successful development studio that always made games for its fans ; we spent more than $ 11 million developing The Witcher and the Enhanced Edition , and it sure is nice to make some of that money back ! " said CEO Adam Kicinski about the milestone .
CD Projekt followed the original release of The Witcher with an Enhanced Edition last month , offering re-recorded dialogue , additional NPCs models , improved load times and many other improvements .
The company also recently launched Good Old Games , a digital distribution platform for classic PC games .
A hit - and - run driver who killed a man with his Bentley is suing the city – for damaging his car while it was impounded .
Harry Shasho , 38 , claims he ’s due $ 190,000 because cops impounding his 2005 Bentley Continental – the car involved in his fatal Brooklyn hit - and - run – allowed mold to fester inside .
But he makes no mention anywhere in the suit about the reason it was impounded .
Shasho was arrested in the early hours of Oct. 1 , 2005 , after mowing down Louis Couch on Ocean Parkway .
Shasho heartlessly took off and left the man to die in the street .
According to police , Shasho hit Couch , 54 , and then drove home .
He was arrested within hours after cops found a side - view mirror in the road .
The windshield was also cracked , and the headlight , fender and roof were damaged .
Shasho , who owns the Brooklyn - based 212 Motoring , which customizes luxury cars , pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident without reporting it .
He served 20 days of community service , lost his license for six months , and was on probation for five years .
Now Shasho claims the car “ was in excellent condition , proper working order and fully functional . . . with no noticeable defects or damage ” when the police impounded it .
In the year and a half cops parked it in a Queens impound as evidence , they allowed mold to grow inside and water damage to occur , “ rendering the vehicle inoperable , ” the suit claims .
He claims they violated his property rights by not returning it to him in “ good condition . ”
Shasho wants the NYPD to fork over $ 190,000 .
He did not return messages , and his lawyer refused to comment on the case .

Terrorist Fear Mongering Seems to be Working Less Well
BART , the San Francisco subway authority , has been debating allowing passengers to bring drinks on trains .
There are all sorts of good reasons why or why not — convenience , problems with spills , and so on — but one reason that makes no sense is that terrorists may bring flammable liquids on board .
Yet that is exactly what BART managers said .
No big news — we ’ve seen stupid things like this regularly since 9/11 — but this time people responded :
Added Director Tom Radulovich , “ If somebody wants to break the law and bring flammable liquids on , they can .
It ’s not like al Qaeda is waiting in their caves for us to have a sippy - cup rule . ”
Directing his comments to BART administrators , he said , “ You know , it ’s just fearmongering and you should be ashamed . ”

The Federal Reserve , which has encouraged excessive borrowing , is to blame for the credit crunch that has gripped world markets for more than a year , Marc Faber , the author of the Gloom Boom & Doom Report , told CNBC on Tuesday .
" About 15 percent of U.S. households have negative equity .
Who supplied the leverage into the system ?
It 's called the Federal Reserve Board , " Faber said .
" If I 'm the drug dealer I 'm not responsible that everybody takes drugs , but I facilitate it , especially if I give it out free of charge , I can enlarge the market share , and that 's what the Fed has done . "
Liquidity will dry up even more , volatility will stay high and financial assets are going to suffer as the crisis continues to unfold .
The bailout plan is unlikely to work and the global economy will take the hit , he predicted .
" People rely on the people in Congress , at the Fed , at the Treasury , people that brought us into this trouble , to take us out of trouble .
I do n't think they will succeed , " Faber said .
" We can have recovery rallies but a new high on the S&P is practically out of the question for a very long time .
In real terms , equities are still very high and economically , I think the world will go into a slump . "
The main provider of global liquidity was the U.S. current account deficit , which increased at a fast pace over the past 10 years , but this will no longer be the case .

Predictions vs. Reality in Iraq
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
On September 10 , 2002 , I asked 35 questions regarding war with Iraq .
The war resolution passed on October 16 , 2002 .
Now today , as some of my colleagues try to reestablish credentials regarding spending restraint , I want to call attention to my 18th question from six years ago :
 Are we willing to bear the economic burden of a 100 billion dollar war against Iraq , with oil prices expected to skyrocket and further rattle an already shaky American economy ?
How about an estimated 30 - year occupation of Iraq that some have deemed necessary to " build democracy " there ?
Many scoffed at my radical predictions at the time , regarding them as hyperbole .
Six years later , I am forced to admit that I was wrong .
My radical predictions were in fact , not radical enough .
I warned of a draining 30 - year occupation .
Now , politicians glibly talk about a 100 - year occupation as if it is no big deal .
On cost , according to estimates from the Congressional Research Service , we have already burned through around $ 550 billion in Iraq , at a rate of about $ 2 billion per week .
Economist Joseph Stiglitz ’s estimates are even higher , at $ 12 billion a month .
It is a total price tag quickly heading into the trillions , if we do n’t stop bombing and rebuilding bridges in Iraq that lead us nowhere but bankruptcy !
Bridges in this country are crumbling along with our economy , while some howl about earmarks .
Earmarks are a drop in the bucket compared to war and occupation .
Yes , I was wrong about Iraq .
I knew it would be bad .
I did n’t know it would be this bad .
The American people deserve better .
Being asked to endorse such a farce is beyond insulting .
Clearly , the rosy predictions of the neo-Conservatives from before the war are not coming true .
Far from it !
With a straight face , one official estimated the TOTAL cost of reconstruction in Iraq would be just $ 1.7 billion .
Turns out that we spend more than that in ONE WEEK .
Our friends are not pitching in to cover the cost .
Expenses are not being covered by oil from a grateful and liberated Iraqi people .
Rather , big corporate interests are benefitting , the price of oil has more than quadrupled , and the American economy is on its knees and sinking fast .
No one predicted the exact course of this war before it started .
But to continue to listen to the foreign policy advice of those that were the MOST off base will only lead to more foreign policy disasters .
We need to keep this in mind as we think about Russia , Iran , Cuba and other countries .
Keep in mind — the doomsday predictions on the Iraq War from six years ago , sound like a cakewalk today .
While what leaders in the administration had predicted , reads like a fairytale .
Ask yourself , when listening to the same foreign policy experts  explaining situations around the world and suggesting policy positions :
In light of the facts of today , and the predictions of yesterday , how expert have they shown themselves to be ?
Passing HR 2605 to sunset authorization for the use of force in Iraq is the first step to stopping this bloody war , and the consequent bleeding of our treasuries .
Serious fiscal conservatives will support it , as will those who have been paying attention to foreign policy predictions and reality .

The Best of Ron Paul
When we do not have a fixed idea about the aquarium we want , the wide selection of aquariums available in the stores can be overwhelming .
However , choosing our first aquarium is easier than you think .
Ideally , before you buy it , do some research and inform yourself about the requirements of space , habitat and specific care , among others , that you will need the fish you are interested in maintaining .
If we had the good fortune to start with a complete aquarium with aquarium filter , it may have seemed like a great wonder , because it seems that the filter will absorb all the dirt from the water and the water will be clean and we will no longer have to change it .
The filter becomes the salvation for that dirty and smelly water , which many people believe is associated with keeping fish .
Location of your first aquarium :
The location will be key to the proper maintenance of the aquarium .
Placing it in an area of the house that you do not frequent much go is not recommended , since you may not notice in time if there is a problem in the aquarium , with the operation of an accessory , if a fish is sick , etc .
It is always better to place the aquarium in an area where you spend a lot of time every day .
At the end of the day , aquariums are beautiful and relaxing , it is better to enjoy them as much as possible .
The main thing in an aquarium is aquarium filter , without which the fishes cannot survive !
Even more important is to place the aquarium where it is easy to access it for regular and practical maintenance .
Keep in mind that , once full , the aquarium will weigh at least 1.2 kg per litre .
This means that even a 19 - litre nano aquarium will weigh a considerable 23 kg .
Think carefully and choose wisely the place where you will place the aquarium to avoid having to move it later .
Place the aquarium on a stable and level surface .
As we mentioned before , the aquarium will weigh at least 1.2 kg per litre , so a stable surface is more than necessary .
In case of doubt , consult a professional to ensure that the furniture or surface is able to support the weight of the aquarium .
Also , try to place the aquarium on a flat , level surface .
In this way , you will make sure that the water is also level and you will help to avoid excessive pressure in the tank .
Size of your first aquarium
There is a tendency towards the decision of the first aquarium that the smaller it is easier to maintain , have you heard it too ?
Pay attention , nothing is further from reality .
Generally , the bigger the aquarium , the better it will be for your fish .
First , you will have more space to include a greater diversity of fish , plants and decoration .
Secondly , and more importantly , a larger volume of water helps maintain more stable parameters ( such as temperature , for example ) and dilute the toxic residues of nitrogen ( ammonia and nitrite ) that can accumulate over time .
The fish in your first aquarium
Again , research about the fish species that you would like to keep in your first aquarium .
Find out what size they can reach and if they are compatible with each other .
Remember that a nice 8 cm coloured fish will not keep that size forever .
Find out about their natural habitat to know the aspects to consider , such as decoration , what is their behaviour , feeding , temperature and with what other fish or species usually live together .
Types of filtration
Choosing the type of aquarium filter , that you will use in your first aquarium is often considered the most difficult part of buying an aquarium , but it should not be since there are only 3 main options : backpack filters , external or internal .
Backpack filters , such as AquaClear and the Fluval C series , are the most common for aquariums up to 189 - 227 litres .
These are attached to the back of the aquarium easily , absorb water from the aquarium and lead to a series of mechanical , biological and chemical filters .
Its maintenance is simple , relatively cheap and reliable filters .
The external filters are often used in aquariums of over 227 litres or have a large number of fish .
Generally , external filters are placed in a cabinet under the aquarium , so that they are hidden .
The external filters Fluval have spent decades in the market and have a wide variety of sizes with numerous options of filter media for a wide range of possibilities .
The internal filters , as the name suggests , are submerged in the aquarium .
They can be used as main filters in small aquariums or as complementary filters in aquariums of more than 189 - 227 litres .
Its exclusive design makes it possible to place them in the bottom of the aquarium , so they are especially ideal for aquariums where the water level is low .
But although the sellers try to convince us of this , this is not the case .
The filters do not make dirty water clean , but its work is tremendously important for any aquarium .
So the aquarium filter is not something optional in an aquarium , but something essential .
Then we will explain more about them and which is the most appropriate for each type of aquarium .
In the filters is where a large part of the nitrogen cycle will be carried out , they are the aquarium ’s purifier , and that is what we are going to explain now .
What is the nitrogen cycle ?
The truth is that it sounds like something strange and complicated
For nothing , do not worry .
I will explain it to you in a very simple way : all the waste of the fish , remains of plants and excess of food not consumed , are transformed into ammonia .
As you know , ammonia ( NH3 ) is a very toxic product , which is why fish usually die in unfiltered tanks , or in new aquariums where fish have been put in without waiting for the maturation process .
NEWSMAKER INTERVIEW :
One of the oil industry ’s most influential voices called Monday for a temporary 1970s - style rationing of gasoline in parts of the United States to help avoid hurricane - related shortages and declared that the Bush administration , the Congress and the two men running for president have failed to exhibit the courage needed to solve America ’s longer - term energy problems .
“ We need to get a Congress that is willing to make some courageous decisions , and we need to have a president willing to make courageous decisions with respect to energy supply , ” former Shell Oil Co. President John Hofmeister told editors and reporters at The Washington Times .
Mr. Hofmeister , who now serves as chairman of the National Urban League , also said that America ’s current economic crisis is disproportionately hurting middle - and lower - income families .
“ The economy is actually quite weak for middle - and low - income folks because of the drain on their disposable income ” resulting from soaring energy , food and health care costs , he said .
“ America is suffering a lot more than is being reported . ”
Mr. Hofmeister laid blame squarely on the country ’s political leaders , saying President Bush unnecessarily waited 7 1/2 years as gas prices soared to lift a presidential moratorium on offshore drilling and that Congress has made only token gestures to solve an energy crisis that requires significant action .
As for the men seeking to succeed Mr. Bush , Mr. Hofmeister said he has talked with energy advisers to both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain and has n’t heard a comprehensive solution .
Both candidates , for example , oppose drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , although Mr. McCain recently reversed his opposition to most offshore drilling and has endorsed a massive expansion of nuclear power .
“ Both campaigns have good ideas , ” Mr. Hofmeister said .
But “ this whole energy set of issues needs a short - term , a medium - term and a long - term set of solutions .
Neither campaign is looking at it holistically .
“ If you are running a corporation , you always have a short - , medium - and long - term strategy , ” he added .
“ If you are running U.S. government , you tend to run it on political time , which is , ‘ What do we have to do in preparation for the next election ? ’ ”
Mr. Hofmeister suggested that the government impose limited gasoline rationing over the next four to six weeks , targeting regions where supplies will be reduced because hurricanes have shut down Gulf Coast refineries by temporarily cutting off their power .
Mr. Hofmeister recommended introducing an odd - even plan that he said successfully addressed short - term gasoline shortages during the energy crisis of the early 1970s .
Drivers whose license plates ended in an odd number would be able to purchase gasoline on odd - numbered days .
He also recommended limiting the amount of gasoline drivers can purchase .
The United States will be in “ a world of hurt ” for the next four to six weeks as the oil industry recovers from the damage from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike , said Mr. Hofmeister .
The areas where rationing will be needed include the Southeast and extend northward toward Denver , the upper Midwest and Washington , D.C. , he said .
Not everybody is on board with that idea .
“ It ’s hard to support rationing , ” said Mary Novak , managing director of energy services at Global Insight .
“ We did n’t ration after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
Until we are experiencing some extraordinary pricing , rationing should not be necessary . ”
The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) also declined to endorse Mr. Hofmeister ’s rationing recommendation .
“ It ’s normal for prices to increase following periods of constraint - that ’s what happens when supply and demand are imbalanced , ” said DOE press secretary Healy Baumgardner .
“ The Department of Energy is mitigating impacts to American families by working with the EPA to issue multi-state fuel waivers , releasing emergency exchanges from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and monitoring gas - price gouging . ”
Mr. Hofmeister also lashed out at the U.S. political system ’s failure to muster the courage to address the nuclear waste problem .
He lamented the “ fundamental problem in Congress , ” where he said it appeared to be more important to follow the rules of the Senate that permit two senators representing 2.5 million Nevadans to block the solution to the nuclear - waste storage problem at the expense of 300 million other Americans .
Mr. Hofmeister decried the “ lack of an energy policy in this country for most of the last 50 years , ” saying Americans became spoiled during the 1990s when energy prices hit “ bargain - basement ” levels , when oil sold for as little as $ 10 per barrel .
He stood behind a statement he made in congressional testimony earlier this year as the price of oil headed toward $ 147 per barrel .
“ $ 65 is a pretty good price , ” he said .
Mr. Hofmeister recently founded Citizens for Affordable Energy , which advocates increasing the supply of energy from all sources and making major investments in energy infrastructure .
“ We need a whole lot more energy to sustain the lifestyle we ’ve chosen for ourselves , ” he said .

Dabic was a regular contributor to Belgrade 's " Healthy Life " magazine , according to the magazine 's editor - in - chief Goran Kojic .
On January 28 , 2008 , he attended a conference sponsored by " Healthy Life . "
A video of him at the conference was made by Kikinda Television in Serbia and has been posted online by the BBC .
Dabic was known as a " researcher in the fields of psychology and bio-energy . " *
He gave lectures on healthy living and billed himself as an expert in calmness and meditation .
His website says that people are programmed to live to between 120 and 130 , an age that could be reached by those who took his quantum energy treatments , which he called the David Wellbeing Programme .
Reports from attendees at his lectures indicate that they were attended by up to 400 participants at a time .
Dabic was also a regular at The Madhouse bar where he drank red wine , according to bar owner Misko Kovijanic , and was known as an expert in human quantum energy .
A neighbor described Dabic as a polite man who always said hello and always wore black . *
It is not clear whether the bar owner wore one of the charms Dabic sold to harmonize bioenergy and protect the wearer from evil radiation .
As is usual with people who make extraordinary claims that defy a scientific understanding of the world and stretch credulity to the borderlands of sanity , nobody bothered to check Dabic 's credentials or investigate his ridiculous claims .
Had they done a little investigation they might have discovered that Dabic 's real name is Radovan Karadžić , a fugitive wanted for genocide , including the massacre at Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo .
Hard to believe that nice man at the end of the bar having a belly laugh with his buddies is a mass murderer , is n't it ?
Especially when he helps so many people with his quackery .
Karadžić was arrested in Belgrade on July 21 , 2008 .
Before his arrest , he was last seen in public in the eastern Bosnian town of Han Pijesak in July 1996 .
Karadžić was trained as a psychiatrist , which , according to Peter Finn and Kevin Sullivan of the Washington Post , " appears to have helped him fit into the world of alternative medicine . "
As of January 2014 , Karadžić remains in the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . [ new ]
On March 24 , 2016 , Karadžić was convicted of genocide , war crimes , and crimes against humanity by a United Nations tribunal .
He was accused of terror against civilians that included the slaughter of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica in 1995 and the nearly four - year siege of Sarajevo .
Karadžić , now 70 , was sentenced to 40 years in prison . [ / new ]

WASHINGTON , Sept. 16 ( UPI ) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says the United States should begin direct negotiations with Iran over its nuclear enrichment program .
Kissinger , speaking Monday at George Washington University along with four other former U.S. State Department secretaries , said the next president should initiate high - level discussions with Iran " without conditions , " ABC News reported .

The opinion of the former secretary of state for Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford differs sharply with that of the current GOP administration , which has maintained a strict policy of not negotiating directly with governments deemed to sponsor international terrorism .
The Bush administration has demanded that Iran dismantle its nuclear program as a precondition for any direct talks .
The other former secretaries of state , Madeleine Albright , James Baker III , Warren Christopher and Colin Powell , were asked to identify the biggest challenges the next president will face .
They answered the fight against terrorism , restoring America 's reputation abroad , r-building U.S. economic power and global climate change , ABC reported .
Mr. Fossett ’s aircraft was discovered Wednesday in a remote area of Inyo National Forest , about 120 miles south of the Nevada ranch where he departed on Sept. 3 , 2007 .
Mr. Fossett , a renowned aviator , had said he was going on a brief flight but never returned , and the transmitter on his aircraft did not send any location signals .
At his wife ’s request , Mr. Fossett , 63 , was declared legally dead in February by a judge in Chicago .

Mr. Rosenker said parts of the transmitter had been found , along with other pieces of Mr. Fossett ’s plane , in a debris field some 150 feet wide and 400 feet long .
Initial indications are that the plane hit a mountain , at an altitude of about 10,100 feet , and then burst into flame , investigators said .
There was no sign the plane had been on fire before the crash , Mr. Rosenker said , but the plane ’s engine was found 300 feet from the fuselage , which indicated an intense impact .
The wreckage lay about nine miles northwest of Mammoth Lakes , a popular ski village , and about 12 miles from the town ’s airstrip .
It is an area so remote that it required a 45 - minute hike from the nearest path up steep hills , said the director of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management , Gary Derks , who visited the site and led the five - week search last fall for Mr. Fossett .
About 30 investigators and other recovery personnel were on the scene , with volunteers and representatives from local sheriffs ’ departments camping overnight in frigid temperatures to protect the scene .

The region where the plane wreckage was found had been flown over repeatedly during the search last year , but Mr. Derks said the area was dense , mountainous forest where something as small as a two - seat light aircraft would be easy to overlook .
An Australian woman is blind three days out of every six because her eyes involuntarily shut and she cannot open them , a report has said .
The woman 's mysterious medical condition has left doctors puzzled .
Natalie Adler , who experts believe may be the only person in the world with this condition , said she has had this medical predicament since she was 17 .
" I woke one Sunday and my eyes were swollen .
It was the day before an English exam , " the 21 - year - old told Melbourne 's Herald Sun .
" My eyes started closing intermittently , really randomly , but within a few weeks they were closing for three days [ at a time ] . "
Doctors from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital said Ms Adler 's condition was baffling .
" She 's a one - off and we do n't have a diagnosis , " said Professor Justin O'Day of the hospital 's neuro - ophthalmology department .
" It 's unusual to see somebody with this degree of spasming and eyelid closure , especially at this age .
There is no known cause . "
Professor O'Day said the medical condition blepharospasm , which causes an involuntary closing of the eyes , could be used as a reference but that it did not explain why Ms Adler 's eyes closed according to a routine .
Botox treatment
When Ms Adler 's eyes are closed , she cannot see at all except through a small slit in her left eye .
On the days when they are open , she can see clearly but her left eyelid droops .
For almost two years , doctors treated her by injecting Botox around her eyes , allowing her to see for five days out of six .
But the treatment no longer works for Ms Adler , who also suffers from fatigue and nausea , and she is now hopeful that electrical stimulation tests around her eyes might help .
Ms Adler plans her life around her condition , but still misses some important dates .
" On my 18th birthday , my eyes were closed , but on my 21st they were open , so I had a party , " she said .
" Not being able to go to the football or seeing my friends as much is what I miss the most . "

Courtesy of Entertainment Weekly , we ’ve got the first two photos from the upcoming sci - fi thriller “ , ” dark and claustrophobic tale , directed by German filmmaker , which starsand .
The film takes place 500 years in the future when the human race is trying to migrate from an Earth dying of climate change to a new planet .
Two crewmen awaken from hyper - sleep aboard a spacecraft .
None of their equipment is working , and their memories are incomplete .
What was their mission ?
How much time has passed ?
Where are they ?
Who are they ?
As they try to piece things together , they discover they are not alone , and the ship ’s new inhabitants – tribal warriors carrying crudely made weapons – are moving among them , intent on killing all aboard .
As the space travelers unravel the frightening and deadly secrets the ship harbors , they realize the survival of mankind hinges on their actions .
They must regain control of the ship before Pandorum takes over .
“ There ’s nobody around , we ca n’t get anybody on the radio .
We ca n’t even recall what our mission is , ” said Quaid .
And a series of quick polls taken after the Republican convention have suggested that Mr. Obama has lost support among white women and independent voters .
Polls taken so close to major political events are notoriously unreliable , but Democrats remember what happened in 2004 , when Republicans used the period right after Senator John Kerry ’s nomination to undercut him with a series of attacks .
By every indication , Mr. Obama ’s aides underestimated the impact that Mr. McCain ’s choice of Ms. Palin would have on the race .
Mr. Obama and his campaign have seemed flummoxed in trying to figure out how to deal with her .
His aides said they were looking to the news media to debunk the image of her as a blue - collar reformer , even as they argued that her power to help Mr. McCain was overstated .
“ Everyone was astonished that she drew 9,000 people to Lancaster the other night , ” said Mr. Obama ’s senior strategist , David Axelrod .
“ But we drew 10,000 people there last week . ”
“ They got a transient boost from the sort of imagery surrounding her selection , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
“ But I think things will settle in .
She will be a candidate and not just a symbol . ”
Beyond that , Mr. Obama ’s aides said they had been taken aback by the newfound aggressiveness of the McCain campaign under Steve Schmidt , who has played an increasingly powerful role since last summer .
Even as the aides have denounced the tactics as unsavory , they acknowledge that Mr. McCain is running a more effective campaign than he was a month ago .
“ They had big problems in their campaign , and they made adjustments , ” Mr. Axelrod said .
To a large extent , the perception that Mr. Obama is struggling is based on national polls taken in the days after the convention .
But Mr. Obama ’s campaign views such measures as irrelevant and focuses on what is going on in the 18 or so swing states .
Mr. Plouffe argued that the attention being paid by national news media outlets to events like Mr. Obama ’s lipstick comment was not mirrored in local news coverage .
What is more , the Obama campaign has filled the airwaves in some states with advertisements that link Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush .

[ How Much Money Does an Economy Need ?
Solving the Central Economic Puzzle of Money , Prices , and Jobs .
By Hunter Lewis .
Axios Press . Vi + 185 pages . ]
In Are the Rich Necessary ?
Hunter Lewis showed himself to be a master of dialectics ; and he here applies the same method to monetary theory .
Not content to expound his own views , Lewis carefully explains conflicting standpoints as well .
Lewis does not disguise his own strong commitment to Austrian economics , but the reader of this book will understand not only this position , but its chief competitors as well .
Lewis begins by asking , what kind of prices do we want ?
At first , we might think that stable prices are the order of the day .
If the price level fluctuates , does this not make economic calculation much more difficult ?
If the price level is rising , for example , businessmen may think they are making profits when they are in fact losing money .
They may neglect to discount their paper profits by the rate of inflation .
This position at times won the allegiance of the great monetary economist Irving Fisher , though sometimes , as Lewis notes , Fisher adopted a more inflationist view .
Against the policy of stable prices , though , there are insurmountable objections .
In a free - market economy , as production expands , many prices tend to fall .
Formerly expensive goods now can be produced in large quantities .
This is all to the good , as it makes possible rising standards of living .
As Mises long ago noted , capitalism is a system of " mass production for the masses . "
If these prices fall , then attempts to maintain a stable price level require that other prices be artificially boosted .
Will doing this not introduce shortages and discoordination into the economy ?
Far better to leave things as they are .
The whole point of free markets is to keep reducing prices , so that more and more people can afford to buy .
Why , then , should we want overall prices in our economy to remain stable ?
If most prices fall , as we should hope they will , stable prices overall can only mean that some prices are steeply rising .
These rising prices make everyone poorer , but especially retired and poor people … ( p. 5 )
But , supporters of inflation refuse to accept this conclusion .
Even if boosting prices does result in some discoordination , they maintain , the advantages of increasing prices outweigh the disadvantages .
This is particularly so in times of depression and unemployment .
Those who favor deflation and price coordination through the market will say that if unemployment exists , wages need to be adjusted downwards .
Is not such a draconian policy too hard on workers ?
Far better to deal with unemployment through an expansion of spending .
So , at any rate , Lord Keynes contended .
Austrian economics shows the error in the Keynesian argument .
When unemployment exists , the problem is not that wages in general are too high .
Rather , particular wages need to be adjusted .
A general policy of inflation may mean that workers will not face monetary cuts in wages , but the underlying discoordination remains .
Further , if inflation lowers workers ' real wages , the Keynesian policy also involves cuts in wages .
Why is a decline in monetary wages supposed to be worse than a fall in real wages ?
Additionally , W.H.
Hutt has pointed out that inflexible wage rates generate sub-optimal employment .
If wages cannot fall , employers will discharge workers , who will often have to secure employment in jobs for which they are less suited than those they would hold in a free market .
As Hutt warned , " Chronic unemployment is conspicuous …
Yet the wastes implied under ' sub- optimal employment ' are , as I [ Hutt ] see things , normally the most virulent form which wastes can take . " ( p. 14 , quoting Hutt )
In response to Keynes 's contention that reducing wages in times of depression is " too hard " on workers , Lewis makes an insightful point .
Why should workers be able to benefit from good times but not have to suffer any diminution in income in bad times ?
Is it reasonable to advocate wage freezes when prices plummet , but permit unlimited wage increases when prices soar ?
Why should wages be inflexible only on the downside ? ( p. 45 )
The question of how to deal with depression raises a more fundamental issue : what is responsible for depression in the first place ?
Lewis offers an excellent account of the Austrian theory of the business cycle , by far the most cogent explanation of business downturns .
As Lewis notes , cycles can not be blamed on the free market .
The flaw that makes the cycle possible is fractional - reserve banking , in which a bank is permitted to create credit in excess of the deposits that have been made to it .
The bank is required only to maintain a certain ratio between deposits on hand and its credit expansion .
A free market need not incorporate fractional - reserve banking ; it can , instead , institute the alternative 100 % reserve system .
Indeed , Murray Rothbard argued that a free market required this latter arrangement .
The fractional - reserve system is the artifact of particular legal decisions .
Lewis calls attention in this connection to two decisions of British courts in the early nineteenth century .
An effort to require banks to maintain 100 % reserves against all deposits failed in British courts in 1811 and 1816 .
The House of Lords also confirmed the right to maintain fractional reserves in 1848 . ( p. 55 )
How does fractional - reserve banking make the business cycle possible ?
The problem arises if the government , in an effort to promote prosperity , increases the generation of bank credit .
( Lewis discusses in detail various ways in which the Federal Reserve System can do this . )
The increase in the money supply lowers the monetary rate of interest .
Investment then increases : because business loans are available at lower interest rates , projects that were formerly unprofitable are now feasible .
Business then expands , especially in capital goods .
Trouble — usually sooner rather than later — arises .
The interest rate is not in essence a monetary phenomenon .
Quite the contrary , interest reflects time preference , the rate at which people prefer present goods to future goods .
This rate will not in general alter just because of the monetary expansion .
The lowering of the interest rate thus proves a temporary affair , and the interest rate rises to reflect time preference .
As a result , some of the new investments prove unprofitable and must be liquidated .
In the Austrian view , this liquidation ought to be allowed to proceed unhindered .
Should the government attempt to alleviate matters by further monetary expansion , the result will be another artificial boom that will again require correction .
The necessary liquidation cannot be indefinitely deferred .
If the government continues its expansionist course , the upshot will be hyperinflation and the collapse of the monetary system altogether .
Keynes denied this analysis .
In what to my mind is the best part of the book , Lewis finds the essence of the Keynesian system in this point .
Keynes did not merely preach a policy of government spending in order to get around the supposed problem of wages that are rigidly downward in a depression .
He claimed that boom conditions could be made permanent .
The interest rate could be driven down almost to zero ; doing this would greatly increase investment , thus bringing about permanent prosperity .
Investment , further , should not depend on the vagaries of capitalists ' " animal spirits " ; instead , investment should be to a large degree socialized .
The remedy for the boom is not a higher rate of interest but a lower rate of interest .
For that may enable the so - called boom to last .
The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi- boom . ( p. 35 , quoting Keynes )
In his stress on lowering the rate of interest to zero , Lewis has independently arrived at the same view of Keynes as that of Roger Garrison , in his Time and Money : The Macroeconomics of Capital Structure ( Routledge , 2001 ) .
But Garrison 's excellent book is intended mainly for his fellow economists .
Lewis explains the issues in clear terms that everyone can understand .
Keynes 's theory is , on Austrian grounds , obviously unacceptable .
But the Austrian theory has itself been subjected to various criticisms .
Can it successfully withstand them ?
Lewis offers a convincing response to one of the most serious of these .
As the theory has it , increased bank credit will induce more investments ; some of these investments fail because the monetary interest rate is artificially low .
But does not the theory assume that businessmen will act foolishly ?
What if they realize that the increased money supply does not reflect the rate of time preference and , as a result , do not seek new loans to expand investment ?
No business cycle will result .
Lewis responds in two ways .
First , it is often hard to judge what the correct rate of interest should be :
[ A ] business owner may know that today 's rate of interest is artificial , unsustainable , and misleading but he or she cannot know what the rate would be without government interference , and without this vital information can only guess at the best course .
( p. 74 )
Further , businesses that reject new money will simply lose out in market share to competitors .
Unless a businessman can forecast when the crash will occur , it is to his advantage to take the new money and stay abreast of the competition .
An additional point merits consideration .
As Mises noted in " Elastic Expectations and the Austrian Theory of the Trade Cycle " ( Economica , August 1943 ) , the aim of the Austrian theory is to explain those cycles that do occur .
If businesses do not " take the bait " of loans at artificially low rates , there will be no boom ; but if they do , a boom will occur .
The theory thus shows how a boom may arise ; it need not , to count as a good theory , postulate a process that invariably generates a cycle .
In science , there are laws of tendency as well as laws that state an invariable causal relation .
How Much Money Does an Economy Need ? is an outstanding guide to the essentials of monetary theory .
If the literate public absorbs its lessons , the book cannot fail to have a salutary effect on current economic policy .
Hunter Lewis deserves congratulations for his notable achievement .
High rate of Houston soldiers ' suicides prompts scrutiny Houston soldiers ' suicides prompt scrutiny
Response team to deploy here after deaths of 2 more recruiters
An alarming number of suicides among Houston - based Army recruiters — including two in recent weeks — has prompted calls by a senator and veterans ' advocates for closer scrutiny of high - stress recruiting duty during wartime .
Staff Sgt. Larry G. Flores Jr. , 26 , and Sgt. 1st Class Patrick G. Henderson , 35 , are the fourth and fifth recruiters at the Houston Recruiting Battalion to kill themselves since 2001 .
Both men belonged to the battalion 's Tyler Company , and both were combat veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Clearly , there 's a problem , " said David Rudd , a former Army psychologist and psychology chair at Texas Tech University .
" Somebody needs to look and see if there 's a broader national problem outside of this one battalion .
Is it a problem placing these combat veterans in recruiting positions ? "
Following inquiries by the Houston Chronicle on the suicides , Texas Sen .
John Cornyn sent a letter Thursday to the secretary of the Army , asking for a briefing on the ongoing investigation and on the policy of returning soldiers from combat and reassigning them to a recruiting office .
" I am very concerned about this apparent trend within the Houston - based recruiting battalion , and I believe the situation requires your leadership and oversight to ensure the proper actions are taken and safeguards put in place to protect our troops , " Cornyn wrote .
Also on Thursday , U.S. Recruiting Command at Fort Knox in Kentucky announced that it is " deeply concerned " and will deploy a critical response team to the battalion .
Houston has one of the top recruiting battalions in the nation when it comes to putting much - needed troops in boots .
But with America 's all - volunteer force straining to meet the manpower requirements of fighting simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the difficulty of meeting monthly quotas — recruiters call it " making mission " — is taking its toll on recruiters and their families , say mental health specialists and veterans advocates .
The suicides in the Houston battalion are a " very loud , very bright alarm " that Army officials and politicians can't afford to ignore , said Paul Sullivan , executive director of Veterans for Common Sense .
" This may warrant congressional hearings , " Sullivan said .
" This may warrant changes in the selection , retention , promotion and distribution of recruiters , and it may also impact how the military addresses mental health needs for returning combat veterans placed in stressful noncombat jobs . "
' You dread waking up '
Recruiting has long been considered one of the toughest jobs in the military .
Recruiters from the Houston battalion who spoke to the Chronicle said they regularly work 12 - to 14 - hour days , six or seven days a week .
Many of them have long commutes to small stations far from the camaraderie and resources of a military base .
The pressure to sign at least two fresh " prospects " a month is immense .
Recruiters who were hand - picked from the ranks because of their chests full of medals find themselves suddenly playing the unfamiliar role of salesman .
If they do n't " make mission , " they 're punished with even longer duty hours and threatened with losing rank or receiving bad evaluations that could label them as failures .
Most would prefer the combat zone over the pressure - cooker of recruiting , they say .
" You dread waking up and going to work , " said Chris Rodriguez , a Houston battalion recruiter from 2005 to 2006 .
" You 'll have no life , you 'll never see your family .
It 's worse than a deployment because you 're there with your family , but you can't spend any time with them . "
Rodriguez , 25 , used to have nightmares about recruiting after he left the battalion to serve in Iraq .
Last March , his friend and fellow Army recruiter Nils Aron Andersson , 25 , shot himself to death in a downtown Houston parking garage .
Another friend who recruited in Houston told Rodriguez he 'd put a .45 in his mouth and contemplated pulling the trigger .
" You 've heard that recruiters are kind of insensitive to their recruits and tell them anything , but that pressure comes down all the way from the top , " Rodriguez said .
" It 'll change your personality . "
Expectations ' lose - lose '
Seeking mental health treatment is difficult because even if recruiters get over the stigma , they have little free time or access to doctors and therapists .
Recruiters said they 're proud of their Army service but feel trapped by what they describe as the Houston battalion leadership 's lack of compassion .
" The situation you 're placed in , the expectations you are given , are lose - lose , " said Staff Sgt. Jonathan L. Heinrich , a recruiter with the battalion 's Tyler Company .
" You can talk to as many people as you want to , but if people do n't want to join the Army , there 's nothing you can do . "
Heinrich considered Flores his best friend .
He hopes the tragedy will force change .
" I 'm not going to blame a specific person because I do n't know everything , " he said .
" However , I think the system to recruit should be revamped to actually do what they say they 're going to do and look out for you and your family as well as the mission , because right now it seems they do n't care about the recruiters at all . "
The Houston Recruiting Battalion 's Lt. Col. Toimu " Troy " Reeves and Command Sgt. Major Cheryl M. Broussard declined a request for interviews this week .
It was n't until Thursday that U.S. Recruiting Command at Fort Knox responded with a written statement about what steps were being taken to address the battalion 's string of suicides .
It said the group will deploy a critical response team made up of a chaplain and psychologist to the battalion in October and will also establish a suicide prevention board to increase awareness , analyze trends and highlight resources to combat suicide among recruiters .
An argument
Flores , who served in Afghanistan and Iraq , headed up the Tyler company 's Nacogdoches recruiting station .
On Aug. 2 , he was called to Houston to attend " low - production training " at 10:30 a.m. with other station commanders having trouble making mission .
The recruiters were told they'd go before a panel of their superiors to defend the work ethic at their stations .
It was 6 p.m. before Flores went inside to take his turn .
From the other side of the door , Sgt. 1st Class Willie Dawson , 40 , could hear voices rising and muffled shouting .
When Flores came out of the room , his face was beet red , Dawson said .
Dawson , commander of Tyler Company 's Jacksonville station , asked Flores what happened .
" He just shook his head and said , ' I ca n't talk , ' " Dawson said .
Later , Flores called his friend and fellow recruiter Heinrich .
" The way he told me it went down is the sergeant major kept pressuring him to say he 's a failure and that he wanted to quit so it would make it easier for her to get rid of him from recruiting altogether or even out of the Army , basically chaptering him out of the Army , " Heinrich said .
" To be honest , that 's something that 's threatened on an almost daily basis out here . "
Flores had more than work stress to confront .
His wife , Jennifer , later told police she 'd planned to leave her husband .
The couple 's marriage was deteriorating under the strain of his long hours and other job - related problems , she said .
He 'd told her he felt like a failure at work and could n't take it anymore .
Flores was found dead in his garage in Palestine the morning of Aug .
9 . He had hung himself with an extension cord .
A meltdown
Two weeks after Flores ' death , police were called to the Hendersons ' home in an East Texas town also called Henderson .
The recruiter was acting delusional and threatening suicide .
" He was basically having a meltdown , " said Lt. Craig Sweeney of the Henderson Police Department .
" He was seeing some Iraqis in the woods near his house . "
Henderson , an Iraq War veteran , was posted in Tyler Company 's Longview station .
His wife , Staff Sgt. Amanda Henderson , worked as a recruiter under Flores at the Nacogdoches station .
The couple lived halfway between the two cities in Henderson .
After his breakdown , Patrick Henderson was treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , police said .
He was removed from recruiting duty and ordered to report to the Tyler Company headquarters until reassignment .
On Sept. 19 , Patrick Henderson and his wife apparently argued , police said .
The next morning , his stepson found him dead in the shed behind his house .
Like Flores , he had hung himself .
The two recruiters died just six weeks apart .
Their deaths come at a time when suicides among all active duty soldiers are on track to set a record for the second year in a row .
Last year , 115 soldiers committed suicide .
By the end of August this year , 93 soldiers had killed themselves .

Evangelicals and social conservatives have embraced McCain 's vice presidential pick for what they call her " pro-family , " " pro-woman " values .
But in Alaska , critics say Gov. Sarah Palin has not addressed the rampant sexual abuse , rape , domestic violence and murder that make her state one of the most dangerous places in the country for women and children .
Alaska leads the nation in reported forcible rapes per capita , according to the FBI , with a rate two and a half times the national average – a ranking it has held for many years .
Children are no safer : Public safety experts believe that the prevalence of rape and sexual assault of minors in Alaska makes the state 's record one of the worst in the U.S .
And while solid statistics on domestic violence are hard to come by , most – including Gov. Palin – agree it is an " epidemic . "
Despite the governor 's pro-family image , public safety experts and advocates for women and children struggled when asked to explain how Palin 's leadership has helped address the crisis .
And current and former officials from Palin 's administration confirmed that an ambitious plan to tackle the crisis has apparently sunk into doldrums after arriving at the governor 's office .
" She 's really done a lot of work on oil and gas , but when it comes to violence against women and children .
. . we have n't been on her radar as a priority , " said Peggy Brown , executive director of the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault .
The Juneau - based group is an umbrella organization for shelters and anti-violence programs around the state .
State troopers respond to most domestic violence calls outside of Alaska 's major cities , but they 're too short - staffed and under - funded to do it well , according to Robert Claus , a recently retired trooper .
" The training says you always respond to domestic violence with two people , [ but ] for most of my career that has n't been possible , " said Claus , who lives on the remote island he patrolled for 15 years .
" So how do you go down the list and do what you 're supposed to do – separate the people , transport one person while taking care of the kids and victim ?
You have to pick and choose .
We have n't seen the money to do that . "
In an interview Wed. arranged by the McCain - Palin campaign , former Palin aide Meg Stapleton defended her old boss ' record .
" One of the governor 's number one priorities since taking office has always been to tackle domestic violence in the state of Alaska , " said Stapleton .
Several victims ' advocates noted that Palin did agree to a two percent increase in funding for victim assistance this year .
But a March study by a state task force found that level of funding only covered the cost of helping women and children hurt by the epidemic of sexual violence .
It was not enough to try to prevent assaults from happening – or to ensure " accountability of offenders , " as the panel phrased it .
In a press release Thurs. , the director of an Anchorage women 's shelter defended Palin 's leadership on the issue .
In addition to approving the funding increase , Gov. Palin boosted anti-violence efforts by " publicly speaking out against domestic violence , " noted Judy Cordell , director of Abused Women 's Aid in Crisis ( AWAIC ) .
The state legislature also passed a tough anti-strangulation law while Palin has been in office , Cordell said .
Some members of Palin 's administration were focused on the issue of sexual violence .
Officials in the Department of Public Safety were devising an ambitious , multi-million - dollar initiative to seriously tackle sex crimes in the state , but Palin 's office put the plan on hold in July .
Days later , Palin fired its chief proponent , Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan , after he declined to dismiss a state trooper Palin accused of threatening her own family members .
Palin has said she fired Monegan because she wanted to move his department in a " new direction , " and he was not being " a team player on budgeting issues . "
The dismissal is now at the center of a hotly - contested investigation by the state legislature .
The status of the plan , which would have " fast - tracked " sex crime cases via a dedicated group that included specially - trained investigators , judges and prosecutors , is unknown .
" I 'd ask the governor , " said one official with knowledge of the plan .
Numerous inquiries to Palin 's campaign spokeswoman went unreturned .
Coincidentally , Palin had praised Monegan -- and specifically his work on domestic violence -- just months before she fired him .
" An indication of our commitment is the participation here of my , our , department of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan 's participation here and all of his hard work , and I want to publicly thank him , " Palin said in remarks at an April 28 conference on domestic violence .
" I want to publicly thank Walt for having his heart in the right place and his efforts too . "

When the summer heat breaks and the first cool days arrive , I feel melancholy , because it means the end of our local farmers market is nigh and the variety of summer produce will soon be gone .
While I savor the rest of our ripening tomatoes , my thoughts turn to fall ’s produce , with its rich red and orange hues , mirroring the turning leaves .
Fall produce reminds me of rich , hearty dishes that fill you up during the harvest season .
Here are five fall fruits and vegetables ( and meal ideas ) that are great sources of nutrition and the basis of many delicious dishes .
1. Butternut Squash
It ’s a good source of fiber , Vitamin A , Vitamin C , Vitamin C , and potassium , and it ’s incredibly filling .
Butternut squash is versatile : it can be baked or roasted as a simple side dish , or used in hearty stews , but it ’s sweet flavor makes it a natural choice for filled pastas .
One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants has a butternut squash agnolotti with brown butter and sage that is tear - inducingly good , and I ca n’t wait until it ’s on the menu .
Meal idea : try Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese .
2. Pomegranates
I love eating these just as they are –little pearls ( called arils ) of deep - red juiciness .
They ’re great for your health , too ( as most brightly - colored fruits and veggies are ) and are a good source of Vitamin C , potassium , and anti-oxidants .
A great treat in a smoothie or juice drink , or can be used as a topping for dessert .
Meal idea : Try Cheryl Tallman ’s Jewels in the Snow .
3 . Sweet potatoes
These babies are a nutritional powerhouse , providing enormous amounts of Vitamin A , Vitamin C , Vitamin B6 , thiamin , riboflavin , niacin , fiber , potassium , and manganese .
You can mash them like regular potatoes , or make awesomely salty - sweet potato fries .
Meal idea : try Green Diva ’s Sweet Potato Hash or Shepherd ’s Pie .
4. Swiss chard
This leafy green has over - the - top amounts of Vitamin K , and is a great source of Vitamin A , fiber , folic acid , iron , and potassium .
I use it as I would cooked spinach–in soups , pastas , as a cooked green sauteed with garlic .
Do n’t eat it raw , though .
It ’s not very tasty that way .
Meal idea : Lovin’ Fresh ’s Sauteed Greens Over Spelt .
5. Pumpkin
This fall icon is more than just a centerpiece or the basis for a pie .
It is a great source of Vitamin A , Vitamin C , Vitamin E , Vitamin B6 , fiber , riboflavin , potassium , and copper .
You can find them locally grown almost everywhere –look for small “ sugar pumpkins ” .
There ’s also a bonus that comes with pumpkins –their seeds , which can be roasted and eaten .
These seeds , called pepitas , are a good source of protein , copper , iron , magnesium , and zinc .
Meal idea : Try Lisa Kivrist ’s Pumpkin Spice Muffins .

Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 2
Intermediate widgets
Content series :
This content is part # of # in the series : Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 2 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
This content is part of the series : Learn the Perl / Tk module , Part 2 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
The Perl language is commonly used by the IBM ® AIX ® operating system ( AIX ) administrators and developers .
Perl can be found on nearly every successful Web site and on most AIX systems .
Although Perl scripts are powerful , they produce a Web interface that lacks a graphical front end and forces the user to type information instead of using the mouse , which can be an unsatisfying experience for the customer .
This problem has been resolved with the introduction to the Tk module in Perl .
An admin or developer can quickly breathe new life into Perl scripts with the Tk module and satisfy customers ' desires for X11 products .
Understanding widgets
As discussed in Part 1 , a widget is a graphical object that performs a specific function .
Any graphical object in the Perl / Tk module can be considered a widget .
In a GUI application , the buttons , text , frames , and scrollbars are all widgets .
This second article discusses such widgets as :
Radiobutton
Checkbutton
Menu
Menubutton
Scrollbar
Packing widgets
One of the most commonly used functions and also one of the more complicated methods is pack .
The pack function is a geometry or placement manager in the Perl / Tk module .
When the developer defines a widget , it is simply that : defined .
The widget is n't displayed until space is properly allocated by a geometry manager — and this is where pack comes in to do its job .
The pack function calculates space allocated on the widget 's parent and displays the widget .
Creating multiple windows
Depending on the end user 's needs , an application might require multiple windows .
Creating multiple windows is simple .
It extends the methods used in Part 1 .
The first question to be answered is whether the application should create and display the windows at the same time , or whether a user 's action should trigger the creation and display of the new windows .
This section discusses both methods .
Creating an application that displays several windows at the same time is an extension of creating a single window with the addition of the TopLevel widget :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w # Create multiple windows at once use Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Multiple Windows Test " ) ; my $ subwin1 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin1 -> title ( " Sub Window # 1 " ) ; my $ subwin2 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin2 -> title ( " Sub Window # 2 " ) ; MainLoop ;
Running the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 .
An example of multiple windows opening at once
This article reviews the first section of the code once in order to review what was discussed in Part 1 of this series .
The first part ( / usr / bin / perl ) defines the location where the Perl executable resides on the computer , and it instructs the computer to use this copy of the Perl executable to execute the file multiple_windows_at_once - demo.pl :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
The second part of this line of code ( - w ) is a valuable tool in Perl .
It enables warnings when executing the script , informing the end user of any possible errors found .
Comments and text that are n't to be evaluated at execution are preceded with a pound sign ( # ) .
For example :
# Create multiple windows at once
In order for a Perl script to use the Tk module , it must be included : hence the use Tk code .
For example :
use Tk ; use strict ;
Adding the use strict statement to a Perl script helps find typos and logic errors .
To create the application 's primary window , use MainWindow , and assign it to $ mw .
For example :
my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ;
$ mw acts as the parent of all other widgets , as discussed further in this article .
Set the main window size to 200x100 , and title the main window Multiple Windows Test .
For example :
$ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Multiple Windows Test " ) ;
To create an additional window in the application , use TopLevel and assign it to $ subwin1 .
For example :
my $ subwin1 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin1 -> title ( " Sub Window # 1 " ) ;
Similar to creating the first additional window , create another window and assign it to $ subwin2 .
For example :
my $ subwin2 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin2 -> title ( " Sub Window # 2 " ) ;
Before executing MainLoop , everything in the script is read , defined , and prepared to execute .
Then , when MainLoop is called , all functions and data read previously are executed , and the GUI is displayed .
For example :
MainLoop ;
Creating an application that displays additional windows as triggered by the user is equally easy .
For example :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w # Create a sub window at the request of the user use Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 400x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Multiple Windows Test " ) ; my $ button1 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Open new window " , - command => \&button1_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( ) ; sub button1_sub { my $ subwin1 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin1 ->geometry ( " 300x150 " ) ; $ subwin1 -> title ( " Sub Window # 1 " ) ; my $ subwin_button = $ subwin1 -> Button ( - text => " Close window " , - command => [ $ subwin1 => ' destroy ' ] ) -> pack ( ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 .
An example of multiple windows opening individually
When the script executes , only the main window is displayed .
However , clicking the Open new window button creates and displays the subwindow ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 .
An open subwindow
First , create a button labeled Open new window , and assign its function to the subroutine button1_sub .
Also create an Exit button that executes the subroutine to exit the Perl script .
For example :
my $ button1 = $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Open new window " , - command => \&button1_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ mw -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( ) ;
The button1_sub subroutine creates a new window with the TopLevel widget setting the size and title .
It also creates a Close Window button that lets the user destroy the child window .
For example :
sub button1_sub { my $ subwin1 = $ mw -> Toplevel ; $ subwin1 ->geometry ( " 300x150 " ) ; $ subwin1 -> title ( " Sub Window # 1 " ) ; my $ subwin_button = $ subwin1 -> Button ( - text => " Close window " , - command => [ $ subwin1 => ' destroy ' ] ) -> pack ( ) ; }
Using intermediate widgets
This section discusses intermediate widgets , which logically follows from the discussion of introductory widgets in Part 1 .
These intermediate widgets include the radiobutton , checkbutton , menu , menubutton , and scrollbar widgets .
Radiobutton
The radiobutton widget displays one or several radio buttons ; the user must decide among the buttons .
The following example demonstrates how to introduce the radiobutton widget into an application .
#!/usr /bin/perl -w # create radio buttons use Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Radio Button Test " ) ; my $ color = " Red " ; my $ radio_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ radio_frame -> Label ( - text = >
" My favorite primary color is " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ radio_blue = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Blue " , - value => " Blue " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ radio_yellow = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Yellow " , - value => " Yellow " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ radio_red = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Red " , - value => " Red " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; my $ button_color = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " OK " , - command => \&color_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ button_exit = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; sub color_sub { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" You selected $ color ! " , - type => " ok " ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 4 .
Figure 4 . A radiobutton widget example
You first define the variable $ color and set its value to " Red " :
my $ color = " Red " ;
Creating a frame to hold the radio buttons and label gives the widget a clean , aligned , professional look .
Create a label widget to let the user know what the program expects from him .
For example :
my $ radio_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ radio_frame -> Label ( - text = >
" My favorite primary color is " ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ radio_blue = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Blue " , - value => " Blue " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ radio_yellow = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Yellow " , - value => " Yellow " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; my $ radio_red = $ radio_frame -> Radiobutton ( - text => " Red " , - value => " Red " , - variable= > \ $ color ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
Create three radiobutton widgets , and assign them to the predefined variable $ color .
Each radio button has text and a value assigned as a color .
Because you defined the variable $ color with the value " Red " , the $ radio_red widget is the default value , and it is set to true .
Now add a second frame to hold the window 's buttons .
Inside the frame , create two buttons .
The first is labeled OK and executes the subroutine color_sub when the user clicks the button .
The second button is labeled Exit ; when clicked , it exits the program .
For example :
my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; my $ button_color = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " OK " , - command => \&color_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ button_exit = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
The following subroutine displays a message box notifying the user which color they selected .
When they click OK , the message box is destroyed .
For example :
sub color_sub { $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" You selected $ color ! " , - type => " ok " ) ; }
Checkbutton
The checkbutton widget displays one or several check boxes .
The user can select one or more of them .
The following example illustrates using the checkbutton widget :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x150 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Check Button Test " ) ; my $ check1 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ; my $ check2 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ; my $ check3 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ; my $ check_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ check_frame -> Label ( - text = >
" Select some check buttons . " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) -> pack ( ) ; my $ chk1 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 1 ' , - variable => \ $check1 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ; my $ chk2 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 2 ' , - variable => \ $check2 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ; my $ chk3 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 3 ' , - variable => \ $check3 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ; my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; my $ ok_button = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => ' OK ' , - command => \&check_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ exit_button = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => ' Exit ' , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ; sub check_sub { my $ check_msg = " Check # 1 : $ check1
Check # 2 : $ check2
Check # 3 : $ check3 " ; $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Check Button Summary :
$ check_msg " , - type => " ok " ) ; } MainLoop ;
Executing the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 5 .
Figure 5 . A checkbutton widget example
First , define three variables for the checkbuttons , and set a default value of " NOT CHECKED " .
For example :
my $ check1 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ; my $ check2 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ; my $ check3 = ' NOT CHECKED ' ;
Next , create a frame to organize the label widget and checkbutton widgets .
Also create the label and pack it , aligning it to the top of the frame .
For example :
my $ check_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ check_frame -> Label ( - text = >
" Select some check buttons . " ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) -> pack ( ) ;
Create three checkbuttons labeled Check # 1 , Check # 2 , and Check # 3 .
Assign them the predefined variables $ check1 through $ check3 , and set the onvalue and offvalue attributes to display the appropriate text to the user .
For example :
my $ chk1 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 1 ' , - variable => \ $check1 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ; my $ chk2 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 2 ' , - variable => \ $check2 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ; my $ chk3 = $ check_frame -> Checkbutton ( - text => ' Check # 3 ' , - variable => \ $check3 , - onvalue => ' CHECKED ' , - offvalue => ' NOT CHECKED ')-> pack ( ) ;
Create a second frame to organize the buttons .
Two buttons are created in this frame .
The first , labeled OK , triggers the subroutine check_sub .
The second executes the subroutine to exit the Perl script .
For example :
my $ button_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " bottom " ) ; my $ ok_button = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => ' OK ' , - command => \&check_sub ) -> pack ( - side => " left " ) ; my $ exit_button = $ button_frame -> Button ( - text => ' Exit ' , - command => sub{exit} ) -> pack ( - side => " right " ) ;
The subroutine check_sub defines a variable named $ check_msg with the status of each checkbutton , and it displays the output to the variable $ check_msg using the messageBox widget .
For example :
sub check_sub { my $ check_msg = " Check # 1 : $ check1
Check # 2 : $ check2
Check # 3 : $ check3 " ; $ mw->messageBox ( - message =>
" Check Button Summary :
$ check_msg " , - type => " ok " ) ; }
Menu and menubuttons
The menu widget is an easy way to display items in a single , clean column .
The majority of complex GUI applications contain some form of a menu that might contain only an exit function or 20 selections .
The following script demonstrates how easy it is to create a menu :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x150 " ) ; $ mw - > title ( " Menu Test " ) ; my $ main_menu = $ mw -> Menu ( ) ; $ mw -> configure ( - menu => $ main_menu ) ; my $ file_menu = $ main_menu ->cascade ( - label= > " File " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff= >0 ) ; $ file_menu->command ( - label= > " Exit " , - underline= > 0 , - command= > sub{exit} ) ; $ main_menu->command ( - label= > " Say Hello " , - underline => 0 , - command=>sub{$mw->messageBox ( - message= >" Hello ! " , - type => " ok " ) } ) ; MainLoop ;
Executing the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 . A menu widget example
Create the menu widget , and begin to configure it , preparing it for menu items .
For example :
my $ main_menu = $ mw -> Menu ( ) ; $ mw->configure ( - menu => $ main_menu ) ;
Now , create a File menu .
For example :
my $ file_menu = $ main_menu ->cascade ( - label= > " File " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff= > 0 ) ;
Create an Exit command under the File menu , with a subroutine to exit the script .
For example :
$ file_menu->command ( - label= > " Exit " , - underline= > 0 , - command= > sub{exit} ) ;
Create another menu , and label it Say Hello .
For example :
$ main_menu->command ( - label= > " Say Hello " , - underline => 0 , - command=>sub{$mw->messageBox ( - message= >" Hello ! " , - type => " ok " ) } ) ;
Instead of including commands under this menu , a command is configured onto the menu itself .
When you select this menu , a message box appears that says " Hello ! "
The menubutton widget is similar to the menu widget , but it includes a means to display text or images associated with the menu .
The following example describes how to add the menubutton widget into an application and how to add a little color to the commands .
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 300x150 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Menubutton Test " ) ; my $ main_menu = $ mw -> Menu ( ) ; $ mw -> configure ( - menu => $ main_menu ) ; my $ btn = $ main_menu -> Menubutton ( - text => " Colorful Buttons ... " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff=>0 ) ; $ btn->command ( - label => " Button # 1 " , - activebackground => " blue " , - foreground => " blue " , - command => sub{$mw->messageBox (- message =>
" Button # 1 Pressed " ) } ) ; $ btn->command ( - label => " Button # 2 " , -activebackground => " red " , -activeforeground => " black " , - background => " yellow " , - foreground => " green " , - command => sub{$mw->messageBox (- message =>
" Button # 2 Pressed " ) } ) ; $ btn->command ( - label => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) ; MainLoop ;
Running the script generates the GUI application shown in Figures 7 , 8 , and 9 .
Figure 7 .
A menubutton widget example
Figure 8 .
Menubutton widget example : mouse over Button # 1
Figure 9 . Menubutton widget example : mouse over Button # 2
First , create the menubutton widget , and prepare to add commands to it .
For example :
my $ btn = $ main_menu -> Menubutton ( - text => " Colorful Buttons ... " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff= >0 ) ;
Now create three commands on the $ btn menubutton .
For example :
$ btn ->command ( - label => " Button # 1 " , - activebackground => " blue " , - foreground => " blue " , - command => sub{$mw->messageBox (- message =>
" Button # 1 Pressed " ) } ) ; $ btn->command ( - label => " Button # 2 " , -activebackground => " red " , -activeforeground => " black " , - background => " yellow " , - foreground => " green " , - command => sub{$mw->messageBox (- message =>
" Button # 2 Pressed " ) } ) ; $ btn ->command ( - label => " Exit " , - command => sub{exit} ) ;
The first command has a blue foreground :
When the command is not highlighted , the background remains the default grey with blue text .
The command also has an active blue background :
When the command is highlighted , the background turns blue , while the text remains the default grey .
When the menubutton is activated , a message box appears and states that the button has been clicked .
The second command performs a similar action when selected .
However , the active background is red , the active foreground is black , the background is yellow , and the foreground is green .
The third command exits the script .
Scrollbar
The scrollbar widget controls the view of other widgets , such as text and entry widgets .
Adding this widget enables the user to move the target widget up and down using a scrolling bar .
Adding the scrollbar widget to an application is quick and simple .
For example :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 200x100 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " Scrollbar Test " ) ; my $ scroll_text = $ mw -> Scrollbar ( ) ; my $ main_text = $ mw -> Text ( - yscrollcommand => [ ' set ' , $ scroll_text ] , - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' red ' ) ; $ scroll_text ->configure ( - command => [ ' yview ' , $ main_text ] ) ; $ scroll_text -> pack ( - side= > " right " , - expand => " no " , - fill = > " y " ) ; $ main_text -> pack ( - side => " left " , - anchor => " w " , - expand => " yes " , - fill => " both " ) ; MainLoop ;
Running the script generates the GUI application shown in Figure 10 .
Figure 10 .
Scrollbar widget example
First create the scrollbar widget .
For example :
my $ scroll_text = $ mw -> Scrollbar ( ) ;
Create a text widget with colors other than the default , and bind the scrollbar widget ( $ scroll_text ) as a scrollcommand on the y ( vertical ) axis of the application .
For example :
my $ main_text = $ mw -> Text ( - yscrollcommand => [ ' set ' , $ scroll_text ] , - background => ' black ' , - foreground => ' red ' ) ;
Allow the user to interact with the scrollbar widget by moving the scrollbar to control the target widget 's movement .
For example :
$ scroll_text ->configure ( - command => [ ' yview ' , $ main_text ] ) ;
Pack the text widget as well as the scrollbar widget , positioning them nicely .
For example :
$ scroll_text - > pack ( - side= > " right " , - expand => " no " , - fill = > " y " ) ; $ main_text -> pack ( - side => " left " , - anchor => " w " , - expand => " yes " , - fill => " both " ) ;
Putting it all together
Now you put together a few of the intermediate widgets in one script .
For example :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use
Tk ; use strict ; my $ver = " 1.0.0 " ; my $ mw = MainWindow - > new ; $ mw -> geometry ( " 500x150 " ) ; $ mw -> title ( " All - In - One Demo # 2 " ) ; my $ main_menu = $ mw -> Menu ( ) ; $ mw -> configure ( - menu => $ main_menu ) ; # give the user a way to exit the script my $ file_menu = $ main_menu ->cascade ( - label= > " File " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff= >0 ) ; $ file_menu->command ( - label= > " Exit " , - underline= > 0 , - command => sub{exit} ) ; # everyone needs a little help my $ help_menu = $ main_menu ->cascade ( - label => " Help " , - underline => 0 , - tearoff => 0 ) ; $ help_menu->command ( - label => " Version " , - underline => 0 , - command => sub{$mw->messageBox (- message =>
" Version : $ ver " , - type => " ok " ) } ) ; $ help_menu->command ( - label => " About Program " , - underline => 0 , - command => \&show_about ) ; my $ greeting_frame = $ mw -> Frame ( ) -> pack ( - side => " top " ) ; $ greeting_frame -> Label ( - text =>
" Tell me a little about yourself ...

Conclusion
Introducing Perl with the Perl / Tk module into an AIX environment can benefit the developer , administrator , and end user .
What begins as a script that may look dull to the customer can be enhanced into a professional - looking GUI application .
It might take a little while to get the hang of the widgets , but once you 've mastered them , you 'll agree that the results are worth the effort and time !

We last mentioned this book back in 2005 , when the text was available as a series of drafts , and LtU user raould updated the post back in late August letting LtU readers know you can get it from MIT Press , but to be sure : the book is out .
Not to play favorites , but Amazon currently has it new for $ 54 USD , and it retails for $ 75 USD .
Powell 's currently has one copy in stock as well ( thanks Tim ! ) .
And it 's massive .
At 1,322 numbered pages , it 'll take me a while to get through , but I hope to post a review once I 'm done .
LtU readers might be interested to know that the book is based on and is now used in MIT 's graduate programming languages course , 6.821 .
I take it that a few people thought the point of my last post was to suggest that people should quit their jobs .
Perhaps it ’s the point in which I come out and recommend that everyone who does n’t work for themselves is living a low quality life .
Because that ’s exactly the type of thing that I would say .
As a case in point , I ’ll share a comment I got on that post from lavendula13 at Reddit :
Stupid , self - serving , egocentric cock rot .
Most of us do n’t have a choice , asshat .
I love this comment for several reasons .
One , I absolutely love the term “ asshat . ”
Two , I love the self - assuredness of his lack of a choice in the matter .
Third , I love that he took the time to see how this train of thought would play out .
This is an absolutely wonderful comment that ’s a testament to the quality of commenters on the Internet .
Sure , there are some elements to the questions that may make you question the suitability of your current job .
If it helps you get out of a bad situation , great .
But I have a larger goal : I want to change the way you think about your work and your play .
I want to give you a new paradigm that I hope will clear some things up and empower you to do more of those awesome things that you do .
Work , Play , and That ’s It
From an early age , we ’ve associated “ work ” with something we do n’t want to do and “ play ” with things we want to do .
Our lives are structured around “ work ” days , “ vacation ” and “ leave ” days , and “ rest ” days .
The end result is that we create conceptual dichotomies along the following axes : job / fun , work / play , and leisure / productivity .
But what happens when our work becomes play ?
Or when our play becomes work ?
That is , what happens when we find ourselves in the position such that the things we want to do are the same things that put food on the table ?
What happens is that most people are still stuck with the work / play paradigm that the rest of us are in .
On one level , they know that they love what they do , yet at the same time they have to untangle their emotional associations when they talk and think about what they do .
So pernicious is our cultural socialization that it ’s hard for us to really come to grips with the fact that it ’s possible to have fun doing the work that you do and there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with that .
In fact , that ’s the ideal situation .
Introducing Productive Play
Stop living in the work / play dichotomy .
As with most things in the life , there ’s a third category : productive play .
Productive play is what creatives do when they ’re reaching down to their core and creating that new thing .
Hours lost while writing , making music , painting , coding , designing , problem - solving , and such do not feel like work – they feel like play are done for the process , not the product .
Think about how children play for a second .
Sure , there ’s a point to the games that they play , but usually adults are the ones who have structured play to have a specific outcome .
Children enjoy playing not because they ’ll reach an outcome , but because the process of playing is fun .
That we learn to structure play into outcomes is part of the problem .
The closer we tie play to a specific outcome , the less fun it generally is .
And , of course , work is tied to a specific outcome – is it any wonder that we do n’t find it fun ?
But unlike pure play , in which no specific outcomes are desired , productive play happens to have the side benefit of advancing one ’s goals and projects .
At the end of a day of productive play , a good creative recognizes that something came from that day spent at play .
It may be a great creation , an advance in their creative skill , or the building of a great relationship .
Before I make the jump to the next section , please remember that by “ productive , ” I do n’t mean the mere business metrics that we mostly associate with productivity .
Spending time with friends , family , and loved ones is productive – perhaps much more that putting food on the table .
Spending time brainstorming and dreaming can be productive .
Exercising is productive because it both makes you healthy and helps your energy levels during other sessions of productive play .
If it fits in with your goals , makes you a more full person , and you enjoy it , it ’s productive play .
Productive Play Is Not The End of the Story
It ’s truly awesome when work becomes productive play .
The goal is to get as much of the “ work ” one has to do to become productive play , for productive play is something that you want to do rather than have to do .
That makes all the difference in the world .
One of the things that makes productive play so powerful and motivating is that the energy comes from an internal source – without sounding overly spiritual , productive play is a manifestation of your ideas , skills , and energy in the world .
The problem , though , is that many of us are using the best parts of ourselves on projects that are n’t really our own .
It ’s draining when that piece of the world that ’s uniquely ours is taken by someone else and they profit from it , compromise on its excellence , or kill it because it does n’t match their plans .
This , I suspect , is the tension that Ali and Mike feel in what they ’re doing ( responding to their comments from the last posts ) .
They both love what they do , but they do n’t love who they ’re doing it for .
It ’s the tension that almost every freelancer I know feels .
At a certain point , loving what you do is not enough – we want that piece of us to be our piece to share with the world , not someone else’s .
I ’m leaving it here for today with a call to action .
See what parts of your “ work ” are productive play and which are n’t .
Try to find ways to spend more time in productive play , pulling from both “ work ” and “ play ” to make it happen .
And , perhaps most importantly , see what you can do to spend your time in productive play to advance your own projects and goals .
Returning to the awesome comment that lead into this post , moving more of your work to productive play and moving more of your productive play to your own stuff is possible .
I ’m doing it , and I ’m currently a full - time University employee , completing my dissertation , an officer in the Guard , and running an internet business .
I ’m not saying this to brag , but rather to express that I understand what it ’s like to have a lot going on – but I also know that moving towards a more healthy and happy tomorrow starts with a choice and action today .
Take the long view when you dream , but act on the short view today .
House budget : Borrow , then borrow more
An editorial / By Dale McFeatters
Scripps Howard News Service May 22 , 2006
Monday
The Republican - run House has spared itself the embarrassment of being unable to agree on a budget by narrowly approving a blueprint for spending $ 2.8 trillion in fiscal 2007 .
Even then it only passed in the wee hours Thursday on a promise to several GOP moderates that several billion in projected cuts in education and health programs would be quietly restored down the road .
And to get an acceptable number the House budgeted only $ 50 billion next year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - it 's likely to be twice that - and leaving out the long - term costs altogether .
It also omits the annual cost of capping the Alternative Minimum Tax .
The budget assumes future , politically improbable cuts in education and veterans medical care while scrapping for this election year cuts President Bush had asked for in such politically popular programs as Medicare , Medicaid and farm subsidies .
The House leadership praised itself for enforcing spending discipline and so did Bush , even though the House would spend more than he asked for in his own budget .
Only in Planet Washington is this spending discipline .
What this budget does is borrow , and then borrow some more .
The budget raised the ceiling on the national debt $ 653 billion to $ 9.6 trillion and put in an automatic increase next year to $ 10 trillion , freeing the lawmakers from the awkward task of having to vote on borrowing yet more money .
And the lawmakers will borrow :
The budget calls for the deficit to grow $ 254 billion over five years
As a side effect , the interest on the national debt is now the second fastest rising cost in the budget after Medicare .
This year , the interest payments will cost $ 211 billion , about 8.2 percent of federal spending , and they will increase by another $ 132 billion over five years .
What savings there in the House budget would go not to deficit reduction but to underwrite $ 228 billion in tax cuts over the next five years .
Recall that when Bush took office the budget was in balance ; there was a projected five - year surplus of over $ 5 trillion ; the national debt stood at $ 5.7 trillion and was actually starting to decline .
The House 's new spending plan is not a budget as someone who actually has to live on one would understand it .
