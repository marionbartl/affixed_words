Monkeys have become a major nuisance throughout India Wildlife officials in India plan to build a special school to improve the behaviour of delinquent monkeys .
They say the aim is to target monkeys that pose a serious threat to people in the state of Punjab .
Officials say monkeys are a growing menace in Punjab as the animals move into towns and cities looking for food .
The state government has asked India 's Central Zoo Authority for funds to build the country 's first monkey rescue and rehabilitation centre .
Punjab has more than 65,000 wild monkeys .
As more and more forests disappear , they are increasingly encroaching into human settlements , say experts .
Humans attacked Many of the animals now live in towns and villages and it is not uncommon for them to attack humans as they forage for food .
The problem of rogue monkeys is particularly severe in towns close to India 's north - western border with Pakistan .
Officials accuse them of a variety of bad behaviour from terrorising children , snatching food from people and destroying property .
The rehab centre will be located on the site of a defunct ' monkey jail '
Macaque monkeys routinely destroy TV antennae , tear down clothes - lines and damage parked scooters and motorcycles .
" Besides people landing in hospitals after encounters with monkeys , the animals also often get hurt when house owners try to chase them away or keep them out by using live electric wires and other means , " chief wildlife warden RK Luna told the BBC .
The proposed new monkey school will take in the " worst offenders " and put them through a crash course in good manners .
" We have proposed a composite facility where scientific methods will be employed to change and alter the social habits of the monkeys , " Mr Luna said .
Wildlife officials hope to reduce aggression and train the monkeys to be more like the wild animals they originally were .
Temporary home
It is hoped that the school will eventually become a temporary home for up to 100 rogue monkeys .
It will begin with 15 - 20 animals complete with a quarantine area and a veterinary hospital .
The monkey rehabilitation centre is planned as an extension to a mini zoo near the city of Patiala , in a thickly forested area that was once the royal hunting grounds of the princely state of Patiala .
It replaces an earlier - now defunct - holding facility or " jail " for rogue monkeys also located at the site several years ago .
Mr Luna said work on the school would begin as soon as possible .

THE Director of Public Prosecutions , Nicholas Cowdery , QC , has condemned the Government 's new bikie laws as " very troubling legislation " that could lead to a police state and represent " another giant leap backwards for human rights and the separation of powers - in short , the rule of law " .
Mr Cowdery 's warning comes after a second wave of anti-bikie laws passed through Parliament this week , this time providing for penalties of up to five years ' jail for members of a proscribed gang who " recruited " members .
" Where will the line be drawn ? " ... the Director of Public Prosecutions , Nicholas Cowdery , QC . Credit : Kate Geraghty
Last month the Premier , Nathan Rees , insisted the first set of laws be rushed through Parliament after the death at Sydney Airport of Anthony Zervas during a bikie brawl .
Those laws allow the Police Commissioner to move in the Supreme Court to proscribe criminal gangs and jail members who associate with each other .
But the laws are yet to be used and the Government will not say when they might be .
A study , written for U.S. Special Operations Command , suggested " clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers . "
Since the start of the Iraq war , there 's been a raucous debate in military circles over how to handle blogs – and the servicemembers who want to keep them .
One faction sees blogs as security risks , and a collective waste of troops ' time .
The other ( which includes top officers , like Gen. David Petraeus and Lt. Gen. William Caldwell ) considers blogs to be a valuable source of information , and a way for ordinary troops to shape opinions , both at home and abroad .
This 2006 report for the Joint Special Operations University , " Blogs and Military Information Strategy , " offers a third approach – co-opting bloggers , or even putting them on the payroll .
" Hiring a block of bloggers to verbally attack a specific person or promote a specific message may be worth considering , " write the report 's co-authors , James Kinniburgh and Dororthy Denning .
Lt. Commander Marc Boyd , a U.S. Special Operations Command spokesman , says the report was merely an academic exercise .
" The comments are not ' actionable ' , merely thought provoking , " he tells Danger Room .
" The views expressed in the article publication are entirely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views , policy or position of the U.S. Government , Department of Defense , USSOCOM [ Special Operations Command ] , or the Joint Special Operations University . "
Denning , a professor at Naval Postgraduate School , adds in an e-mail , " I got some positive feedback from people who read the article , but I do n't know if it led to anything . "
The report introduces the military audience to the " blogging phenomenon , " and lays out a number of ways in which the armed forces – specifically , the military 's public affairs , information operations , and psychological operations units – might use the sites to their advantage .
* Information strategists can consider clandestinely recruiting or hiring prominent bloggers or other persons of prominence ... to pass the
U.S. message .
In this way , the U.S. can overleap the entrenched inequalities and make use of preexisting intellectual and social capital .
Sometimes numbers can be effective ; hiring a block of bloggers to verbally attack a specific person or promote a specific message may be worth considering .
On the other hand , such operations can have a blowback effect , as witnessed by the public reaction following revelations that the U.S. military had paid journalists to publish stories in the Iraqi press under their own names .
People do not like to be deceived , and the price of being exposed is lost credibility and trust .
* * An alternative strategy is to “ make ” a blog and blogger .
The process of boosting the blog to a position of influence could take some time , however , and depending on the person running the blog , may impose a significant educational burden , in terms of cultural and linguistic training before the blog could be put online to any useful effect .
Still , there are people in the military today who like to blog .
In some cases , their talents might be redirected toward operating blogs as part of an information campaign .
If a military blog offers valuable information that is not available from other sources , it could rise in rank fairly rapidly . *
Denning , the report 's author , has promoted controversial opinions before .
In the early 1990s , when she was chair of the Georgetown
University 's computer science department , Denning emerged as the leading advocate for the so - called " Clipper Chip , "
a cryptographic device for protecting communications – until the government wanted to listen in .
The project was cancelled by 1996 .
In her 2006 paper , Denning warns that blogs can and will be used by
America 's enemies .
These sites , she argues , can also be used to serve
U.S. government interests .
* There are certain to be cases where some blog , outside the control of the U.S. government , promotes a message that is antithetical to U.S. interests , or actively supports the informational , recruiting and logistical activities of our enemies .
The initial reaction may be to take down the site , but this is problematic in that doing so does not guarantee that the site will remain down .
As has been the case with many such sites , the offending site will likely move to a different host server , often in a third country .
Moreover , such action will likely produce even more interest in the site and its contents .
Also , taking down a site that is known to pass enemy EEIs ( essential elements of information ) and that gives us their key messages denies us a valuable information source .
This is not to say that once the information passed becomes redundant or is superseded by a better source that the site should be taken down .
At that point the enemy blog might be used covertly as a vehicle for friendly information operations .
Hacking the site and subtly changing the messages and data — merely a few words or phrases — may be sufficient to begin destroying the blogger ’s credibility with the audience .
Better yet , if the blogger happens to be passing enemy communications and logistics data , the information content could be corrupted .
If the messages are subtly tweaked and the data corrupted in the right way , the enemy may reason that the blogger in question has betrayed them and either take down the site
( and the blogger ) themselves , or by threatening such action , give the
U.S. an opportunity to offer the individual amnesty in exchange for information .

Today Haxe 2.04 was released .
Thanks to the hard work of Hugh Sanderson , Haxe now have support for the C++ platform .
It then mean that you can compile any Haxe program directly to C++ , and get the performances of the one of the world fastest languages !
C++ support open also a lot of new possibilities for Haxe targets , including huge progress on running Haxe on iPhone
In order to use the C++ platform , you will have to use the - cpp target , but before that you need to install the hxcpp library that contains all things needed to compile .
This is easily done by running the following command :
haxelib install hxcpp
Now , you can simply write a small Haxe program :
class
Test { static function main ( ) { trace ( " Hello World ! " ) ; } }
And compile it with :
haxe - cpp out - main Test
This will give you a file out / Test.exe that when run will simply display Hello World .
Easy , is n't it ?
In order to go further , you can use the APIs that have been made accessible from Haxe / C++ , they are fully listed on the Haxe API pages .
It 's of course possible to interoperate with other C++ programs , but these details will be soon documented .
Actually , C++ is the 6th platform supported by Haxe , since there is already :
Flash ( for Flash Player versions < =8 )
Flash9 ( AVM2 , for Flash Player versions >= 9 )
Javascript
Neko
PHP
... and now C++
Which will be next one ? ;)

It 's a great British technology success story , using brilliant voice - recognition software to decode your voicemail messages and turn them into text .
It 's growing rapidly , and will have over 100 million users by the end of this year , to the delight of its backers , who include the investment bank Goldman Sachs .
It 's created hundreds of high - quality jobs in the UK and elsewhere and employed some world - leading computer scientists at Cambridge University .
That , at least , was how I saw Spinvox until recently .
But in the last few days , I 've been given a somewhat different picture - by one current employee , and several others who 've worked for the company in recent years .
Most significantly , they 've told me that the central claim of the company - that it 's getting machines to translate audio into text - does n't really stand up , because most of the work is actually done in call centres dotted around the world .
I have some confidence in those claims because I 've seen compelling evidence that my own voicemails have been transcribed by humans , not by machines .
I have been using the service for quite some time - indeed I 've found it very useful - and been moderately impressed by the way that it translates the often garbled messages left on my phone .
But I have now seen the transcript of a number of my voicemails , including one from a major technology company promising a story , and another from the BBC's Occupational Health Department .
What the logs of those messages appear to show is that the messages were sent to call - centres , where workers then spent a minute or so transcribing them .
Still wishing to be convinced that it was people not machines listening to my messages , I tried another tactic .
It was suggested to me that if I recorded a message and then sent it five times in a row to my mobile , then a computer would provide the same result every time .
Well , my message ( which you can hear below ) was deliberately stumbling and full of quite difficult words - including my rather tricky name .
But every version that came back to me in text form was radically different - and pretty inaccurate .
So unless Spinvox is employing a whole lot of rather confused computers to listen and transcribe messages , it sounds like the job was being done by a variety of agents .
In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed .
Visit BBC
Webwise for full instructions .
If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content .
Why does this matter ?
After all , Spinvox has always been clear that there is a human element in the work - though when it says it can call on " human experts for assistance " , you might imagine Cambridge boffins rather than overseas call centre staff .
But the fact that so much of its work still appears to rely on people simply listening and typing could have implications for its finances and its data security .
The information commissioner has asked the firm to explain why its entry on the Data Protection Register says no data will be transferred outside the European Economic Area .
Customers may ask whether they really want people listening in to private or commercially sensitive messages .
The company insists all messages are encrypted and anonymised to ensure agents cannot identify its sender or recipient .
But it 's the sheer cost of getting hundreds of people to do this work which is the biggest issue for the company .
One of its PR men admitted to me that the basis of the business was that more and more of the work should be done by machines , rather than humans .
So part of the spinning of Spinvox has been true , in that it has enjoyed extraordinary growth by providing a service that many people have found very useful .
But is it a major technology success story , cracking the age - old problem of getting a machine to understand the human voice in all its glorious , cacophonous varieties ?
Not yet , it is n't .

Here are some articles that I ’ve had published since the start of 2020 ( in reverse chronological order )
A generational divide in British Jewry ? , in Jewish News , 14 May 2020
In spite of populist Brexiteer promises , science and the state …
I 'm supposed to be working as a lifeguard and swimming instructor this summer at Etobicoke 's Memorial Pool .
Instead , as a member of CUPE Local 79 , I 'm on strike .
And on Canada Day , I picketed at the Ingram Transfer Station .
I 've never really spent time with a group of men .
Boys , certainly , but not honest - to - God men .
And to tell you the truth , they 're not that different – just bigger , fatter , smellier , hairier , taller and wider .
During a strike , they 're also incredibly interesting .
How could Canada
Day be boring when your mother drives you to a dump site in the middle of nowhere , smiles and waves at you , and then drives away , screeching her tires ?
Just 16 , I was left to fend for myself in the testosterone jungle of picketing members of CUPE Locals 79 and 416 .
Ingram Transfer Station , I learned , is code for a dump - and - run garbage zone where peeved - off unemployed workers stand around and burn stuff .
It was the most potentially dangerous situation I 'd ever been in at seven in the morning .
Tall , ferocious - looking unionized garbage workers and office staff stood around amid piles of rotting trash – chain - smoking , ranting and showing off their drooping arm tattoos .
Everybody – including the small number of women on my shift – seemed to curse every second word .
There was nobody , aside from me , under the age of 25 .
So I set myself down on a curb , rested my head in my hands , and glared at everyone in that I - am - a - spoiled - teenager - and - I - do n 't - want - to - be - here fashion .
Little did I know how much I would learn .
I 'm not your typical city worker .
As a teenager , I fervently practise three activities : staying up too late , talking back to my parents and giggling about boys .
Going on strike was not part of my summer plans .
I started off not caring at all about the actual meaning of the dispute : I was there for the strike pay , not to support my fellow workers .
If I worked for just four hours a day , five days a week , CUPE 79 would pay me $ 200 .
For a student like me , that seems like decent enough money .
I soon got a reality check .
I am currently scheduled at the York Civic Centre , where I picket in the back parking lot .
On my first day , a woman brought along her 2 - year - old toddler , for whom she could n't find daycare .
The second day , I overheard another woman talking about being behind on her phone bill .
We 've been striking for nearly four weeks now : $ 200 times four equals $ 800 , right ?
In an expensive city like Toronto , $ 800 barely manages to cover rent , if you 're lucky .
On top of that are food , clothes , utility bills , miscellaneous needs and desires .
Some people live from paycheque to paycheque .
A strike could cost them their home and credit rating .
You might wonder , " Why are you on strike ?
And why should I care ? "
Well , first , when your parents tell you to go on picket duty instead of sitting around watching TV , as a dependent child , you tend to do what you 're told .
It 's particularly ironic because my father is a manager for the City of Toronto .
Imagine our dinner conversations .
And why should you care ?
Because it 's so incredibly , mind - bogglingly unfair .

The public is n't on our side .
Most of the summer workers like me are n't even on our side .
I know that , and all unionized workers know that .
But stay with me .
Under their current contract , which expires next year , Toronto police get a pay raise of at least 3 per cent each year , and had to make no concessions .
Toronto firefighters got an increase of 3 per cent annually with no concessions .
TTC workers got 3 per cent with no concessions .
Toronto Housing workers got 3 per cent with no concessions .
Even city councillors got a pay raise of 2.4 per cent while still arguing that the city cannot afford any more union pay raises .
When initially discussing our contract with David Miller , Local 79 president Ann Dembinski reported back to the union that the city was initially offering something along the lines of a 0 per cent raise in the first year and a 1 per cent raise in the second year .
As workers , we could lose money that first year because of inflation .
That 's pretty vile .
Back at Ingram Transfer Station , I was soon forgotten in the maze of litter and trash bags , the hazy clouds of cigarette smoke and overwhelming stench of garbage .
So I continued sitting , nearly getting my feet squished by cars playing loud music , the drivers eager to drop off their stinky secrets .
Lying low turned out to be a good idea , since by that point two fights had nearly broken out between garbage dumpers and strikers , due to the overpowering scent of maleness and that crazy , I - am - tougher - and - more - macho - than - you emotion in the air .
Even so , in most of the cases when verbal fights did break out , they were started by people impatient about waiting an extra 15 minutes to dump their trash because of the picket .
( When I was at Ingram , nobody waited for more than half an hour to drop off three bags of garbage . )
When one guy hissed in the face of a striker , saying something along the lines of " white trash , " the striker hurled insults back at him .
But , if certain media had been present , the striker 's behaviour would probably have been described as " unprovoked , " right ?
I can barely claim to understand the complexities of the labour dispute .
However , I can say that it 's mean and hurtful when a man parks his car and grinds his wheels against the pavement , releasing pungent fumes and causing the pregnant woman who was picketing with me to start coughing .
It 's wounding and cruel when a woman teeters past us on five - inch heels , swearing at striking workers , calling us all " faggots " and " idiots . "
I can say that it 's insulting and degrading when a patron decides to drive through the crowd of strikers , nearly bowling us all over .
I can especially say that it 's so , so painfully wrong to be malicious , rude and spiteful to a group of people who just want to make a point for 15 minutes of your day .
I 'm just pleading for a bit of respect , really .
You do n't need to agree with what the unions are fighting for .
All you need to do is grant us the basic dignity any human being deserves .
Do n't get angry .
You 'll get to where you need to go ... just a couple of minutes later , that 's all .
This piece is the twenty - sixth duet from Trente- six Petits Duos Mélodiques Faciles et Chantants pour deux Flûtes ( 36 Easy Flute Duets ) by French Romantic composer Benoit Tranquille Berbiguier .
This Largo is the second movement of the third of 12 sonatas for flute and continuo by Italian composer Pietro Antonio Locatelli , originally published in Amsterdam in 1732 .
This march is taken from the Rice - Walsh manuscript , a collection of music from the repertoire of Jeremiah Breen , a blind fiddler from North Kerry , Ireland , notated by his student .
This étude in D minor is the eighteenth piece from 24 Etüden zur Förderung der Technik ( 24 Studies for the Development of Technique ) , Op. 12 , by German flutist Emil Prill .
It was first published in Bremen in 1913 .
This flute duet appears in Blake 's Young Flutist 's Magazine , published in Philadelphia in 1833 .
The arrangement is probably based on an 18th - century waltz from central Europe , but unfortunately we were unable to trace its exact origins .
from Recorder Sonata in G minor
This is the third movement of the fourth sonata from Sonate a flauto solo con cembalo , o violoncello ( “ Sonatas for solo flute with harpsichord or cello ” ) by Italian Baroque composer Paolo Benedetto Bellinzani , originally published in Venice in 1720 .
The movement starts off and spends most of its time in E - flat major , but in the last three measures it modulates back to the main key of the sonata , G minor , and finally ends on a half cadence which prepares the ground for the final movement .

In earlier days of aviation , flying around the world was the ultimate test of pilots and new aircraft and now in the days of alternative - fueled aviation , it seems that test remains the ultimate challenge .
Bertran Piccard , the pilot of the first nonstop , round - the - world balloon flight , hopes to achieve that goal in a solar - powered airplane called the Solar Impulse .
The Solar Impulse design was first unveiled in late 2007 , but now a working prototype has been developed ( with a budget of $ 94 million ) .
The plane will get a chance to take its first test flight at the end of 2009 .
The test flight will consist of flight sequences over two days and one night .
If successful , the team will start preparing for the round - the - world flight .
.
The Impulse is made of carbon fiber , has a wingspan of 63 meters and is covered in 12,000 solar PV cells .
The power generated by the solar cells is stored in over 400 kg of batteries , which allow for flying at night .
The plane is propelled by four ten - horsepower electric motors .
It can't reach great speeds , meaning circling the globe will take a long time , but if it accomplishes such a feat , we 'll know that solar - powered air travel ( as well as other types of transportation ) could have a real future .

Do you want to learn about binding books ?
Here is everything basic that you need to know in one bookbinding tutorial .
Anyone can follow these easy steps .
Comment at the bottom if you like this .
Preparation
In addition to your book making materials you will need :
A large working area ( if you do n’t have a large area , you will need to clean up well after each stage )
Both large and small binder clips ( I use them gratuitously )
A waste paper basket close by
A stack of clean scrap paper
Pre-cut sheets of wax paper
A wet cloth ( for wiping glue from fingers )
A dry cloth
Signature block
Start by deciding how many pages and what dimensions you wish your book to be .
It is helpful to fold pages with a bone folder .
This saves your fingertips and gives you a good crease .
Fold on the paper grain ( the grain should run parallel with the spine ) .
Here I fold seven signatures with six sheets per signature .
Clamping the spine end with large binder clips ( here I use cardboard to protect the pages ) and allowing to compress overnight helps with having flatter signatures for sewing .
It helps to make a pattern of your page for later use in measuring and cutting board , endpages , etc .
Lay one of your signatures on a blank page and trace , then cut .
Perfect .
Measure and cut linen tape and mull cloth for the backbone .
I use a 50/50 cotton / linen blend for both my tapes and mull .
For a large book you will want 3 strips of tape .
For this small book I will use two at a 1/2 inch width .
Cut the mull cloth about a half inch shorter at top and bottom than the length of the spine , and 2 inches wider on either side of the spine .
Number your signatures at the bottom of the page near the spine .
This is especially important if your pages have printed material on them .
This ensures that everything stays in the correct order .
Also , squaring up will be done on the top edge of the book for a clean , straight edge .
The numbers work as a place marker as to which end is up and which end is down .
Next we mark the spine to show where to punch holes for sewing .
I square up the pages and then clamp with binder clips to hold everything tidy .
Mark 1 / 2 an inch from each end , and then evenly space marks on either side of where your tapes will lie across the backbone , allowing just a little extra room on either side so that the stitching does n’t pinch your tapes .
Make sure your lines are even and straight .
Binding books tutorial : punching holes for sewing
Time to punch holes at your marks with an awl or needle .
Use a very narrow needle so your holes are not unnecessarily large .
Unfold your signature , paying careful attention to keep everything aligned , and gently push the awl through from the outside just enough to make a hole .
All holes have been punched .
Clear off your workspace and assemble your materials for sewing .
Choose a sturdy thread ( unbleached linen thread is good ) and an appropriately sized needle .
Draw a length of thread , 20 or 30 inches in length , across a beeswax block two or three times to coat .
This helps your thread to stay tangle - free and helps prevent tears in your paper while sewing .
Thread can be rough on paper , so coat it good .
( Fabric stores often sell little kits for waxing your thread . )
To begin sewing , start with your last signature and work forward .
This is where a sewing frame would come in handy , but I do n’t find it to be necessary for smaller books .
Your tapes will be held into place as you sew over them .
Knot your thread and push the needle into the end hole at the right to start .
From inside the signature push the needle back out the second hole , cross over the tape and down into the third hole .
Continue in this fashion until you ’ve completed the first signature and your needle is out the end hole .
For the first signature simply sew back down into the end hole on the next signature .
Continue sewing back across the second signature until you come out the end hole on the right .
Tug to make sure everything is snug , but do n’t pull hard enough to tear the paper .
Then tie your thread around and below the original knot .
Continue adding signatures ( taking care to keep them in order ! ) and sewing them together in the same fashion .
At the end of each row loop your thread under the thread of the previous signature , and then again through the loop that you just made .
Pull snug .
This keeps everything secure .
Binding books tutorial : sewing the signatures together
When you ’ve sewn together all signatures , loop and tie off your thread .
Tug tapes to remove any wrinkles that may have built up during sewing and adjust so that there is the same amount of excess on either side of the spine .
Good .
You will notice first thing that between your signatures there is a pretty obvious gap , even if you sewed snugly .
This is normal when binding books .
Take a piece of folded scrap paper and lay it 1/ 8 of an inch away from the gap between the first and second signature .
Pressing the scrap paper down , spread a thin layer of glue ( I ’m using an Acid Free / Photo Safe rubber cement because it dries quickly and wo n’t wrinkle the paper ) down near the gap .
Remove the scrap paper , close the book and press down firmly for 10 seconds .
Carefully flip the book and do the same to the last signature .
Continue flipping the book and gluing the gaps between signatures until you reach the center of the book .
When you ’ve finished , put the pages in clamps and allow to set .
This process forms a temporary bond to hold the signatures in place until the backs are glued .
It is time to glue the mull onto the backbone of the book .
A press would be useful here to hold your book spine end up .
Lay your mull across the backbone of the book and center it .
There should be a two inch overlap on either side .
Take a pencil and rub the side of the tip gently across the edges of the spine to make a mark on the mull .
This will give us a guide to know where to spread the glue .
I am using a PVA glue that stays flexible when dry .
Coat the center of the mull with glue between where we have marked with pencil lines .
Work the glue down into the weave of the fabric .
( I like to use my fingers for all gluing .
I ’ve found I can work it in better , get a nice even spread , I can feel what I am doing better , and clean up is easier .
Regardless of whether you use a brush or your fingers , keep a damp cloth and a dry cloth nearby for quick clean up . )
Spread glue across the backbone of the book , working it down in between the signatures and into the weave of the tapes .
When this is done , center and press the mull down onto the spine .
Binding books tutorial : gluing the mull cloth
There should be about 1 / 2 an inch at the top and bottom of the spine that is not covered by mull .
Spread more glue across the top of the mull and work it into the weave .
Keep the book in clamps or press for a couple of hours or overnight to dry .
Prepare cover materials
In the meantime you can start preparing the cover boards and , in my case , make many last minute changes as to what materials you plan to use .
Using your pattern as a guide , measure out your cover boards .
( Here I am using pressed illustration board . )
You will want the width to be the same as your book page pattern ( this will be staggered a bit to cause an overhang ) and with 1/8 of an inch additional at the top and bottom .
The spine board should be approximately the thickness of your book PLUS the thickness of your cover boards .
Do yourself a favor and double check your measurements !
( I speak this from experience .
Ahem . )
Using the pattern against your measurements is a good way to eyeball indicate if you are off .
When you are sure everything is accurate cut your boards with either a bandsaw , a jigsaw , or if your board of choice permits it , an exacto knife or box cutter against a straight edge .
Your edges may look rough .
Take a roll of sandpaper and slough off any gnarly bits , at the same time softening the hard edges and corners .
If you rub with your sandpaper in a circular motion , moving back and forth across the edge of the board you should get a good , even edge .
Otherwise , parts may sand down more than others and you will end up with a lumpy edge , which is not good .
All tidy !
Debate a bit more over your materials .
A Fat Tire often helps during this deliberation process .
Our mull is dry !
There may be a bit of tightening / shrinking as the glue dries , but this is okay .
Headbanding
I want to do headbanding on this book , so we need to punch more holes .
Measure and mark where your holes will be , just above the top of the mull , using the same method as before .
To punch holes , hold each signature open and punch through from the outside , paying careful attention that the needle comes through in the center of the crease on the inside of the signature .
( A piece of cardboard is useful like a bookmark . )
For headbanding you need a length of cord to loop around and ( for two toned headbands ) two lengths of embroidery thread in different colors tied together at the end .
Wax all of these with your beeswax block .
I keep completed signatures clipped with a binder clip to keep them out of the way and keep myself more organized .
Binding books tutorial : headbanding
All done .
Cut off excess embroidery thread .
Also trim cord to within 1/8 inch on either side .
This can be trimmed more precisely later with a razor blade .
Touch a bit of glue on the ends to keep embroidery thread from unraveling .
The cover
Commit to a cover material , either fabric or paper , and lay face down .
Place your cover boards across the back of your material and trace .
You want the gap between the spine and cover boards to be approximately the thickness of two boards .
Then , using your cover boards as a pattern , measure and mark 1/ 2 inch around each side .
This will give us enough excess for turnover .
Cut out your material .
Binding books tutorial : attaching the cover boards
Now we attach our signatures to the cover boards .
At this stage it will begin to resemble a * real * book !
From this point forward we will use a lot of wax paper .
It is easier to cut a whole stack of sheets to size , slightly larger than your cover , and have those within easy reach .
With your book pages face up in front of you , place two sheets of wax paper beneath the mull but above the tapes .
Spread glue across the mull , working it well down into the weave .
Remove the top sheet of wax paper and discard .
Carefully align and press the cover board onto the mull .
Stagger the cover boards about 1/8 inch from the spine .
This allows our book to open and close freely without scraping against the spine board .
It also gives us an overhang along the right hand edge to match the overhang along the top and bottom .
Open the book cover to check if the mull is in place .
Use a rubbing cloth to stick the mull firmly down and work out any wrinkles or air bubbles .
Leave the second sheet of wax paper in place to keep glue from sticking to your pages .
Flip the book over and attach the back board in the same way .
Place under weights for about 1 /2 an hour .
Here I use a handy dandy gigantic book on China , which is very heavy .
Using the same method as above , spread glue and attach the tapes to the cover board .
( You can trim your tapes to be flush with the mull if you want . )
Flip and do the same for the back cover .
Binding books tutorial : attaching cover boards
If you ’ve paid careful attention to alignment your book should stand on it ’s end with no slanting or unevenness .
Place the book under weights for an hour .
Cover material
While waiting you can attach the spine board to your cover material .
With the material face down , rub glue into the spine area ( which should be marked with pen or pencil .
In this case you ca n’t see the lines because my material backing is black , but they are there . )
Center and press your spine board into place .
Flip the material over and use a rubbing cloth on wax paper to work out any wrinkles or air bubbles , and then flip back over .
Place under weights and allow to dry .
Ribbon bookmark
I ’m attaching a ribbon bookmark , so when the mull and tapes have sufficiently dried the book is turned onto it ’s side and I position my ribbon across the mull on the spine .
Using my fingers I glue it down and saturate back of the ribbon also with glue .
Cover with wax paper and place this under weight for about 1 / 2 an hour to dry .
( Note : if you are using glued on headbands you may attach the ribbon beneath the headband , rather than on the outside . )
Binding books tutorial : attaching the ribbon bookmark
Now it ’s time to attach our cover boards to the cloth or paper cover .
Using the guidelines that we marked on the back of the material previously , spread glue all over the inner area of the front cover material , allowing a bit to go outside the lines .
Carefully align and press the front cover onto the glued area , making adjustments as needed to keep it centered .
When aligned properly , flip the book over and use a rubbing cloth over wax paper to work out and bubbles or wrinkles .
Press the material down into the crack between the cover board and the spine board .
Binding books tutorial : attaching the cover boards to cloth or paper
Do the same for the back cover , then place beneath weights for an hour .
The next step is to miter the corners .
I would like to do a more in - depth tutorial on this later if there is interest . ??
Now it is time to glue the turnover .
We glue tops and bottoms first .
Lay your project over a piece of wax or scrap paper and spread glue all the way across the top edge of the turnover .
Turn the book on it ’s end and start turning the material in at the spine .
Bend it down behind the backs of the signatures .
You can use your bone folder if necessary to work it down and press it flat .
Then work your way along the top edge to the left and right and fold over the turnover with your fingers , working out any wrinkles as you go .
Flip the book over and do the same with the bottom edge .
Binding books tutorial : folding down corners
Again , a more detailed tutorial is necessary for folding corners .
There are different ways of doing this , and with thicker materials ( as I am using here ) it can be tricky .
After gluing down corners and side edges I use small binder clips to hold bulky areas down while the glue dries .
Place entire book under weights for 1 /2 an hour .
Binding books tutorial : attaching the end pages
End papers
To finish up our book we need to glue down the first and last pages to the cover boards .
This will hide the unattractive mull and tapes .
Place two pieces of wax paper beneath the first page and spread glue , first near the spine , then working outward to the edge of the page .
You will have to work quickly because the paper will suck up the glue and start to wrinkle .
Discard the top sheet of wax paper , then lift carefully the bottom sheet of wax paper .
Using the flat side of your hand , press the paper into the cover board .
Work up from near the spine until the whole page is attached .
If the alignment is crooked , gently unstick and re-align .
When everything is in place , use a rubbing cloth to work out any wrinkes or bubbles .
Place an extra sheet or two of scrap paper beneath the wax paper and close the book firmly .
The extra paper keeps moisture from the glue from being absorbed into the other pages of your book , which will wrinkle them .
Flip your book over and attach the last page in the same fashion .
When completed , place the entire book under weights overnight .
A good , long dry under pressure is necessary so that your book does n’t warp .
Afterward you can attach decorative end papers if you wish , using the same method .
End result
The end result .
Have any questions ?
Send me a quick message , or leave a public comment below .
Hillary Clinton today signalled a significant shift in US foreign policy by discussing publicly how a nuclear - armed Iran could be contained in the Middle East .
Until today , the shared position of the US , Britain and France was that Iran would not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons , and no senior official from any of the three countries would discuss the option of containment .
However , Clinton broke that taboo during a visit to Thailand , when she pledged enhanced US protection for Washington 's Gulf allies , implying nuclear protection , if Iran succeeded in building a bomb .
" We ... have made it clear that we 'll take actions , as I 've said time and time again , crippling action working to upgrade the defences of our partners in the region , " Clinton told Thai television .
" We want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment : that if the United States extends a defence umbrella over the region , if we do even more to develop the military capacity of those ( allies ) in the Gulf , it is unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer because they wo n't be able to intimidate and dominate as they apparently believe they can once they have a nuclear weapon . "
Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Tehran said : " She 's implying that , if Iran became a nuclear weapon state , then the US would develop their existing defence commitments and that the US would contemplate nuclear deterrence to protect Persian Gulf states . "
The remarks appeared to be aimed at reassuring Arab allies uneasy about the rise of a nuclear Iran , and considering their own nuclear options .
It also seeks to influence the decisions being made in Tehran .
But it drew an immediate riposte from Israel 's minister of intelligence and atomic energy , Dan Meridor .
" I was not thrilled to hear the American statement ... that they will protect their allies with a nuclear umbrella , as if they have already come to terms with a nuclear Iran .
I think that 's a mistake , " Meridor said .
Clinton 's comments appear to reflect a new US pessimism on Iran following the June presidential elections , that brought an entrenchment by hardliners in Tehran .
There had been hope in Washington that Barack Obama 's warm overtures to the Iranian people and the offer of talks with Iran without preconditions would break the long - running impasse over Iranian enrichment of uranium .
Iran insists the uranium is intended for peaceful power generation , but the UN security council has called for it to be suspended , at least until doubts over Tehran 's intentions are resolved .
Iran had put off , until after the recent election , a response to the latest offer from six major powers – the US , Britain , France Germany , Russia and China – to offer economic help and technical assistance in building a nuclear power industry , if Iran suspends enrichment .
There is little hope left in Washington or other western capitals that any response now will be positive .
The outgoing director of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , said recently he thought Iran was developing a breakout capacity to build nuclear weapons , so that it would have all the components in place to build a warhead at short notice .
The containment option is boosted by the belief that Iran is running out of uranium ore to convert and enrich .
The US thinks the supply will run out by next year and is urging all uranium - producing countries to tighten control over their exports , to ensure Iran does not get hold of any more .
If that effort is successful , it would severely limit the size of arsenals Iran is able to build .
That is the theory at least .
It is very much " plan b " as far as the west is concerned , but it is a bow to new realities .
The young , quiet Frenchwoman became fascinated with Iran not because she wanted to fight against Islamic radicalism or because she was lured by the mystique of the Orient , like most scholars , but for more mundane reasons .
As a child in Paris , her longtime nanny was Iranian , teaching her bits of Persian as she grew up .
Shortly after her mother died eight years ago , she immersed herself in the language and culture of the country , eventually spending months in Iran studying Persian and teaching French at colleges .
Now Clotilde Reiss , 23 , sits in Tehran ’s Evin Prison , Western diplomats say .
She was arrested July 1 and accused of espionage .
Her detention has placed her at the center of an international drama that pits the European Union against Iran , which is trying to suppress protests following the June 12 presidential election , marred by accusations of fraud .

A Western official in Tehran said she allegedly was photographed taking part in anti-government demonstrations , had pictures of protests on her cellphone camera and wrote an e-mail to a journalist describing the unrest .
“ That is not espionage and can not be so .
The accusation is absurd , ” French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Monday .
“ She ’s not political , ” said a longtime friend , among the small group of European scholars who travel to Iran to conduct social and political research .
The friend spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns .
“ But she ’s Iranian in her heart . ”
Reiss finds herself among a group of foreign nationals caught up in the recent unrest .
Greek British journalist Iason Athanasiadis was arrested at Imam Khomeini International Airport as he tried to leave the country and was held for two weeks .
Iranian Canadian journalist Maziar Bahari , a freelance correspondent for Newsweek and broadcast media , is in prison , as is Hossein Rassam , an Iranian who is the top political analyst at the British Embassy in Tehran .

In an effort to paint the unrest as the work of foreign agents , the government has accused all of taking part in or provoking postelection protests .
But the soft - spoken Reiss appears miscast for such a role .
She studied Iran in the French city of Lille and at the Sorbonne in Paris and traveled to Iran last year as a fellow for the French Research Institute in Tehran , returning five months ago to teach language classes at a university in the city of Esfahan .
Reiss found an apartment in the historic city ’s ancient Jolfa section , the heart of Iran ’s Armenian Christian community , her friends say .
She decorated her apartment with Persian rugs and made friends with her neighbors , who adopted the young woman with exceptional command of Persian as one of their own .
During weekends she would travel to Tehran or the cities of the lush Caspian Sea coast , or welcome visitors from Tehran to her home .
Advertisement
On July 1 , as she tried to leave the country for Beirut , she disappeared .
French and Iranian authorities confirmed Monday that she was being held in Evin , accused of espionage .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed the charge as “ pure fantasy ” and demanded her release .
“ Let me say in the clearest and simplest way possible :
We demand the release of our compatriot , ” Sarkozy said Tuesday .
“ I do not doubt for an instant that she will be released very , very soon . ”
A Western diplomat in Tehran said she is also accused of sending one straightforward e-mail describing events in Esfahan to a journalist in Tehran , which authorities say they have tracked .
Friends say she never tried to hide anything .
Advertisement
“ Of course we know that being a researcher in Iran , we ’re under surveillance , ” said one friend .
“ We know that our Internet is monitored and our phone is tapped .
But we were always cautious and we never took any risks . ”
Though she may have marched in peaceful protests or taken pictures of them with her cellphone , friends say they cannot imagine her taking part in riots or damaging property .
“ She ’s not the kind of girl who would jump in the fire , ” said one friend .
“ She ’s always respectful of morality and behavior .
She knows very well Iran so she would n’t take stupid risks . ”

The lesson is : always keep a rolling pin handy when you are trying to write a comic .

It is no surprise that the personification of a comic is as a bug - eyed sadist .

If you made a webcomic that featured nothing but the mangled corpses of comic ideas , you would be taking all of my money as I buy the trade paperbacks , the movie tie-ins and the Xbox game that come from the success of it .
Is that what you want ?

And the Eisner for Best Vomit And Crying is ...
The papal plane is heading for Mexico and John Paul II is busy preparing for the first of his many overseas trips .
It is January 1979 .
At his right hand , briefing him , is the Mexican - born Father Marcial Maciel Degollado , founder of the ultraconservative Legion of Christ , one of the youngest but fastest - growing religious orders in the Catholic Church .
This dapper , well - connected priest , worshipped by his adoring followers as " Nuestro Padre " ( " Our Father " ) shares with the Polish pontiff a conviction that the liberal reform of Catholicism in the 1960s needs to be halted , especially in Latin America .
That trip was the first public sign of the extraordinary bond between Maciel and the man in charge of a church of 1.2 billion souls .
In the subsequent 26 years of John Paul 's reign , the Legion was regularly lauded by him for its unwavering fidelity to church teaching , its intolerance of dissent , and its conviction that only Catholicism could save the world .
Maciel was a prince of the Church , in the papal inner circle , sitting on the most important Vatican committees and running his own congregation of 800 priests and 2,500 seminarians , plus the 70,000 lay members of the associated Regnum Christi movement , as it spread around the globe , including a base in London .
Much has been made of the power wielded by the secretive Opus Dei under John Paul II , not least by Dan Brown in The Da Vinci Code , but many Vatican - watchers believe that the Legion of Christ was bigger , richer ( annual budget £ 435 m ) , more influential , and even more sinister .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Parents of youngsters recruited as Legionaries described it as a cult that targeted the young and naive in particular , some of them just 13 , and then " brainwashed " them .
But it is Maciel himself who has proved most controversial .
Nuestro Padre was , according to one biographer , " a narcissistic sociopath " with a taste for flights on Concorde and five - star hotels .
He is acknowledged by the Legion to have fathered at least one child – a 23 - year - old daughter said to be called Norma Hilda and now living in Madrid .
It has also been alleged that he was a paedophile .
The first accusation came in 1976 from the former head of the Legion in the US .
By 1998 , the Vatican had received sworn statements from eight men , all detailing how Maciel had abused them when they were young recruits .
Throughout the 1990s , a series of allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests that had been covered up by the church authorities shook Catholicism in America , Canada , Australia , Ireland , the UK and other countries .
At least two cardinals were forced to retire , dozens of paedophile priests were jailed for their crimes , and the Church paid out millions of pounds in compensation to victims .
The damage to its reputation in the eyes of its own congregations has been huge , and bishops have struggled to convince sceptics that they have put into place procedures rigorous enough to ensure that such a betrayal never happens again .
Yet in Maciel 's case , it took 30 years – until 2006 , after John Paul 's death – for the new pope , Benedict XVI , finally to issue a public rebuke , and then it was simply an order that he should see out his days in private prayer rather than face a court .
The long delay is evidence , some have suggested , that the Vatican still does not take the issue of paedophile priests sufficiently seriously .
A year after Nuestro Padre 's death in 2008 , the Vatican announced an investigation into the Legion .
An unnamed official told America 's National Catholic Reporter newspaper that the total number of Maciel 's abuse victims was " more than 20 and less than 100 " .
As a team of cardinals opens the locked cupboards of an organisation that prided itself on secrecy – all new recruits had to take a unique private vow ( abolished by Benedict in 2007 ) never to speak ill of the founder and to report to superiors anyone who did – the Catholic Church is once more mired in a scandal about the sexual abuse of minors , and the abuse of power .
Ex-priests and nuns are often easy to spot .
It is something to do with how uneasy they look in civvies , and their reluctance , learnt in the seminary and the convent , to look anyone in the eye .
But Todd Carpunky , a corporate lawyer in the City of London , gives few outward clues of his past as a Legionary of Christ when we meet in a bar near Liverpool Street station .
Tall , blond and open - faced in his well - cut suit , this Illinois - born 34 - year - old has an easy sense of humour , both about the world around him , and his six years in the Legion .
" My grandmother raised me , " he explains .
" She was great , but so Catholic she makes the Pope look like the anti-Christ .
The rest of my family was just nuts .
I wanted to get away from them , and the Legion knew that . "
Founded by the then 21 - year - old Maciel in Mexico in 1941 , almost four years before he was even ordained as a priest ( he had been asked to leave more than one seminary ) , the Legion of Christ spread rapidly , supported by bishops who felt embattled by government anti-clericalism in Mexico , the result of a church - state spilt in 1917 .
Soon it was running schools and universities .
Its militant , old - style Catholic spirituality was directed mainly at the wealthy with the result that it members were known as " the Millionaries of Christ " .

By the 1950s , it had gone international with branches in Spain , Chile , Italy , Ireland and the United States .
Carpunky came across one of its recruitment drives in the early 1990s via his grandmother .
" They began visiting me at home and invited me on a summer programme .
It was fun and my grandmother was delighted .
She 's still upset I 'm a lawyer . "
He went to one of the Legion 's boarding schools in Connecticut at the age of 16 , seeing it as a means of escape from an unhappy home life .
" Our contact with home was strictly limited , but that suited me .
All our mail was reviewed .
Even the Catholic newspapers were censored .
They would have great holes in them where articles had been cut out .
It was to protect our vocation , we were told . "
Life at the school followed a strict schedule .
" We 'd get up early in the morning , shower with our bathing suits on , even though there were curtains , because apparently it was faster and more chaste .
We slept in our swimming trunks under our pyjamas .
There was meditation – usually on the writings of Nuestro Padre .
It was all very regimented .
We were not allowed free time .
It was cult - like .
Maciel played mind games . "
All of this , Carpunky acknowledges , is said with the benefit of hindsight .
At the time , he quickly moved into the noviciate and was sent to Spain to train as a priest .
" I felt part of something .
I was happy .
I did n't rationalise . "
What was Maciel like ?
" He had charisma .
He told great stories .
He was the great conspiracy theorist .
According to him , he had left the seminaries in Mexico because he was misunderstood and was trying to save the Church .
The Jesuits , he said , were very jealous of him .
He used conspiracy theories to explain away all of these things .
He had been persecuted because he was just too holy , too clever , too Catholic .
He actually claimed never to have said no to God – which implies he never sinned . "
Maciel was also , Carpunky claims , intent on controlling every aspect of the life of every Legionary .
" We had a green book of rules of etiquette and social norms , " he recalls .
" We 'd have classes about not piercing a vegetable with a fork when we were eating , or how to eat a banana with a knife and fork . "
Carpunky was singled out for attention by Maciel .
" When he came to Madrid , I was asked to serve his meal .
I took it as a great honour .
I thought he was a living saint .
So when he would follow me with his eyes , I thought he was looking into my soul .
Now I think he was checking me out because apparently he liked blonds . "
The first major question mark was raised over Maciel 's personal conduct as early as 1956 , when he was suspended by the Vatican while charges that he was addicted to pain - killing drugs were investigated .
Two years later , the inquiry was dropped and he was reinstated .
Then , in 1976 , Father Juan Vaca , who had joined the Legion as a 10 - year - old in Mexico and risen to be its US director , but subsequently left to work as a priest in a Catholic diocese on Long Island in the States , formally reported Maciel to his bishop for sexually abusing him from the age of 12 .
This was a time before the sexual abuse of minors by priests had been exposed .
In 1978 , fearing that his accusations had been swept under the carpet , Vaca sent a long statement about what had happened to him direct to the Vatican , and even received an acknowledgement .
And then , nothing .
In 1998 , eight other former members of the Legion ( one now dead ) filed sexual - abuse charges against Maciel in the Vatican 's Court of Canon Law , but Rome seemed to delay .
It was only in 2004 that an official investigation , headed by canon lawyer Monseigneur Charles Scicluna , was set up .
That led , in 2006 , to the decision to discipline Maciel .
Was Carpunky sexually abused ?
" I am one of the few people who has been in Maciel 's bedroom without ... you know ... because he has a bedroom in each of the Legion 's houses , reserved for him .
In the American house at Cheshire in Connecticut , he even had his own Mercedes reserved for him ' because of his back problems ' .
He always had these weird things .
He could only drink Evian water .
For medical reasons , he'd eat only steak or a specific type of chicken that had to be obtained from Spain .
I was n't sexually abused , though a friend of mine in seminary had been molested by a Brother in the Legion in his early teens .
When the rector found out , he told Maciel , and within 24 hours that Brother was sent to Rome , where he was later ordained as a priest . "
It raises the suggestion of a culture of sexual abuse inside the Legion , taking its lead from the founder and covered up by the " private vow " .
Carpunky is not convinced .
" Maciel was a monster and others were abused , but they were more the exceptions than the rule . "
Consider , though , the experience of Stephen Dougan – not his real name – from Belfast .
Now a university student , he was wooed by the Legion as a 14 - year - old .
" It was hard not to be enthused by what you were shown , " he recalls .
" As their guest , I enjoyed good food , went on hikes , played table tennis , watched movies and did sport with happy seminarians .
When I actually joined [ in the early 1990s at the Legion 's Dublin seminary ] , I did not have even a vague idea of the Legion 's spirituality or its rules , only that , as I was being told , I had been called as part of God 's plan . "
Around the time of his 18th birthday , Dougan was summoned one night to the bedroom of his novice master .
" He said he had severe cramps in his stomach .
He unbuttoned his pyjama top , poured oil on his stomach and asked me to massage him .
I did .
Very soon he unbuttoned his pyjama bottoms and poured on more oil .
He asked me to ' do it deeper ' .
He meant lower down .
His penis was erect .
I was shocked and confused .
I can remember my hands in his pubic hair .
I closed my eyes and prayed . "
Dougan 's abuse by the Father almost exactly mirrors allegations against Maciel , made by Fernando Perez , one of the eight to file charges , about what happened to him at 14 .
Maciel even told his victims , one reported , that he had a special dispensation from the Pope to allow him to be masturbated because of the pains he suffered as a result of his " delicate " health .
Dougan never spoke while in the Legion about what had happened , though he has subsequently reported it to the police .
" The vow I had taken meant that no Legionary could in any way criticise the defects or mistakes of any superior .
This included internal – in your mind – criticism . "
Eighteen months after the incident , he was told that he did n't have a vocation and asked to leave .
" It was hard for me to adjust to normal life , " he admits .
" I am still battling with the belief that God has spat me out of his mouth because I left .
I have been in counselling on and off ever since . "
Not all ex-members – some of whom belong to the support group , ReGain – have unhappy memories .
Adam Dunbar – he is not willing to use his real name because he is still in touch with former colleagues from in the Legion – is a 62 - year - old bookkeeper and grandfather from Dublin .
He was among the first recruits to the Legion 's Irish mission which started in 1960 .
" What attracted me as a youngster was the energy of it , the ability to inspire , and the fact that they used young men to recruit young men and filled us full of idealism . "
Maciel , he reports , was " gentle , considerate , patient .
My memories of him are sweet .
I never had any experience of anything irregular nor did I see anything that in retrospect might be judged as misbehaviour . "
Matthew Muggeridge , the 39 - year - old grandson of the celebrated writer and broadcaster Malcolm , is currently working as a lawyer in the US .
He joined the Legion in 1990 because he saw it as " dynamic , challenging and growing .
It enthused me about my faith – and you do n't get that with ordinary diocesan seminaries . "
Though he left six years later , he did so , he says , with no regrets and remains a supporter of the order and its defence of traditional Catholic values .
He was part of Legion plans to establish a base in London .
Still a seminarian , he was sent to the affluent parish of St James , Spanish Place , in Marylebone , central London , along with an Irish Legionary priest .
However , Cardinal Basil Hume , head of the local Westminster archdiocese , was not keen on their presence , Muggeridge recalls .
" He tended to equate the Legion with Opus Dei , about which he also had well - recorded concerns , but we were not the same .
We were so visible , whereas Opus Dei tends to act behind the scenes . "
The Legion is still thought to have ambitions on London .
In the past year , one of its priests has been calling on parishes in wealthy areas of the capital .
Maciel had prepared himself a tomb in Our Lady of Guadalupe , the church he built in Rome in the 1950s .
In the event , he was laid to rest in January 2008 in his family 's modest crypt in his hometown in Mexico .
The past 18 months have been a traumatic time for Legionaries .
The secrecy rules meant they knew nothing of the charges against Nuestro Padre .
The first they heard was when , a year after Maciel 's death , Father Alvaro Corcuera , his hand - picked successor , confirmed the existence of Norma Hilda .
The Legion is tight - lipped about its current predicament .
Jim Fair , its communications director , declined even to discuss the issues raised by the former Legionaries in this article .
In brief written answers to questions I submitted , he said that the Legion was " grateful " for the present Vatican investigation and " sad " about the " aspects of our founder 's life of which we were not aware " .
On the charge that the order has a cult - like approach , Fair wrote : " We listen carefully to what former members have to say .
At the same time we listen to the voice of the Church and to the principles of religious life throughout the centuries as a guideline . "
Adam Dunbar feels the revelations will have had a profound effect on his friends still in the Legion .
" Imagine , after half a century of being told that Maciel was a living saint , you discover that this is a hall of smoke and mirrors .
Who is the victim then ?
Apart from the sexual abuse , if it existed , what about this abuse of lives ? "
Back in the City of London , Todd Carpunky has , he says , put the Legion ( and his Catholicism ) behind him .
His doubts began when he contracted a liver infection because painful gallstones had gone untreated .
His superiors advised him instead to swim and pray to Mary .
Later , he was made to wait several months for an operation on a disc problem in his back that had left him disabled , because Nuestro Padre could n't decide what to do with him .
" The final straw came when I was sitting in a doctor 's office and the Legionary with me admitted they had been lying about not being able to find a surgeon to see me .
I was told , ' Just obey . '
That 's when I snapped and realised they were crazy .
I checked my brain back in and left . "
For him , the story of the Legion is not just another aspect of clerical sex abuse .
" It really comes down to the fact that they cared more about building the Kingdom of Maciel than the Kingdom of God .
The Legion calls itself Catholic but it is inhumane and really damages people .
That is what distinguishes it from other religious orders . "

A catalogue of abuse
Britain Father Michael Hill ( pictured ) was convicted in 1997 of sexual abuse of nine children .
It emerged that his local bishop , the future Cardinal Cormac Murphy - O'Connor , had been aware that concerns had been raised about Hill 's behaviour , but had moved him to another parish .
US Allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests were first made public in 1984 .
In September 2003 , the archdiocese of Boston paid $ 85 m in compensation to 552 victims .
Many other dioceses have made similar payments – to an estimated total of $ 1bn .
In 2004 the archdiocese of Portland declared itself bankrupt as a result .
Austria Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër was dismissed as Archbishop of Vienna by Pope John Paul II in 1995 after it emerged that he had abused young boys at Catholic schools over a 40 - year period .
One expert suggested he may have had 2,000 victims .
Ireland
In May 2009 , High Court judge Sean Ryan published a report of his nine - year investigation detailing the beating , rape and humiliation of thousands of children by priests and nuns in the schools they ran .
Australia
In July 2008 in St Mary 's Cathedral in Sydney , Pope Benedict XVI made an unprecedented apology for the crimes of priests against minors .
" I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured and I assure them that , as their pastor , I too share in their suffering . "

What if there were far too many people living on planet Earth , but no one had the courage to talk about it ?
According to Global Population Speak
Out , that is exactly our situation .
Consider that we repeatedly see news reports about scarce and dwindling resources ( e.g. , water , food , fish , fuel , topsoil ) , but these news reports rarely consider the exploding population on Earth as a major contributor to these problems .
This refusal to consider the carrying capacity of Earth is truly staggering .
As a thought experiment , consider how our “ environmental ” issues would be altered if each country had 25 % fewer people than it currently does .
Or 50 % .
Instead , we the human population of earth is at 6.5 billion , headed toward at least 9 billion by 2050 .
When it comes to discussing sex , reproduction and birth control , we freeze up , even when out - of - control population growth threatens our way of life .
Why do n’t we discuss this important issue of overpopulation ?
We ’re afraid that the conversation would get out of control and we ’d insult each other .
Therefore , we choose silence , thus continuing on our path to horrific environmental decay that is ruining our standard of living .
GPSO has a plan for dealing with our collective reluctance to discuss this critically important issue .
The trick is that we all need to jump in at once to draw attention away from the vast number of trivial stories that currently swamping our “ news . ”
Many prominent scientists and other people of prominence have already made their pledges .
I sent in my pledge today and so can you .
GPSO also offers templates for letters to the editor and blog content .
Here is the recent GPSO press release :
Scientists from around the world have pledged to speak out publicly in February , 2009 on the problem of the size and growth of the human population .
Speaking out as well will be environmental and science writers , social activists , and representatives of environmental groups .
The event , called the Global Population Speak Out ( GPSO ) , aims to weaken a decades - long taboo against open discussion of population issues .
So far , GPSO has received pledges from scientists and others in 16 countries , all agreeing to speak out during February .
Many will do so through the print media .
Others are planning interviews , talks , and conferences .
Endorsers of the project include , Stanford University scientists Paul and Anne Ehrlich , Cornell University ecologist David Pimentel , and co-author of The Limits to Growth Dennis Meadows .
Those pledging to speak out include botanist and past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Peter Raven , Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm , University of Delhi professor of community medicine Jugal Kishore , University of Tehran environmental scientist M. F. Makhdoum , and social activists Jerry Mander and Harvey Wasserman .
One of the project ’s endorsers , Ohio State University anthropologist Jeffrey McKee , said , “ If you look at the key issues and goals of our time — economic prosperity , clean water , sustainable energy , and biodiversity survival — they all have a common denominator .
They all point to the need immediately and responsibly to stem the growth of the human population , and to return our population size to sustainable limits . ”
But , said environmental writer and GPSO organizer John Feeney , “ Despite its central role in nearly every environmental problem , many have for years viewed the population topic as politically unpopular .
In fact , despite the urgent need for solutions , it ’s become taboo to state publicly that population growth must be humanely stabilized and reversed . ”
He added , “ Environmental groups have been reluctant to talk about it because they know it will trigger criticism and may compromise funding .
Scientists have hesitated too , knowing any mention of population is sure to stir controversy . ”
GPSO is designed to make it easier for participants to raise the issue by bringing together a collection of voices so participants know they are not alone in speaking out .
The project grew out of a simple idea , said Feeney .
“ We wondered , what if a large number of qualified voices worldwide , many of whom might not have emphasized the topic previously , were to speak out on population all at once ?
With any luck it will nudge the subject closer to the center of public discourse . ”
Another goal of the event , said Feeney , is to bring new voices to the population issue .
“ This is a matter of profound importance .
There are experts , such as the Ehrlichs , who address it regularly .
But we need many more voices .
We hope GPSO might help bring a few to the world ’s attention .
Our hope is that after February it will be a little easier to talk about population and there will be more people doing just that . ”

The profession , students and architecture schools are struggling to agree on how to tackle the growing work placement crisis .
With just weeks left before the end of term , the AJ ’s State of Architectural Education survey shows that an alarming 61 per cent of those responding had still not found a year - out position .
And one in five of those said they had given up looking .
Suffering the effects of the severe global economic downturn , practices cannot afford to take on as many students ( AJ 26.02.09 ) .
Meanwhile , the number of wannabe architects continues to rise – university applications are up 6.7 per cent this year .

‘ The implications for the profession are significant , and I do n’t expect the effects will be limited to this cohort of students , ’ said David Dernie , head of Leicester School of Architecture .
Possible solutions to have been mooted include changes to the current year - out arrangements and even a temporary suspension of the year out .
Dernie added : ‘ The post - Part 1 year out is a habit , rather than a necessity .
When times are good it is probably a good thing .
But it does depend on the experience .
‘ I think schools need to take a lead on this and focus on a more flexible delivery of programmes .
The days of the rigid institution are over . ’
His view is echoed by the Association of Consultant Architects , which in March this year wrote to all heads of school , asking them to waive the schools ’ requirement for the academic year 2009 - 2010 , ‘… since it is neither an RIBA nor an ARB requirement for students to have any professional experience before starting their Part 2 course ’ .

The number of applications from disheartened Part 1 students forced to stay in education and start their diploma in September has rocketed .
At Westminster University , for instance , applications are up by 50 per cent and the number of applicants is expected to approach 800 eventually .
Other schools are reporting similar figures .
Yet , of the 400 students surveyed by the AJ , only 6 per cent called for the 12 - month in - practice work experience
period to be dropped completely .
Rather , the results showed , students want practices and schools to do more to help them gain relevant experience .
Half of all respondents said that firms needed to do more to help students .
A sizeable 12 per cent said practices were letting down the next generation of architects .
Meanwhile , 45 per cent argued that firms should be forced to take on year - out students .
In Scotland , the RIAS is looking at that issue .
Later this week , Gordon Smith , co-founder of Smith Findlay Architects , >> and the RIAS ’ education committee convener , will send a letter to every Scottish practice suggesting an innovative ‘ two - for - one ’ strategy .
According to Smith , a student need only work a 22 - hour week to comply with the Professional Experience and Development Record ( PEDR ) regulations , so firms could take on two students for the same price and effectively cover a full - time position .
Smith said : ‘ The situation is pretty disastrous at the moment and one measure alone is not going to alter things …
What is needed is a cumulative effect
of smaller initiatives .
But this suggestion would give two people an opportunity . ’
He added : ‘ If they chose to work for 35 hours , that ’s up to them .
They would only get paid for 20 hours but , whatever they do , they must not work for nothing . ’
Not every firm has backed away from supporting the next generation of architects and there are still practices committed to taking on year - outers .
Andrew Morris , commercial director of Rogers Stirk Harbour +
Partners , said the practice currently employs six students a year , paying them each £ 20,000 , although it had taken on as many as a dozen at a time when business was booming in 2007 .
Despite recent redundancies – the practice announced in March that it was shedding 35 staff – the firm has vowed to continue with its student year - out programme .
Morris said :
‘ We believe we have an obligation to support the process and , if practices like ours can’t do it , then students are going to be in real trouble .
‘ There ’s also a selfish reason for our commitment .
We have found our students to be a tremendous success , very good employees , and contribute generally to the office .
The day we stopped doing it would be a very sad day . ’
But Morris was not so sure about the Scottish two - for - one job share proposal .
He said : ‘ It ’s a practical issue , not a financial one .
It could bring about a lack of continuity in students ’ work . ’
Elsewhere in the country , other proposals have emerged , including a pilot bursary scheme in Yorkshire , funded in part by the regional development agency Yorkshire Forward .
The brainchild of Irena Bauman , co-founder of Bauman Lyons Architects , the scheme is backed by Yorkshire Forward in tandem with the regions ’ schools of architecture ( Huddersfield , Sheffield University , Sheffield Hallam and Leeds ) .
Under the initial plans , 60 per cent of a student ’s placement would be financed by the government ’s Train to Gain ( TtG ) fund , with the remaining 40 per cent funded by the practice .
Under its government remit , TtG money has to be spent on research .
So , as well as learning the practical side of an office , the selected students – at first numbering about 10 – would carry out research beneficial for the region , the practice and the schools : investigating low - carbon housing , for instance .
Bauman said : ‘ The intention is not only to create jobs for students , but also to get us all working together to strengthen the region and to create excellence in the built environment .
‘ We are also hoping to influence architectural education and practice by developing a tradition of practice and research within the profession . ’
In Liverpool , the RIBA North West and the Liverpool Architectural Society are consid­ering lending their support to a new workshop initiative , Unit 4 , aimed at graduating students working with the city ’s Static Gallery .
Billed , again , as a ‘ research programme ’ , the scheme will involve architects , artists and the public and will overlap with the RIBA ’s own student initiative .
The society would co-ordinate the involvement of local architects wishing to work alongside student groups , enabling some measure of overlap with practice for the purposes of the PEDR practical training record .
Meanwhile , the University of Westminster has landed a £ 400,000 cash pot from the Higher Education Funding Council for England , intended to offer training and ‘ skills enhancement ’ to unemployed built environment professionals , including new graduates unable to find work .
There are , besides , other career paths which , according to the AJ survey , are not being championed by the schools .
Peter King , a qualified architect who left the profession to set up The Rooflight Company , said : ‘ Right through every architecture course it is always assumed you will be an architect at the end of the journey .
Little peripheral vision is afforded by the schools towards alternative career paths , such as construction management or product design .
‘ Students only tend to consider a different career when they have failed to get a job in architecture ; they consider anything else a last resort , ’ he added .
Case history : India Wright , third - year student at London South Bank University
I am about to complete my BA and should be embarking upon my year - out work experience , which for the past three years I ’ve looked forward to , impatient to be part of the ‘ real world ’ of architectural practice .
Instead , I am anxious over my looming , almost certain , unemployment .
The number of architects joining the dole queue has risen by 860 per cent from last year .
Friends in practice tell me about redundancies at their offices following suspension of projects , while others with their own practices are getting applications from qualified architects with families to support .
The message is that priority will not be given to inexperienced Part 1s for the few scarce jobs .
At my institution , we are being told to apply for our diploma now or go and get any sort of work to gain ‘ life experience ’ .
With competition for diploma places now having apparently trebled , I ’m facing a spell at McDonald ’s , and the country an impending skills gap .
I took a risk when commencing my degree .
But then it did n’t seem like a gamble .
I agreed to take on a tuition fee loan to cover the cost of my education ( which , three years ago , was bumped up to £ 3,000 a year , regardless
of economic background ) , in addition to a student loan to cover the cost of living .
I assumed , in line with the New Labour dream , that work was guaranteed upon graduation , especially since I was undertaking professional training .
While I am angry at the government for not having the foresight to predict that its reckless consumer culture would result in a downturn , it is not to blame for my position in the job market .
But I am indignant at the realisation that after , three years ’ study , I am now in £ 25,000 of debt to the government , with the very real possibility of my qualification being effectively meaningless , if I can not continue my training .
The high price tag somehow seemed easier to swallow before .
That a generation is saddled with this almost unavoidable mountain of debt , with ever - decreasing prospects of work , seems inconceivable , and quite wrong .
Everyone ’s written a JavaScript loop that just loops over all the {LIs , links , divs} on a page\* , and it ’s pretty standard .
Something like var lis = document.getElementsByTagName( “ li ” ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i or , if you ’re using jQuery : $ ( “ li ” ) .each ( function ( ) { // do something here to this } ) ;
This is problematic if there are , say , 2000 LI elements on the page , and what you ’re doing in the loop is semi-intensive ( imagine you ’re creating a couple of extra elements to append to each of those LIs , or something like that ) .
The reason this is a problem is that JavaScript is single - threaded .
A tight loop like this hangs the browser until it ’s finished , you get the “ this script has been running for a long time ” dialog , and the user interface does n’t update while you ’re in this kind of loop .
You might think : aha , this will take a long time , so I ’ll have some sort of a progress monitor thing : var lis = document.getElementsByTagName( “ li ” ) ; for ( var i=0 ; i but that does n’t work .
What happens is that the browser freezes until the loop finishes .
Annoying , but there it is .
One approach to getting around this is with timeouts rather than a `for` loop .
var lis = document.getElementsByTagName( “ li ” ) ; var counter = 0 ; function doWork ( ) { // do something here to lis[ i ] counter += 1 ; progressMonitor.innerHTML
= “ processing list item ” + counter ; if ( counter < lis.length ) { setTimeout ( doWork , 1 ) ; } } ; setTimeout ( doWork , 1 ) ; so you move the bit of work you need to do into a function , and that function re-schedules itself repeatedly , using `setTimeout` .
This time , your user interface will indeed update , and your progress monitor will show where you ’re up to .
There are a couple of caveats with this : it ’ll take a bit longer , and you ’re no longer guaranteed to have things processed in the order you expect , but they ’re minor issues .
For doing this in jQuery , a tiny plugin : jQuery.eachCallback = function ( arr , process , callback ) { var cnt = 0 ; function work ( ) { var item = arr [ cnt ] ; process.apply ( item ) ; callback.apply ( item , [ cnt ] ) ; cnt += 1 ; if ( cnt < arr.length ) { setTimeout ( work , 1 ) ; } } setTimeout ( work , 1 ) ; } ; jQuery.fn.eachCallback = function ( process , callback ) { var cnt = 0 ; var jq = this ; function work ( ) { var item = jq.get ( cnt ) ; process.apply ( item ) ; callback.apply ( item , [ cnt ] ) ; cnt += 1 ; if ( cnt < jq.length ) { setTimeout ( work , 1 ) ; } } setTimeout ( work , 1 ) ; } ; and now you can do $.eachCallback ( someArray , function ( ) { // “ this ” is the array item , just like $ .each } , function ( loopcount ) { // here you get to do some UI updating // loopcount is how far into the loop you are } ) ; $ ( “ li ” ).eachCallback( function ( ) { // do something to this } , function ( loopcount ) { // update the UI } ) ;
Not always a useful technique , but when you need it , you need it .
The small , thin battery comes out of the printer and can be applied to flexible substrates .
Updated 6:05 p.m. ET
A new battery , small and thin , weighs almost nothing and can be printed in a process similar to silk - screening shirts .
The printable battery is expected to be cheap and easy to mass produce and could be used in disposable receipts or cards , engineers in Germany announced today .
" Our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price of single digit cent range each , " said Andreas Willert , of the Fraunhofer Research Institution for Electronic Nano Systems ENAS , where Reinhard Baumann led the battery 's development .
The battery weighs less than 1 gram and is less than 1 millimeter thick .
It runs at 1.5 volts .
Placing several in a row can produce up to 6 volts .
A standard AAA battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts .
The newly developed battery has a life span more limited than traditional batteries , however .
Here are the technical details :
The battery is composed of different layers : a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , among others .
Zinc and manganese react with one another and produce electricity .
However , the anode and the cathode layer dissipate gradually during this chemical process .
Therefore , the battery is suitable for applications which have a limited life span or a limited power requirement .
The battery new contains no mercury and so is said to be more environmentally friendly than some .
Actual products with the battery could be ready by the end of the year , the engineers said .
Preparation 10 minutes / Cooks all day
A slightly spicy , slightly barbecued taste with a dash of the Southest in it .
Should make you want to saddle up and ride on out .
As with all my recipes , all the measurements are based on 1 person ( and one serving ) .
You can simply increase accordingly rather than trying to guess .
1 to 2 boneless chicken breasts ( depending on how hungry each person is )
½ can ( 7 ½ oz of pinto beans )
½ can ( 7 ½ oz of corn )
¼ diced onion ( or onion powder equivalent )
½ teaspoon garlic ( or garlic powder equivalent )
1 chicken bouillon cube
½ teaspoon lime juice
Southwest Chipotle Seasoning ( I like Mrs Dash )
) paprika
black pepper
cayenne pepper
water
You can either use the chicken breasts whole or slice them , it ’s a matter of preference .
Put into the crock - pot with the pinto beans , corn , garlic and onion .
Dissolve the bouillon cube in one cup of hot water ( if you are multiplying this recipe , you can use 1 cube for 2 people and adjust the water accordingly ) .
Pour into the crock - pot .
Add the lime juice and a pinch ( literally ) of paprika , black pepper and cayenne pepper ( if you ’re making this for more than one person , put a pinch of each per person ) .
Use 1 to 2 teaspoons of the chipotle seasoning to get you started .
Mix everything together .
If the chicken and vegetables are exposed , add water until they ’re just covered .
Put the lid on and cook .
How long you need to cook for will vary on your make of crock - pot .
If you ’re using frozen chicken , then you ’ll certainly need to add time .
With my crock - pot , I cook everything on high for at least 2 - 3 hours and then turn it to low for the rest of the day .
Your set up might be different , check the manual .
When you ’re about ½ an hour from being ready to eat , stir and taste .
This is where you can adjust the chipotle taste or " heat " buy adding chipotle seasoning ( for taste ) and cayenne / black pepper ( for heat ) .
Just note that cayenne and black pepper take a little while to develop their flavor so err on the side of caution !
You can eat this alone , serve with rice or Tortillas .
Dishes like this often taste better when reheated the day after cooking ( store in a fridge overnight ) .
The flavors blend very nicely and seem to " ferment " .
As with any raw meats , safety and hygiene are important .
Follow safety precautions , wash your hands , disinfect surfaces and cook thoroughly !
Enjoy !

Village Services Trust ( VST ) is an NGO based in Tamil Nadu with a mission to facilitate rural development through community development projects .
Their vision is to “ serve the basic needs and priorities of the socially , educationally and economically backward sections of women , foster rehabilitation and overall development of the physically challenged and provide utmost care and support for child welfare ” .
VST ’s main focus areas are women ’s empowerment and child welfare and they currently operate in the Dindigul and Kanyakumari districts of Tamil Nadu .
Many of their initiatives , targeting the areas of education , health and overall welfare , are implemented in tandem with the state government and other NGOs operating in these areas .
VST has enabled the formation of women ’s group in village to campaign for better representation and involvement in key decision making processes .
They also have implemented a Grameen Bank model micro credit system that is supported by Self Help Groups ( SHGs ) .
These SHGs have also been successful in building community network within these societies for women and the marginalised .
VST also runs health centers to provide medical , maternity consultations and counselling .
In collaboration with the Aravind hospital , Madurai , VST has organized eye and dental camps .
They are also active in spreading awareness about personal hygiene , HIV , STDs , immunization and family planning .
The other major focus for VST is child welfare with emphasis on rehabilitation of abandoned and abused children .
VST rescues at - risk children and provides them shelter , education , vocational training and , more importantly , an opportunity to lead a normal life again .
The child rehabilitation project has been operational since 1999 at their Dindigul center .
It is estimated that there are 3500 children living on the streets of Dindigul .
Many of the abandoned or run-away children seek work in factories and shops to earn a living .
Their predicament makes them easy victims of sexual , labor and / or drug abuse .
VST seeks to help these children by help strengthen family structure to minimize run-aways , scouting for and reaching out to the abandoned as early as possible and shelter them before abuse .
They also rescue abused children and provide a safe shelter where they can grow in a nurturing environment .
At present , there at 83 children being cared for at the shelter .
It takes almost Rs. 1.5 Lakhs or $ 3,000 a month to sustain this project , to provide for children ’s basic needs ie food , clothing , health care , education etc .
The child rehabilitation project currently has a crisis of funds .
VST is seeking donations to help them continue operations and provide for these children .

Prince Fielder last night showed the world what Brewer fans already knew he could hit the baseball a very long way .
Fielder was able to beat Nelson Cruz in the Home Run Derby Finals by a score of 6 - 5 and take the title back to Milwaukee .
Fielder was making his second appearance in the Home Run hitting contest and he did look much more confident then his last time around .
Fielder has been on a hitting tear the last few weeks so I thought he had a good shot at it , but he even exceeded my expectations .
Fielder opened a lot of eyes up in baseball with this win .
Fielder plays in a small market and not everyone gets to see what a true talent he is .
The only down part of the night for Fielder was when he fielded questions about his dad who he does not talked to .
As usual a reporter had to bring it up instead on asking questions about winning the trophy .
No matter what Prince Fielder represented Brewer fans well last night and we should be proud of the Prince we have in Milwaukee .
Based on Comes vs Microsoft exhibits , we already know that the company from Redmond is most afraid of GNU / Linux .
There is no point in denying it and it is always valuable to see what the company says internally .
In today ’s exhibit , Exhibit PX08256 ( 2001 ) [ PDF ] , a revealing memo from Gates is shown publicly , probably for the first time at least on the Web .
Jim Allchin distributes this in - progress memo from Bill Gates to Brian Valentine , Paul Flessner , Mike Nash , Will Poole , Yuval Neeman , and Dan Neault .
Gates expresses concern about developers moving away from Windows :
Our strength comes from the singularity and popularity of the platform .
even we ca n’t afford multiple overlapping messages especially when developers are moving to Linux and Java .
Right now they try pulling developers to Windows , .NET , and Visual Studio , thanks to Novell ’s work on Mono .
Regarding quality , Gates concludes :
Jihad is a term that Bill Gates uses on occasions .
But here is the most interesting part :
Our most potent Operating System competitor is Linux and the phenomena around Open Source and free software .
The same phenomena fuels competitors to all of our products .
The ease of picking up Linux to learn it or to modify some piece of it is very attractive .
The academic community , start up companies , foreign governments and many other constituencies are putting their best work into Linux .
Another drop of fear :
According to Gates , GNU / Linux may be is easier than Windows ( at least in areas that he mentions ) .
Microsoft understands that it needs to prevent GNU / Linux from becoming a commodity , which it is already becoming regardless of Microsoft ’s efforts to prevent it ( even with FUD , intimidation , and lawsuits )
Wallclimber , who kindly extracted and provided the full text , adds : “ One thing that struck me in this one is the mention of Gmail ( it ’s mentioned under the heading “ Asynch Communication ” ) .
Yet , the emails attached to the “ Software Agenda ” document are dated back in 2001 . ”
She is referring to the following part where Bill Gates states :
We will continue to charge for email capability which we need to enhance with Gmail capabilities as discussed in the subscription memo , Unclear is whether Workflow or Portal Servers are separate and what access is paid for by having an up - to - date Office license .
Walt Mossberg and Gates are not exactly as separate as the Wall Street Journal wants readers to believe and here is more potential proof :
The PC has to have all the advantages of being a simple dedicated appliance without giving up the ability to run many applications and support a variety of peripherals and update the system software .
Walt Mossberg and our satisfaction data say we have n’t done enough on this .

This memo is one of the ones I have discussed doing .
It is not the Roadmap memo .
Rather it is my view of the key issues .
This will be a live document .
Some of the points are incomplete as you will see .
We will have some time to discuss where I should focus more attention during the SLT meeting tomorrow .

Software Agenda
For companies like Oracle where they have a single technology and a focus on a single customer set its easier to understand what their priorities are Microsoft is building a much broader platform for a broader set of customers .
Our strength comes from the singularity and popularity of the platform .
even we ca n’t afford multiple overlapping messages especially when developers are moving to Linux and Java .
our platform pieces have to solve major problems for customers and be extremely popular .
This memo is an attempt to draw up the list of areas where progress can make a big difference so that we can focus on these and track our progress .
In addition to improving this memo a complimentary Roadmap memo needs to be created .
Software Distribution
We need to be able to go to endusers and corporate customers with a service for keeping their software up to date .
For customers I believe this should be included in our low cost subscription offering which you get 3 months of free membership in when you update Windows or get a new copy .
The service needs to federate through the corporation so they can control what goes out to their end users .
Allowing updating to be federated will help us know how to federate other elements of the system which contain Microsoft URLs or connect to our services ( help , crash , dump , IM , custom home page , SIP communications , remote storage … ) .
Federation means giving IT a way of reviewing and controlling what goes out as well as using the infrastructure for their own software distribution .
We have many formats and approaches to software distribution today .
the question of when “ setup ” gets done affects distribution .
SMS should go away as a separate product as we provide this service as a part of Windows .
Windows update needs to move to sending deltas instead of whole files .
We need Drizzle features that MARS provides .
In many cases we need to move away from DLL replacement to patching using the PPRC technology .
Fusion needs to be embraced broadly .
Windows Update has to be a lot less intrusive to the user and a lot richer in content .
Corporations have to feel a real loss if they are not getting the fixes that only come by belonging to the update service .
We need to articulate the vision for software distribution and get ISVs involved as well .
OS updates and Driver updates need to share the same infrastructure .
Windows needs to pick someone to architect this and make sure it is a central element of our platform .
The business benefit of having great software distribution will be huge because it will give corporations a reason for staying up to date with us without viewing every new bit that comes from us as creating gigantic overhead ,
It will also allow us to up the quality of the products our users experience dramatically .
This is the most important reform I list .
The Windows group needs to drive the creation of this service for all Windows users and
ISVs .
There are parts of SMS which could get moved to a “ PC support ” overall package ( like software inventory ) but that would only make sense if we bought one of the PC support packages to sell as an application .
Quality
Microsoft needs to know when users experience crashes or other errors that come from software bugs .
Using this feedback loop we will be able to fix problems in our products quickly .
Combined with the distribution service described above this will do more to improve our reputation than any new features we will provide .
Both Office ( Dr. Watson ” and Windows ( Bluescreen ) have systems for taking system crash information and publishing it to a MicrosoR URL so that we can analyze the crash .
Already these systems have uncovered a number of important crashes that our normal systems had never caught .
Today we have no way of taking a system that is experiencing problems and being able to remotely patch in code to gather more information .
Using the
work done in PPRC we can add that capability .
Today the crash logging systems are n’t able to involve a third party ISV or PSS or a customers IT group in the process of gathering all the information and solving the problem – these dumps are coming straight to the product group today .
The current systems are restricted to dealing only with crash situations – they should be broadened to support general error conditions including
having the application call on these services when something is wrong .
These crash handling systems need to be changed to work in the unattended server environment .
We need to have at least 100,000 clients and 10,000 servers where we totally support the machines to have a complete profile of problems .
As part of our subscription offering being able to log what goes on on these systems , back them up and solve any problems that come up will guide our work .
We need to understand the costs and complexities users experience with our systems .
Beyond the “ error ” feedback loop described above we need an overall focus on quality issues including someone full time who looks at the business , partnership and technical issues that could significantly improve the situation .
People like the specialized publications and Intel could play a role in helping us measure what needs to improve .
For example a great feature of Whistler is the ability to connect up with someone else in order
for them to help support you including letting them take control of your machine .
We need to fix the firewall problem that stands in the way of all PC real time scenarios for this feature to see its full use .
We need to continue to evolve this capability so that
support costs for PCs go down significantly .
This feature needs to work for ISVs and IT .
Another key element of quality is to make sure that buggy third party code creates less problems for our users .
Central to this is code signing and forcing addon code to go through a testing process .
Our update service should be able to notify users that a piece of code they have installed has had its certificate revoked .
An ongoing jihad here is critical .
Productivity
The man -years of work per feature created at Microsoft is n’t good enough .
Good architecture that leads to powerful shared infrastructure can help with this but there are dramatic gains that need to be made beyond that .
The total number of bugs we are creating and then having to track down slows everything down .
Even a 10 % improvement would make jobs more interesting , cut costs and allow us to get higher quality more powerful software to market quicker ..
Potential advances can come from tools , processes , and source language .
The recent move to SourceDepot was a big success
and reinforced the importance of great tools .
Likewise the Prefix work from PPRC has been extremely beneficial .
Still our tools overall are poor .
The tools we use internally should be a pure superset of those we offer to the market .
Our source codes should be structured XML documents that allow specification and code to be more closely coupled .
Part of the PPRC vision is that navigating information related to execution and testing
with the source code should be easy .
Source codes should be easily accessible online .
Part of Simonyi ’s vision is that the source language itself should be extensible so that domain specific constructs are simple to create and understand .
User interface ’ s should be so easy to create that you create them and then document them .
Ideas for improvements will come from PPRC , Simonyi ’s work , Research in general , Linux development , other outsiders and parts of the product group including some initiatives in David Greenspoon ’s area .
I think VS8 should embrace the idea of source code as an XML document with an environment that combines the vision Intentional Programming and PPRC have suggested .
This will be a huge advance for our customers as well as for internal productivity .
We need a specific agenda in this area – things we are implementing and things we are exploring .
We need regular checkpoints for discussing best practices and new ideas .
Openness
Our most potent Operating System competitor is Linux and the phenomena around Open Source and free software .
The same phenomena fuels competitors to all of our products .
The ease of picking up Linux to learn it or to modify some piece of it is very attractive .
The academic community , start up companies , foreign governments and many other constituencies are putting their best work into Linux .
Although we cannot make Windows free for commercial use we can do dramatically more to make it accessible including parts of the source code .
We can make it flee in restricted areas .
One important idea is to be able to source debug any running copy of Windows by connecting up to an Internet hosted symbol table with PPRC technology allowing you to patch the code .
This means that you do n’t have to get the entire source and learn how to build it to debug and add on to Windows at a source level .
Although some parts of the source would have to be made opaque to the general public , some of the source could be there for all people and all of the source could be there for some people .
We need other creative ideas to allow Windows to match the viral nature of Linux .
Storage innovation ( including caching & replication )
The Microsoft file system and related protocols have stood still for almost a decade .
During this time HTTPFLJRLsiDAV and Email have become important competitors to the file system .
Users are very frustrated that even the most basic property query capability is not available for files .
Even inside Windows itself we create special stores for music , fusion , passwords and every new object that needs property based viewing .
Office has created a storage system called Sharepoint based on HTTP .
MSN created a free “ storage ” service called MSN communities .
Office has had to abstract away from just using our file system APIs because Windows did not connect out to rich enough servers and so Office embraced some form of DAV .
IIS is a kind of storage system with its own naming and security and code invocation capabilities .
Our customers are finding it easier to install storage appliances than Microsoft servers .
Storage systems are being abstracted away from the application servers .
Both our servers and CAL revenue are at risk .
The best solution is to pursue an architecture that is over a decade old and that is to make the storage system richer – rich enough so that email , music and things like printers , fonts , etc.. , are able to be queried and stored without using special applications for each type .
This means taking our next generation SQL technology – Yukon and making it the next generation file system .
The new strategy will only work if we get a class of applications that take advantage of the new capabilities of the store system .
Capabilities like basic Document management should be intrinsic to our new file system .
Serving up bits over HTTP and serving them up over SMB should not be different .
The name spaces and ability to invoke code should come together .
HTTP listening and HTTP efficiency are key capabilities – one listener and one talker .
We need a vision of how storage semantics and systems will evolve .
What is our response to huge SAN networks of disk supporting the commodity protocols ?
Will we make Windows systems easy enough to set up and price attractive for these markets ?
What kind of high end features are we missing ?
I have pushed the Windows NTFS group to think of Sharepoint as a storage system that they should ship and then work to provide something that is integrated and better than NTFS alone or Sharepoint alone .
There is a question about Yukon subsets .
Whistler+l should probably align all of the various system stores to a subset of Yukon like DireetDB .
We also need a compatible subset for PDA devices .
Btackcomb is the release that has the Yukon file system active once it is booted and is used to simplify the interaction with all information on the system
The future of storage systems has to be considered in light of the intelligent caching that will be present in the Network and in the client devices .
There is no reason that Geo-caching should apply to HTTP information and not to the Windows file system .
Our whole Message bus strategy should apply to caching file system information as well as generic messages so that the work we do on tagging , local recomputation , and push ] pull are shared .
We should be the leader in defining the new protocols for caching cache invalidation and reporting usage of cached information .
Our client level caches give us the ability to influence Websites to do things our way .
Making replication of information is another critical goal for storage reform .
One of the key scenarios where the PC shines is in offline use that is not going away .
Today the user is forced to manually do the replication of all the information they might want offline .
The interface is different for Mail , Directory , WebPages , Files , and Code .
For files we have Briefcase and Intellimirror .
Windows2000 brought the different replication commands into one place but that reinforced the problem .
Our file system should treat caching of information – all information – as one of its native capabilities ,
We will need a short term plan for replication advances as well as the plan for Blackcomb .
We have to make it easy to move between PCs either whether or not a user connects to our services or not .
The new storage system has to rtm as a service in the cloud at very large scale including hooks in Windows to make it easy for subscribers to store data .
Even before we get advanced storage we need to provide a rich replication service between all our devices .
Collaboration / Workflow on SQL
Strongly related to storage reform is having email show up as an item in system storage .
We have already taken the step of combining the Exchange and SQL groups with this goal in mind .
Yukon is being influenced by the requirement of hosting the next version of our email server .
There is a key question about what different servers we should have on top of Yukon for Knowledge workers .
The Windows File Server needs to use Yukon and offer much richer features which subsume Sharepoint .
We will continue to charge for email capability which we need to enhance with Gmail capabilities as discussed in the subscription memo , Unclear is whether Workflow or Portal Servers are separate and what access is paid for by having an up - to - date Office license .
I believe we should take the Biztalk platform and use it for Office workflow but this requires a visual front end .
The technology needs to relate to our Information Agent work .
The separation of Office from our servers has held us back in solving problems for knowledge workers .
No matter what the organization structure is Office needs server support for rich Document Management , Workflow , Conferencing , C-mail and other knowledge worker scenarios .
We should also combine the efforts to have a rich environment for Team source code development with the desire to have a Vignette like high end production tool built on these servers .
Whatever servers we create we will want to operate them as a service for customers signing up to our Office .
Net service .
Authentication and Directory
We need to move over to SQL as the store for directory and metadirectory as soon as we can .
We need to have security ACLs they are n’t dependent on Ids which are tied to the hierarchy chosen for names .
Companies should be able to move users around in the hierarchy whenever they want .
By using SQL our tools will work with the directory information .
We need to articulate the importance of a Metadirectory and take leadership in having connections to all the applications that use directory information .
There will be a lot of key schema work that we n~d to do in partnership with other leading companies to make this work .
We need A.D. to support public keys and allow for federation with Passport .
One of the systems should be renamed to have the same name as the other .
Our metadirectory should be usable independent of the OS it is running on for intranet scenarios .
The Directory team needs to work with Yukon to get the data model and protocol issues resolved so that the semantics for authentimtion replication can be done without special set up .
We need to make sharing of all kinds of information across corporate boundaries easy by federating with Passport .
We need to make it easy to authenticate the sender of information the same way .
Directory design should not be a fragile and gating item for the deployment of Windows , systems .
We need to make sure our authentication system allows for signed code .
We need to eliminate vulnerability that the way our admin account passwords are handled creates .
Our customers should not have to go to third party solutions .
Our certificate architecture should be aligned with our ACL / Directory / PKI work .
Customers should n’t have to buy add on security products like Entrust .
The Windows group needs to drive a roadmap for this big change in how we do Directory .
We should be able to charge extra [ ’or Metadirectory and the Federation services that allow the Extranet services to work through Passport .
We should have Office and H , R. Apps vendors work with our MetaDirectory people so that the common scenarios relating to finding out about employees provides a great front end experience .
Today trying to find out who works in what part of the org or where they are located or what their backround is far too complex .
Management / Setup
Provisioning and monitoring Windows systems needs to be far easier than Linux systems .
Our management infrastructure has to use the eventinghogging / filtering APIs that we are defining with the SQL Message bus .
The vision of the BIG group where you can describe a set of systems to perform a task and then monitor those systems through an XML document is key here .
An abstract description of a servex should allow a service to fully provision the server .
Customers respond favorably to the idea of having ASP resources available on demand for peak loading and disaster recovery .
BIG and AppCenter and Management to me are really one set of ’problems .
By using all the SOAP / XML protocols and the Yukon infrastructure we will be able to have an extensible management environment .
Windows has to work in a headless environment including reporting crash information over the network to enable the automatic provisioning scenario .
One of the reasons that appliances are so attractive for dedicated functions is that Windows is too hard to setup for specific profiles .
Although for high visibility profiles we should have special packages it should be very easy to choose a profile like “ Load balancing ” or “ RAS ” and a few parameters and simply ask the server to be setup .
We need to merchandise how this approach can be more flexible in terms of staying up to date and providing flexibility than a pure appliance approach ,
In the past we tried to do setup and monitoring using MMC .
MMC was n’t a model – it was simply a shared display service .
The Setup and Management Console capabilities need to be put onto the XML runtime as that gets done so that we get rich viewing and navigation .
I do n’t know what interim runtime the Management people are trying to use – this should be discussed .
Some level of management needs to ship with Windows and some level can be extra charge .
We need a rich framework / schema around the Yukon infrastructure that third parties use to add management capabilities .
Tivoli excelled as a framework with third party value added before they actually shipped rich functionality which is a model for what we need to do several parts of management .
We should make sure firewall issues do n’t make it hard for people to manage their systems across the Internet .
We should consider offering Remote management services under the new framework .
Leadership in management will be measurable from customer feedback , revenue , and comparison with other high end vendors .
We have invested a lot in this area over the years but our solutions have suffered from having their own infrastructure .
Windows cannot be a strong server product without having excellent management .
Presentation reform
Our “ presentation ” layer today consists of a number of disconnected technologies including DirectUser , GDI Plus , DirectX , Trident , PTO , VS Forms , Webforms , Ebook , Office SDM and Forms3 .
An innovative presentation layer is critical to showing off why local application execution provides a better experience and keeping the PC vibrant versus dumb devices .
We want most applications to download to PCs and run there receiving XML data and XML SOAP calls over the Internet .
A rich presentation environment that allows forms and UI to be specified and easily edited and allows XML data to bind to each is critical .
The lowest level of our Presentation system should present a single driver interface and allow exploitation of new graphics chips .
Turner Whirred in Research is pulling together thoughts on what requirements this creates .
A good design for this system will allow us to layer in PDF compatibility including an annotation layer .
A good design for this system will allow us to build an animation layer which is competitive – today Flash is playing this roll .
Video and Audio will play a major role in upcoming interfaces and they cannot be relegated to just run in a player application .
Also screen updating should be done more smoothly using offscreen memory
I want us to be able to construct rich UI easily simply by editing an XML document .
I want us to be able to bind to XML data easily using the new forms environment .
We have compatibility issues to consider with all of the above systems .
Trident will be a piece of the solution as the HTML displayer but it will likely not be at the center of the system .
One important consideration is to make sure that display remoting using our proprietary WTS protocol / Netmeeting ( same or different ? ) continues to work for applications with extensions to support high quality audio and video .
There are a lot of compatibility constraints but also a need to innovate in this level of the system .
A key question is : Can we make applications look better if they use the new approach ?
Its unclear to me how much symmetry we can have with the server based forms model – Webforms .
Ideally we want XML payloads to rich clients but developer ’s do n’t want to think through their forms logic twice and completely duplicate that code .
Our strategy is to make standards based HTML look increasingly obsolete and not have to give away the underpinnings of our presentation environment to a standards group .
There is an ongoing dialog between Ted Peters and all of the constituent groups to try and come up with a proposal on where we go with this .
FIP is potentially a partner for printing related aspects of the new approach .
Applications platform
Our applications platform message is quite confused today .
Pieces like CLR , WMI , MSMQ , XML runtime , Biztalk , MTS , i-IS , ASP + , Load Balancing , Message bus , SOAP , UDDI and Yukon are not consistent and reinforcing .
Basic standards like eventing , logging , and filtering have to be established .
The discomaeetion of these products make our message when trying to win back the developers who like JAVA and J2EE very difficult especially when we have the limitation of being only on Windows and those technologies are supported on many platforms by many companies .
Although we have waited a long time for the shipment of VS with the URT that does n’t give us anywhere near a complete consistent platform story .
We have talked about many of these problems but not pulled things together .
MSMQ is a bit of an orphan .
Our transaction strategy is n’t getting any traction while BEA has established an $ 800 M per year business around that technology .
We did a good job on MSMQ and MTS but they could n’t thrive on their own .
Our decision to make Yukon the center of gravity and to connect Yukon to the URT should give us the clear starting point .
We may need to be able to package Yukon so that it does n’t feel like a database if all you want is a Message bus .
We may need to create some subset implementations of things like Queuing for size and speed reasons .
However the API set should be consistent .
We may need to be compatible with some of the J2EE apis .
I think that between Paul , Yuval and Eric ’s group with some help from Rick Rashid we should be able to go through another iteration on this ( like we did with NGWS ) and come up with some clear answers .
The strength of this platform and the innovation around it is the key element in preventing commodization by Linux , our installed base and Network Appliance vendors .
We are in the best position to define the distributed application model that allows work to be moved out into the Network .
We do n’t have enough research our product group people pushing this agenda but we have the best opportunity .
This is what it takes to seize leadership in caching , load balancing and protocols , I think between Management / Setup and a vision of how our platform is Distributed we give ourselves a chance to lead in all the Level 7 networking pieces .
I almost included this as a separate item but executing on these two technical pieces will give us what we need except for packaging , marketing and sales force .
There is a major packaging question once we get architectural coherence .
To what degree should we package or charge for the rich so ealled middleware pieces separately from the rest of the platform ?
Are there advanced forms of some of these pieces that cost extra ?
Most of the API set we want supported in the base server with understandable advanced services costing extra .
We are discussing with IBM a joint effort to agree on most of the Application server pieces so that companies have a choice of our two implementations .
Although this would be an unexpected partnership I see a lot of advantages for both companies .
I think they can help with parts of the architecture .
The current view is that we do not share any code between the companies .
We also need to drive Microsoft to use the new platform to prove it out and show it off .
Our Services need to use these architectures so that our tools make them easy to extend .
PC Excellence
The PC has to have all the advantages of being a simple dedicated appliance without giving up the ability to run many applications and support a variety of peripherals and update the system software .
Walt Mossberg and our satisfaction data say we have n’t done enough on this .
One critical issue is boot time .
I spend minutes of my life everyday rebooting my system at work and at home
It has gotten slower as I have moved to new releases of Windows .
Just making a big advance in this area would cause a lot of people to upgrade Windows .
The Windows team is focused on making Standby and Hibernate much faster including the BIOS piece that requires OEM work .
We need to make sure we improve it even a lot beyond where Whistler will be partly with software advances and partly with hardware .
We should have a flavor of Boot that assumes not big changes and uses the same logic and de-hibernating .
WinHEC is the forum where we get to send the message to the hardware vendors about what we are focused on .
We need a clear message on power management , removable media , microphones , video decoding , graphics , that makes the PC a moving target .
Data Center
Its critical that we be able to handle the most demanding applications – even those that do n’t partition naturally across many servers .
We need to lead with partitioning technology but also make sure our hardware partners are providing single server systems that match everything SUN is doing – memory bus , I / O speed etc . .
We will continue to find software bottlenecks in these scenarios .
There are a number of sottware features we still need to match up to Mainframes and Solaris in the Datacenter scenarios .
Many of those we can use partners to solve .
Key hardware partners are IBM ( particularly if they will put x86 support onto their latest chip technology ) , Intel , AMD , Compaq , HP , Unisys and a number of Japanese vendors .
We have put a lot of energy into supporting Itanium and we need to evaluate at some checkpoints how well Itanium will provide what we need .
Reliability and Manageability are also critical to success here but those have already been mentioned .
The Data center does bring special requirements to those issues .
Real time communication
Part of our vision is that communication in the future will be multi-modal .
People will have a screen – either a PC or a PDA type screen – and anytime they are interacting with the screen they can use speech for commands or navigalion or dictation or talking or voice mail .
Notifications / email / filtefing .

Speech platform and Natural Language
Over the years we have invested quite a bit in natural language and speech recognition / synthesls .
Recently some people have asked when it will really enhance our products and whether there is a customer / developer need that will be huge around this technology .
While some parts of the speech stack we could have developed by partners the “ API ” that says how people allow speech to affect their application is something we need to lead in and own .
As described in our RealTime and PC vision , speech input will be a mainstream part of using a PC .
Likewise typing natural language as part of a conversation ( type in line ) will be the most efficient interface for many things .
This means that alI applications including websites will want to be able to describe how to “ react ” to natural language .
For example when you connect to Amazon .
Com with a PC or a PDA your commands should help you navigate .
Part of Windows /.NET keeping a lead as an applications platform requires us to have the architecture and tools that make it easy for people to language enable all applications .
We need to innovate in how these grammars or slot filling or tree diagrams deal with probabilistic input .
This includes having the client side and server so , rare that can execute the applications .
A degenerate case is where the device is a voice only device .
Since Nuance and Speechworks dominate people creating voice only interaction it is natural for them to be strong in websites wanting multimodal interaction .
Also IBM , Philips , Lucent and various research labs will like to give away speech technology so our asset needs to Focus on toois and API allowing other speech engines to be used .
Speech interaction will change the way applications are defined and finally bring the idea of social interface back to the fore .
I think we can define some scenarios that we need to lead in and track our progress in being the primary platform for language enabled applications .

This is the fourth in a five - part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor 's background and life with those who know her , revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice .
Sonia Sotomayor is flanked by her supervisor , Warren Murray , and D.A. Robert Morgenthau , right , in 1983 .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor graduated with honors from Ivy League schools .
But she may have learned some of her most memorable lessons as a young prosecutor , following police into abandoned tenements and tracking down witnesses on the grimy streets of New York .
Sotomayor joined the Manhattan District Attorney 's office in 1979 during an epic crime wave .
Muggings , burglaries and assaults were rampant ; homicides topped 1,800 a year .
She was recruited from Yale Law School by Robert M. Morgenthau , Manhattan 's district attorney .
She was 25 , and her starting salary was $ 17,000 .
The cases in Trial Bureau 50 seasoned the idealistic young lawyer and honed her trial skills .
She could shred a witness on cross-examination and move a jury to tears , former colleagues recalled .
New York City was awash in heroin , street crime and gun violence .
To prepare for trials , she followed police into tenement shooting galleries , scaled rickety staircases in dilapidated buildings and fought off the stench of squalor to talk to reluctant witnesses .
Sotomayor 's former colleagues and her legal foes describe her as intense , driven and politically astute .
As a prosecutor , she had a commanding presence and put in long hours , chugging several cans a day of the diet soft drink Tab and chain - smoking cigarettes .
( She no longer smokes . )
Watch how she made an impression on fellow prosecutors »
Trial Bureau 50 , with its crowded cubicles and walls painted the color of putty , has sent many lawyers onto distinguished careers in public service , including the late Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John Kennedy Jr.
Sotomayor 's five years there , say Manhattan prosecutors past and present , make her uniquely qualified for the nation 's highest court .
If confirmed , she would be the only justice who prosecuted criminal cases , presided over them and handled criminal appeals .
See what would set Sotomayor apart on the court »
" If you can handle a felony case load in New York County , you can run a small country , " said Warren Murray , who ran the bureau when Sotomayor worked there , and still does .
" I think Sonia 's most interesting days were in the district attorney 's office , " said Hugh H. Mo , a former homicide prosecutor who supervised Sotomayor and tried cases with her .
" You can grow up in the projects and still be very sheltered .
She got her education on the streets of Harlem . "
Like most rookies , Sotomayor started with misdemeanors , juggling 60 to 80 cases at a time , working 12 - hour days in the 1930s - era building on the tip of Manhattan , and pulling an occasional shift in night court .

" Some of the judges liked to use the new assistants to clear their calendars , " Morgenthau recalled .
" She quickly established herself as somebody the judges could n't push around . "
On her second trial , Sotomayor met Dawn Cardi , a rookie Legal Aid lawyer who was trying her first case .
They became best friends .
" We were both baby attorneys , " Cardi said .
" She 's really , really smart and very well - prepared .
She was an excellent trial attorney .
She had a talent for it . "
Another defense attorney , Gerald Lefcourt , recalled Sotomayor as " a very zealous prosecutor , " adding , " She did n't see gray .
She only saw black and white . "
Sotomayor moved up quickly in the D.A. 's office .
It was n't long before she was prosecuting murder cases .
To prepare for trials , she hit the streets , working junkies and street characters for information and comforting grieving families .
The work was sometimes unnerving , but it could also provide an adrenalin rush .
" You could feel the violence .
It was palpable , " said Mo , who with Sotomayor accompanied detectives of Harlem 's 28th precinct into top - floor apartments in six - story tenements to prepare for what became known as the " Tarzan Burglar " case .
" Normal people do not walk into these buildings , " he recalled .
" They were hangouts for drug addicts . "
Robert M. Morgenthau remembers Sotomayor for her role in both the Tarzan Burglar case and in winning the office 's first conviction under a rewritten child pornography law .
Sotomayor mentioned the lessons of the Tarzan case during her confirmation hearings .
She said the case taught her " the tragic consequences of needless deaths . "
A family was destroyed after one of the siblings was killed by a bullet in the head , she said .
" They scattered to the four winds , and only one brother remained in New York who could testify , " she said Tuesday .
The Tarzan case was Sotomayor 's rite of passage as a prosecutor .
She sat second chair , meaning she assisted Mo , the lead prosecutor , at the murder trial of Richard Maddicks .
Read the complaint ( pdf )
Maddicks earned his nickname by swinging from building to building with rope and cables , Mo said .
Along his route , he burglarized top - floor apartments , robbed residents and shot people who got in his way .
Sotomayor convinced Maddicks ' girlfriend , Mabel Ivey , to testify , pointing out that she could shave years off her sentence in another case if she cooperated .
They linked the murder weapon to Maddicks through a neighbor who sold liquor after - hours through a hole cut in the door of his basement apartment .
Sotomayor questioned the man , Charles " Wirdell " Brown , in court , Mo recalled .
It was a high point in the colorful trial .
She had the jury in tears as she questioned the girlfriend of a man fatally shot by the Tarzan Burglar .
Sotomayor impressed
Mo with her organizational skills and ability to boil a complicated case into the essential elements that resonate with jurors .
She helped write his opening statement for the five - week trial and -- long before computers and PowerPoint -- crafted People 's Exhibit One , a large poster - board chart illustrating the pattern linking the Tarzan Burglar to his crimes .
The chart somehow survived nearly three decades in Mo 's basement laundry room .
During the trial , Sotomayor handled the questioning of half the 40 witnesses .
Maddicks was convicted of murder , robbery and related crimes and sentenced to 62 ½ years to life in prison .
He 's still serving time " upstate , " as Manhattan 's prosecutors say .
Even 30 years ago , it was obvious Sotomayor was going places .
See her life story told in pictures »
" Did anybody think she was going to the Supreme Court ?
Of course not , " said Cardi .
" But when you look back , you see she always stood out .
She was always really a cut above . "
" She was very focused , very ambitious , very competent , very hardworking , " Mo recalled .
What struck him most , he said , was her confidence .
" She wanted to reach the highest pinnacle of the profession and did n't think that was far - fetched .
You could see it .
She wanted to make history , " Mo said .
All About Sonia Sotomayor • U.S. Supreme Court • Harlem
The video seen here is “ true ” in the basic sense that it captures the real phenomenon of elephants who perform the physical process of creating drawings by holding brushes in their trunks and applying them to cards mounted on easels .
A BBC News article described an exhibition of such paintings at an Edinburgh gallery in 1996 :
Pictures which were painted by elephants have gone on display at an Edinburgh gallery .
Art graduate Victoria Khunapramot , 26 , has brought the paintings from Thailand to the Dundas Gallery on Dundas Street .
They include “ self - portraits ” by Paya , who is said to be the only elephant to have mastered his own likeness .
Paya is one of six elephants whose keepers have taught them how to hold a paintbrush in their trunks .
They drop the brush when they want a new colour .
Mrs Khunapramot , from Newington , said : “ Many people cannot believe that an elephant is capable of producing any kind of artwork , never mind a self - portrait .
“ But they are very intelligent animals and create the entire paintings with great gusto and concentration within just five or 10 minutes — the only thing they cannot do on their own is pick up a paintbrush , so it gets handed to them .
“ They are trained by artists who fine - tune their skills , and they paint in front of an audience in their conservation village , leaving no one in any doubt that they are authentic elephant creations . ”
Mrs Khunapramot , who set up the Thai Fine
Art company after studying the history of art in St Andrews and business management at Edinburgh ’s Napier University , said it took about a month to train the animals to paint .
The web site of the Asian Elephant Art and Conservation Project explains the background behind elephants ’ being taught to paint , with the resulting artworks being sold and the monies so raised being used to fund elephant conservation projects .
The site includes a video gallery that features several clips of pachyderm artists in action similar to the one linked above , as well as galleries displaying the individual elephants ’ works .
( Based on the similarity of drawings , we ’d guess that the elephant shown in the example video is Hong , a nine - year - old female living at the Maetaman Elephant Camp in Thailand . )
However , although these animals may be creating artworks in a purely physical sense , critics contend that the elephants participating in this activity are not actually “ painting ” in any meaningful sense of the word :
They are n’t engaging in any form of creativity , much less abstractly making free - form portraits of whatever tickles their pachydermic fancies at the moment ; rather , they ’re simply actors performing in tourist trap attractions in Thailand , where they do nothing more than outline and color specific drawings they ’ve been painstakingly trained to replicate — and they manage that much only while receiving a good deal of prompting and guidance throughout the process from their mahout ( trainers ) .
As zoologist Desmond Morris wrote after he and scientist Richard Dawkins traveled to Thailand in 2008 to investigate the “ elephant painting ” phenomenon :
So are these endearing mammals truly artistic ?
The answer , as politicians are fond of saying , is yes and no .
Let me describe exactly what happens .
A painting session begins with three heavy easels being wheeled into position .
On each easel a large piece of white card ( 30 in x 20 in ) has been fixed underneath a strong wooden frame .
Each elephant is positioned in front of her easel and is given a brush loaded with paint by her mahout .
He pushes the brush gently into the end of her trunk .
The man then stands to one side of his animal ’s neck and watches intently as the brush starts to make lines on the card .
Then the empty brush is replaced by another loaded one , and the painting continues until the picture is complete .
The elephant then turns towards its audience , bows deeply and is rewarded with bananas .
The paintings are then removed from their frames and offered for sale .
They are quickly snapped up by people who have been astonished by what they have just witnessed .
To most of the members of the audience , what they have seen appears to be almost miraculous .
Elephants must surely be almost human in intelligence if they can paint pictures of flowers and trees in this way .
What the audience overlooks are the actions of the mahouts as their animals are at work .
This oversight is understandable because it is difficult to drag your eyes away from the brushes that are making the lines and spots .
However , if you do so , you will notice that , with each mark , the mahout tugs at his elephant ’s ear .
He nudges it up and down to get the animal to make a vertical line , or pulls it sideways to get a horizontal one .
To encourage spots and blobs he tugs the ear forward , towards the canvas .
So , very sadly , the design the elephant is making is not hers but his .
There is no elephantine invention , no creativity , just slavish copying .
Investigating further , after the show is over , it emerges that each of the so - called artistic animals always produces exactly the same image , time after time , day after day , and week after week .
Mook always paints a bunch of flowers , Christmas always does a tree , and Pimtong a climbing plant .
Each elephant works to a set routine , guided by her master .
The following video clip reveals something of how much an elephant is actually guided by its mahout during the painting process :
Other critics contend that not only is the elephant painting phenomenon a misleading show put on to garner money from tourists , but that the animals who participate in it have been abused ; therefore , visitors to Thailand should shun the purchase of such works :
I was recently sent an email video which shows an elephant painting a picture of an elephant holding a flower over its head and was asked to comment on it .
As you may or may not know , I returned home last night after my 7th trip to Chiang Mai , Thailand , where the video was shot .
I can tell you with absolute certainty that elephant did not create that picture out of a need for a creative outlet .
It was trained to follow the mahout ’s ( trainer ) command and was purely following orders out of fear of the abuse it suffered during the training process .
If you look closely during the wide angle shots you will see other mahouts standing on their elephant ’s left side and they too are leading their elephant during the process .
The close ups show an elephant ’s trunk moving a paint brush across a canvas and it appears to be creating a picture , except it is taking commands from its mahout who is out of the shot .
The training process is called the ‘ phajaan ’ or ‘ crush ’ and is centuries old and is used throughout Asia today .
It involves taking a 3 - year - old baby from its mother ’s side and roping it into a small bamboo cage in which it cannot move except to breathe .
Of course the elephant fights for its freedom and is beaten , poked with sharp bamboo , starved , dehydrated , and sleep - deprived until it submits to its captors ’ demands .
The process may take a week , depending on how long it takes to ‘ crush ’ the elephant ’s spirit .
About 50 % of the babies die from the process and the survivors are left with physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives .
The demand for elephant paintings comes mostly from Japan , Europe , and the US , and the motivation from the Thai people is purely financial since a single painting can fetch several thousand dollars .
I honestly hope that if people knew the true process for creating a picture , they would not offer any support at all for it .
So PLEASE tell your friends , family , anyone who will listen : DO NOT SUPPORT ELEPHANT PAINTINGS IN ANY WAY , SHAPE , OR FORM !

Shortly after Neda Agha -Soltan bled her life out on the Tehran pavement , the man whose 40 - second video of her death has ricocheted around the world made a somber calculation in what has become the cat - and - mouse game of evading Iran ’s censors .
He knew that the government had been blocking Web sites like YouTube and Facebook .
Trying to send the video there could have exposed him and his family .
Instead , he e-mailed the two - megabyte video to a nearby friend , who quickly forwarded it to the Voice of America , the newspaper The Guardian in London and five online friends in Europe , with a message that read , “ Please let the world know . ”
It was one of those friends , an Iranian expatriate in the Netherlands , who posted it on Facebook , weeping as he did so , he recalled .
Copies of the video , as well as a shorter one shot by another witness , spread almost instantly to YouTube and were televised within hours by CNN .
Despite a prolonged effort by Iran ’s government to keep a media lid on the violent events unfolding on the streets , Ms. Agha -Soltan was transformed on the Web from a nameless victim into an icon of the Iranian protest movement .
At one time , authoritarian regimes could draw a shroud around the events in their countries by simply snipping the long - distance phone lines and restricting a few foreigners .
But this is the new arena of censorship in the 21st century , a world where cellphone cameras , Twitter accounts and all the trappings of the World Wide Web have changed the ancient calculus of how much power governments actually have to sequester their nations from the eyes of the world and make it difficult for their own people to gather , dissent and rebel .
Raskolnikov Meets Dr. Phil
by James Warner
Dr. Phil :
My first guest tonight is a man who has some impulse - control problems .
Raskolnikov :
What do you want ?
When will you leave off tormenting me ?
Dr. Phil :
Hold it right there .
Seems to me you need an attitude adjustment .
( Raskolnikov turns abruptly and stares at the wall . )
Dr. Phil :
Says here you murdered an old lady for her money .
You murdered her , and then you murdered her sister .
What were you thinking ?
Raskolnikov : ( Making a violent effort to understand what it all means ) I murdered myself , not them !
It was the Devil that killed them .
Enough , enough !
I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone , so what is the object of these senseless sufferings ?
Dr. Phil :
You need to get a grip on yourself , and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices .
( Applause from studio audience . )
Raskolnikov : ( Breathing heavily , his upper lip twitching . )
My choice was to be a great man dedicated to improving the lot of humanity .
The vast mass of mankind is mere material , and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence .
Dr. Phil :
Let ’s talk about the independence thing , since you brought it up .
You ’re still receiving money from your mother , is n’t that right ?
And you have a college degree but no job ?
And recently you ’ve embarked on a life of crime ?
Raskolnikov :
The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder , if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea .
Our rulers destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue .
They are knaves and scoundrels .
Dr. Phil :
Ho ho , well I ’m not an expert on politics , but do n’t you think you have enough problems of your own to keep us busy here ?
I understand you ’re in love with a prostitute ?
Raskolnikov : Sonia is a woman of the utmost purity whom I love with a Christ - like intensity that drives me to torment and humiliate her .
Dr. Phil :
Be honest with me now .
Do n’t you think she ’d prefer a relationship in which two healthy people come together because they complement each other on an equal footing of respect and love ?
( Applause from studio audience . )
Raskolnikov : ( Grinds his teeth . )
A dull animal rage boils within me .
Dr. Phil :
We need to extinguish these self - defeating behavior patterns of yours .
Raskolnikov : Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart .
Dr. Phil : I one - hundred percent disagree .
You can do better than that .
Now I understand Sonia ca n’t be here tonight because she ’s ministering to the needs of plague victims , but once you get out of prison for those murders , supposing this Sonia ’s still waiting for you , what do you think
you ’ll have to do to repair the damage you ’ve already done to the relationship ?
Raskolnikov :
My mind is clouded and I am almost unconscious of my body .
Dr. Phil : I ’m sending you to the green room to do some figuring .
Raskolnikov :
Why must you persecute me with kindness , when I would rather boil over with a rapturous agony .
( Laughs insanely . )
Perhaps I am really mad , and all this happens only in my imagination .
Dr. Phil : Nope , you ai n’t getting you off the hook that easy .
Fact is , you are accountable for your actions .
What I ’m asking you to do is take responsibility .
Are you willing to give that a try ?
Raskolnikov : ( Bows down to kiss the earth . )
Good God , man is a vile creature .
Dr. Phil :
Do we have a deal or not ?
Raskolnikov : I could strangle you at this moment .
Why must you torture me ?
I feel a physical hatred for you , cannot bear you near me , and am becoming convinced that you are the most aggravating bully on the face of the Earth .
Dr. Phil :
You see , now we ’re getting somewhere .
Pain , once it ’s acknowledged , can be a powerful motivator .
Raskolnikov :
Be silent , I beg of you .
( Shuddering nervously , a malignant expression in his black eyes . )
I am a louse , a wretch , a fool .
Dr. Phil :
It ’s time for you to identify and confront the behaviors that are making you unhappy .
I always tell people , you do n’t need a diploma to hose down a mule .
( Standing ovation from studio audience . )
Raskolnikov : I feel sublimely indifferent to your opinion .
( Walks toward the exit . )
No , I retract everything I have said , your words make perfect sense , you are a seer , a god .
( Bounding out of the studio , his voice carrying from afar . )
If only I had met you before I became an axe
murderer , perhaps I would now be among the saints .
Dr. Phil :
Oh boy .
( Raskolnikov returns after a tumultuous inner struggle , pushing his way through a dense crowd of peasants . )
Dr. Phil :
We ’re going to take a break now .
Raskolnikov : ( Strikes Dr. Phil repeatedly on the head with the blunt side of an axe , then leaves overcome with remorse . )

Damn , I thought we were done with this story , but it just keeps getting seedier ....
Sen .
John Ensign 's attorney acknowledged Thursday that the Nevada Republican 's parents paid nearly $ 100,000 to the family of his mistress around the time she and her husband left his staff in April 2008 .
Paul Coggins , Ensign 's attorney , said in a statement that the senator gave Doug Hampton , Cindy Hampton and their two children gifts worth $ 96,000 and that " each gift was limited to $ 12,000 . "
" The payments were made as gifts , accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts , " Coggins said .
Coggins said that after Ensign told his parents about his affair with Cindy Hampton — who was an then a campaign aide — the senator 's parents " decided to make the gifts out of concern for the well - being of longtime family friends during a difficult time .
" The gifts are consistent with a pattern of generosity by the Ensign family to the Hamptons and others . "
Wow , 100 K given to his mistress ' family , since he " used her for his own pleasure " .
What a hypocritical nut job .
Can we get rid of this man , too ?
He is as bad as Senator David " I love prostitutes " Vitter .

I received in the mail today a copy of the 2nd edition of Jesus Huerta de Soto 's Money , Bank Credit and Economic Cycles with a nice note from him pointing me to his new preface .
Professor Huerta de Soto and I have known of each other for now close to 20 years , we have periodically corresponded throughout those years but unfortunately I think we have met only 1 time -- at an MPS meeting in Cannes , France .
But our meeting was very memorable to me as extremely pleasant and one that I wish I had many more ocassions to experience .
Professor Jesus Huerta de Soto is a gentleman 's scholar in a way that is very reminiscent of Professor Kirzner .
To be honest very few within the contemporary Austrian school of economics carry themselves with such class and old world dignity .
I know this is one of my failings --- too crude in my sense of humor and undignified in my demeanor ( I get angry easily and am vindictive , and very competitive ) --- and I wish I could behave better .
Professor Kirzner in my mind sets the standard .
Anyway , I do have my disagreements with certain arguments Prof.
Huerta de Soto makes in his various writings , but I have great respect for his deep and uncompromising commitment to the Austrian school of economics , and the tremendous job he has done in teaching and in publishing Austrian works in Spain .
He has written papers and books dealing not only with monetary economics and legal history , but also on the socialist calculation debate , entrepreneurial market process , methodology , and welfare economics .
In short , he is a dynamtic teacher , writer and organizer for the Austrian school of economics first in the Spanish speaking world , but increasingly now in English language works ( he recently published The Theory of Dynamic Efficiency with Routledge ) .
In this second edition of his treatise on money , Huerta de Soto provides a short preface contextualizing the current financial crisis in light of the Austrian theory he develops in the book .
In the process of making the argument for the superior analytical framework provided by the Austrian tradition , Huerta de Soto tackles the interpretative puzzle of the relative price stability experienced under Greenspan ( a fact that may in fact have misled individuals such as Jeff Hummel and David Henderson ) .
But such a record is actually problematic , rather than a sign of the perfection of central banking practice .
During this period of time , the US realized tremendous productivity increases due to technological innovations , and also new trading opportunities in China and India .
As Huerta de Soto writes :
" The absence of a healthy " deflation " in the prices of consumer goods in a period of such considerable growth in productivity as that of recent years provides the main evidence that the monetary shock has seriously disturbed the economic process . "
This is basically Selgin 's thesis in Less Than Zero , and Huerta de Soto presents another Selgin argument when he states that :
" the theorem of the economic impossibility of socialism , which the Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A . Hayek discovered , is fully applicable to central banks in general , and to the Federal Reserve and ( at one time ) Alan Greenspan and ( currently ) Ben Bernanke in particular .
According to this theorem , it is impossible to organize society , in terms of economics , based on coercive commands issued by a planning agency , since such a body can never obtain the information it needs to infuse its commands with a coordinating nature .
Indeed , nothing is more dangerous than to indulge in the " fatal conceit " — to use Hayek 's useful expression — of believing oneself omniscient or at least wise and powerful enough to be able to keep the most suitable monetary policy fine - tuned at all times . "
Selgin develops this argument about central planning very forcefully in his A Theory of Free Banking .
But I was left after reading this rather wonderful preface to wonder where the source of the critical disagreements between Huerta de Soto and Selgin , White and Horwitz really lay with regards to economic theory ( legal and banking history is another question ) .
But I think we can all agree that artificial credit expansion distorts economic activity and ultimately destroys wealth rather than create it .
And we can agree that government intervention into the market economy to try to remedy the previous artificial credit induced distortion does little but to lead to further distortions .
As Huerta de Soto argues :
" the most appropriate policy would be to liberalize the economy at all levels ( especially in the labor market ) to permit the rapid reallocation of productive factors ( particularly labor ) to profitable sectors .
Likewise , it is essential to reduce public spending and taxes , in order to increase the available income of heavily indebted economic agents who need to repay their loans as soon as possible .
Economic agents in general and companies in particular can only rehabilitate their finances by cutting costs ( especially labor costs ) and paying off loans .
Essential to this aim are a very flexible labor market and a much more austere public sector .
These factors are fundamental if the market is to reveal as quickly as possible the real value of the investment goods produced in error and thus lay the foundation for a healthy , sustained economic recovery in a future that , for the good of all , we hope is not too distant . "
I applaud Professor Jesus Huerta de Soto on the publication of the 2nd edition of his book and for all the important activities he is engaged in with his own research , his teaching at King Juan Carlos University in Madrid , and his publishing activities .
And for the clarity with which he states the basic lessons of economic for public policy at this critical time in our history .
The way things stand now , Felix Hernandez and Roy Halladay are Zack Greinke ’s only legitimate competition for the 2009 AL Cy Young Award .
Taking a look at the stats , Greinke is the clear cut favorite to win the award despite playing on an awful team .
Now is a perfect time to break each of their seasons down since all three have made 20 starts and are within 1.2 innings pitched of one another .
Roy Halladay : 141.0 innings pitched with an 11 - 3 record , 2.62 ERA , 1.05 WHIP , and 164 ERA +.
He has struck out 123 and walked 20 while opponents have hit 0.243 against him .
Felix Hernandez : 139.2 innings pitched with an 11 - 3 record , 2.45 ERA , 1.11 WHIP , and an ERA + of 173 .
He has struck out 137 and walked 38 while opponents have hit 0.225 against him .
Zack Greinke : 141.1 innings pitched with a 10 - 6 record , 2.04 ERA , 1.10 WHIP , and an ERA + of 210 .
He has struck out 146 and walked 27 while opponents have hit 0.243 against him .
Clearly it is Greinke ’s award to lose .
He ranks 1st in ERA , 1st in CG , 4th in SO , 5th in IP , and is tied for 1st in shutouts .
Those are MLB , not just AL , rankings .
Switching focus to the AL rankings only ; his 0.3 HR / 9 ranks 1st among starters , his 1.72 BB/9 ranks 2nd , his 9.30 K/9 ranks 3rd , and his 5.41 K / BB ranks 2nd .
If you want one ranking to sum it all up , Greinke ’s 210 ERA + leads AL starters .
Despite Zack ’s phenomenal performance thus far in 2009 the Royals are just 10 - 10 in his 20 starts , which sums up the team ’s lack of offense and defense while highlighting their bullpen woes at the same time .
Click here for proof that I ’m not the only one tracking the Royals ’ record in Zack ’s starts .
Fortunately for Zack , the Royals ’ poor level of play should not adversely impact his chances at the award .
The Cy Young Award is not as tied to team success as the MVP Award traditionally has been .
2008 ’s AL and NL winners , Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum are proof of that .
While the Cy Young Award may not be tightly tied to team success , pitching well on a competitive team certainly does n’t hurt and there are plenty of unenlightened voters that ca n’t get past a pitcher ’s W - L record .
Fortunately for Zack , and Royals fans who need something to root for at the ML level , King Felix and Doc Halladay pitch for teams that , like the Royals , wo n’t sniff the postseason .
Felix ’s Mariners are 51 - 44 and in 3rd place , but they are n’t getting past the Angels or Rangers in their division and are rumored to be shopping Jarrod Washburn among others .
Halladay ’s Blue Jays have wilted to a 4th place 47 - 49 record and he may not be a Blue Jay much longer .
With a no trade clause in place , it seems doubtful that he will allow the Jays to trade him to another AL team .
If he is n’t NL bound , my guess is that he finishes the season with Toronto , either way it wo n’t hurt Zack ’s chances .
Another feather in Zack ’s cap this season is that all 3 candidates play outside of the major TV markets so all should be fairly evaluated with respect to one another .
All 3 pitchers figure to have another 14 or so starts if they remain healthy so a lot can change between now and the end of the season .
That said , but if things stay on course , there is no doubt that Zack Greinke will be the 2009 AL Cy Young Award winner .
When that happens , Royals fans will finally have something to be proud of .

The very fact that God has chosen to devote an entire chapter of the Bible to the story below shows the importance He places on its message .
If you are a Christian , you are in this story .
Read it carefully .
Hopefully your eyes will be opened to reveal which character you presently play .
John 9:1 ( NCV )
As Jesus was walking along , he saw a man who had been born blind .
2 His followers asked him , " Teacher , whose sin caused this man to be born blind - - his own sin or his parents ' sin ? "
3 Jesus answered , " It is not this man 's sin or his parents ' sin that made him be blind .
This man was born blind so that God 's power could be shown in him .
4 While it is daytime , we must continue doing the work of the One who sent me .
Night is coming , when no one can work .
5 While I am in the world , I am the light of the world . "
6 After Jesus said this , he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man 's eyes .
7 Then he told the man , " Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam . " ( Siloam means Sent . )
So the man went , washed , and came back seeing .
8 The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said , " Is n't this the same man who used to sit and beg ? "
9 Some said , " He is the one , " but others said , " No , he only looks like him . "
The man himself said , " I am the man . "
10 They asked , " How did you get your sight ? "
11 He answered , " The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes .
Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash .
So I went and washed , and then I could see . "
12 They asked him , " Where is this man ? " " I do n't know , " he answered .
13 Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind .
14 The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day .
15 So now the Pharisees asked the man , " How did you get your sight ? "
He answered , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and now I see . "
16 So some of the Pharisees were saying , " This man does not keep the Sabbath day , so he is not from God . "
But others said , " A man who is a sinner can't do miracles like these . "
So they could not agree with each other .
17 They asked the man again , " What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened ? "
The man answered , " He is a prophet . "
18 The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again .
So they sent for the man 's parents
19 and asked them , " Is this your son who you say was born blind ?
Then how does he now see ? "
20 His parents answered , " We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
21 But we do n't know how he can now see .
We do n't know who opened his eyes .
Ask him .
He is old enough to speak for himself . "
22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews , who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue .
23 That is why his parents said , " He is old enough .
Ask him . "
24 So for the second time , they called the man who had been blind .
They said , " You should give God the glory by telling the truth .
We know that this man is a sinner . "
25 He answered , " I do n't know if he is a sinner .
One thing I do know : I was blind , and now I see . "
26 They asked , " What did he do to you ?
How did he make you see again ? "
27 He answered , " I already told you , and you did n't listen .
Why do you want to hear it again ?
Do you want to become his followers , too ? "
28 Then they insulted him and said , " You are his follower , but we are followers of Moses .
29 We know that God spoke to Moses , but we do n't even know where this man comes from . "
30 The man answered , " This is a very strange thing .
You do n't know where he comes from , and yet he opened my eyes .
31 We all know that God does not listen to sinners , but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him .
32 Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind .
33 If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . "
34 They answered , " You were born full of sin !
Are you trying to teach us ? "
And they threw him out .
35 When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , Jesus found him and said , " Do you believe in the Son of Man ? "
36 He asked , " Who is the Son of Man , sir , so that I can believe in him ? "
37 Jesus said to him , " You have seen him .
The Son of Man is the one talking with you . "
38 He said , " Lord , I believe ! "
Then the man worshiped Jesus .
39 Jesus said , " I came into this world so that the world could be judged .
I came so that the blind would see and so that those who see will become blind . "
40 Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked , " Are you saying we are blind , too ? "
41 Jesus said , " If you were blind , you would not be guilty of sin .
But since you keep saying you see , your guilt remains . "
Well , have you discovered yourself in this story yet ?
If not , perhaps the rest of this article will help open your eyes .
There is much we could say about this true story .
But I want to focus on " giving glory to God . "
When the blind man was telling the truth , the religious men did not believe him because they already made up their minds that Jesus was a sinner .
The religious men heard the story twice and it was confirmed by the blind man 's parents , yet they wanted this man to call Jesus a sinner .
" You should give God the glory .
We know this man is a sinner . "
The religious men had a preconceived idea of what the Messiah should be like .
They had preconceived ideas about sin and sinners and God 's response to them .
What happened to the blind man did not conform to their preconceived ideas or traditions .
( We must be careful of this ourselves . )
From the religious man 's point of view , to glorify God meant to call Jesus a sinner , something the man Jesus healed from blindness could not say .
When the religious men continued to press the healed blind man , he began to use their own words against them .
They said God does not hear sinners .
God obviously heard Jesus because " no one could open the eyes of the blind unless God 's favor was on him . "
At this point , they ridiculed the blind man being insulted that a man born " completely in sin " had the nerve to try to teach them something .
They threw him out .
This was far more serious than it appears in the text .
It was like excommunication in the Roman Catholic church .
To be thrown out by them was to be cut off from God , from His promises , covenants , and blessings .
In modern christendom terms , he was declared a heretic and consigned to the flames of hell .
While this story happened almost 2 millenniums ago , it is a story which happens every day all over the world .
Two thousand years ago , the players were Jews .
Today , the players are Christians .
The ones thrown out are often those who have had their eyes opened to God 's love for all mankind .
To the religious Jew , to give glory to God meant calling Jesus a sinner .
The word " to sin " in the Hebrew is the word " chata " which literally means " to miss , " as in missing a target with a bow or sling .
The Greek word is " hamartano " which means " to miss the mark ( and so not share in the prize ) , to err . "
It means to fall short of a goal or a purpose .
The religious Jews ' target or goal was their interpretation of the Law of Moses .
" Sin is transgression of the Law . "
The Jews said they had Moses .
They knew who he was , but they did not know who Jesus was .
Jesus told them if they knew Moses , they would have recognized Him because Moses pointed to Jesus .
Because Jesus did not conform to the image the religious Jews expected in the Messiah , they declared Jesus a false Messiah , a false Christ .
They killed the Christ , and turned the ex-blind man into a heretic .
In today 's average church , the " concept of Jesus Christ " states that He in the role of Savior , will save a portion of mankind from eternal torment or annihilation .
He will not or cannot , depending upon whether one is a Calvinist or Arminianist , save all mankind .
The image , mark , goal , law , standard of the Jesus Christ of christendom is one which sees great quantities of human being in hell , unredeemed , unforgiven , unreconciled , and doomed to an awful eternal existence , forever separated from God .
If Jesus came into the average church even declaring who He was , and said that He was going to save all mankind , he would immediately be declared a heretic , a sinner .
Why ?
Because the image the church has of Jesus Christ is one which calls for a large portion of mankind to be tortured or annihilated .
As the Jews say , " We have Moses and the Prophets , " the church would say , " We have our Jesus and the Bible . "
Jesus said
He came to reveal the Father to us .
" For the Father Himself loves you , because you have loved Me , and have believed that I came forth from God . " ( John 16:27 ) " For God so loved the world ... " ( John 3:16 ) Jesus came to reveal the will of the Father .
" For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ; Who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
For there is one God , and one Mediator between God an men , the Man Christ Jesus , who gave Himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time . "
( 1 Timothy 2:3-6 , KJV ) " The Lord is not slack concerning His promise , as some count slackness , but is longsuffering toward us , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance . "
( 2 Peter 3:9 )
Jesus declared
He came to do the will of the Father : " All that the Father gives Me will come to me , and the one who come to Me I will by no means cast out .
For I have come down from heaven , not to do my will , but the will of Him who sent Me .
This is the will of the Father who sent Me , that of all He has given
Me , I should lose nothing but raise it up at the last day .
( John 6:37 - 39 ) Can we know for certain all that the Father has given Jesus ?
" The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in His hands . " ( John 3:35 . NIV )
Now if it is the will of the Father that all be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth , and Jesus came to do that will , if He saves everyone , He will have accomplished His goal ; if He failed to save everyone , He will have missed the mark of His goal , He will have sinned .
The average church clearly believes Jesus will miss the mark , fall short of the Father 's desire or will and so fall short of His purpose .
If a person ran into a typical church service declaring he had been religiously blind for all the years he had spent in church , but now he sees that Jesus is going to save everyone , he will be declared a heretic and thrown out of the church just as the healed blind man was thrown out of the synagogue .
Now I say this from personal experience .
I once was blind to the Truth and like most Christians , I declared Jesus a sinner like the religious people in Jerusalem did .
I said He was not going to save everyone .
Then one day
He opened my eyes and I saw clearly that He had to save everyone in order to fulfill His mission of doing the Father 's will .
My eyes were opened to the Scriptures in a new and exciting way .
I saw Jesus not " missing the mark , " but perfectly completing everything He planned from the foundation of the world .
" If I be lifted up from the earth will draw ( drag in the Greek ) all mankind unto Myself . " ( John 12:32 )
So who are you in the story ?
The blind man before being healed , or after being healed , or the parents who knew , but were afraid to speak because they feared the religious leadership .
Or are you a religious person who says he sees and therefore are still in your sins and as a result still blind ?
Or are you a blind leader leading the blind ; still in your pit of darkness ?
Are you giving glory the way religious men tell you to do , by calling Jesus a sinner , one who will miss His calling ?
Or will you be like the healed blind man , cast out of the church , but received by Jesus ?
( John 9:41 ) Open our eyes , Lord , we want to see Jesus .
And then " Give Glory ! "

As you ’ll see later , in this tutorial we will cover how to trade with Plus500 broker .
So , before continuing you can look at this review of Plus500 before we begin .
And now , we ’ll start with the online trading guide .
Online stock trading
With CFDs , you can make online trades on many underlying assets .
Currencies on the Forex market are among the most popular underlying assets .
However , there are possibly more people in the trading world who are interested in stocks .
As you may know , CFDs are derivative products .
This means that when you trade CFDs on an underlying asset , you do not own that asset , but rather a product that roughly replicates its behavior and price .
Therefore , if you trade stock CFDs you should be aware that you will own not the stocks , but a derivative .
Of course , if you have purchased stock CFDs that pay dividends with Plus500 , you should know that you are entitled to receive dividends .
With brokers like Plus500 you can trade CFDs on stocks from around the world .
Of course , stocks on the US Stock Exchange ( S & P500 , Dow Jones and Nasdaq ) , from the UK , Germany and Spain are available .
This means that there are CFDs on the shares of Facebook , Alphabet , Netflix and many more .
Of course , it is also possible to trade stock index CFDs .
Each online broker has their conditions for trading .
Some apply fees for each purchase and sale transaction / operation , and others simply charge spreads and other types of fees .
In the case of Plus500 there are no commissions on the buying and selling of share CFDs as you can see here ( 76,4 % of retail CFD accounts lose money ) .
Online Forex trading
If what you ’re interested in is currency trading , you have the option of trading CFDs on different currency pairs .
As you may know , in the Forex market you are always operating with currencies .
If you invest in stocks , you only do so with one stock .
That is , you buy or sell Facebook shares , but in the case of currencies , you can only trade one currency against another .
For example , you can buy CFDs on the Euro against the Dollar , which is known as the Euro / Dollar .
If you are making this trade , what you ’re interested in is that the Euro should be better than the Dollar .
As you can see , the Forex market is somewhat complex , and if we add to this the fact that CFDs are also complex , we find that we are dealing with high - risk products .
As you can imagine , currency prices are constantly moving because the Forex market is the one that is the most liquid and has the largest volume worldwide .
This means that every time a piece of news comes out about the economy of a country , the prices move quickly and strongly .
In the case of Forex CFD trading , Plus500 broker has no commissions as you can see here ( 76,4 % of retail CFD accounts lose money ) .
Online commodity trading
Almost everything in the world is based on commodities .
Among the most popular commodities for trading are oil , gold , corn , etc .
As you can see it is energy , metals and food that move the world .
Obviously if you trade commodity CFDs you do not have the right to collect dividends or anything like that , because you are not investing invest in companies that have an economic activity , but in raw materials .

Online cryptocurrency trading
In recent years there has been a huge cryptocurrency boom .
The sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin since its inception has made millions of people interested in virtual currencies .
Having said that , we have to remember that the volatility of cryptocurrencies is enormous .
Just as there have been months when the price of cryptocurrencies such as Ripple or Ethereum has had a meteoric rise , there have also been huge falls within short periods of time .
The interest in cryptocurrencies is no surprise because many people see them as the future of payment methods .
But there are also opposing opinions .
For example , there are many people who think that cryptocurrencies are a big bubble that is bursting .
And there are some who are even more radical ; they think that cryptocurrency is an outright scam .
Of course , there are also opinions in between .
Among them are those who think that one cryptocurrency may succeed and another may fail .
For example , some may think that Bitcoin will fail , and that Ripple will be the one to succeed because it has the support of banks .
At the end of the day , deciding if cryptocurrencies are a scam or the future is entirely up to you .
As you can see here with Plus500 , you can trade CFDs on almost all crypocurrencies ( 76,4 % of retail CFD accounts lose money ) .
Online brokers
To be able to trade you need to contract the services of a broker or a CFD provider .
The world is full of brokers that allow CFD trading .
However , some of them are very expensive , because they charge big commissions , and others , although they have attractive offers , also involve great risks because they are not properly regulated .
In this tutorial we talk a lot about Plus500 , but there are other reputable brokers such as Markets.com , eToro or AvaTrade , among others .
Most of them have something in common and it is that they are reasonably regulated .
– Plus500UK Ltd authorised & regulated by the FCA ( #509909 ) .

Although it is impossible to know if a broker is a scam , all the signs seem to indicate that one is dealing with a safe broker .
Demo account
Throughout the tutorial we have stressed quite a bit the fact that CFDs are high - risk products , and partly because of this , some brokers offer a demo account service .
The demo is a simulator that allows you to trade with virtual money .
With the demo , the underlying assets are simulated , but they behave the same as on a real trading platform .
This allows you to get into the world of trading without risking real money .
In the Plus500 demo we find that the platform is the same as the real one .
This means that the charts are the same , that orders such as stop - loss or take - profit are available and that you have all the underlying assets at your disposal .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- A Chinese factory that makes iPhones said Wednesday that it has suspended several staffers after an employee committed suicide , apparently under duress when a prototype went missing .
Foxconn manufactures the popular iPhone for U.S. - based Apple in China .
Sun Danyong , 25 , jumped off the 12th floor of the Foxconn Science and Technology Group in the southern city of Shenzhen last week .
The recent engineering school graduate sent 16 model phones to phone manufacturer , Apple , but only 15 were received , said the state - run newspaper New Beijing Post .
Because of the missing phone , Sun was questioned by company officials and -- according to posts on online forums by his friends -- detained , searched and beaten .
Apple China said it was awaiting the results of an investigation into Sun 's death .
" We require that our suppliers treat all workers with dignity and respect , " Apple said in a statement .

Two years ago this month , there were 24 left .
Now , they are all gone , and there is nobody alive who fought in the First World War .
Well , there is still Jack Babcock , who joined the Royal Canadian Regiment in 1917 but got no closer to the fighting than England .
And American veteran Frank Buckles , who drove an ambulance in France as a 17 - year - old in 1918 .
But the last real combatant , Harry Patch , who was wounded at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917 , died on Saturday ( July 25 ) .
They ’ve been going fast .
Erich Kaestner , the last German veteran , died in January 2008 .
Tony Pierro , who fought with the American Expeditionary Force in France in 1918 , died in February .
Lazare Ponticelli , the last of the generation of French men who fought in the trenches , died a month later .
( One - third of French males who were between 13 and 30 in 1914 did not survive the war . )
Yakup Satar , who joined the Turkish army in 1915 and fought in Iraq , died in April 2008 .
Delfino Borroni , the last Italian veteran , died in October .
Australia ’s last veteran , Jack Ross , died last month , and Henry Allingham , the grandest old man of all , died a week ago .
Allingham was almost 20 in 1916 when he took part in the Battle of Jutland , the last and greatest clash of armoured steel battleships .
( He saw the giant shells “ skipping off the water . " )
As a mechanic in the Royal Naval Air Service , he flew missions over the freezing North Sea in 1917 in seaplanes that he described as “ motorized kites ” .
And he spent 1918 in France trying to recover British planes that came down in No Man ’s Land .
" We were moving forward at night , ” he recalled about the Western Front .
“ It was dark ... I fell into a shell hole .
It was full of arms , legs , ears , dead rats -- a lot of dead , rotten flesh ...
I lay there in the dark , not daring to move , cold and with my uniform stinking .
I was frightened . "
Sixty million men had the same memories , but they are no longer with us .
Harry Patch was an apprentice plumber when he was conscripted in 1916 , and 19 years old when he arrived at the Western Front in 1917 .
He lasted four months before a German shell burst overhead , killing three close friends and wounding him in the groin .
He was evacuated to England , and never saw the war again .
He married in 1918 , had children , followed his trade of plumbing , and served as a volunteer fireman during the bombing raids on Bristol during the Second World War .
He died on Saturday , at the age of 111 .
So what have Harry Patch of Somerset and his 60 million comrades ( for it no longer matters which side they were on ) left behind for us ?
One thing they would have been quite clear about : we ca n’t do this any more .
In the First World War we crossed a threshold .
All the advances in science and technology came together and created a kind of industrialized warfare that is simply unsustainable in human terms .
It consumes soldiers , civilians , and whole cities at a rate that endangers civilization itself .
All the technological innovations that have been added since the First World War–armoured divisions , bomber fleets , nuclear weapons–only deepen the lesson , they do n’t change it .
Human beings have fought wars since we were all hunter - gatherers , and those who were good at it tended to prosper .
Now , if you are really good at war , you will be destroyed .
Europe is just where industrialized total war first appeared .
You can send expeditionary forces into the weaker parts of what we used to call the Third World and bash them to your heart ’s content , but if you get into a serious fight with another fully industrialized country , you will be both be destroyed .
( This is a lesson that emerging industrial countries like India , China , and Brazil can learn cheaply from history , or very expensively from experience . )
What else did the 60 million leave us ?
Inscribed on the wall of the chapel at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst , where I taught “ war studies ” as a much younger man , is the first line of Horace ’s poem , “ Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori ” :
How sweet and fitting it is to die for one ’s country .
But we do n’t believe that lie any more .
Wilfred Owen was killed crossing the Sambre canal a week before the war ended .
He never got any older than 25 , but he put the wisdom that the millions bought with their lives into his poem “ Dulce et decorum est . ”
It ’s about a poison gas attack , and the last lines run :
If you could hear ... the blood come gargling from the froth - corrupted lungs ...
My friend , you would not tell with such high zest to children ardent for some desperate glory , the old Lie : Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori .
It ’s almost a century now since anybody but fascists and fools saw war as glorious .
The government may tell us that our “ glorious dead ” have “ fallen ” , but we know that they were only teenagers , and that they died in agony and lost all the rest of their lives .
Sometimes , we even worry about the fact that we have sent them to kill people for us .
In 1917 , during the Third Battle of Ypres , Harry Patch was manning his machine - gun when a German got close enough that he looked like a real person–and suddenly Harry realized that he did n’t want to kill him .
Should n’t kill him , in fact .
He shot the German in the shoulder , which made him drop his rifle , but he kept coming .
So Harry shot him again , first above the knee and then in the ankle .
God knows if the German survived all this , but at least Harry was trying .
So are the rest of us .
Most of the time .
Gwynne Dyer ’s latest book , Climate Wars , was published recently in Canada by Random House .

Yesterday , a middle - aged beggar woman roamed the traffic trying in vain to sell dish - cloths .
We moved for a few seconds but then ground to a halt again , just like Iran 's political paralysis .
The driver of our shared taxi , in between grumbling about the traffic , lit up a cigarette and turned on the CD player .
The words of the song could hardly have been more appropriate : " Once again I feel crying tonight " .
On the surface , things may look as if they are back to normal after the crushing of the biggest protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
On the way to my office , I check out the headlines at a newspaper kiosk and yes , it 's business as usual : " The West miscalculated with unrest in Iran . "
Some of us still go up to our roofs and balconies at 10 pm every night and for about 10 minutes shout : Allahu Akbar !
Allahu Akbar !
( " God is great " . )
It was the gesture that helped topple the Shah in 1979 .

But fewer people are doing it now .
And the night - time theatre can make you laugh almost to death .
First you hear a chorus echoing : Allahu Akbar !
Allahu Akbar ! from one roof .
Then comes a cry from another : " Death to the dictator . "
Then a different voice from another building in the distance shouts : " Death to those who defy the leadership . "
Then yet another voice , presumably not an Ahmadinejad supporter roars back : " Death to your father . "
On 12 June , many Iranians voted for the first time because they believed there was a real chance to get rid of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a man whose every utterance leaves them feeling humiliated .
But a great many of the millions who came out on to the streets in the aftermath of the stolen election were n't just releasing their outrage at Ahmadinejad or his plain - clothes thugs .
They were expressing a message far more dangerous to the mullahs : the Islamic Republic does not legitimately represent the Iranian Nation .
Thirty years ago , the revolution gave Iranians the opportunity they craved to cry out against years of repression .
What we got instead was three decades of dictatorship by proponents of a radical Islamic ideology .
Even the revolution 's leaders had no clear vision of what the ruling class wanted to achieve with their theological socialism .
They knew what they did n't want , which was the West .
Because its freedoms would inevitably unwrap the illogical foundations of their rule .
And so the propaganda began .
For nearly 30 years now , the state broadcaster IRIB , ( or Seda va Sima as we call it ) has shaped the way Iranians think , influencing their grasp of events and of reality .
From morning to night , we are told that while the Islamic Republic is well on its way to delivering divine virtues , the rest of the world is in a state of moral and economic collapse .
Sooner or later , America and its allies will implode .
The ceaseless repetition of this message has helped to prolong public tolerance of the sovereignty of the mullahs .
It also means that for the 70 per cent of Iranians who have no access to foreign TV via satellite , the treachery of the super - powers is as active as it was during the Cold War when British intelligence really was busy orchestrating a coup against Iran 's democratic government .
But even if they wo n't admit it , our rulers must be worried .
They know that after last month 's unrest and the violent suppression that followed , the nation is still in deep crisis .
And they also know that something profound has changed .
Because never at any time since the revolution has public criticism been as open and as bitter as now .
The state television channel as the mouthpiece of the regime is increasingly mocked for its lies .
We watched in disbelief as it broadcast cookery shows during the upheaval .
Now we view staged confessions by some of the countless individuals rounded up after the election .

A colleague quietly left a piece of paper on my desk tallying recent news items on IRIB .
Neda Agha Soltan , the young woman shot dead during a street protest , was mentioned three times ; Uighur Muslims in China eight times and the killing of an Egyptian - born Muslim woman by a racist in Germany 140 times .
Until recently , it was almost unheard of to utter criticism and the name of the Supreme Leader in the same breath .

My own father , seriously mistrustful of talking about anything meaningful on the telephone , has given up observing his own cautious rules after almost three decades .
The people who are now daring to speak out like my father are not all intellectuals from north Tehran .
Nor are they organised resistance .

And they seethe at the unimaginable gap between them and loyal members of the Revolutionary Guard who have recently enjoyed salary rises .

Those mourning Neda will commemorate her again on the 40th day since her death , unless that event too is crushed .

SYLLABUS
1. Appellants [ Coleman ] did not establish that , by requiring proof that statutory absentee voting standards were satisfied before counting a rejected absentee ballot , the trial court 's decision constituted a post-election change in standards that violates substantive due process .
2. Appellants did not prove that either the trial court or local election officials violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection .
3 . The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded additional evidence .
4. Inspection of ballots under Minn. Stat. § 209.06 ( 2008 ) is available only on a showing that the requesting party cannot properly be prepared for trial without an inspection .
Because appellants made no such showing here , the trial court did not err in denying inspection .
5 . The trial court did not err when it included in the final election tally the election day returns of a precinct in which some ballots were lost before the manual recount .
Affirmed .
OPINION
PER CURIAM .
[ Unanimous 5 - 0 decision . ]
Appellants , incumbent Republican United States Senator Norm Coleman and Cullen Sheehan , filed a notice of election contest under Minn. Stat. § 209.021 ( 2008 ) , challenging the State Canvassing Board 's certification that Democratic - Farmer - Labor challenger Al Franken was entitled to receive a certificate of election as United States Senator following the November 4 , 2008 general election .
After a trial , the three - judge trial court we appointed to hear the election contest issued its findings of fact , conclusions of law , and order for judgment , concluding that Franken received 312 more legally cast votes than Coleman and that Franken was entitled to a certificate of election for the office of United States Senator .
The question presented on appeal is whether the trial court erred in concluding that Al Franken received the most legally cast votes in the election for United States Senator .
Because we conclude that appellants have not shown that the trial cour 's findings of fact are clearly erroneous or that the court committed an error of law or abused its discretion , we affirm .
...
I
We turn first to the question of whether Coleman 's right to substantive due process under the United States Constitution has been violated .
Whether Coleman 's right to substantive due process was violated is a question of law , which we review de novo .
State v. Netland , 762 N.W.2d 202 , 207 ( Minn. 2009 ) .
...
We conclude that our existing case law requires strict compliance by voters with the requirements for absentee voting .
Thus , we reject Coleman 's argument that only substantial compliance by voters is required .
Having rejected this argument , we also conclude that the trial court 's February 13 order requiring strict compliance with the statutory requirements for absentee voting was not a deviation from our well - established precedent .
...
II
We next examine Coleman 's argument that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection was violated in this case .
12 Coleman 's equal protection argument is two - fold .
First , he argues that the differing application and implementation by election officials of the statutory requirements for absentee voting violated equal protection .
Essentially , Coleman contends that similarly situated absentee ballots were treated differently depending on the jurisdiction in which they were cast and that this disparate treatment violated equal protection .
Second , Coleman contends that equal protection was violated when the trial court adhered to the statutory requirements for acceptance of absentee ballots , in contrast to the practices of local jurisdictions during the election .
...
The trial court found that election judges applied the election laws in a consistent and uniform manner .
The court found that election jurisdictions adopted policies they deemed necessary to ensure that absentee voting procedures would be available to their residents , in accordance with statutory requirements , given the resources available to them .
The court also found that differences in available resources , personnel , procedures , and technology necessarily affected the procedures used by local election officials reviewing absentee ballots .
But the court found that Coleman did not prove that these differences were calculated to discriminate among absentee voters .
Our review of the record convinces us that the trial court 's findings are supported by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous .
As a result , we conclude that Coleman did not prove his equal protection claim .
...
The trial court concluded that Bush is distinguishable in several important respects and , as a result , does not support Coleman 's equal protection claim .
We agree .
In Bush , the Supreme Court specifically noted that it was not addressing the question of " whether local entities , in the exercise of their expertise , may develop different systems for implementing elections . "
531 U.S. at 109 .
Variations in local practices for implementing absentee voting procedures are , at least in part , the question at issue here .
As previously noted , the trial court here found that the disparities in application of the statutory standards on which Coleman relies are the product of local jurisdictions " use of different methods to ensure compliance with the same statutory standards ; that jurisdictions adopted policies they deemed necessary to ensure that absentee voting procedures would be available to their residents , in accordance with statutory requirements , given the resources available to them ; and that differences in available resources , personnel , procedures , and technology necessarily affected the procedures used by local election officials in reviewing absentee ballots .
As we noted previously , Coleman has not demonstrated that these findings are clearly erroneous .
...
III
Coleman next contends that the trial court improperly excluded ( 1 ) evidence of absentee ballots accepted on election day and in the manual recount that would not satisfy the standards established by the trial court , and ( 2 ) evidence of disparities among jurisdictions in their application of the statutory standards governing absentee ballots .
We review the trial court 's evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion .
See Peterson v. BASF Corp. , 711 N.W.2d 470 , 482-83 ( Minn. 2006 ) .
...
In enacting section 204C.13 , subd .
6 , particularly in light of our interpretation of the same language in Bell , the legislature made a policy decision to limit challenges to an absentee ballot , once it is separated from its return envelope and deposited in the ballot box , to challenges based on the face of the ballot .
We conclude that the trial court ruled correctly that Minnesota law provides no remedy for wrongly accepted absentee ballot return envelopes once those envelopes have been opened and the ballots inside deposited in the ballot box .
Accordingly , we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence .
...
As we have explained , in order to prevail on his equal protection claim , Coleman was required to prove intentional or purposeful discrimination on the part of either local election officials or the trial court .
But Coleman does not contend that the additional evidence he sought to introduce would have proven intentional or purposeful discrimination on the part of any election officials or the trial court .
We therefore conclude that in excluding this evidence , the court did not abuse its discretion .
IV
Coleman also claims that the trial court erred in denying his petition for inspection of ballots for certain precincts in which he alleges that double - counting of ballots occurred .
The trial court concluded that Coleman had not met his burden to show that an inspection was needed to prepare for trial , noting Coleman 's concession at the hearing on the petition that he would be able to prove his case without an inspection , by calling election judges as witnesses and by subpoenaing voter rolls and ballots .
The court also concluded that inspections under Minn. Stat. § 209.06 ( 2008 ) are limited to the ballots themselves and do not include voter rolls or other election materials sought by Coleman .
Finally , the court noted that the parties had already reviewed the ballots during the manual recount .
...
Coleman conceded at the hearing on the petition for inspection , and does not dispute here , that he could prove his claim of double - counting by subpoenaing the ballots and election materials and by subpoenaing witnesses to testify .
This concession negates any claim that he made the required showing of necessity and any contention that he was prevented from proving his case by denial of the inspection .
Coleman called no witnesses with direct knowledge of the handling of duplicate ballots in the relevant precincts , but he did introduce at trial voter rosters , envelopes from accepted absentee ballots , copies of ballots challenged during the manual recount , and machine tapes from the identified precincts in which he alleges double - counting of absentee ballots occurred .
On appeal , Coleman has identified nothing additional that an inspection of ballots under section 209.06 would have produced .
21
We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for inspection .
V
Finally , Coleman contends that the trial court erred when it ruled that missing ballots from Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 , were properly included in the State Canvassing Board 's January 5 , 2009 certification of legally cast votes .
During the manual recount , election officials could locate only four of the five envelopes of ballots from Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 .
Voting machine tapes showed a total of 2,028 ballots cast and counted in the precinct on election day , but only 1,896 ballots from the precinct were available for the recount , a difference of 132 ballots .
The State Canvassing Board determined that an envelope of ballots had been lost and , rather than certify only 1,896 votes in the recount , accepted the election day returns for that precinct .
...
Coleman articulates no compelling reason why that same principle should not apply here .
The ballots are missing , but Coleman introduced no evidence of foul play or misconduct , and the election day precinct returns are available to give effect to those votes .
We hold that the trial court did not err in ruling that the election day precinct returns for Minneapolis Ward 3 , Precinct 1 , were properly included in the tally of legally cast votes .
VI
For all of the foregoing reasons , we affirm the decision of the trial court that Al Franken received the highest number of votes legally cast and is entitled under Minn.
Stat. § 204C.40 ( 2008 ) to receive the certificate of election as United States Senator from the State of Minnesota .
Affirmed .

US prosecutors have filed sexual assault charges against four boys aged nine to 14 , alleging they brutally attacked an eight - year - old girl in Phoenix , Arizona , after luring her to a shed with chewing gum .
Police said the girl 's parents criticised her , blaming her for bringing shame on the family .
All five children are refugees from the West African nation of Liberia .
The boys held the girl down while they took turns assaulting her , police said .
" She was brutally sexually assaulted for a period of about 10 to 15 minutes , " police Sergeant Andy Hill said , calling it one of the worst cases the department had investigated .
The 14 - year - old boy was charged on Wednesday as an adult with two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping , the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office said .
He is being held without bond .
The other boys - aged nine , 10 , and 13 - were charged as juveniles with sexual assault .
The 10 - and 13 - year - old boys were also charged with kidnapping , the office said on Thursday .
Authorities said the victim was in the care of Child Protective Services after her parents blamed her for the rapes and bringing shame to the family .
" The father told the case worker and an officer in her presence that he did n't want her back .
He said ' Take her , I do n't want her , ' Sergeant Hill said .
Sergeant Hill cited the family 's background as the reason the family shunned the girl .
In many parts of Africa , women are often blamed for being raped for " enticing " men or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Girls who are raped are often shunned by their families .
In recent years , Liberia has made efforts to combat rape under the leadership of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , who has sought to dispel the stigma associated with sexual assault by publicly acknowledging that she was herself the victim of attempted rape during the country 's civil war .
Phoenix investigators said the boys lured the girl to an empty shed on July 16 under the pretence of offering her chewing gum .
Officers responding to an emergency call that reported hysterical screams found the girl partially clothed and the boys running from the scene .
The boys were being held in a juvenile corrections facility .
" This is a deeply disturbing case that has gripped our community , " Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said in a news release on Thursday .
" Our office will seek justice for the young victim in this heartrending situation . "
The girl 's healing process will be particularly difficult , said Paul Penzone of Childhelp , which aids young victims of crime .
" These four boys used what was a ploy to entice her to a place where they could take advantage of her almost like a pack of wolves , " he said .
" And what 's so disturbing beyond the initial crime is the fact that a child needs to have somewhere to feel safe , and you would think that would be in a home with her own family , " not in state custody , Mr Penzone said .
Today is Maybe Day , a day inspired by the late writer Robert Anton Wilson .
It was his hope that on this day people of all creeds and beliefs would come together and chant , " Jesus is the only son of God , maybe " " Hear O Israel , the Lord thy God is one , maybe " and " There 's no God but Allah , maybe , and maybe Mohammed is his prophet . "
At this point the world would suddenly become a far saner place .
Of course , it is not necessary to congregate to celebrate Maybe Day .
It is not even necessary to say those words out loud .
Simply reading the words in a newspaper or a blog is enough to participate , and in that spirit may I personally thank you for joining in and making Maybe Day 2009 such a success .
But be careful : the Wars of the Certain rage around us .
As Wilson pointed out , " certitude is seized by some minds , not because there is any philosophical justification for it , but because such minds have an emotional need for certitude . "
By celebrating Maybe Day you risk abuse from those people , the Certain , who object to the unsure , the sceptical or the deeply confused .
In The God Delusion , to give one example , Richard Dawkins engages with the monotheistic viewpoint with argument , but he dismisses agnostics with insults .
They are , in Dawkins ' view , the theological equivalent of the Lib - Dems , " namby - pamby , mushy pap , weak tea , weedy , pallid fence - sitters . "
To sympathise with the Certain for a moment , they do not have it easy .
There are billions of people on this planet and they all have wildly differing ideas about politics , ethics , theology , art and science .
It is very hard for the Certain to insist that their own position is the only right , true and undeniable one , especially if they posses a basic knowledge of mathematics and probability .
You can rationalise away this problem by deciding that the rest of the world is basically composed of idiots , but it is rarely a good idea to admit this publicly .
We live in a culture where megalomania is frowned upon .
Then there was the relentless march against certainty that took place in the 20th century .
The work of Einstein , Joyce , Picasso , Heisenberg , Leary , Jung , Lorenz and countless others showed that we do not possess a single model of our universe that can account for all that we find around us .
Instead , we have a number of contradictory models , each with their own strengths and flaws , and we must decide which is the most practical to adopt for our current needs .
Our task , therefore , is to keep testing those models , to evaluate probabilities and to reject once - treasured ideas when more suitable replacements are found .
This is not to say that all models are equally valid ; rather , it is to say that all models should be recognised as incomplete , flawed and useful only to a point .
To quote Robert Anton Wilson again , " I do n't believe anything , but I have many suspicions . "
Maybe Day allows us all to cast off our certainties , if only for one day .
It is a day when you are can allow yourself to be sceptical of your favoured models without any danger of damage to your ego .
The Certain are invited to climb up on the agnostics ' fence and join them for a cup of their famous weak tea and a plateful of mushy pap .
By sitting up on the fence , they 'll be able to see the whole territory .
Maybe the Certain will be surprised by this view .
Maybe they will see that the important question is not which side of the fence they should defend , but what idiot put the fence there in the first place , and exactly who benefits from leaving it up ?
DUNHUANG , China –
As the United States takes its first steps toward mandating that power companies generate more electricity from renewable sources , China already has a similar requirement and is investing billions to remake itself into a green energy superpower .
Through a combination of carrots and sticks , Beijing is starting to change how this country generates energy .
Although coal remains the biggest energy source and is almost certain to stay that way , the rise of renewable energy , especially wind power , is helping to slow China ’s steep growth in emissions of global warming gases .
While the House of Representatives approved a requirement last week that American utilities generate more of their power from renewable sources of energy , and the Senate will consider similar proposals over the summer , China imposed such a requirement almost two years ago .
This year China is on track to pass the United States as the world ’s largest market for wind turbines — after doubling wind power capacity in each of the last four years .
State - owned power companies are competing to see which can build solar plants fastest , though these projects are much smaller than the wind projects .
And other green energy projects , like burning farm waste to generate electricity , are sprouting up .
This oasis town deep in the Gobi Desert along the famed Silk Road and the surrounding wilderness of beige sand dunes and vast gravel wastelands has become a center of China ’s drive to lead the world in wind and solar energy .
A series of projects is under construction on the nearly lifeless plateau to the southeast of Dunhuang , including one of six immense wind power projects now being built around China , each with the capacity of more than 16 large coal - fired power plants .
Each of the six projects “ totally dwarfs anything else , anywhere else in the world , ” said Steve Sawyer , the secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council , an industry group in Brussels …
That does not mean that China will become a green giant overnight .
For one thing , Chinese power consumption is expected to rise steadily over the next decade as 720 million rural Chinese begin acquiring the air - conditioners and other power - hungry amenities already common among China ’s 606 million city dwellers …
But in March of last year , as power companies began accelerating construction of wind turbines , the government issued a forecast that 10,000 megawatts would actually be installed by the end of next year .
And now , just 15 months later , with construction of coal - fired plants having slowed to one a week and still falling , it appears that China will have 30,000 megawatts of wind energy by the end of next year — which was previously the target for 2020 .
RTFA , We ’ve addressed the difference between perceived and actual progress on environmental questions in China before .
That difference rooted in Cold War leftovers to just plain lazy journalists and pundits .
I reintroduce my pet peeve – which is Westerners do n’t comprehend that China ’s biggest coal - based pollution problem is the same faced by the UK when Edinburgh and London were called “ Auld Reekie ” , e.g. , household cookfires and heating .
That will probably be solved much the same as it was in the UK .
Introducing affordable gas and sufficient electricity to replace coal .
It will a take a decade when they do it ; but , I do n’t doubt it ’s on the list .
It ai n’t rocket science .
Lear Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday , and the maker of automotive seats and electronics will attempt to reorganize quickly and shed more than 70 % of its debt .
The company 's fate is being closely watched for possible effects on the global supply chain and as a test of lender sentiment in the auto sector .
Lear is among a handful of large seat suppliers , with more than two - thirds of its sales outside the U.S.
Any disruptions in Lear 's product flow would shut down auto - maker assembly plants around the world .
The Southfield , Mich. , company listed $ 4.5 billion of debt and $ 1.3 billion of assets as of May 30 , according to documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York .
Lear plans to submit its reorganization plan within the next 60 days .
The filing covers Lear 's U.S. and Canada divisions , along with some of their subsidiaries .
The majority of the company 's overseas operations are n't included in the Chapter 11 filing .
Gordon has pointed out the following troublesome story .
I do believe , as do many [ Polar Bear Specialist Group ] members , that for the sake of polar bear conservation , views that run counter to human - induced climate change are extremely unhelpful .
... I , too , was not surprised by the members not endorsing an invitation .
Nothing I heard had to do with your science on harvesting or your research on polar bears .
Mitch Taylor , a polar bear expert , retired last year but he is still doing research .
The Polar Bear Specialist Group did n't invite Taylor to their conference .
More disturbingly , they explicitly said that the reason had nothing to do with the quality of Taylor 's science .
Derocher , a boss of the AGW - contaminated polar bear specialists , wrote an explanation to Taylor : Wow .
The group is overrun by dishonest demagogues who use 20th century totalitarian methods combined with a politically correct jargon to achieve the ideological " purity " ( meaning " complete dirtiness " ) .
In my files that are getting ready for the collapse of this gigantic scam , I am adding Andrew Derocher one year in prison .
What a screwed jerk .
Has it become normal in polar bear science - or broader science - to filter participants of conferences according to ideological and political criteria and to be open about it ?
Have you heard what had to be done with the previous groups who were doing similar things ?
Also , I find it very arrogant to call Taylor 's views " dissenting " .
It is the AGW Chickens Little who are dissenting - and who are rejecting the very basics of democracy , freedom , modern civilization , and the scientific method .
AGW nuts , you 're the hippies , freegans , loons , and freeloaders .
And be sure that I will go after your necks , bastards .
By the way , it is a complete coincidence that I wrote about this story and combined the German symbol from the 1930s with the logo of Greenpeace .
It just happened that today , The U.K .
Times have reported that Al Gore compared the fight against climate change with the fight against the Nazis .
As you can see , I completely agree with him : he has just seriously confused the two sides of the barricade .
The story of Mitch Taylor is the millionth piece of evidence that I am right and Gore is wrong about the sign issue .
Read the Roots of Environmentalism to learn about the environmentalist character of the Nazi Big Cheeses and Anthony Watts ' blog with additional remarks .
Concerning Godwin's law , I do n't think that comparisons to Nazis should be taboo .
The AGW movement is becoming radical enough for thoughtful comparisons of Nazism and environmentalism to gain importance .
Asking what can we learn from the history about the dynamics of the society is important because the nations that do n't learn anything from the history are destined to repeat its mistakes .
Assuming that I ask you to optimize the analogy , where do we stand today ?
My guess is that with the AGW activists today , we are in the situation of Germany in 1936 or so .
It 's not yet a " crisis " but the global warming realists enjoy a comparable treatment as the Jews in 1936 .
The fighters against climate change are slowly ( or quickly ? ) taking over the scientific institutions and international organizations .
Some pogroms against power plants may resemble a modest version of the Night of Broken Glass - but we 're not there yet .
It is up to us whether 2011 will be similar to 1938 , too .
But structurally speaking , the current fight against global warming ( i.e. alarmism ) is similar to the fight against Nazism , indeed .
It 's not quite the same thing but the number of similarities is sufficiently high for us to learn a lesson or two .
Al Gore has recently studied the psychology of Gaia , Her thumbs , and neocortex .
His reasoning will only be understood by the future generations , namely by the 22nd century psychiatrists .
You may be interested in the self - described " mainstream " climate science .
What is the hottest question studied by the concerned people who are paid USD 2 billion for being concerned ?
Gavin Schmidt has the answer .
In the second part of " Science at the bleeding edge " , he discusses the question whether higher populations of sheep amplify global warming .
No kidding .
A lighter color of their fur may cool the Earth .
But global warming makes sheep smaller , Gavin argues , and it could therefore add some additional warming .
However , he has forgotten the Double Copenhagen Feedback .
While the male climate aparatchiks are enjoying the genuine gifts of the Danish capital , their partners are lonely at home .
With a higher number of sheep , they have a higher probability to buy a cheap sheep fur coat or a woolen sweater before they enjoy their own night with their preferred spare partners .
That allows them to turn off the heating for a while , an act that cools the Earth - both directly and by a reduced emission of greenhouse gases .
You may write 50 papers about similar topics and millions of dollars are yours ! ;-)
An imbecile would have to be an idiot not to join climatology these days !
In fact , pretty much all of them are already working on it .
The more Chinese authorities try to stamp out protests by repressed ethnic minorities , the fiercer those protests grow .
Beijing should have learned that lesson after last year ’s bloody anti-Chinese riots in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa .
It did n’t .
This week , clashes in Xinjiang between Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese have left at least 156 dead and more than 1,000 wounded .
This round of trouble began on Sunday when Uighurs took to the street to demand a government inquiry into an earlier brawl between Uighurs , the region ’s largest ethnic group , and the Han , the country ’s dominant group .
We do n’t know who is responsible for that protest turning violent .
On Tuesday , Han Chinese clutching meat cleavers , pipes and clubs spilled down side streets of the Xinjiang capital looking for Uighurs to target .
The Uighurs have long been mistreated .
Beijing has invested heavily over the last decade to exploit the region ’s rich oil and gas deposits and at the same time financed a huge influx of Han migrants .
Amnesty International said recently that the Uighurs ’ identity and well - being are being “ systematically eroded ” by government policies that limit the use of the Uighur language , restrict religious practices and foster job discrimination .
It accused Beijing of arresting thousands of Uighurs on bogus terrorism charges .
It may sound odd , but Jiangqiao Bamboo and Wood Industry Co. , Ltd , a Chinese company , is manufacturing bamboo keyboards made completely of bamboo .
Since launching last October , they ’ve received orders for 40,000 finished units .
China ’s sole bamboo keyboard producer , Jiangqiao swears these wooden keyboards are as strong and long - lived as their plastic counterparts .
“ You need n’t worry that it might crack even if it drops from a one - meter - high table .
Its user - life is no shorter than a plastic one , ” says Zhang Lina , a sales manager for Jiangqiao .
Much of the bamboo used in the keyboards is leftover scrap from bamboo floorboard manufacturing .
“ It sells well in the European and American markets , but not the domestic market for now , ” Lina said .
The keyboards sell for between $ 12 and $ 44 .
Wonder if you have to worry about splinters ?
Or termites ?

Read on to find out …
My parents live in Los Angeles and until just recently , so did my brother .
About three times a year , I go back to LA to hang out with the family , get my In - N - Out Burger fix and get the very important big dose of smog and traffic .
It ’s important because it gives me that fantastic talking point when the Los Angelenos ask me , “ why the heck did you move to Bradenton , Florida ? ”
Hmmm…well , let me cough the reasons !
Just a few days ago , my brother , Jay , packed his bachelor belongings in a moving truck and moved to Wichita , Kansas to start a brand new fancy job as a Doctor of Cardi - $ dollar$ - gy .
At first , I was like , “ Are you crazy ?
Giving up living in Beverly Hills to go live in Kansas ? ”
Not that I have anything against the good state of Kansas , it ’s just that it ’s a totally different lifestyle than the fast - paced , Botox ’d , diamond - studded city of Angels .
Last night , Jay called .
He ’d just arrived after a couple days of driving to his new home , “ Hey sis , you must come and visit .
FOR THE BAR -B- QUE !!! ”
He went on to describe the pulled pork and smoked ribs that he ’s sampled in the past 24 hours .
That was a good enough reason to commit one of the most important holidays of the year , Thanksgiving , to haul my family to Wichita , Kansas for a week ’s vacation .
And it got me thinking .
Take award - winning barbequed pulled pork and combine it with an Korean style barbeque sauce and a puckery Asian cucumber relish .
The result is something you ’d find on the street corner of Cahuenga and Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , the Kogi BBQ truck .
As I ’m sure you ’ve heard , Kogi is the hottest thing to hit the streets of Los Angeles ( literally ! ) , smashing standard taco truck fare with the zing and spice of Korean flavors .
They use Twitter to announce their itinerary for that evening and serve hundreds of people at each stop .
Sometimes , the lines form an hour before the truck even arrives and snakes carelessly around cars , fire hydrants and benches .
I have n’t sampled their fare , I gave one of the owners , Alice Shin , a call and told her that I ’d like to make a pulled pork taco from smoked pulled pork .
Alice was able to nudge their chef , Roy Choi , into creating a BBQ sauce to match the deep smoky flavor of traditional BBQ ’d pulled pork .
This recipe is mid-west meets Los Angeles .
Good luck with your new adventure , my brother .
Korean Style Tacos with Kogi BBQ Sauce on Daytime TV
I would have loved to pair good ol ’ spicy kimchi with these tacos , but my local Asian store had really sad looking kimchi .
So , last minute , I decided to create a quick cucumber pickle for television as well as the photo shoot .
Dr. BBQ and I tag teamed that morning on a Daytime segment – he made his very famous pulled pork smoked in the Big Green Egg in a Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich with Spicy Tangy Slaw ( I also posted the video ) – and I took his leftovers to make these Korean Style Tacos with Kogi BBQ Sauce .
Hey , p.s. the video shows you what happens when you forget your dang mandoline and end up slicing cucumbers by hand in a hurry .
They look like hockey pucks .
Use a mandoline .
Thank you Sur La Table for providing the Shun Perfect Paring Knife and the beautiful Foldable Grilling Tools

Enlarge By Chip Somodevilla , Getty Images CNN's Lou Dobbs reported that Hawaiian officials had destroyed President Obama 's original 1961 birth certificate without citing a source .
In an attempt to quash persistent rumors that President Obama was not born in Honolulu on Aug. 4 , 1961 , Hawaii 's health director reiterated Monday afternoon that she has personally seen Obama 's birth certificate in the Health Department 's archives : " I , Dr. Chiyome Fukino , director of the Hawaii State Department of Health , have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural - born American citizen .
I have nothing further to add to this statement or my original statement issued in October 2008 over eight months ago .... "
On Oct. 31 , Fukino originally tried to put an end to the belief among " birthers " that Obama was born in Kenya and thus was ineligible to run for the office of president .
Despite Fukino 's statements , the issue has continued to resonate from Capitol Hill to the national airwaves .
Last week , CNN's Lou Dobbs demanded Obama 's original birth certificate .
CNN / U.S. President Jon Klein told staffers of Lou Dobbs Tonight that the issue is a " dead " story , Kline told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published Sunday .
In an e-mail , the Times reported , Klein wrote that CNN researchers determined that Obama 's 1961 birth certificate no longer exists because Hawaiian officials had discarded paper documents in 2001 — a claim denied Monday by Hawaiian health officials .
In 2001 , Hawaii 's paper documents were reproduced in electronic format , but " any paper data prior to that still exists , " Health Department spokeswoman Janice Okubo said .
Okubo would not say where Obama 's original birth certificate is but said , " We have backups for all of our backups . "
A congressional resolution introduced by Rep. Neil Abercrombie , D - Hawaii , to commemorate the 50th anniversary of island statehood was delayed Monday .
The resolution includes a clause noting Obama 's Hawaiian birthplace .
The line " Whereas the 44th President of the United States , Barack Obama , was born in Hawaii on August 4 , 1961 " appeared to be construed by birthers as a thinly veiled attempt to get Congress to affirm Obama 's U.S. citizenship , said Dave Helfert , an Abercrombie spokesman .
As the issue came to a vote Monday , Rep. Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , rose to object , saying there was not a quorum present .
The House later voted 378 - 0 to approve the resolution .
Bachmann voted in favor of the resolution .
Birthers denounce the notion that Obama was born in Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu on Aug. 4 , 1961 , despite court rulings and statements by Fukino and Hawaii 's Republican governor , Linda Lingle .

To see Gupta discuss “ Bacon as a Weapon of Mass Destruction ” August 3 on Democracy Now , see here .
Among my fondest childhood memories is savoring a strip of perfectly cooked bacon that had just been dragged through a puddle of maple syrup .
It was an illicit pleasure ; varnishing the fatty , salty , smoky bacon with sweet arboreal sap felt taboo .
How could such simple ingredients produce such riotous flavors ?
That was then .
Today , you do n’t need to tax yourself applying syrup to bacon — McDonald ’s does it all for you with the McGriddle .
It conveniently takes the filling for an Egg McMuffin , an egg , American cheese and pork product , and nestles it in a pancake - like biscuit suffused with genuine fake - maple syrup flavor .
The McGriddle is just one moment in an era of extreme food combinations — a moment in which bacon plays a starring role from high cuisine to low .
There ’s bacon ice cream ; bacon - infused vodka ; deep - fried bacon ; chocolate - dipped bacon ; bacon - wrapped hot dogs filled with cheese ( which are fried and then battered and fried again ) ; brioche bread pudding smothered in bacon sauce ; there ’s hard - boiled eggs coated in mayonnaise encased in bacon — called , appropriately , the “ heart attack snack ” ; bacon salt ; bacon doughnuts , cupcakes and cookies ; bacon mints ; “ baconnaise , ” which Jon Stewart described as “ for people who want to get heart disease but [ are ] too lazy to actually make bacon ” ; Wendy ’s “ Baconnator , ” six strips of bacon mounded atop a half - pound cheeseburger , which sold 25 million in its first eight weeks ; and the outlandish bacon explosion , a barbecued meat brick composed of two pounds of bacon wrapped around two pounds of sausage .
It ’s easy to dismiss this gonzo gastronomy as typical American excess best followed with a Lipitor chaser .
Behind the proliferation of bacon offerings , however , is a confluence of government policy , factory farming , the boom in fast food and manipulation of consumer taste that has turned bacon into a weapon of mass destruction .
While bacon ’s harmful effects were once limited to individual consumers , its production in vast porcine cities has become an environmental disaster .
The system of industrialized hog ( and beef and poultry ) farming that has developed over the last 40 years turns out to be ideal for breeding novel strains of deadly pathogens such as the current pandemic of swine flu .
If a new killer virus appears , like the Spanish Flu that killed tens of millions after World War I , factory farms will have played a central role in its genesis .
Concentrated animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) churn out cheap but flavorless meat .
However , for the CAFOs to exist there must be demand for the product .
That ’s where the industrial food sector comes in .
Chains like McDonald ’s , Chili’s , Taco Bell , Applebee ’s and Pizza Hut approach the tasteless , limp factory beef , pork and chicken as a blank canvas with which to create highly enticing , even addictive , foods by pumping it full of fat , salt , sugar , chemicals and flavorings .
The chains lard on bacon in particular as a high - profit method of adding an item that has a “ high flavor profile , ” a “ one - of - a - kind product that has no taste substitute . ”
According to David Kessler , author of The End of Overeating , a standard joke in the restaurant chain industry goes , “ When in doubt , throw cheese and bacon on it . ”
In essence , the chains conjure up endless variations on the McGriddle that itself is the mass - produced version of the maple syrup - soaked bacon strip from our childhood .
Thus , the crisis of factory farming becomes its own solution through the use of the industrially produced bacon .
We know our industrial food system is killing the planet and killing us with heart disease , diabetes and cancer , but how can we resist when it tastes oh - so - good ?
Our current food system has its roots in the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression .
With thousands of farming families fleeing the land , the Roosevelt administration dispensed credit and established price supports to stabilize the agricultural sector .
The policy worked , but inadvertently created large grain surpluses .
The problem of surpluses was temporarily alleviated by the demand created by the total mobilization of the state and nation during World War II .
But after the war , the question of what to do with the excess production became more pressing .
The answer was to dump the surpluses , first on a devastated Europe , then during the Korean War and finally as “ humanitarian aid ” to Third World countries .
In the name of national food security , the U.S. government subsidized farmers to produce more food than Americans could eat , and to dump that surplus as a weapon in the Cold War .
This policy favored economy of scale and technological innovation to increase yields , because managing overproduction was more effective if the farm sector was reduced and subsidies targeted at large - scale monoculture producers rather than farmers who produced a variety of goods or had small plots of land .
While the U.S. farm population had been shrinking since the late 18th century , when it was 90 percent of the general population , in 1940 , on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II , some 18 percent of Americans were still farmers .
By 1970 farmers accounted for only 4.6 percent of the populace because small farms could not compete with government - subsidized agribusiness .
It ’s government policy that allowed CAFOs to come into being .
Karl Polanyi argued decades ago in The Great Transformation that “ laissez - faire was planned . ”
In other words , government regulation of land , labor and finance creates the conditions for free - market capitalism to operate .
The post -WWII period witnessed a series of agricultural revolutions that have been exported around the world , starting in the 1950s with the U.S. - led “ Green Revolution ” in cereal grains .
In the 1970s , the “ Livestock Revolution ” went global .
And the 1980s saw the “ Blue Revolution ” — factory farming of fish and seafood .
Over the past few decades , global meat production has increased by more than 500 percent .
In Fast Food Nation , Eric Schlosser recounts the 1960s rise of Iowa Beef Packers ( IBP ) , which revolutionized the beef industry .
IBP came into being because it was able to exploit heavily subsidized water , fuel , land and grain for cattle feed ; a national transportation infrastructure ; and anti-union laws .
IBP ’s innovation was to combine slaughterhouses with enormous cattle feedlots .
In the slaughterhouses , IBP used Fordist production techniques to de-skill meat cutting , paid low wages and busted unions to drive prices down and rake in profits .
Faced with relentless low - cost competition from IBP , other meatpackers had to adapt or die .
By 1971 , notes Schlosser , the last Chicago stockyard shut down .
( The modern poultry industry , typified by Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms , got its start during World War II with the help of price controls and government - created demand . )
In the 1970s Smithfield Foods revolutionized hog production .
According to a Rolling Stone 2006 expose , Smithfield “ controls every stage of production , from the moment a hog is born until the day it passes through the slaughterhouse .
[ It ] imposed a new kind of contract on farmers :
The company would own the living hogs ; the contractors would raise the pigs and be responsible for managing the hog shit and disposing of dead hogs .
The system made it impossible for small hog farmers to survive — those who could not handle thousands and thousands of pigs were driven out of business . ”
In the 1950s there were 2.1 million hog farmers in the United States with an average of 31 hogs each .
As of 2007 there were just 79,000 hog farmers left , averaging over 1,000 hogs each .
A single Smithfield subsidiary in Utah holds half - a- million hogs and produces more shit every day than all the residents of Manhattan .
Rolling Stone ’s stunning report describes the lakes of manure that surround pig factories as Pepto Bismol colored because of the “ interactions between the bacteria and blood and afterbirths and stillborn piglets and urine and excrement and chemicals and drugs . ”
( Vegetarians who think they are unaffected by this toxic fecal frappe should think again :
The sludge is often used to “ fertilize ” crops that may find their way to your table . )
Beef , poultry and hog CAFOs could not exist without large - scale environmental devastation .
Governments at every level exempt these operations from laws and regulations covering air pollution , water pollution and solid waste disposal .
They are also largely free from proper bio-surveillance , that is , public monitoring to detect , track and report on the outbreak of diseases .
Mike Davis , author of The Monster at Our Door , writes that scrutiny of the interface between human and animal diseases is “ primitive , often non-existent ” because companies such as Smithfield , IBP and Tyson would have to spend money on surveillance and upgrade conditions at their hellish animal factories .
For Smithfield , devastating the environment is just a minor cost of doing business .
In Virginia in 1997 the company was slapped with a $ 12.6 million fine for 6,982 violations of the Clean Water Act — an average of $ 1,800 per violation .
Rolling Stone paints a grim picture of what goes on inside a hog CAFO : “ Sows are artificially inseminated and fed and delivered of their piglets in cages so small they cannot turn around .
Forty fully grown 250 - pound male hogs often occupy a pen the size of a tiny apartment .
They trample each other to death .
There is no sunlight , straw , fresh air or earth .
The floors are slatted to allow excrement to fall into a catchment pit under the pens , but many things besides excrement can wind up in the pits : afterbirths , piglets accidentally crushed by their mothers , old batteries , broken bottles of insecticide , antibiotic syringes , stillborn pigs … ”
Factory farms are a hotspot of new infectious diseases .
According to a former chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ’s Special Pathogens Branch , “ Intensive agricultural methods often mean that a single , genetically homogeneous species is raised in a limited area , creating a perfect target for emerging diseases , which proliferate happily among a large number of like animals in close proximity . ”
In his book Bird Flu , Michael Greger , MD , writes , “ Factory farms are considered such breeding grounds for disease that much of the animals ’ metabolic energy is spent just staying alive under such filthy , crowded , stressful conditions ; normal physiological processes like growth are put on the back burner .
Reduced growth rates in such hostile conditions cut into profits , but so would reducing the overcrowding .
Antibiotics , then , became another crutch the industry can use to cut corners and cheat nature . ”
But what happens when a poultry factory is doused with antivirals ?
According to Greger , “ Say there ’s a one in a billion chance of an influenza virus developing resistance to amantadine [ an antiviral drug ] .
Odds are , any virus we would come in contact with would be sensitive to the drug .
But each infected bird poops out more than a billion viruses every day .
The rest of their viral colleagues may be killed by the amantadine , but that one resistant strain of virus will be selected to spread and burst forth from the chicken farm , leading to widespread viral resistance and emptying our arsenal against bird flu . ”
To compound the problem , “ the raising of swine is increasingly centralized in huge operations , often adjacent to poultry farms and migratory bird habits , ” writes Mike Davis .
These operations often abut cities , meaning the “ superurbanization of the human population … has been paralleled by an equally dense urbanization of its meat supply . ”
These elements have produced an interspecies blender that is spitting out new viruses at an alarming rate , like the current swine flu bug .
While CAFOs excel in creating novel pathogens , they also churn out mountains of cheap but tasteless meat .
So there is another important component to our deadly food system , and that ’s the science and industrial manufacturing of highly processed foods .
Just as factory farms depended on government policies and regulations to exist , the processed food industry could not exist without industrial farming .
In 1966 McDonald ’s switched from using about 175 different suppliers of fresh potatoes to J.R. Simplot Company ’s frozen French fry .
Within a decade , notes Eric Schlosser , McDonald ’s went from 725 outlets nationwide to more than 3,000 .
Tyson did the same with chicken , which was seen as a healthy alternative to red meat .
It teamed up with McDonald ’s to launch the Chicken McNugget nationwide in 1983 .
Within one month McDonald ’s became the number two chicken buyer in the country , behind KFC .
The McNugget also transformed chicken processing .
By 2000 , Tyson made most of its money from processed chicken , selling its products to 90 of the 100 largest restaurant chains .
As for the health benefits , Chicken McNuggets have twice as much fat per ounce as a McDonald ’s hamburger .
The entire food industry , perhaps best described as “ eatertainment , ” has refined the science of taking the cheap commodities pumped out by agribusiness and processing them into foodstuffs that are downright addictive .
Food is far more than mere fuel intake .
Food is marketed as a salve for our emotional and psychological ills , and dining out as a social activity , a cultural outlet and entertainment .
To get us in the door ( or to pick up their product at the supermarket ) , food companies stoke our gustatory senses .
The food has to be visually appealing , have the right feel , texture and smell .
And most of all , it has to taste good .
To that end , writes Kessler in The End of Overeating , the food industry has homed in on the “ three points of the compass ” — fat , salt and sugar .
One anonymous food - industry executive told Kessler , “ Higher sugar , fat and salt make you want to eat more . ”
The executive admitted food is designed to be “ highly hedonic , ” and that the food industry is “ the manipulator of the consumers ’ minds and desires . ”
Referencing human and lab animal studies , Kessler shows how varying concentrations and combinations of fat and sugar intensify production of neurochemicals , much the same way cocaine does .
One professor of psychiatry explains that people self - administer food in search of “ different stimulating and sedating effects , ” — much like a “ speedball , ” which combines cocaine and heroin .
Kessler deconstructs numerous restaurant chain foods as nothing more than layers of fat , salt and sugar .
Take the McGriddle :
It starts with a “ cake ” of refined wheat flour ( essentially a sugar ) , pumped with vegetable shortening , three kinds of sugar and salt .
This cradles an egg , cheese and bacon topped by another cake .
Thus , the McGriddle , from the bottom up , is fat , salt , sugar , fat and salt in the egg , then fat and salt in the cheese , fat and salt in the bacon , finished off with fat , salt and sugar .
And this does n’t indicate how highly processed the sandwich is .
McDonald ’s bacon , a presumably simple product , lists 18 separate ingredients , many of them used multiple times .
The success of the McGriddle and the Baconator has inspired an arms - race - like escalation among chain restaurants .
Burger King ’s French Toast Sandwich is nearly identical to the McGriddle .
In 2004 Hardee ’s went thermonuclear with its 1,420 - calorie “ Monster Thickburger , ” laden with 107 grams of fat .
And people are gobbling them up .
Perhaps you feel smug ( and nauseated ) by all this because you are a vegetarian , a vegan or a locavore , or you only eat organic and artisanal foods .
Do n’t .
Americans are in the thrall of the food industry .
More than half the population eats fast food at least once a week ; 92 percent eat fast food every month ; and “ every month about 90 percent of American children between the ages of three and nine visit a McDonald ’s , ” states Schlosser .
The food industry has successfully appropriated the childhood creation of bacon dripping with syrup and repackaged it as a product that provides us with a coveted but deadly hit of salt , fat and sugar .
We know this food is killing us slowly with diseases like diabetes , heart disease and cancer .
But we cannot stop , because we are addicts , and the food industry is the pusher .
Even if we could opt out completely ( which is almost impossible ) , it is still our land being ravaged , our water and air being poisoned , our dollars subsidizing the destruction , our public health at risk from bacterial and viral plagues .
Changing our perilous food system means making choices — not to shop for a greener planet , but to collectively dismantle factory farming , giant food corporations and the political system that allows them to exist .
It ’s a big order , but it ’s the only option left on the menu .

When Rosemary discovers a photograph of a forgotten friend , she is driven back to her old haunts to piece back together her memories and unravel what happened to him .
She finds herself questioning her memories of the people and places she interacted with in her childhood .
Rosemary is a point - and - click adventure game with a twist : the player has to explore and arrange the memories of the character in order to solve the mystery of the game .
We chose how memory works as our new mechanic to bring to adventure games , without falling into the trite premise of the player character being amnesiac .
This game is an attempt to innovate in a genre whose evolution has petered out , but from which we can learn valuable lessons applicable to other genres with storytelling aspirations .
There are many ways in which memories can be triggered : a smell , a song or a familiar face can trigger off memories .
In our game , the player has to see the world as Rosemary remembers it , compare it to what it looks like in the present , and find what objects or people may help her remember information .
The player has to interact with her memories , represented in a photo album .
The mechanics of this part of the game are inspired by the memory palaces , as described by Quintillian .
Memory palaces helped rhetoricians remember their speeches - they would place objects related to each passage within an imaginary palace , and by traversing their mind palace , they remembered what they had to say .
We 've taken arranging and putting things into place as the basic mechanic of recollection .
Her memories are represented by photos , which reveal more information when placed in their corresponding slot , changing how Rosemary remembers her old town .
Remembering is thus the key to solve the mystery of what happened to her friend .
The verb list of the game is also somewhat unusual - we decided to expand the list of standard verbs as in the tradition of older games .
The player can smell and listen , as they are senses that are traditionally likely to trigger memories .
In the end , Rosemary is an exercise in nostalgia , since it 's inspired by the feelings of going back to one 's hometown , and reviving events that one may have forgotten .
It ’s no secret that the reaction of a significant number of Republicans to the presidency of Barack Obama has been a bit , well , insane .
And do n’t start making false equivalences by talking about some video someone once posted on MoveOn ’s web site , or some comment someone once posted at Daily Kos.
Did any U.S. Senators compare the Bush administration to Germany on the eve of World War II ?
I do n’t think so .
So what ’s going on ?
Is it the fact that Obama is black ?
Actually , I do n’t think so : there was a comparable level of craziness in 1993 — Bill Clinton is a drug smuggler , Hillary murdered Vince Foster .
What ’s basically going on is that a significant part of the modern GOP ca n’t accept the idea of a Democratic president .
Why ?
I think part of it is that , in the minds of quite a few , it ’s a betrayal of a promise .
They gave their loyalty to the GOP and the conservative movement in return for the expectation of being part of a permanent ruling party .
It ’s just wrong , as they see it , a perversion of the way things ought to be , to have the other party sitting in the White House .
In short ,
A man briefly lit up a cannabis joint in Parliament before being nabbed by security yesterday .
The man lit the joint in the public gallery about 5.30 pm during the second reading of the Resource Management ( Climate Protection ) Amendment Bill .
He was quickly grabbed by security and removed .
There was no indication it was any sort of protest , said Parliamentary Services spokesman Warren Inkster .
Apart from breaking drug laws , the man would have broken Parliamentary codes of conduct surrounding behaviour in the chamber , Mr Inkster said .
Parliament 's premises were also non-smoking .
The matter had been handed over to police , he said .
Parliamentary police were unavailable for comment and Wellington police were unable to provide any further details .

Witchdoctors claim potions made from albinos bring luck and love
One person has been sentenced to life in prison and eight others to jail in Burundi over the murder of albinos whose remains were sold for witchcraft .
Three other suspects were acquitted by the court in Ruyigi province over the the killings of at least 12 albinos .
The victims were mutilated and their body parts sold in neighbouring Tanzania for use in potions .
In addition to the killing of albinos in Burundi , more than 40 have been killed in Tanzania .
In addition to the life sentence , those convicted were jailed for between one and 15 years .
The trial is believed to be the first linked to a spate of albino killings in East Africa since 2007 .
Witchdoctors in the region claim potions made with albino body parts will bring those who use them luck in love , life and business .
An association campaigning for the rights of albinos in Burundi says the authorities are now taking the killings seriously , but more needs to be done .
At least 200 people have been arrested over the trade in Tanzania , but none has been convicted .
We all rely on search engines , believing that if information is on the Internet a search will discover it - but is it really so ?

We all rely on search engines , believing that if information is on the Internet a search will discover it - but is it really so ?
Suppose for a moment that you have solved some really important problem , one that the entire world would be interested in if only they knew about it .
Eager to share your new knowledge as widely as possible you set up a web page not only to publicise the new information but actually to supply the answer for free .
You include on the page " the answer to problem Y is X " .
Now you just sit back and wait for people to come and find the solution .
Only they do n't .
The reason is that we believe that if an answer X exists then a search engine will find it .
This simply is n't true .
Search engines are more complex and temperamental than the simple model of " seek and ye shall find " .
Their true behaviour is more like " seek and ye shall find - if lots of other people have already found and thought it important " .
In the early days this approach worked reasonably well , today is less certain .
Search engines work by building a dictionary of key words in each web page - but they do n't return results just based on key words .
They rank the results according to how important they are .
A page that matches your search specification could be listed behind thousands of pages that match less well but are deemed more important .
In the early days of the web page importance was judged by humans - Yahoo !
for example was a directory of pages put together by humans .
The key innovation , made by the creators of Google , in search engine design was the idea of page rank .
This avoided the problem of having to use a human to rate a page by … using lots of humans to rate a page .
The importance of a page was judged , and still is , by the way the Internet treats it .
It depends on how many links there are to it from other sites and these links are weighted by the importance of the site linking to the page .
Essentially the page rank idea simply detects the way humans regard the page .
A good idea but you might notice that there is a problem .
Something is circular , but unlike the wheel it no longer goes around .
Page rank is a great idea as long as the web has some way of getting things started .
A page that is 100 % new and 100 % important has no page rank .
How is it going to get page rank ?
By being found .
But without page rank it is n't going to be found .
You see the problem .
The wonderful , world - important , solution to life , the universe and everything is going to remain a secret for all time and yet be 100 % on display in the public domain .
What is worse is that its rumoured - remember how a search engine works is kept secret - that Google for example does n't take a web site seriously until it has reached a " certain age " .
That is young web sites do n't get a high page rank .
Search engines based on page rank work only after a page has been discovered by " other means " and with the increasing size of the web and with users hostile to direct advertising - it 's always spam even when relevant - there are no " other means " apart from luck .
When Google first crashed onto the scene changing everything , page rank was n't circular because the " other means " were the only means and humans were doing the finding and the ranking simply by being interested .
We still are doing the ranking only not as efficiently because we do n't have the tools for the size of the job .
So the next time you search for " important answer " and read results such as " We have important answer at bargain prices " " For books on important answer " " Be the first to review important answer " " Try ebay for important answer " and so on .. remember that this does n't mean that there are n't millions of pages actually telling you the important answer .
It just means no one has found them yet .

Es rauscht im Blät­ter­wald .
Gegen Jörg Tauss soll Ankla­ge erho­ben wer­den .
Sagt der Staats­an­walt .
Dabei ist vor allem der Ver­brei­tungs­weg der Nach­richt inter­es­sant :
So wie es aus­sieht , hat Ober­staats­an­walt Rüdi­ger Rehring dies­be­züg­lich mit der Bild gespro­chen .
In deren Online­auf­tritt fin­det sich jeden­falls fol­gen­des :
Ober­staats­an­walt Rüdi­ger Rehring zu BILD​.de : „ Wir beab­sich­ti­gen , eine Ankla­ge zu erhe­ben . ”
Soso .
Das ist ja span­nend .
Und was heißt das ?
Jörg
Tauss schon so gut wie vor dem Kadi ?
Nun , nicht ganz .
Bild erklärt selbst , was nun noch pas­siert :
BILD erfuhr : Die Ermitt­lun­gen sind abge­schlos­sen , der Bericht ( zwei dicke Ord­ner ) liegt bei Tauss ‘ Anwalt .
Die­ser hat jetzt zusam­men mit Tauss die Mög­lich­keit , Stel­lung zu bezie­hen und gege­be­nen­falls wei­te­re Ermitt­lun­gen zu bean­tra­gen .
Und vor der Ankla­ge­er­he­bung muss noch etwas pas­sie­ren :
Zuvor wird der Immu­ni­täts­aus­schuss des Bun­des­ta­ges Ein­sicht in die Akten bekom­men , weil der Bun­des­tag für eine Ankla­ge die Immu­ni­tät von Herrn Tauss auf­he­ben müss­te .
Wir fas­sen zusam­men : Die Staats­an­walt­schaft hat also ihre Ermitt­lun­gen abge­schlos­sen .
Die­se lie­gen jetzt dem Beschul­dig­ten bzw .
des­sen
Anwalt vor , die dar­auf reagie­ren kön­nen .
Und dann geht das gan­ze zum Immu­ni­täts­aus­schuss , der eben die­se Immu­ni­tät auf­he­ben muss .
Und dann , erst dann , kann die Staats­an­walt­schaft Ankla­ge erhe­ben .
Man kann also kei­nes­falls davon spre­chen , dass die Vor­be­rei­tun­gen der Ankla­ge­er­he­bung abge­schlos­sen sind .
Eigent­lich ist es so , dass die Staats­an­walt­schaft jetzt mit ihrer inter­nen Arbeit fer­tig ist und alle ande­ren Betei­lig­ten die Gele­gen­heit haben , in den Fort­gang des Ver­fah­rens aktiv ein­zu­grei­fen .
Und in die­ser Situa­ti­on spricht der Ober­staats­an­walt mit der Bild ?
Kein Wun­der , dass Jörg Tauss ’
Anwalt tobt .
Auf der Web­sei­te sei­nes Man­dan­ten wird er zitiert :
Der Ober­staats­an­walt betreibt wei­ter eine Öffent­lich­keits­ar­beit , bei der es gar nicht mehr dar­auf ankommt , wie der Fall am Ende aus­geht : Jörg Tauss war in Rehrings Augen offen­sicht­lich schon von der ers­ten Stun­de der Ermitt­lun­gen an schul­dig und für sein Urteil bedarf es auch kei­nes Gerichts .
Für die sozia­le Exe­ku­ti­on reicht ihm die BILD - Zei­tung .
Uner­träg­lich , dass eine Staats­an­walt­schaft in unse­rem Rechts­staat so agie­ren kann und sich ihr kein Ver­ant­wort­li­cher in den Weg stellt .
Bei Jörg
Tauss geht es um ein Straf­ver­fah­ren .
Im Gegen­satz zu Zivil­ver­fah­ren heißt es hier „ Staat gegen Bür­ger ” – und das sind zwei Betei­lig­te mit extrem unter­schied­li­chen Aus­gangs­vor­aus­set­zun­gen : Der Staat hat letzt­lich immer mehr Macht und mehr Mög­lich­kei­ten als der ein­zel­ne Bür­ger .
Des­halb müs­sen in einem Straf­ver­fah­ren ins­be­son­de­re die Rech­te des Bür­gers geach­tet wer­den und der Staat muss sich auf die­je­ni­gen Mit­tel zur Durch­set­zung sei­ner Inter­es­sen beschrän­ken , die ihm vom Gesetz her zuge­stan­den sind .
Das ist einer der Kern­punk­te des Rechts­staa­tes .
Ansons­ten kön­nen wir uns näm­lich die­ses gan­ze Getue mit Ankla­ge , Rechts­an­walt und Gerich­ten spa­ren und den Ver­däch­ti­gen gleich in den Fluss schmei­ßen .
Nun gibt es in Deutsch­land höchst­wahr­schein­lich kein Gesetz , dass es Ober­staats­an­wäl­ten ver­bie­tet , mit der Bild zu spre­chen .
Wenn sie dies aber in Sachen eines lau­fen­den Ver­fah­rens tun und dann auch noch zu einem Zeit­punkt , wo ande­re Betei­lig­te Stel­lung zu ihren Ermitt­lungs­er­geb­nis­sen neh­men kön­nen , dann hat das schon ein „ Geschmä­ck ’­le ” .
Was soll uns das Inter­view sagen ?
Die Staats­an­walt­schaft wird sich mit even­tu­el­len Ein­wän­den von Jörg Tauss oder sei­nem Anwalt gar nicht mehr beschäf­ti­gen , frei nach dem Mot­to : „ Die Par­tei Staats­an­walt­schaft hat immer Recht ” ?
Oder ist das ein wenig dezen­ter Hin­weis an den Immu­ni­täts­aus­schuss , dort sei gefäl­ligst auf Auf­he­bung der Immu­ni­tät zu ent­schei­den ?
Selbst wenn dem Staats­an­walt nach den Buch­sta­ben des Geset­zes an sei­nem Inter­view nichts vor­zu­wer­fen ist , so hat er hier mei­nes Erach­tens deut­lich die Gren­ze über­schrit­ten , die eine Ankla­ge­be­hör­de in einer rechts­staat­li­chen Ord­nung aus grund­sätz­li­chen Über­le­gun­gen nicht über­schrei­ten soll­te .
Die Pira­ten­par­tei setzt sich für einen trans­pa­ren­ten Staat ein .
Das bedeu­tet unter ande­rem , dass ein Bür­ger jeder­zeit eine Recht­fer­ti­gung von staat­li­chen Stel­len für ihr Ver­hal­ten ein­for­dern kön­nen soll .
Ich fän­de es inter­es­sant zu erfah­ren , wie Ober­staats­an­walt Rehring sein Inter­view mit Bild recht­fer­tigt und wie er den Ver­dacht aus­räumt , es sei ihm vor allem um Stim­mung­ma­che gegen Jörg Tauss gegan­gen .
Ich habe beim Ein­tritt von Jörg Tauss in die Pira­ten­par­tei gesagt : „ Es gilt die Unschulds­ver­mu­tung . ”
Und dabei blei­be ich !
Nach­trag ( 14:03 Uhr ) : Mitt­ler­wei­le fin­det auch Gene­ral­staats­an­wäl­tin Hügel das Ver­hal­ten ihres Ober­staats­an­walts nicht so toll .
Nach­trag ( 14:20 Uhr ) : Udo Vet­ter schreibt im Law­blog aus jusis­ti­scher Sicht über den Staats­an­walt und die Pres­se .
American blogger " Susie of Arabia " , 57 , moved to Jeddah almost two years ago with her Saudi Arabian husband .
She posted these images on her blog , Susie 's Big Adventure , which has just been censored by the Saudi authorities .
Strict censorship is alive and well here in Saudi Arabia .
The morality of the citizens is of the utmost importance , and measures are in place to ensure that people behave impeccably , although despite all the enforcement efforts , sometimes people fall short .
Pork in any form is prohibited , and so is pornography .
Photos of women in books , magazines and product packaging are routinely censored with black markers if any skin is showing , and sometimes pages are just ripped right out .
Sometimes the black marker is just scribbled across the woman 's image , like in the photo below of a package for a maternity support belt .
Other times , the censor is much more careful about colouring in the parts of the woman 's body that are objectionable .
The other night I went to a music shop to purchase a few CDs for my son , Adam .
One of the CDs I got is called “ One of the Boys ” , by a female artist named Katy Perry .
When he opened up the CD , we were both astonished .
I had n't noticed when I bought it , but the tightly sealed plastic - wrap packaging had been removed and had been replaced with a clear plastic resealable envelope - type wrapper .
So what it all boils down to is that the Saudi government is actually paying religious police members of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice to remove the plastic wrap from these CDs , open up the CD cases , remove the front and back inserts and carefully and painstakingly colour in with a marker any photos baring exposed female flesh that is deemed objectionable .
What supreme sacrifices these noble men make for the sake of their fellow Saudi man !
( The CPVP is a government agency that employs religious police , called Muttawa , to make sure that citizens adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam , especially those pertaining to dress , socialization , morality and prayer .
The commission comprises approximately 10,000 Muttawa and has nearly 500 centres within the country . )
When some Russian rebels take control of some ICBM's , the Americans mobilize .
Among the vessels sent is the nuclear sub , USS Alabama .
But before they leave they need a new X.O. and among the choices is Commander Hunter , who has n't seen much action .
But the ship 's Captain , Ramsey , OK 's him .
While on the way , there was an incident and Hunter disagreed with how Ramsey handled it .
It 's evident that Ramsey does n't think much of Hunter because Hunter was college educated while Ramsey worked his way up .
They 're given orders to attack but when they were in the process of receiving another order , the ship 's communications were damaged , so the entire message was not received .
Ramsey decides to continue with their previous order while Hunter wants to reestablish contact first .
That 's when the two men butt heads that ends with Hunter relieving Ramsey .
Later when some men die , some of the officers feel that Hunter is not up to the task so they team up to retake control .
But Hunter has taken ...

How do they measure the calorie content of food ?
When you lose weight , where does it go ?
Matt Soniak has the answers to these questions and more .
How does the treadmill know how many calories I 've burned ?
If a piece of exercise equipment has a screen that tells you how many calories you 've burned , then inside there 's a computer using standard mathematical formulas to calculate that number .
Most of these formulas , which differ among equipment manufacturers , revolve around distance covered and body weight .
That makes the short answer " they do n't really know . " 
Just like there is a wide range of factors to consider when calculating how many calories you need , there 's a number of factors that determine how many calories you burn during exercise that the machine do n't take into account , like muscle mass , basal metabolic rate and efficiency of stride .
Given these variables , exercise equipment is n't 100 % accurate in calculating caloric expenditure and can only give you a rough estimate .
Back up .
What is a calorie , anyway ?
Calories are units of energy that we often use to measure the amount of energy in food that is available through digestion , but can also apply to just about anything containing energy ( 1,000 tons of TNT is roughly equal to 1012 calories ) .
The common parlance " calorie " " “ those found in PB&J and not TNT " “ is actually a " kilocalorie " ( 1,000 calories = 1 kilocalorie ) , also called " food calories . "
One of these bad boys is equal to 4,184 joules , and is the amount of heat energy it takes to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water ( about 4.4 cups ) by one degree Celsius ( 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
Depending on how you make your peanut butter and jelly sandwich , the final product should contain about 300 calories .
If you could rig up a PB&J - powered water heater , burning that sandwich completely would produce enough energy to raise the temperature of 300 kilograms ( about 82.67 gallons ) of water 1 degree Celsius .
Our bodies need a certain amount of energy to function well , and therefore a certain number of calories .
The body gets energy from food through metabolic processes that break down the food 's nutrients into simpler molecules , which are then absorbed by cells for immediate use or reacted with oxygen later to release their stored energy .
The " percent daily value "  you see on nutritional labels is based on is a rough average of the number of calories a person needs to consume in a day to function — nutritional labels assume the number to be 2000 .
However , people need more or less depending on their height , weight , age , gender , level of physical activity , basal metabolic rate ( the amount of energy the body needs to function at rest ) , and the thermic effect of food ( the amount of energy the body uses to digest food ) are all factors a person needs to consider when figuring out how many calories they need in a day .
And this should be obvious : when you take in more calories than you need , you gain weight " “ 3,500 extra calories get stored by the body as a pound of fat .
Burning more calories than you consume , either through exercise or eating less , results in weight loss .
If the body needs energy and is facing a caloric deficit it will convert stored fat into energy .
How do they measure the calorie content of food ?
Remember that sandwich - powered water heater we had rigged up in the basement ?
Scientists actually used to use something along those lines called a " bomb calorimeter , "  a device invented by Wilbur Olin Atwater ( whose work helped put the calorie in the spotlight , and also proved that alcohol is somewhat nutritious ) to literally burn calories .
To measure caloric content , a food sample was dried and ground into a powder so all water content was eliminated .
The powder was placed into the bomb calorimeter , which consisted of a strong metal container in a water bath .
The container was filled with pure , high - pressure oxygen to promote combustion and the food was ignited .
The result was a fast and violent energy release as the stored energy in the food was turned into heat .
The heat raised the temperature of the metal container and the surrounding water , and the temperature increase revealed how many calories the food contained ( remember , 1 calorie increases the temperature of 1 kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius ) .
The number of calories was then multiplied , usually by 89 % , to account for the energy used during digestion .
These days , divining caloric content is lighter on pyrotechnics .
The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires the calorie count on food packaging to be calculated from food components , so food labs use the Atwater system , a set of conversion factors derived by , yup , Wilbur Atwater .
Using the Atwater system , scientists calculate caloric value by adding up the calories in a food 's energy - containing nutrients .
The average values for these nutrients , originally determined by burning and then averaging samples , are 4 calories per gram of protein , 4 cal / g of carbohydrate , 9 cal / g of fat and 7 cal / g of alcohol .
Of course the amounts of these nutrients in a given food need to be figured out before their calories can be added up .
Again , all moisture is removed from a food sample and it is ground into a fine powder .
Gas chromatography is used to separate fat from the rest of the sample so it can be measured .
The amount of protein is determined by the Kjeldahl method .
Carbohydrates are determined by process of elimination , the assumption being that once fat and protein are removed , whatever 's left is carbs .
How can some foods have 0 calories ?*
Water is the only naturally occurring calorie - free food , but you 've no doubt seen some diet sodas advertised as having zero calories .
Soda usually does n't have any fat or protein , so the caloric stumbling block is a carbohydrate , namely , sugar .
Sweetening something with sucrose , the sugar we know from the sugar bowl and the little packets , gives it caloric content because our bodies metabolize sucrose .
Some artificial sweeteners , though , like saccharin ( Sweet 'n Low ) and sucralose ( Splenda ) , pass through the body without being metabolized and therefore have no caloric value .
When you lose weight , where does it go ?
We learned before that the body , when expending more energy than it 's receiving , converts its stored fat into usable energy .
Most of that stored fat exists in chemical form as triglycerides ( a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid chains ) and is tucked away as oil droplets within the fat cells that make up the fat tissue in our beer bellies .
When you 're cutting calories in your diet or working out , lipase , a hormone - sensitive enzyme located in fat cells , responds to hormonal messages and breaks down triglycerides into their component parts .
The glycerol and fatty acids then exit the fat cells and enter the bloodstream , where they 're absorbed by the liver and muscles .
After absorption , the triglyceride components are further broken down and modified by chemical reactions to create usable energy .
The results of these reactions are carbon dioxide , water , heat and an energy - carrying molecule called adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .
We exhale the carbon dioxide , get rid of the water as urine and sweat , use the heat to maintain body temperature and the ATP goes off to power cellular activities and provide the energy it takes to put in one more mile on the treadmill or walk away from a plate of doughnuts .
* No doubt someone will ask about celery containing fewer calories than it takes to digest .
Discussing that could take a whole post , so I 'll turn you Anahad O'Connor 's Never Shower in a Thunderstorm for his take on it .
This weekend capped off the 12th Goodguys PPG Nationals in Columbus , Ohio .
The event took place July 10 to July 12 on the grounds of the Ohio Expo Center with thousands of 72 ′ and earlier hot rods , far - out customs , classics , muscle cars , street machines and trucks on display .
For folks into hot rodding and modified classic cars , this is a must attend event that is one of the largest in the country .
There was something for everyone with a Street Challenge Autocross , indoor and outdoor vendor displays , games , a large swap meet , a ‘ for sale ’ area , and , of course , loads of fantastic vehicles .
Goodguys Nationals Columbus is also well known for crowning the coveted Street Rod of the Year and Street Machine of the Year awards .
Both of these are the only accolades of their kind in the world .
This year the 2009 Street Machine of the Year award went to the ‘ C1RS ’ 1962 Corvette ( above ) created by Roadster Shop .
Built from aluminum and carbon fiber , the car is lightweigt and features a Turnkey Engines LS7 good for 618 hp and 640 lb - ft of torque .
The suspension was provided by Detroit Speed and Engineering and the brakes sport huge Brembo 14 1/2 ″ rotors with 6 - pistons all around .
The car is not only beautiful for show but can hold its own in the real world , as it dominated the mandatory 3 lap Autocross course with the best lap time .
The vibe at Goodguys Columbus 2009 was friendly and welcoming , with owners interacting with one another along with the many hardcore enthusiasts .
Builders such as Fesler - Moss , GlowShift , Greening Auto Company , R&H Collectibles and Hudson Rod & Customs all had great project cars on display .
The modifications ran the gamut from restorations with a little refreshing to cars completely built from scratch or even melded together in the case of the Lamborghini Gallardo Mustang Tractorri from R&H ( below ) .
With all the negative focus on the American auto industry , it was definitely refreshing to see that there is still tremendous interest in building , maintaining and modifying classic American automobiles with a plethora of businesses , from small machine shops to large multi-nationals , still keeping things humming along .
You only have to look at the revitalization and huge interest in the the 2010 model Chevy Camaro , Ford Mustang ( did n’t really leave , but definitely seemed like it ) and the Dodge Challenger , with their design cues from the classic pony car days , to see that there may be light at the end of the tunnel after all …
For those unfamiliar , Goodguys Rod & Custom Association puts on over 20 events a year across the country from coast to coast .
Their formula involves live entertainment , vendor and manufacturer exhibits , loads of amazing hot rod and custom cars , all packaged together in a very dynamic and vibrant atmosphere .

People ask me all the time how I can be so honest about my life in my blog .
They want to know how I can write about marriage , sex , abortions , or running out of money over and over again .
It 's an endless list really , of the stuff I write about that people can’t believe I 'm writing about .
But each of you has a list of things in your life similar to that , it ’s just a list you do n't want to talk about .
I 'm not special — I do n't have more stuff that is difficult to talk about .
I just have more difficulty not talking about difficult stuff .
This is why .
I ’m going to start by telling you that I was at the World Trade Center when it fell .
I was in a post - traumatic stress support group afterward .
People were divided into groups of ten based on their experience at the site — how bad things were for you that day .
I was in a group comprised mostly of people who narrowly escaped the building before it fell and , as they were running out of the building , were splattered by body parts from people who were jumping out of the building .
We had individual therapy as well .
Here 's what my therapist said to me : “ Your childhood was so terrible that your experience at the World Trade Center was nothing compared to what you experienced as a kid .
Your post - traumatic stress therapy needs to focus on your childhood . ”
That was the first time I really had a sense of how bad my childhood had been .
I knew everyone in the world thought things at the World Trade Center were terrible .
So this must mean that my childhood was really terrible .
I was 34 .
When I was five , I knew something was not right .
That 's when I started therapy .
I was never totally sure why my parents were sending me .
When I was seven I knew something was not right because the neighbor came over to our house when my parents were smashing picture frames over each others ' head .
The neighbor said to me and my little brother , “ Come with me . ”
Then my memories get blurry .
The next thing I remember is my high school homeroom teacher .
I skipped a day of school and then came to school with a black eye and a note from my dad that said I had been sick .
She said that she was not accepting notes from my dad anymore .
She said I could not come back to school the next time I miss a day unless I called the police .
I do n't remember what I thought when she said that .
Except that I thought , “ Does she know what 's going on at my house ?
How does she know ?
I never told her anything . ”
I remember the next time my dad beat me up though .
I called the police and they came .
Like always .
And my dad said nothing was wrong .
Like always .
And then the police started to leave .
Like always .
But then I said , “ Hold it .
Wait .
My teacher wo n't let me back in school unless I get a note from you that says I called you . ”
I do n't remember what else happened .
I remember the police asking me if I want to leave .
I remember my mom saying , “ Yes .
Please .
Take her away .
Please . ”
I went to my grandma's to live .
I spent all of high school living at my grandma's .
The school social worker spent the rest of high school trying to convince me that my parents did something wrong .
My grandma spent the rest of high school telling me that my parents were completely irresponsible .
Except at family gatherings .
When my parents were there , with my three brothers , and everyone pretended that everything was normal and that I did not live at my grandma's .
I do n't remember very much .
I went to college and spent my time trying to sort things out : abusive boyfriends , bulimia , anti-depressants , and cutting .
Getting nearly straight - A's for a lot of the time .
I sorted very little out .
I went to a mental ward the summer of my senior year .
My parents visited me .
They told me they were happy I was in the mental ward .
My extended family visited me and they did not mention my parents .
No one talked about why I might be there .
My parents were anxious and loud in the family meetings : Begging the doctors to keep me from going back to their house .
But even the doctors could not quite figure out why I was there : I worked on my senior thesis , I was a model patient , and I started dating a doctor right after that .
After I graduated , I moved back to Chicago , where he lived and so did my parents .
I could n't figure out how to support myself and there were so many opportunities for me to try nude modeling jobs .
The doctor thought it was ridiculous .
He thought I was too uptight to model .
I said I probably was , but I wanted to try because it was such good money .
I said they first test you out in a swimsuit .
He said , “ Do n't you need some sample photos ? ”
I said , “ Yeah .
I have some , ” and I pulled them out of my bag .
The doctor looked .
He smiled .
He said , “ Who took them ? ”
I said , “ My dad . ”
The doctor flipped .
He went nuts .
He could n't believe it .
I was mostly surprised .
I had no idea that my dad taking the photos was weird .
That I did n't know it was weird made the doctor even more upset .
I remember trying to figure out why I thought it was okay .
Or why he thought it was not okay .
I was 22 .
I did n't tell anyone about the pictures .
I started having nightmares about having sex with my parents .
I started not being able to sleep .
I did n't tell anyone though .
Because I thought I was crazy .
Then my dad visited me a few years later , when I lived in Los Angeles .
He wanted to go camping .
I went .
I was so nervous about being alone with him that I read almost all of One Hundred Years of Solitude before I went into the tent .
Then he took off his clothes , down to his underwear , and snuggled up next to me , with his arms around me and his penis up against my back .
Then I knew .
Or I thought I knew .
I slept outside the tent .
I did n't talk the rest of the time .
I do n't think he even noticed .
I know the street in Los Angeles we were parked on when I finally asked , “ Dad , did you do sexually inappropriate things with me when I was younger ? ”
He said , “ Yes . ”
I had no memory of what , exactly , he did .
I still have no memory of it .
And I was scared to ask him more .
I asked my mom the same question .
She gave me the same answer .
Both parents have said they were sorry .
But that is not my point .
My point is that my childhood was ruined by secrets .
In hindsight , so many people kept the secret : my family , the police , teachers before my freshman year .
Decades later , when I asked my high school friends what they thought of me in high school , two of them told me that everyone thought I was nuts coming to school beaten up so often .
I 'm not kidding when I say that I thought I was keeping that a secret .
So what I 'm telling you here is that I 'm scared of secrets .
I 'm more scared of keeping things a secret than I am of letting people know that I 'm having trouble .
People can't believe how I 'm willing to write about my life here .
But what I can't believe is how much better my life could have been if it had not been full of secrets .
So today , when I have a natural instinct to keep something a secret , I think to myself , “ Why ?
Why do n't I want people to know ? ”
Because if I am living an honest life , and my eyes are open , and I 'm trying my hardest to be good and kind , then anything I 'm doing is fine to tell people .
That 's why I can write about what I write about on this blog .
And when you think you cannot tell someone something about yourself , ask yourself , “ Really , why not ? ”

Infrared observations taken at the Keck II telescope in Hawaii reveal a bright spot where the impact occurred .
The spot looks black at visible wavelengths ( Image : Paul Kalas / Michael Fitzgerald / Franck Marchis / LLNL / UCLA /UC
Berkeley / SETI Institute ) Amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley snapped this image of the new black spot ( near the top of Jupiter ’s disc ) on Sunday , just after discovering it ( Image : Anthony Wesley )
Something has smashed into Jupiter , leaving behind a black spot in the planet ’s atmosphere , scientists confirmed on Monday .
Advertisement
This is only the second time such an impact has been observed .
The first was almost exactly 15 years ago , when more than 20 fragments of comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 collided with the gas giant .
“ This has all the hallmarks of an impact event , very similar to Shoemaker - Levy 9 , ” said Leigh Fletcher , an astronomer at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena , California .
“ We ’re all extremely excited . ”
The impact was discovered by amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley in Murrumbateman , Australia at about 1330 GMT on Sunday .
Wesley noticed a black spot in Jupiter ’s south polar region ( see image ) – but he very nearly stopped observing before he saw it .
“ By 1 am I was ready to quit … then changed my mind and decided to carry on for another half hour or so , ” he wrote in his observation report .
Initially he suspected he was seeing one of Jupiter ’s moons or a moon ’s shadow on the planet , but the location , size and speed of the spot ruled out that possibility .
‘ Stroke of luck ’
After checking images taken two nights earlier and not seeing the spot , he realised he had found something new and began emailing others .
Among the people he contacted were Fletcher and Glenn Orton , also at JPL .
They had serendipitously scheduled observing time on NASA ’s InfraRed Telescope Facility in Hawaii for that night .
“ It was a fantastic stroke of luck , ” Orton told New Scientist .
Their team began observations at about 1000 GMT on 20 July , and after six hours of observing confirmed that the spot was an impact and not a weather event .
“ It ’s completely unlike any of the weather phenomena that we observe on Jupiter , ” Orton says .
Splash
The first clue was a near - infrared image of the upper atmosphere above the impact site .
An impact would make a splash like a stone thrown into a pool , scattering material in the atmosphere upwards .
This material would then reflect sunlight , appearing as a bright spot at near - infrared wavelengths .
And that ’s exactly what the team saw .
“ Our first image showed a really bright object right where that black scar was , and immediately we knew this was an impact , ” Orton says .
“ There ’s no natural phenomenon that creates a black spot and bright particles like that . ”
Supporting evidence came from measurements of Jupiter ’s temperature .
Thermal images also showed a bright spot where the impact took place , meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in that area .
The researchers have also found hints of higher - than - normal amounts of ammonia in the upper atmosphere .
Extra ammonia had been churned up by the previous Shoemaker - Levy comet impact .
Exotic chemistry
The Shoemaker - Levy impact also introduced some exotic chemistry into Jupiter ’s atmosphere .
The energy from the collision fused some of the original atmospheric components into new molecules , such as hydrogen cyanide .
Scientists hope this new impact has done the same thing , since that would allow them to follow the new materials and learn how the atmosphere moves with time .
So what was the impactor ?
“ Not a clue , ” Orton says .
He speculates that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in Jupiter ’s neighborhood , or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to detect before the impact .
“ We do n’t know if the impact was produced by a comet or an asteroid , ” agrees Franck Marchis , an astronomer at the University of California , Berkeley , and the SETI Institute , who was part of a team that observed the spot on Sunday with the Keck Observatory in Hawaii ( see image ) .
If the object was large enough to be visible before impact , current surveys of asteroids may not have been looking in the right direction to find it , he says , adding that future surveys will spot more of the solar system ’s uncatalogued objects .
Asteroid or comet
Spectra collected by various observatories may help identify what the impactor was , since a large amount of water at the impact location would hint at a comet as the source .
“ We will also compare the observations with those collected during [ Shoemaker - Levy 9 ] 15 years ago , ” since that was a known comet , Marchis says .
Without having seen it , scientists can’t tell how large the object was .
“ But the impact scar we ’re seeing is about the same size as one of Jupiter ’s big storms , Oval BA , Fletcher told New Scientist .
“ That , I believe , is about the size of the Earth . ”
Marchis says Jupiter may be protecting Earth from getting hit by such objects .
“ The solar system would have been a very dangerous place if we did not have Jupiter , ” he told New Scientist .
“ We should thank our Giant Planet for suffering for us .
Its strong gravitational field is acting like a shield protecting us from comets coming from the outer part of the solar system . ”
Most drivers have done it : misjudged a bend in the road and only realized they are travelling too fast when they start wrestling the wheel to stay safely in their lane .
A new safety system developed by Nissan could put an end to such situations by warning drivers if they are approaching a curve too fast .
The system , which goes by the somewhat clunky " navigation - cooperative intelligent pedal " name , monitors the car 's location via the navigation system and keeps an eye out for upcoming curves and bends in the road .
It judges the maximum safe speed from the tightness of the curve and then keeps a watch on the car 's speed .
If the car is approaching the curve too fast , it first triggers a warning announcement from the navigation system that there 's a curve ahead .
Should the driver not decelerate , an actuator connected to the accelerator will push the pedal up to reduce the flow of fuel to the engine and then gently apply the brakes to reduce speed .
When the car gets to the safe speed for the curve the system disengages .
In a demonstration of the system at Nissan 's test track outside of Tokyo , it worked without fail each time a sharp bend was approached too fast .
For a driver who has misjudged the tightness of the curve , as opposed to one who is not concentrating , the audible warning could be an easy one to ignore , but it was quite difficult to ignore the accelerator being pushed up .
It 's of course possible to push back , but when the car starts fighting your speed it would be a brave driver who ignores such a warning .
" By using this system , drivers can feel more peace of mind and drive more easily , " said Kazuhiro Doi , general manager in Nissan 's technology development division .
The system will begin appearing in production cars later this year when it debuts in Nissan 's Fuga car in Japan .
The same car will also introduce a second safety system designed to help cars get more safely around curves .
Called " active stability assist , " the system works to synchronize braking , steering and engine response so that the driver feels more in control when heading through tight curves , such as those on winding mountain roads .
When enabled , the system should result in a smoother and more controlled ride through sharp turns .
Both safety systems are part of Nissan 's safety shield concept , which seeks to prevent the car from entering a situation where a collision is unavoidable .
" Our goal is to create a collision - free vehicle , " said Doi .
" Historically all automakers have tried to create safer vehicles , especially with airbags or a safety body , and such a system works when you crash .
Recently we could realize a lot of electronics - based systems , and by using them detect the risk and work the brakes or steering before you get into a risky situation . "
Sa ’ad bin Laden .
Sa ’ad bin Laden , the son of Osama bin Laden , is thought to have been killed in a US Predator airstrike in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
The report has not been confirmed .
Sa ’ad is thought to have been killed during a strike earlier this year , US intelligence officials told The Long War Journal .
“ We ’re pretty sure but we ’re not certain , ” one official said .
“ We are hopeful . ”
US intelligence officials want to confirm or deny Sa ’ad ’s death by using DNA testing .
But it is unclear if they have recovered a body from the attack site .
The officials would not identify the date or the location of the airstrike that is thought to have killed Sa’ad .
The covert US air campaign has focused heavily on North and South Waziristan .
Fifty percent of the attacks occurred in South Waziristan , and 38 percent took place in North Waziristan , according to data compiled by The Long War Journal .
The US has killed a total of 22 High Value Targets , which include some of the high - and mid-level Taliban and al Qaeda leadership in the tribal agencies since the first strike was reported back in June 2004 [ see LWJ report , US Predator strikes in Pakistan : Observations ] .
Al Qaeda has neither confirmed nor denied Sa ’ad ’s death .
Al Qaeda typically issues a martyrdom statement for senior leaders and commanders who have been killed in battle .
Sa ’ad is considered a senior leader in al Qaeda .
He is an operational commander who was involved in the 2003 bombings in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
He is known to shelter in Iran and move back and forth across the border with Pakistan .
He is reported to have facilitated communications between Ayman al Zawahiri and Qods Force , the notorious special operations branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps , in September 2008 after the deadly attack on the US embassy in Yemen .
Sa ’ad made “ key decisions for al Qaeda and was part of a small group of al Qaeda members that was involved in managing the terrorist organization from Iran , ” according to the US Treasury report that designated him as a terrorist on Jan. 16 , 2009 .
“ As of September 2008 , it was possible that Sa’ad bin Laden was no longer in Iranian custody , ” the Treasury reported .
Sa ’ad is believed to have entered Pakistan ’s northwest to meet with Zawahiri in Pakistan sometime in early September , according to Mike McConnell , the outgoing Director of National Intelligence .

Three - time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka said he was ready to challenge for his second French Open title after a comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 1 win over German Dominik Koepfer to advance to the third round on Wednesday .
The 2015 Roland Garros champion put his muscular build to good effect to hit 51 crunching winners despite the slow conditions on Court Suzanne Lenglen in his first career meeting against the 61st - ranked German .
" I 'm happy so far with my start at the French Open , " Wawrinka told reporters .
SACRAMENTO 
When a company called Ausra filed plans for a big solar power plant in California , it was deluged with demands from a union group that it study the effect on creatures like the short - nosed kangaroo rat and the ferruginous hawk .
By contrast , when a competitor , BrightSource Energy , filed plans for an even bigger solar plant that would affect the imperiled desert tortoise , the same union group , California Unions for Reliable Energy , raised no complaint .
Instead , it urged regulators to approve the project as quickly as possible .
One big difference between the projects ?
Ausra had rejected demands that it use only union workers to build its solar farm , while BrightSource pledged to hire labor - friendly contractors .
As California moves to license dozens of huge solar power plants to meet the state ’s renewable energy goals , some developers contend they are being pressured to sign agreements pledging to use union labor .
If they refuse , they say , they can count on the union group to demand costly environmental studies and deliver hostile testimony at public hearings .
My friend Tim met Barack Obama while he was campaigning .
Tim was his limo driver on the way to an airport , and wisely asked to take a picture with the man who would become our next President ( and pretty much the biggest celebrity in the world , sorry Brangelina ) .
Any normal person who had their photo taken with Obama would naturally show it off by displaying it on their desk at work , or maybe post it to their Facebook profile .
But my friend one - upped all that .
Tim went to Kinko ’s and blew up his Obama buddy photo up to poster size , framed it in a custom - fitted deep mahogany frame and nailed it in the center of his living room wall .
If there were tea candles lit underneath it , it could be considered a shrine .
Every single girl that comes over to Tim ’s apartment after a date ca n’t help but gawk in awe at him and Obama together , smiling at the camera .
Simply through association to the President , my friend becomes ten times more attractive .
And he gets laid .
Who knew our President could be such an aphrodisiac ?
Is it his perfectly tailored power suits accessorized with that bold red or blue tie ?
The book - smarts / street smarts combo ?
The assumption that Michelle is constantly glowing in her sleeveless dresses all the time because she ’s sexually satisfied in the Lincoln bedroom ?
Whatever it is , the man has a degree from Harvard law school and the Midas touch for inflicting horniness in his fellow Americans .
Could any other President have that special power over a woman ’s loins ?
Maybe Clinton , but only in his saxophone - playing , boxer - shorts - admitting - wearing heyday .
If someone I was dating managed to take a photo with Teddy Roosevelt I ’d certainly be impressed , if only for their ability to go back in time .
But a photo of a potential suitor proudly standing next to Dubya ?
I ’d run in the other direction .
Guys – click and save some photos from CNN.com , and start a - photoshoppin ’ !
" You need to know that Obama , the first man that Obama picked when we were so happy that he was the President , he picked an Israeli – Rahm Emanuel – his number one man .
His number two man – [ David ] Axelrod – another Israeli person .
Why do this small number of people have control of the world ?
You need to go back into your history and find out about France and Germany and England and America got together and offered the Israelites , who became the Israelites , they offered them Ghana , the plains of Ghana .
Why do n't you take Ghana since we beat you down so badly ?
That 's what the Holocaust was all about .
You need to read my chapter on the Holocaust and the anti-Holocaust movement .
There 's some people in the world says no Holocaust even happened .
Some of their leaders say no Holocaust even happened .
Well it did happen .
These people were punished .
They were punished for a reason because they were serially disobedient to Allah . "

" I 'm glad that most of the people who express such fervent attitudes about the Jews , do n't work as surgeons , or astronauts , or in any other precision endeaver .
Is this , at last , the group to offer the purchase of the Brooklyn Bridge ? "
Jess Ghannam , a Professor of Psychology who teaches at the School of Psychiatry at UC San Francisco is the lead organizer of the virulently anti-Semitic Al Awda and the ISM .
There are loads of doctors and lawyers who are among these anti-Semitic wannabe " Arabs " who were in fact born here in the USA .
They live inour democracy but cheer on the despots back home and in keeping with the primitive roots they sprang from , they are just as anti-Semitic .
The only difference is they try to mask it by claiming they are only against Israel as a Jewish state .
This logic is like saying one does n't hate black people if one only advocates killing or deprotng them from one 's hometown but claiming to have no qualms if they live in another city -- the racism is still there ....
This mindset is in our coleges today that produce the very professionals you think do not adhere to such primitve practices .

I 'm glad that most of the people who express such fervent attitudes about the Jews , do n't work as surgeons , or astronauts , or in any other precision endeaver .
Is this , at last , the group to offer the purchase of the Brooklyn Bridge ?
Such sloppy facts , any White supremicist would do as well describing African Americans according to his distorted beliefs .
Just hearing some supposed history from another ignorant person does not constitute acquired KNOWLEDGE .
People who do n't have knowledge will believe anything , and many of the commentators here fit that catagory .

I am saddened at another Muslim using hate and ignorance to further an agenda that is not valid or healthy .
Some where I think culture hijacked religion and religion hijacked faith .
What he is spewing is " religious " rhetoric .
Religion is BIG business that funnels money into politics , controversy and creating wars .
" Religion " is being used to complicate situations for the common man so that by the time all is said and done the common man is so confused by all the complication " religion " is selling , they have a willing buyer .
Faith is innately human and leaves no space for hatred , bigotry or anti semitism .
" Religion " is bought and sold and is cheap and changable like a pair of underwear .
One can buy " religion " on any corner of the world .
I am saddened that these kinds of Muslims have hijacked the beauty of Islam and they have created fear and loathing of Muslims as a whole .
" Religions " have one thing in common in ALL of them .......
They all think they are RIGHT and the ONE .
In NONE of the Holy Texts does it disseminate groups like , Reconstructionist Jews , Orthodox , Reformists Nor for Baptist , Methodist , Catholic and so on .....
Nor for Sunni , Shia , Salafi or Wahab .
We have done that with religion and LOST faith .
ALL are equal and valid and it's time we get out of our own way and stop the hate across the board .
Peace .
Black " Muslims " Are The Most Anti-Semitic

This " muslim prison chaplain " could have been fired by the Jewish mayor of NYC back in '06 for similar comments , but was only " suspended . "
A " rabbi " named Joseph Potasnik of the " New York Board of Rabbis " as well as other demented Jews supported the suspension and not the firing .
How ironic that Jews are their own worst enemies .
And by the way , black Muslims are not looked upon in the best of light by their " brother " Arabs who usually refer to them as an " abd " ( which means " slave " in Arabic ) .

Go to the back days of the History .
Zions were given the lands of Africa in Uganda , Ghana And madagascar , even Somalia , but they did not they went to Palestine WHY ????
ateention have been risen from all over the Muslim world in the wake of 9/11 .
people are aware now who these people are and Muslims will never give in to jwews or thier fellow crusaders .

When Levi Johnston strolls through the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental on a recent morning , even the well - trained hotel staff ca n’t help but giggle .
He emerges from the elevator carrying a giant hockey bag and two battered , taped - up sticks .
Wearing a blazer , a trendy T - shirt , jeans , and dress shoes , he looks like a catalogue - model version of a high - school kid heading to a game .
For someone whose mere existence ( and raw teenage virility ) threatened to upend a presidential election , Levi seems easily intimidated .
He looks out the lobby windows onto Central Park and shyly tries to make conversation .
“ I do n’t like New York . ”
On the elevator ride down to the Time Warner Center , Levi tries to explain .
“ There ’s too many people , ” he says about this city .
“ I ca n’t wait to get home . ”
Home is 4,000 miles away , in tiny Wasilla , Alaska , where Levi lived quietly for seventeen years before taking up with his pretty classmate Bristol .
A surprise pregnancy and even more surprising GOP vice - presidential nomination later , he ’d tattooed Bristol ’s name on his ring finger , agreed to marry her , and appeared onstage at the Republican National Convention with the Palins and John McCain .
“ That was ridiculous , ” Levi says of the RNC .
“ I was just like , ‘ Uhhh . ’ ” At the time , the Palins insinuated he ’d have to move to D.C. if McCain won .
“ I ai n’t never moving , ” he says with a shudder , thinking back .
Luckily for him , his team lost .
He and Bristol broke up early this year , shortly after they welcomed baby Tripp Easton into the world .
But the life of this self - described “ fucking redneck ” did not go back to normal .
To deal with the constant press inquiries and attention , the Johnston family turned to Anchorage lawyer Rex Butler for help , and he in turn set them up with Tank , a giant pile of a man who serves as Levi ’s bodyguard , publicist , agent , and travel buddy .
“ I would n’t be able to do it without him , ” Levi says of Tank .
“ It ” is the teenager ’s adventurous new life .
The pair have already been to Los Angeles a few times for talent meetings .
Tank arranged for Levi to appear on The Tyra Banks Show , Extra , and CBS ’
The Early Show and to be photographed shirtless , with Tripp , for GQ .
They arrived in New York yesterday to tape an episode of Inside Edition ( Levi played hockey at the producers ’ request ) and are now on their way back to Alaska .
Wandering through the Time Warner Center , Tank keeps taking calls from the Town Car that Inside Edition hired to drive them to La Guardia .
The driver is lost ( Tank is referring to their hotel as “ The Madeleine ” ) , so we sit down at Bouchon Bakery for a quick breakfast .
Levi orders a Coke .
Tank explains that they are shopping a book , because there are still many untold stories about the Palins .
In the meantime , Levi has been offered “ a leading role ” in a movie with a former Miss Oregon ( and Apprentice contestant ) , and he thinks he might take it , though Levi says they “ actually do n’t know anything about it yet , really . ”
Then Tank mentions a soon - to - be - announced television project .
“ I do n’t even want to call it a reality show , ” he says , now in full agent mode .
“ It will be a docudrama or something similar .
I think the whole reality - show thing is played out . ”
To prepare for the camera , Levi says he plans to start working out again .
“ I need to , after seeing that GQ article . ”
Though the scrutiny has been uncomfortable at times ( photographers were waiting for his plane for two hours the last time he flew to L.A. ) , it ’s helped Levi in his personal life .
He thinks that by talking publicly about how the Palins prevented him from seeing his son , he was able to pressure the governor to give him more access .
He now sees Tripp a few times a week , when Bristol swings by to drop him off .
The former couple seems to get along fine , but they do n’t see each other romantically .
Levi ’s planning on removing the tattoo of her name from his finger by using a cream that Tank has heard about .
He says he ’s not dating anyone , though his phone beeps steadily with text messages .
“ It ’s not her , ” he says pointedly to Tank , after getting a look .
Leaving the restaurant , Levi offers a firm handshake and a glimpse of his very white teeth .
Objectively , his future as a reality star seems bright .
He certainly looks the part — great chin , perfect skin , and carefully gelled hair .
True , he ’s rarely answered a question with more than one sentence , and he claims he does n’t enjoy having his picture taken .
“ I even have a hard time looking at a magazine and seeing myself , ” he says , sounding sincere .
( “ I love seeing myself , ” Tank mutters . )
But when asked how , then , he handled being onstage at the RNC with that serene , gum - chomping smile , Levi just grins .
“ I can put on a show . ”

Chris Matthews highlighted this nutcase birther at a town hall with Rep. Mike Castle ( R - DE ) , questioning Obama 's citizenship and forcing a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance .
It 's unfiltered crazy in action .
In the 1990s , the media took these fringe scandals regarding Bill Clinton and gave them a platform and some credibility , seeping them into the mainstream .
You can draw a through - line from the out - there lies of the extreme right like the alleged murder of Vince Foster and the Clinton impeachment .
Some in the media , like Lou Dobbs , continue to do that today , legitimizing the birther movement .
And several far - right Congressmen have co-sponsored a bill to require Presidential candidates to provide proof of US citizenship .
Today on Hardball , Rep. John Campbell , who thinks Atlas Shrugged is non-fiction , tried to dodge the issue by claiming that this is merely a technical bill to ensure Presidents meet the requirements of office in some official capacity , but Matthews was having none of it .
He called it a " crazy proposal " and tried to peg down Campbell on whether or not he believed Obama was an American citizen .
It took him all of 10 minutes to finally say he believed Obama was .
MATTHEWS : Congressman , nice try .
But what you 're doing , it 's a nice try , and I 'm laughing with you only to this extent , because I know it 's a nice try .
What you 're doing is appeasing the nutcases .
As you 've just pointed out , this wo n't prove or disprove whether Barack Obama 's a citizen .
By the way , let me show you his birth certificate .
That 's the way to deal with this .
Mail this birth certificate to the whacko wing of your party , so they see it and say , " I agree with this , it 's over . " [...] you 're verifying the paranoia out there .
You 're saying to the people , " That 's right , it 's a reasonable question whether he 's a citizen or not . "
Campbell squirmed and shuffled , first saying that Obama was an American citizen " as far as I know , " ( Matthews responded : " As far as you know ?
I 'm showing you his birth certificate ! " ) and then eventually saying " I believe he is . "
Now , I do n't remember Matthews being so insistent about " appeasing the nutcases " back in the 1990s , when he had Paula Jones on his shows , and Dan Burton , and the Arkansas State troopers , and every other two - bit huckster peddling juicy gossip about " Slick Willie . "
But clearly the atmosphere has changed , at least for Tweety .
The birther movement has become a bridge too far .
Never mind that the Senate went so far as passing a unanimous resolution that John McCain , born in the Canal Zone in Panama , was a natural - born citizen .
Democrats resolved the issue quickly ; Republicans will raise questions and put out clarifying legislation and just put it " out there . "
It just shows you how diverged the conversations have become in this country .
Democrats are debating how to tackle health care and whether a public option works best and how best to get costs under control , and the right has become fixated on the idea that Barack Obama 's family faked his birth certificate 47 years ago , knowing he would run for President eventually and need a cover story .

WD - 40 and its secret formula has been often imitated , but the small San Diego firm long resisted the temptation to spread itself thin with too many other products .
Under the leadership of one John S. Barry , the company took a single product – one that had taken 40 tries to get right – and built it into the Kleenex of lubricant products , good for $ 317 million in sales last year .
The man who kept his focus firmly on making the best single product of its type has passed away at the age of 84 .
John Barry 's demeanor as the top dog of WD - 40 Co. is an admirable example for fatcat CEOs that are so addicted to costly perks .
Barry himself acknowledged that his style was that of " breaking all the Harvard Business School rules . "

The proof of Barry 's keen instincts can be seen by the myriad of copycat products laid to waste by WD - 40's dominance .
Despite the assertions that a single - product company would never make it , WD - 40 is very much still around thanks to John Barry 's refusal to tinker with his product and its ever - increasing list of unique uses .
The company now has other highly regarded products in its porfolio , such as Spot Shot carpet cleaner , Lava soap , and 3 - in - 1 Oil – perhaps the only other lubricant that 's nearly as universal and also has a delightfully distinct aroma , just like its blue and yellow shelfmate .

Can you see the Flag on the Moon with a Telescope ?
The answer is basically " not a chance " .
No Earthbound telescope can see the flag on the Moon .
Why not ?
For openers , the Earth 's atmosphere is never steady enough to allow resolution below about one arc second for most locations .
Beyond that , the telescope required to " see " the flag would need to be absolutely huge !
Here is some basic analysis to show what would be needed :
Method 1
Method 1 will use simple proportions to show what would be needed .
The Moon 's diameter is approximately 2160 miles .
The Moon is nominally about 239,000 miles from Earth , and at this distance it subtends a diameter of about 30 arc minutes in the sky as seen from Earth .
There are 60 arc seconds per arc minute , so the Moon is about 1800 arc seconds across .
Let 's figure out how many arc seconds represent one mile .
The calculation is straightforward : if 1800 seconds = 2160 miles , then 1 mile = .83 arc seconds ( basically just divide 1800 by 2160 ) .
So , now we know that 1 mile is about .83 arc seconds .
How big is the flag ?
I do not know for sure but let 's assume it is 3 feet long on the long side .
How many arc seconds is this ?
We know that 1 mile = .83 arc seconds ; the flag is 3/5280 miles wide ( or about 5.682e - 4 miles ) .
To find out the arc seconds , we simply multiply this value by .83 to get 4.716e - 4 arc seconds .
A long time ago someone named Dawes determined that the resolution of an optical telescope is basically 4.56 divided by the telescope 's diameter ( in inches ) .
So , from that we can rearrange the equation to say that the diameter of the telescope needed ( in inches ) is 4.56 divided by the resolution required ( arc seconds ) .
Dividing 4.56 by 4.716e - 4 comes out to be 9669 inches .
Converting this to feet yields about 805 FEET !
And this would be the required telescope diameter to JUST BARELY see the flag at all !
And , it would only be just visible as a small dot , it would not " look " like a flag at all .
Let 's say we really want to see the flag and have it look like a flag .
We 'll have to make some assumptions again .
Let 's assume that the stripes on the flag are 1.5 inches wide and we want to just be able to see them .
Using the same method as above we can come up with an answer .
In this case we need to be able to see something that is 1.5/12/5280 miles wide , or 2.367e - 5 miles .
We multiply this by .83 to get the resolution ( 1.965e - 5 ) .
Dividing 4.56 by this number yields 232065 inches , or about 19388 FEET !
This value is also about 3.6 miles .
Clearly it is not possible to build an optical telescope of this size .
So , basically the Flag on the Moon remains " invisible " to us here on Earth .
Method 2
Method 2 will use trigonometry to show the same basic result as above .
If you do not have a background in basic trigonometry then this method may seem intimidating as we do show some basic math .
As we previously mentioned , the Dawes Limit for resolution of an optical telescope is as follows :
Below we examples of the formula for two different size telescopes :
In order to figure out what size scope we need to see the flag on the Moon we have to know how big the flag actually is .
For purposes of this analysis we will assume that the flag is 3 feet wide .
The diagram below shows some information regarding the ratios of the dimensions of the American Flag :
We decided on using a flag width ( dimension B in the diagram ) of 3 feet ( 36 inches ) .
Therefore A = 36/1.9 = 18.95 inches .
Each stripe on the flag is 1/13th of A , so for our flag one stripe is 18.95/13 = 1.457 inches .
we will round this up to 1.5 inches for purposes of our example .
OK , now we have established that the flag stripe is 1.5 inches wide , so what size telescope do we need to see this ?
First we need figure out how many arc seconds the width of a flag stripe represents at the distance of the Moon .
Before we do that , let 's take a look at the basics of the Earth - Moon geometry :
The above diagram shows that the Moon subtends an angle of a little more than half a degree .
So how about the flag ?
Obviously it will subtend a much smaller angle .
The following diagram shows the calculations for figuring how many arc seconds one stripe of the American Flag subtends at the distance of the Moon :
What about the Hubble Space Telescope ?
As powerful as Hubble is ( above the limits of the Earth 's atmosphere ) , it has no chance of seeing the Flag on the Moon .
What could it see ?
Well , Hubble has a mirror that is 94.5 inches in diameter .
That gives it a resolution of 4.56/94.5 or about 0.0483 arc seconds .
If one does the math , this translates to a resolution of about 295 feet at the distance of the Moon .
So , Hubble could just detect an object that was 295 feet across on the Moon .
To see any detail on an object , it would have to be somewhat larger .
To put this in perspective , if a typical pro football stadium was located on the Moon Hubble could make out some basic details ( the field could just barely be made out as a dot in the center of a very small oval ) .
What could Hubble see on Earth if it were to be aimed at the Earth ?
Hubble is in orbit at a height of about 375 miles up .
If we work the math , it can be shown that Hubble could just make out something that is 5.56 inches wide on Earth .
Basically Hubble could just make out the size and shape of a car license plate ( assuming it was laying flat on the ground ) .
However , reading the numbers would be out of the question !
Moon Landing Skeptics
People who believe that the Moon landings were a hoax often raise the question " Why ca n't we see the flag on the Moon [ from Earth ] with our most powerful telescopes ? " .
The analysis provided on this page shows that even Hubble not anywhere near powerful enough to see something the size of a flag ( about 3 feet wide ) when it is at the distance of the Moon .
The laws of optics dictate that even Hubble 's 94.5 inch mirror can never see such a small object at that distance .
Even much larger Earth bound telescopes are far away from being capable of seeing the Flag !
If you are someone who does believe that the Moon landings were staged , I most probably cannot convince you otherwise .
Regardless of that , the analysis here clearly shows that seeing the flag on the Moon from Earth is not possible with any technology we have today .
Check out this story : LRO Sees Apollo Landing Sites .
The reason this spacecract can see the landers is that it is MUCH closer to the Moon .
Conclusions
As of today , spotting the Flag on the Moon ( from Earth using a telescope ) remains impossible .
The only method that could be used to ( in theory ) see something as small as the Flag on the Moon would be to use two optical telescopes set ( for example ) 1000 miles apart .
This would easily provide the required resolution , the huge problem however is combining the images from both telescopes in such a way to realize the resolution .
As far as I know right now that technology is not available .
Even if the technology was available , the unsteadiness of the Earth 's atmosphere would likely render the method useless .

Backup plan to get NASA to moon cheaper Space travel
This undated artist 's rendering released by NASA shows the Ares I crew launch vehicle during launch and the Ares V cargo launch vehicle on the launch pad .
Officially , the space agency is still on track with a 4 - year - old plan to spend $ 35 billion to build new rockets and return astronauts to the moon in several years .
However , a top NASA manager is floating a cut-rate alternative that costs around $ 6.6 billion .

Like a car salesman pushing a luxury vehicle that the customer no longer can afford , NASA has pulled out of its back pocket a deal for a cheaper ride to the moon .
It wo n't be as powerful , and its design is a little dated .
Think of it as a base - model Ford station wagon instead of a tricked - out Cadillac Escalade .
Officially , the space agency is still on track with a 4 - year - old plan to spend $ 35 billion to build new rockets and return astronauts to the moon in several years .
However , a top NASA manager is floating a cut-rate alternative that costs around $ 6.6 billion .
This cheaper option is not as powerful as NASA 's current design with its fancy new rockets , the people - carrying Ares I and cargo - lifting Ares V .
But the cut -rate plan would still get to the moon .
The new model calls for flying lunar vehicles on something very familiar - looking - the old space shuttle system with its gigantic orange fuel tank and twin solid - rocket boosters , minus the shuttle itself .
There are two new vehicles this rocket would carry - one generic cargo container , the other an Apollo - like capsule for astronaut travel .
Those new vehicles could both go to the moon or the international space station .
What 's most remarkable about this idea is who it came from : NASA 's shuttle program manager John Shannon .
He recently presented it to an independent panel charged with reviewing NASA 's costly spaceflight plans .
And he was urged to do so by a top NASA administrator .
It shows that top officials in NASA , an agency of engineers who regularly make contingency plans , worry that their preferred moon plan is running into trouble , space experts said .
Shannon says he likes the present return - to - the - moon design .
But he said , " I think the cost numbers are going to give us problems . "
So for the past three years , Shannon and a handful of others have casually tinkered with the shuttle - less shuttle , an idea that has kicked around NASA for decades .
The Shannon team did so with the permission of NASA and is not connected with another group of space program workers who drew up a different alternative to Ares and did so anonymously for fear of retribution from NASA officials .
" What I was doing was not a break from NASA , " Shannon said in a telephone interview .
" I do n't care what launcher we use , I just want to go to the moon . "
This is all happening while NASA 's new moon program , called Constellation - as well as the entire human spaceflight program - gets a hard look from an outside board as part of President Barack Obama 's science policy .
And that panel 's first reaction to Shannon 's presentation was positive .
" Terrific , very well done , " said panel chairman Norman Augustine , a longtime aerospace executive who noted that he liked a similar proposal 20 some years ago .
Both the Augustine panel 's reaction and the upper - level management fingerprints on the Shannon proposal suggest to space experts that NASA management may be shifting gears , or at least signaling its doubts about the costlier plan .
Howard McCurdy , an American University public policy professor who has written books about the space agency 's decision - making , believes that NASA management worries there wo n't be enough money for the Cadillac version .
" They are hedging their bets , " agreed Keith Cowing , a former NASA engineer who runs the Nasawatch.com
Web site , which acts as a watchdog on the space agency .
" It clearly reflects some doubts among senior agency folks in the overall veracity of their current approach . "
NASA spokesman Michael Curie said Shannon was encouraged to make the presentation " in the spirit of sharing the options we 've studied in the past . "
But he added : " NASA believes the best plan is to fully fund the current architecture .
...
This does not indicate a lack of confidence in or support for the current program . "
Shannon said his numbers are rough and could change .
The system would use hardware already built , like the engines , to save time and money .
Eventually new engines would be built , but from the old design .
Shannon 's concept would use the same new Orion crew capsule being designed for Constellation .
The only new vehicle would be the cargo container .
Both would sit on the external fuel tank like the shuttle does now .
When the crew capsule flies , it would be inside the cargo carrier at the top , with an emergency escape system .
And that " is the easiest part of the whole structure , " Shannon said .
Another advantage of using the old shuttle system is that NASA would n't have to reconfigure its Kennedy Space Center launch site and would use shuttle flight control systems , which would save billions of dollars , time and headaches , Shannon said .
The new system could also launch a year earlier , and fewer space workers would have to be laid off because of that , he said .
The Shannon plan - called the Shuttle - Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle - would only be able to carry two astronauts at a time instead of three or four .
That might mean less of a moon base , Shannon said .
Whatever the final plan , Shannon said it all comes down to this : " I would like us to be in the lunar business . "
In fact , over the years the U.A.W. has taken two different postures toward Detroit : by turns , hard - charging adversary and strategic partner .
Sometimes the union has been an unyielding bargainer , leading to strikes that have lasted for months as well as to much - derided perks , like overtime pay for union members who work less than 40 hours a week .
But other times the union has worked with management to assure labor peace , raise productivity and , over the last few years , push down labor costs .
One example : when G.M. was hurting in 2005 , the union agreed to establish the retiree health plan , known as a voluntary employees beneficiary association , to save the automaker $ 1 billion a year in health costs .
Union officials acknowledge their discomfort with the union being a major shareholder .
“ The reason we ’ve received this equity stake is we ’re trying to help the corporation survive and fund the VEBA , ” Mr. Fredline said .
The Obama administration has pushed hard to bring out the U.A.W. ’s cooperative side , evidenced by the union ’s agreeing to a wage freeze and the no-strike clause .
But the union is likely to continue fighting future layoffs , plant closings and line speedups  there are many ways to pressure management without going on strike .
“ They ’ll want to maximize the number of jobs for their members , and they ’ll use their influence for that , ” said Sean McAlinden , chief economist with the Center for Automotive Research .
“ And there are other fears the industry has  they might want to force G.M. to only use unionized suppliers .
And they could use their political influence to make it easier to organize the international automakers in the South . ”
There is no doubt that the most exciting frontier in medicine now is the use of stem cells .
Stem cells have the power to restore beauty , heal damaged tissues , and the potential to treat and cure some diseases .
Embryonic stem cells vs. fat stem cells
Up until recently the media has largely focused on the more controversial embryonic stem cells .
These are stem cells derived from embryos .
The potential uses of these cells to cure and treat diseases remain vast , but the controversial source of the cells poses ethical questions which have delayed medical progress .
During the past decade , researchers have discovered that stem cells can also be extracted from your own fat tissue .
These adult stem cells have the same potential as embryonic stem cells , except for the ability to differentiate into sperm or ova .
Unlike embryonal stem cells , stem cells extracted from your own fat are abundant , easily available , and pose no ethical or political controversy .
Cosmetic enhancements vs. therapies to treat diseases
Due to FDA regulations , stem cell therapies to treat diseases are not yet available in the U.S. unless you are part of a clinical trial .
In this capacity they are considered to be ‘ drug therapy ’ and subject to very strict regulation .
Therefore , patients not enrolled in these trials are currently traveling outside of the United States to get these therapies .
But using your own ( autologous ) stem cells to restore a more youthful appearance is available now , from experienced plastic surgeons here is the U.S.
There is no need to travel to China , Korea , or Europe to get stem cell enhanced facial rejuvenation or breast augmentation .
These therapies do not fall under the FDA ’s ‘ drug therapy ’ classification and are therefore not regulated as such because : 1 ) the injections are performed in the same operative session as the liposuction procedure to remove the fat ; 2 ) the stem cells have been only minimally manipulated ; and 3 ) the stem cell enhanced fat transfer does not alter the original relevant biologic function of the stem cell .
Thus , when the cosmetic enhancement is performed in the same operative session , it is not regulated by ‘ drug therapy ’ guidelines .
However , if your autologous stem cells are reinjected in a separate or second operative session , it is unclear whether the FDA considers that application to be a drug therapy , even though it is used for the same cosmetic purpose .
There is currently an intense legal debate about what constitutes ‘ drug therapy . ’
Plastic surgeons and fat grafting ( fat injections )
Plastic Surgeons have been extracting and reinjecting fat cells into tissues for over a decade .
Experienced fat grafting surgeons have known that successful fat grafting is highly dependent on the techniques used for extracting , processing , and reinjection of the fat cells .
Surgeons are beginning to understand that fat processing techniques which result in high concentrations of adult stem cells produce not only long lasting results , but also have therapeutic results in injured tissues .
Stem cell enhanced fat injections
To perform stem cell enhanced fat grafting , fat is first extracted by Liposuction using low negative pressure .
The fat is then processed .
Proper fat processing techniques include centrifugation and decanting of the extracted fat .
Long lasting results are only achieved with proper fat processing techniques .
In contrast , surgeons who rinse the tissue decrease stem cell adherence to fat cells , and do not increase the concentration of stem cells .
These less concentrated grafts have a smaller percentage of success .
Reinjection of the fat must be performed in very small quantities and distributed through all tissue layers to facilitate reestablishment of blood flow to the fat grafts .
Areas which benefit from stem cell enhanced fat injections
Examples of stem cell enhanced fat transfers which can be performed in the same operative session by plastic surgeons at the present time include :
Facial fat injections –
The fat transfer to the face is not just a volume filler .
The stem cell enhanced fat can actually rejuvenate your facial tissues and skin .
Stem cells assist in increasing blood supply to tissues to make tissues look younger .
Breast augmentation – Fat injections provide a natural alternative to breast implants Brazilian butt lift–
Originally used for buttock enhancement , stem cell enhanced fat transfers are being used in body contouring to create an hourglass figure .
Hand rejuvenation –
As in the face , there is not only a volume enhancement , but aged hand skin is revitalized by the fat transfer .
Other areas of stem cell therapy which are being investigated and currently developed are :
radiotherapy injuries tissue defects lumpectomy reconstruction breast reconstruction after cancer
Stem cells are the new frontier in plastic surgery
Stem cell therapy is a paradigm shift in cosmetic surgery .
Instead of the surgeon using his talents to create the illusion of a more youthful body , the surgeon guides your body to rejuvenate itself !!
Open Problems in High Dimension Geometry
Open problems on the structure of convex bodies in high dimensions
Santosh Vempala is one of world ’s leading researchers in computational complexity in general , and especially in the subarea of high dimensional computational geometry .
Since coming to Georgia Tech , he has created the ARC , which stands for Algorithms and Randomness Center .
His center has been extremely successful in creating cross cultural connections between theorists and other researchers with real problems .
Today I want to discuss some of the problems that he is working on in the area of high dimension convex bodies .
There are many interesting open problems in this area , and I thought it would be fun to list those that his group is working on right now .
I want to thank Luis Rademacher , one of his postdoc ’s , for helping me .
Santosh , besides his terrific research agenda in high dimension geometry and in computational complexity , is involved in an area that he calls Computing for Good .
This work consists of Santosh and his students , often undergraduates , working on problems that have social good attached to them .
He ran an entire course this spring with Ellen Zegura on this topic .
For example , Santosh has recently worked closely with the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) in Atlanta on systems to track blood supply .
In many countries blood supply and hospital blood requirements are tracked by pencil and paper , which causes errors : blood is misplaced , it is sent late to hospitals , or it is delivered in the wrong amount .
Santosh ’s team has worked on creating a web based system , that will replace the old pencil and paper methods .
A web system sounds like an obvious , if straightforward solution to the blood supply problem .
It is not .
The challenge is that such a systems must work in places were there is often poor connections to the Internet .
The connections are usually both slow and have low availability .
Slow and unavailable internet connections is not a firm basis on which to build a system that manages life - saving blood .
Santosh ’s clever insight is that web services for these situations raise fundamental new computer science questions .
Further he and his students have solved these problems , with new techniques .
Thus , besides helping get blood to the people that need it , when they need it , Santosh ’s team has done basic research in the construction of web services .
Pretty cool .
Convex Bodies in High Dimensions
All these results and questions concern the behavior and structure of high dimension convex bodies .
The motivation is clear : convexity is a powerful restriction on a set in high dimensions .
Moreover , the restriction is often satisfied in actual applications .
So understanding the behavior of convex bodies is of great importance .
The other reason is the problems are fun : they are relatively easy to state , but are often very hard to solve .
Convexity is a nice restriction on a body , and in low dimensions our intuition is usually right .
As the dimension grows my intuition decays exponentially , and one of two things happens : either the “ obvious result ” becomes false , or the “ obvious result ” becomes hard to prove .
That is what makes the study of fundamental problems concerning convex bodies so wonderful .
A famous example of this is the Borsuk Conjecture that Karol Borsuk asked in 1932 : Can every convex body in be cut into pieces of smaller diameter ?
A series of positive results followed , first in low dimensions , and then for special types of convex bodies .
Then , after years of these partial results , in 1993 , Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai , proved that the conjecture was not even close for general convex bodies .
They showed that in general there is a so that
pieces are needed for large enough .
Their paper is a classic : it is short and extremely clever .
It shows that the conventional wisdom was not even close .
I love when this happens–as you know .
Results and Problems
Here are some of the main problems Santosh ’s group is currently working on :
Slicing Problem :
Is there a universal constant so that every dimensional convex body of volume has a dimensional section of area at least ?
This is one of the main open questions in convex geometry .
The key is that the area is believed to be a constant part of the volume of the body .
The best known depends on the dimension and is due to Jean Bourgain and Bo’az Klartag ,
This is an important result because a simple expectation argument would give a bound of order .
Thus , they broke through this barrier , but it is a far distance from the conjectured constant bound .
Sylvester ’s Problem :
The following conjecture implies the slicing conjecture :
For a convex body in , let be the expected volume of a random simplex obtained by picking random points from .
Then , it is conjectured , that for every the only maximizers of among convex bodies of volume are the - dimensional simplexes .
This is known to be true for due to Wilhelm Blaschke , and is open for higher .
The reason it is called Sylvester ’s Problem is that Joseph Sylvester asked the following question : if points are chosen at random in the plane , what is the probability that they form a convex quadrilateral ?
Of course the question is ill - posed because he did not specify a distribution .
Actually , there are multiple answers depending on how “ random points ” in the plane is defined , since the plane is infinite one cannot say that the points come from the uniform distribution .
Reconstruction Problems : Given a dimensional convex body , how many random points from it are needed to reconstruct approximately :
The body , the best known is due to Luis Rademacher and Navin Goyal .

The volume , the best known is due to Ronen Eldan .

The centroid , the best known is which seems to be folklore .
which seems to be folklore .
The covariance , the best known is due to Mark Rudelson .
Recall that if is random in a convex body and is its centroid , then the covariance matrix of is the by matrix having entry equal to the expectation of .
Containment Problem : Let and be two non-empty dimensional convex bodies , with contained in .
Suppose further that for every halfspace ,
is small .
Then , is it true that is also small ?
Note , without the containment , the conjecture is known to be false .
Testing Convexity Problem : Suppose that is an arbitrary body in dimensional space .
Further , assume with high probability that the span of three random points from the body has a convex intersection with the body .
Then , the conjecture is :
Is the body is “ close ” to being convex .
This is known to be false for two points .
Open Problems
I have already mentioned several open problems .
I guess the open problem is to solve them .
The most interesting one to me is the slicing question .
Can there really be a constant size slice found for any convex body ?
The reason this question seems so interesting is that the normal technology for proving the existence of cuts would be to rely on randomization .
But , as I already pointed out that seems to only yield weak bounds .
Thus , the exciting possibility is that a solution to the slicing problem would yield new technical methods for understanding convex bodies .

My Top 10 Problems With Christianity
I live on the buckle of the American “ Bible Belt ” and every once in a while I have evangelical Christians come knocking on my door at dinner time to tell me the “ good news ” ( that I will be burning in Hell for all eternity ) .
So I ’ve decided that I should probably work out the major problems I have with Christianity so that my discussions with them will include less rambling and be more to the point ( I do n’t just slam the door in their faces because I enjoy making them squirm ) .
Below I have listed my major issues with Christianity .
However , it is primarily tailored towards the evangelical branches of Christian faith because those are Christians I deal with on a normal basis .
In no particular order :
Biblical literalism is inconsistent with scientific knowledge .
Biblical interpretation proves the book to be a human invention or the god to be incompetent .
Biblical law is immoral as it condones slavery , genocide , xenophobia , incest , rape , and misogyny .
Biblical scholars ’ god is very different than the layman ’s god .
We are fully capable of rational and critical thought yet we are only rewarded for blind faith and obedience .
Historical evidence for Jesus outside the bible is largely thought to be forgeries or too ambiguous .
Evangelical Christians give huge amounts of money to the church and are the poorest and least educated of all the major denominations .
So much for the Prosperity Gospel .
If we are all loved equally by this god why was Thomas and Paul given much more evidence than me ?
Many of the sins in the bible are arbitrary and lack any founding in reason .
The idea of Hell and an infinite punishment for a finite crime make very little sense when sinners could just be annihilated .
These are n’t my only issues with Christianity , but they are my most pressing problems at the moment .
Do you have major issues that I have n’t mentioned ?
Put them in the comments !
It looks as if House Democrats want to create a new tax bracket , for individuals earning $ 280,000 or more and couples earning $ 350,000 or more .
The rate would be even higher for individuals earning at least $ 400,000 and higher yet for individuals earning at least $ 800,000 .
( The cutoffs for couples would be $ 500,000 and $ 1 million . )
My colleague David Herszenhorn has the details in Saturday ’s paper .
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this proposal is that it would make the tax code more similar to the way it used to be .
I wrote a short essay on the history of the tax rates for The Times Magazine this spring .
The bottom line :
[ Y] esterday ’s tax code , unlike today ’s , had separate marginal tax rates for the truly wealthy and the merely affluent .
For a married couple in 1960 , for example , the 38 percent tax bracket started at $ 20,000 , which is about $ 145,000 in today ’s terms .
The top bracket of 91 percent began at $ 400,000 , which is the equivalent of nearly $ 3 million now … .
Today , by contrast , the very well - off and the superwealthy are lumped together .
The top bracket last year started at $ 357,700 .
Any income above that — whether it was the 400,000th dollar earned by a surgeon or the 40 millionth earned by a Wall Street titan — was taxed the same , at 35 percent .
This change is especially striking , because there is so much more income at the top of the distribution now than there was in the past .
Today a tax rate for the very top earners would apply to a far larger portion of the nation ’s income than it would have years ago .
I have no idea whether this proposal will go anywhere .
But it ’s certainly not a radical one .
As David Brooks , another colleague ( and fellow member of Club Wagner ) , wrote in his column on Friday , “ To get our overall fiscal house in order , we ’re going to need to raise taxes on the rich . ”
Genetically modified bacteria are already a common and useful component of chemical production .
Many drugs , food additives , and industrial chemicals are churned out by engineered bacteria in large vats .
Bacteria are little protein and chemical factories and we put them to good use .
But engineering a strain of bacteria to do exactly what we want is laborious and expensive .
Traditionally engineers have tweaked one or two genes at a time and then looked for the results .
But the production of many substances by bacteria may be controlled by 20 or more genes , and so the permutations of various mutations are enormous – too many to test individually .
But now genetic engineers have developed a new technique known as MAGE – multiplex automated genome engineering .
What they do is to essentially evolve bacteria with optimized or at least greatly improved production of the substance of interest .
The technique causes bacteria to rapidly mutate – causing thousands of mutations and billions of different strains .
This technique allows us to do some amount of rapid evolution , ” says Harris Wang , a researcher at Harvard Medical School , who led the project along with colleagues Farren Isaacs and George Church .
They then select for the strains that produce the most of whatever they are looking for .
Wang and Isaacs use lycopene as an example .
Conveniently , lycopene stains bacteria red , so they can just select the reddest strains .
For other end products other markers will have to be used .
For example , for some protein products genetic engineers have incorporated bits of DNA into the target gene that produce fluorescence , so that the cells that glow the most have the highest concentration of the target protein .
This technology has a great deal of promise , as does anything that makes it cheaper and faster for industrial development of new products and methods .
In addition to speeding up the production of new drugs , it may help our quest for biofuels .
Some scientists think that biofuels may be a solution to our dependence on fossil fuels .
Biofuel crops can be homegrown and they are a renewable resource .
However , if we use existing farmland and farm crops this will raise the price of food , and corn and other such crops are not efficient sources of biofuel – it is still debatable if they even produce as much energy as they consume .
Attention is therefore shifting to biomass that has a higher energy density , a higher crop density ( more biomass per acre ) , is currently a crop waste product ( like stalks ) or grows wild ( like switchgrass ) .
The problem with these sources of biofuel is that we need to develop an industrial process that can convert the tough fibers into ethanol – in a massive and cost effective way .
Economics and scale are the keys – if it costs too much to make the biofuel , it wo n’t happen on a large scale while gasoline is relatively cheap .
While there are many research programs going on right now , no one has developed a complete and cost effective industrial scale process for extracting biofuel from switchgrass or a similar source .
One of the best hopes , however , is bacteria .
If we can engineer a bacteria to eat the grass and produce some substance , like ethanol or something close to ethanol , that can then be easily refined into biofuel , we are off to the races .
Since optimization of yield and efficiency is key to the success of any such process , the MAGE technique may prove essential to the success of biofuels .
The MAGE technique is also interesting because it is a direct application of evolutionary principles .
The process works by increasing diversity randomly through mutations and then selecting those bacteria that by chance have the desirable trait .
This clearly demonstrates that the two step process of evolution – random diversity and selection – works .
Creationists have argued that evolution cannot work because random mutation cannot provide specificity and direction , and that selection cannot increase information because it is a negative process – it only removes information .
This argument is nothing but a diversion from logic and reality , however .
It should be obvious that mutations increase information and selection provides non-random specificity and direction .
In response to MAGE as an example of evolutionary principles , creationists are likely to argue that the MAGE technique allows for the inclusion of genetic mutations already known to be desirable into the mix – including introducing genes from other species .
So the diversity does not have to be entirely random .
But even when it is , the process still works .
Also , the selection is artifical , not natural .
This is an old objection by creationists to artificial selection as an analogy of evolution .
This is a non sequitur , however – the analogy is that selection can drive non-random change in a randomly varying system .
It does n’t matter if the selection is artificial or natural , all that matters is differential survival .
By itself , of course , MAGE does not prove that evolution is true .
No single line of evidence can do this .
But is does support basic evolutionary principles with a practical application .
Creationists often charge that evolution has no practical application , as if utility is a marker of scientific truth .
Not only is this argument fallacious , it is factually incorrect .
Creationists excel at being wrong in two or more ways simultaneously .
At least they are good at something .

I am a great fan of essential oils and herbs for everyday health and well - being .
There are many uses for dried lavender in and around the home .
It can be used in home medical remedies , for scenting a room , in potpourri , for cooking , and for making lavender bags or lavender sachets .
Also , dried lavender is attractive and decorative .
Some people hang them in bunches around the home or use them as part of a dried flower arrangement .
You can , of course , buy lavender already dried .
But why would you when you can do it yourself at home ?
It 's an easy plant to grow and adds a wonderful scent and colour to any garden .
It 's also a plant bees love , so you might not want to harvest all of it — leave a little for the bees .
Once you do grow lavender and harvest it , it 's fun to dry for use in all of the aforementioned projects .
This article explains how best to cut and dry lavender , and how to store it for later use .
A field of lavender grown commerically at a lavender farm in Spain .
Choosing the Right Time to Harvest
You should pick your lavender when it has just opened fully and smells fragrant .
The newly opened blossoms and fragrance means it has a strong concentration of the essential oils and freshness you want to preserve .
If you leave the flowers to bloom for longer , the dried bunches will be less potent .
It 's best to harvest lavender in the early evening , after a dry day .
Harvesting at this time will mean that you do not need to dry any rain or morning / evening dew before being able to dry the flowers .
How to Harvest
When it 's time to cut your lavender , get a pair of sturdy scissors or secateurs .
Then follow these steps to harvest the plants :
Cut carefully , avoiding crushing the flowers .
You should cut just above the leaves , with a good long stem , to make it easier to hang the stalks for drying .
Do n't cut into the woody part of the plant ; leave an inch or two at least of the green growth to encourage future flowering .
Do n't worry about damaging the plant — pruning like this will encourage the bush to grow even more enthusiastically the following year .
Even if you want to leave some stalks of flower for the bees so that the rest of your garden benefits , it 's a good idea to cut the stalk once the flowers as finished to encourage new and healthy growth next year .
Dried lavender flowers still on the stalks .
Preparing the Lavender Stalks for Drying
If you have a drying rack for flowers and herbs , by all means , use it .
But while racks are useful , if you do not have one , they 're not essential .
If you do n't have a rack , all you need is some string .
There are two ways of tying the lavender stalks for drying :
The first is to group about half a dozen lavender stalks together and tie the bunch firmly with string .
This is the quicker method .
The second is to tie the stalks individually , with about three inches between them .
Each stalk is tied with a knot in the string so that if the ends of the string are held taut , the stalks hang individually from the string rather than in a bunch .
The first method is quicker and easier , and fine if you live in a place with low humidity .
The second is useful if you live in a fairly humid area — the flowers will benefit from being separated and dry more quickly than they would otherwise .
You can also use rubber bands to hold the ends of the stalks together .
Drying the Flowers
Once the lavender stalks are on a rack or tied with string , you need to find a place to put them while they dry .
It 's important that the stalks and flowers are in a dark and dry place so that they do not get mould or rot before they dry properly .
A warm place is best .
The ideal drying area is 30 to 32 degrees Celsius for the first 24 hours and 24 to 28 degrees after that .
It does n't have to be exact , do n't worry .
Suitable drying places include attics , lofts , and airing cupboards .
If you do n't have a place that 's suitably dark , you can cover the bunches with brown paper bags ( with holes cut along the sides and bottom to allow air to circulate ) and dry them in a place with more light .
Check the lavender every few days , as the stalks can shrink a little as they dry , and you may need to tighten the string or rubber bands .
It takes on average a month for the lavender to be thoroughly dried , but hanging longer will certainly do the bunches no harm .
Storage
Once it is dry , you need to store your dried lavender until you are ready to use it .
You can store the flowers still attached to the stalks the way they were dried or by themselves , depending on the intended use .
If you want to keep it on the stalks , for hanging in a room or using in a dried flower arrangement , put the whole bunch in a paper bag and store them somewhere dry and dark , in a place that 's neither too hot nor too cold .
Dryness is more important than temperature .
If you want to use the flowers for cooking , tea , potpourri , or lavender bags , gently run your fingers along the stalks to remove the dried flowers .
You can then store the flowers in a box or paper bag .
Questions & Answers
Question :
At what stage of drying lavender do you make lavender bags ?
Answer :
Once the lavender is properly dried and flaked off from the stems , you can make lavender bags .
Question :
How long do I hang lavender to dry it ?
Answer :
It really depends on the climate , and where you are drying them .
It takes a lot longer if the humidity is higher .
Question :
How can I dry just the flower heads as I left them for too long and the woody stem was too close ?
Answer :
Yes , provided they have n't gone entirely to seed .
Question : Can I dry lavender in our bedroom , and for how long ?
I 've got fogate , Royal , and French , Seal , and Melissa .
It 's dark and cool in the room where I 'm drying it .
Answer : I do n't see any reason why not .
Dark and cool ( and not too humid ) matters , the location does n't , as much .
Question : Can I store my lavender flowers in a metal tea tin ?
Answer :
Before they are dried , no .
They would probably go mouldy or rot .
Once they are thoroughly dry , yes .
Question : Can I plant lavender in a shady area , like under my magnolia tree ?
Answer :
It depends on how shady .
Lavender does need a fair bit of sun , as well as well - drained soil .
maggie on September 01 , 2020 :
Can you dry them in an oven or microwave
Linda Longstreet on July 23 , 2018 :
I removed the flowers from stems of 4 large bushes of lavender and now I have bites all over me , arms , legs and body .
Are there bugs in lavender ?
Chiggers ?
Something ?
Anyone know ?

If you want to use lavender to impress and baffle friends and family get the cookbook - The Lavender Cookbook - by Sharon Shipley , Try the Lavender chicken chili with white bean first .
My family no looks forward to new taste treats with lavender .

How do you make lavender potpourri
Liz on August 02 , 2016 :
I have just experimented with drying in the oven , hanging in small bunches in the greenhouse and hanging in small bunches in a dark room .
The oven dried ones have no lavender smell after 3 weeks , the greenhouse dried are fine but the dark room ones are more successful and only take about a week longer .
Hidcote is not as successful as Angustifolia .
lavendar tea on October 07 , 2012 :
i had n't thought about lavendar sachets what a nice idea ... which type of lavendar do i use to make tea ?
Chris on June 04 , 2012 :
I 've been looking for instructions and can't wait to make my bags !
I use them for all sorts of things .
Will definitely have to look up cookie recipes !
I have English and Spanish Lavender .
Are both dried the same ?
Keri Summers from West of England on February 13 , 2012 :
Hello P&O . I found these instructions so helpful , that I 've included a link to your Hub in a " bunch " of Hubs about lavender .
I hope you do n't mind .
Sharon on November 11 , 2011 :
I 'm going to dry the leaves of my first - year 's growth from my lavender plants .
I hope to use them in my medicine bags that I keep in the freezer to use as ice packs when I have a migraine .
I 'm glad to learn that the plants will have flowers next year !
Thanks for the info .
H. Pinto on September 06 , 2011 :
I think the instructions are very precise and clear ; anyone can understand it ... even me .
I wish everybody could explain other things this way .
Great job !
StephenSMcmillan on July 25 , 2011 :
Learned something new here .
Thanks to share .
me on July 07 , 2011 :
i was wondering how you preserve the scent because mine does not smell any more , sadly .
please answer back and thanks for all the information , it was very helpful .
ps plz answer back asap !
Rose on July 03 , 2011 :
VERY informative instructions , I 'd like to try it myself .
Was thinking to use it in my baking , but how do I know it 's the right kind of lavender ?
Polly B on June 15 , 2011 :
I 've been growing a well admired lavender hedge for many years and so far it was just for the bees and butterflies , which give me such pleasure to watch .. now I will dry half of it for me !
thank you .
have to replace next year as going very woody so have taken some cuttings ... ready for planting in the spring .
Roses and lavender , lovely !
jacboromeo on April 19 , 2011 :
Some lavenders look nice but smell and taste nasty .
You have to get the right kind if you are going to use it for food .
craftybegonia from Southwestern , United States on February 20 , 2011 :
Great article .
The aroma of lavender is wonderful !
Julie Bell on January 19 , 2011 :
i use the lavender in post-natal bath herbs for healing after childbirth .
along with other herbs such as yarrow , calendula etc , they make a beautiful fragrant herbal bath that speeds healing .
wonderful for new mothers .
Janet Vevere on November 07 , 2010 :
Thank you for the information .
I was wondering if there was any way how to preserve the fragrance for a longer time ?
Does n't draying the lavander for a month or longer in an opened space leads to losing the fragrance ?
As I am trying to do an English garden near Rome , my lavander is still in full bloom ...
Thanks !
KK on November 05 , 2010 :
I use my dehydrator and it makes the house smell amazing !
Everyone loves it when I am drying my chocolate mint , lavender and other herbs .... its amazing !
Jules on August 27 , 2010 :
Very informative - just what I was looking for .
Ca n't wait to make my lavender bags .
Selena on July 31 , 2010 :
I Like to break up the dried lavender and use as a carpet fresh when I vacuum .
I have a dog and the vacuum holds the dog odor in the bag I brought special bags and spray from Oreck but it did not help .
The lavender does wonders and the vacuum does not smell like dog when I turn it on anymore .
Johannah on July 29 , 2010 :
If anyone wants to go to somewhere beautiful then the Lavender field in Ickleford , Hitchin , Herts is the place to go .
My children loved cutting it and bringing it home .
I 'm about to dry it so your website has been just as good a find .
Heather Squires on July 29 , 2010 :
Ca n't wait to give it a go !
Linda on July 11 , 2010 :
Thank you , need to dry all my lavender this year to throw at my daughters wedding in December .
I guess now is about the right time to be doing it .
Lois on June 09 , 2010 :
My lavender is not as fragrant these last 2 years as it was the first year we moved here .
I do n't know how old it is .
Should I cut it back in the fall ?
Nicki on June 08 , 2010 :

Beautiful lavender fields .
Plants and Oils ( author ) from England on July 14 , 2009 :
Lavender is great for cooking and herbal tea , too .
Make sure you plant it in well - drained soil , lavender needs to avoid water - logged soils .
If you plant in spring , you should get some flowers next year , and more the year after .
The plants fade after about a decade .
LeM22 from Northern VA on July 13 , 2009 :

I just bought a lavendar plant and was wondering how to do that !

Sigh ...
When it comes to software there are three systems of beliefs .
One of them : * Thou shalt know by your heart that all software sucks .
*
Beware of those who say that their software does not suck , for they are either fools or liars .
* Beware of those who give you garments and do not allow to mend them , for sooner or later thou shalt find what needs mending .
*
But beware also of those who give you badly rotten garments and say " Thou shalt prefer that above everything , for thou art allowed to mend it " .
*
Thou shalt not treat software as a living being , for it is not one .
* Choose a license of thine liking for sofware thou writest and do not blame those who choose differently for software they write .
*
Know when to say " It can be mended , I shalt do that " and when to say " It is rotten beyond repair " .
* Choose free over non -free when it is better or when thou art willing to fix what is broken .
*
When shit happens , think how to fix it .
Another : * All software wants to be free *
Thou shalt not use non -free software *
Thou shalt not mention non-free software *
Thou shalt make all thine software free *
Thou shalt choose free above working , even if free one is broken beyond repair *
When shit happens , add new features and the last one : * Our 3133t !
K3wl !
Software !
Does Not Suck !!! *
Always choose our software above everything else *
When shit happens , we add new features
If you happen to believe in second variant , you have my condolence as long as you do n't force your beliefs on everybody else .
If you choose to emulate door - to - door pests ^H^H^H^Hreachers - do n't expect to be treated differently .
People do have a right to put their code under whatever license they like .
Now , I wo n’t use the stuff I do n’t have a source for unless I have exceptionally good reason to believe that authors of that stuff are among the few percents of programmers who can find their arse without outside help .
But that has nothing to do with licensing or any moral considerations and everything to the fact that I know what kind of crap most of the software is .

Computer : Your nominators and endorsers for the Kanai Award consistently characterized your work as simple yet powerful .

Ken Thompson :
It is the way I think .
I am a very bottom - up thinker .
If you give me the right kind of Tinker Toys , I can imagine the building .
I can sit there and see primitives and recognize their power to build structures a half mile high , if only I had just one more to make it functionally complete .
I can see those kinds of things .
The converse is true , too , I think .
I ca n’t from the building imagine the Tinker Toys .
When I see a top - down description of a system or language that has infinite libraries described by layers and layers , all I just see is a morass .
I ca n’t get a feel for it .
I ca n’t understand how the pieces fit ; I ca n’t understand something presented to me that ’s very complex .
Maybe I do what I do because if I built anything more complicated , I could n’t understand it .
I really must break it down into little pieces .
if you ’re capable of understanding `finalised virtual hyperstationary factory class ' , remembering the Java class hierarchy , and all the details of the Java Media Framework , you are ( a ) a better man than i am ( b ) capable of filling your mind with large chunks of complexity , so concurrent programming should be simple by comparison .
go for it .

At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success .
Almost anything in software can be implemented , sold , and even used given enough determination .
There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars .
But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way - and that is reliability .
The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity .
It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay .

Vacuumware : n , software which was written specifically to fill a void in the industry , especially software which is successful more due to how well it fills that void than due to anything else , like usability or utility .

Every language has an optimization operator .
In C++ that operator is ‘//’
Nobody should start to undertake a large project .
You start with a small trivial project , and you should never expect it to get large .
If you do , you ’ll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage .
Or worse , you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision .
So start small , and think about the details .
Do n’t think about some big picture and fancy design .
If it does n’t solve some fairly immediate need , it ’s almost certainly over - designed .
And do n’t expect people to jump in and help you .
That ’s not how these things work .
You need to get something half - way useful first , and then others will say “ hey , that almost works for me ” , and they ’ll get involved in the project .

Theory is when you know something , but it does n’t work .
Practice is when something works , but you do n’t know why .

Q : What is the most often - overlooked risk in software engineering ?
A : Incompetent programmers .
There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000 .
This is entirely misleading .
It is not a quantity problem ; we have a quality problem .
One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year .
Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our perceived need for them .
If we had more good programmers , and could easily identify them , we would need fewer , not more .

Consequently , even if a tool did everything except the thinking for you – if it wrote 100 percent of the code , wrote 100 percent of the documentation , did 100 percent of the testing , burned the CD - ROMs , put them in boxes , and mailed them to your customers – the best you could hope for would be a 30 percent improvement in productivity .
In order to do better than that , you have to change the way you think .

The New York Times reported last week that the Bush administration considered sending in the U.S. military to arrest the so - called Lackawanna Six in 2002 .
Ironically , one of the worst prosecutorial overreaches by the Justice Department in the war on terror almost resulted in a temporary period of martial law .
The Lackawanna Six was a group of half - a- dozen Yemeni- Americans from a Buffalo suburb who traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 2001 and attended an al - Qaeda training camp .
Some members of the group asserted that they fled the camp after they heard appeals for violence against America .
After the six were arrested by the FBI and local police in September 2002 , the Justice Department announced that it had " identified , investigated and disrupted an al - Qaeda - trained , terrorist cell on American soil . "
President Bush hyped the arrests of an al - Qaeda cell in Buffalo in his State of the Union address a few months later .
While the president , the Justice Department , and legions of federal officials speaking anonymously to the media touted the Lackawanna Six as terrorists , the feds never dared make such a suggestion in court .
Salon noted that prosecutors never offered evidence that the Lackawanna defendants intended to commit an act of terrorism .
A secret FBI report in early 2005 admitted : " To date , we have not identified any true ‘ sleeper ’ agents in the U.S. " nor any evidence of concealed cells or networks acting in the homeland as sleepers . "
But the feds did persuade the defendants to plead guilty to material support of terrorism — an amorphous charge that could mean something as simple as paying for their food at the camp .
The feds coerced the plea bargain by threatening to label the men enemy combatants  and send them to Guantanamo — and to charge them with treason , for which they could be executed .
Neal Sonnett , chairman of the American Bar Association ’s Task Force on Treatment of Enemy Combatants , observed : " The [ Lackawanna ] defendants believed that if they did n’t plead guilty , they ’d end up in a black hole forever .
There ’s little difference between beating someone over the head and making a threat like that . "

Georgetown University law professor David Cole commented : " It ’s the first time in American history where people are going to prison for going to a training camp . 
Virginia lawyer and human rights activist Elaine Cassel commented :  The idea is , ‘ Let ’s go out and arrest people before they actually commit a crime , or even think of a crime . ’"
The Bush team considered sending in the military in part because of the lack of evidence .
The New York Times noted that the Justice department was concerned  that there might not be enough evidence to arrest and successfully prosecute the suspects in Lackawanna . 
Vice President Cheney reportedly argued that the administration would need a lower threshold of evidence to declare them enemy combatants and keep them in military custody . 
In other words , the idea was that it would require less evidence to totally nullify all of a person ’s rights ( including the right  not to be tortured ) then to arrest him on a felony charge .
This judicial philosophy keeps getting stranger and stranger .
Some Pentagon officials supported Cheney ’s proposal to send in the troops to grab the Lackawanna Six .
Other administration officials objected , and Bush eventually decided to avoid the overt appearance of martial law for this roundup .
Cheney was invoking a secret memo from Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel ’s John Yoo , who had written :  The president has ample constitutional and statutory authority to deploy the military against international or foreign terrorists operating within the United States . 
Since some of Yoo ’s memos leaked out in recent years , we have heard that they are irrelevant because they were only academic - type posturing .
But the New York Times article makes it clear that Cheney and others wanted to seize new powers and fundamentally change the nature of the United States .
This case illustrates how there are no idle pro-Leviathan legal errors .
Instead , any such error is like a ticking time bomb — waiting to be exploded under the people ’s rights and liberties .
But apologists for Bush would insist that it would not have been a dictatorship because one lawyer in the Justice Department assured the vice president that the White House was entitled to such power .
Supposedly , it only takes one weasel lawyer to nullify all the constitutional checks - and - balances accumulated over centuries .
Some Bush administration officials viewed using the military for the Lackawanna arrests as testing the Constitution .
In reality , it would have tested how much dictatorial power Americans would permit the Bush team to seize .
And the mainstream media might have raised scant protest .
As one wag quipped online :  If the tanks rolled down the streets on the same day the American Idol winner was named , you ’d never even hear about the tanks . 

BILLINGS , Mont . - A Colorado man used a chain saw to fight off an apparently starving mountain lion that attacked him during a camping trip in northwestern Wyoming with his wife and two toddlers .
Dustin Britton , a 32 - year - old mechanic and ex-Marine from Windsor , Colo. , said he was alone cutting firewood about 100 feet from his campsite in the Shoshone National Forest when he saw the 100 - pound lion staring at him from some bushes .
The 6 - foot - tall , 170 - pound Britton said he raised his 18 - inch chain saw and met the lion head - on as it pounced - a collision he described as feeling like a grown man running directly into him .
" It batted me three or four times with its front paws and as quick as I hit it with that saw it just turned away , " he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press .
Wildlife officials said Sunday evening 's attack about 27 miles west of Cody was highly unusual because mountain lions are reclusive by nature .
Only eight cases of mountain lions acting aggressively toward humans have been documented in Wyoming over the last decade .
" It 's very , very rare " for lions to attack , said Wyoming Game and Fish spokesman Warren Mischke .
" We 're still trying to investigate why this lion would behave this way . "
The wounded animal retreated after Britton inflicted a six - to eight - inch gash on the lion 's shoulder , leaving him with only a small puncture wound on his forearm .
" You would think if you hit an animal with a chain saw it would dig right in , " he said .
" I might as well have hit it with a hockey stick . "
The mountain lion was shot and killed Monday after it attacked a dog brought in to track the animal , which was 4 to 5 years old .
Authorities say it was in poor physical condition and appeared to be starving .
After Britton 's confrontation , he and his wife , Kirsta , decided to spend the night in their pop-up camper with their two children rather than risk packing up with the lion still on the loose .
Wildlife agents were called the next morning after Britton told a passing U.S. Forest Service employee about the incident .
Tests for rabies and other diseases came up negative , but officials said they were continuing to analyze the animal for other potential diseases .

Yes , the corporate world is taking its sweet time upgrading from Microsoft 's eight - year - old Internet Explorer 6 , a patently insecure web browser that lacks even a tabbed interface .
Take , for example , the mobile and broadband giant Orange UK .
According to a support technician working in the company 's Bristol call centre - who requested anonymity for fear of losing his job - Orange UK still requires the use of IE6 in all its call centres , forbidding technicians from adopting Mozilla 's Firefox or any other browser of a newer vintage .
This technician tells us that about a quarter of the Bristol staff had moved to Firefox after growing increasingly frustrated with IE6's inability to open multiple pages in the same window and overall sluggish performance .
But a recent email from management informed call - centre reps that downloading Firefox was verboten and that they would be fined £ 250 if their PCs experienced problems and had to be rebuilt after running Firefox or any other application downloaded from the net .
" Under no circumstances should Firefox be downloaded , " the email read .
" Downloading any application from the internet is against Orange policy .
There is NO support for Firefox in the operational environment .
Orange Web applications are all designed to run on IE6 and therefore there is a likelihood that functionality will be impaired on Firefox . "
Citing a conversation with Orange senior security consultant Julie Smith , the email goes on to say that because Firefox is not officially supported , security weaknesses wo n't be addressed by Orange 's internal patching process .
It 's a fair argument - up to a point .
IE6 is inherently less secure than newer browsers from Microsoft , Mozilla , and others .
And you could certainly argue that Orange has had more than enough time to upgrade its infrastructure .
IE7 debuted in October 2006 , the same month that Firefox 2 was released .
Mozilla has since released Firefox 3 and Firefox 3.5 .
And Microsoft has unveiled IE8 .
An Orange representative declined to comment on the matter .
The latest numbers from Stat Owl indicate that IE6 is still used by 18.5 per cent of all net surfers .
And a fair portion of those surfers are likely using the aging browser because they 're working for a company that has yet to spend the time , money , and effort needed to qualify a newer browser and to update browser - based apps .
Stat Owl indicates that 42 per cent of corporate surfers use IE6 .
That means IE6 is more popular in the corporate world than any other browser .
But Orange UK is , well , an internet outfit , and one company support technician tells us that IE6 is hampering the company 's ability to handle customer - service calls .
" If you 've ever called Orange customer services and wondered why it takes so long to get served , it 's because most of the customer service representatives are battling a system that crashes and fails regularly and because of using Internet Explorer 6 have to open about 10 separate pages just to deal with one customer 's issues , " the technician tells us .
The technician also says that hundreds of support reps in the Bristol call centre recently moved to Firefox in an effort to solve at least some of these problems .
" Frustrated with working with Internet Explorer 6 and with a crushingly bad series of systems to work with , Orange employees had taken to downloading Firefox as an alternate browser , " he says .
" Although it would n't work with a large number of internal browser - based systems , it worked with enough to make it worthwhile .
Multi - tabbed viewing , less drain on the processor , etc . "
But then management made it clear that Firefox was not allowed .
And because management 's email warning was so severe - " if problems occur on PCs with unsupported software installed , " it said , " there is a £ 250 charge for rebuilding each machine " - it seems that most Bristol technicians have abandoned the Mozilla browser .
" The ban has been effective because of how severe the warning was .
Basically , we do n't want to get caught using it , even though having to go back to IE6 and multiple windows is a real hassle , " the technician tells us .
" The delay to service is subtle but over a period of time starts to add up .

After all , these are call centres .
The archaic browser 's lack of updated protections could potentially expose customer data .
The technician also said that some of the Bristol call - centre staff asked management if they could use IE7 or IE8 .
But these newer , more - secure Microsoft browsers were explicitly forbidden as well .
Meanwhile , the Orange website has been urging its broadband customers to use a version of the new IE8 that 's been " optimized for Orange . "
The company calls it " a better way to browse " .

A victorious Chloe Smith praises the former MP Ian Gibson in her acceptance speech Press Association
David Cameron today hailed the Tories ' byelection victory in Norwich North as a " historic " result for his party and insisted it showed that the public had " had enough " of Gordon Brown .
On his seventh visit to the constituency since the contest began , the Tory leader heaped praise on his newest MP , 27 - year - old Chloe Smith , for turning a Labour majority of 5,000 into a majority of more than 7,000 for the Conservatives .
" This in a seat that has been controlled by Labour for 45 of the last 60 years , " he said .
Cameron added : " We have seen an absolutely historic victory in Norwich North .
It shows this country has had enough of Gordon Brown 's dividing lies .
This country has had enough of misleading claims about opponents .
This country has had enough about misleading claims about Tory cuts . "
Cameron spoke after his party inflicted a humiliating byelection defeat on the prime minister .
In the first electoral test in a Westminster seat since the MPs ' expenses scandal rocked the House of Commons , Smith won the Norfolk seat with a majority of 7,348 and became the youngest MP in the Commons .
Labour 's defeat , in a seat held comfortably by the party since 1997 , is the fifth byelection blow Brown has suffered since he took over at No 10 .
If the result was repeated across the country in a general election , the Tories would be swept to power with a Commons majority of 218 .
The Tories would have 434 MPs , with Labour on 107 , the Liberal Democrats 79 , and others 30 .
Responding to the news , the prime minister admitted it was a disappointing result but said no party could take a " great deal of cheer " from it because all three of the main parties had lost votes .
" The Conservative vote went down , the Liberal vote went down ; only the fringe parties saw their votes going up , " he said .
" I think it 's a lesson that we have all got to observe .
We have got to clean up Westminster politics and we are doing that .
But we have got to keep our eye on what is important to people and that is the economic recovery .
" We 've got to deal with all problems that arise .
That includes swine flu , where we 're acting in a calm , organised and ordered way to deal with the problem and help people in every part of the country . "
Cameron visited the constituency six times during the campaign , which was triggered by the resignation of Labour 's Ian Gibson following the MPs ' expenses scandal .
The popular MP had a 5,459 majority at the last election in 2005 .
Following today 's count , Smith won with a total 13,591 votes .
Labour 's Chris Ostrowski , who missed the final days of campaigning due to swine flu , received 6,243 votes and the Liberal Democrat candidate April Pond came third with 4,803 votes .
The UK Independence party pipped the Greens to fourth place by 4,068 votes to 3,350 .
The 16.49 % swing from Labour to the Conservatives at Norwich North was just short of the 17.61 % at last year 's Crewe and Nantwich byelection .
Turnout was 45.88 % – down almost a third on the 2005 general election figure of 61.09 % .
Labour supporters are thought to have stayed at home in protest against the party 's treatment of Gibson , who stood down as an MP after Labour ruled that he would not be allowed to stand for the party at the next election because he had used parliamentary expenses to fund a flat that he subsequently sold to his daughter at a discount .
In her acceptance speech , Smith paid tribute to her predecessor , saying he was a " strong , independent " voice .
She pledged to represent the people of Norwich North with the same honesty and conviction as he had .
" I will be a tireless champion for local people , " she said .
" You have invested great responsibility in me .
It will be an honour to serve you and I will not let you down . "
Ben Bradshaw , the culture secretary , insisted that the party had been right to take tough action against MPs over their expenses despite today 's result .
Jo Swinson , the 29 - year - old Liberal Democrat MP had held the unofficial title of " baby of the house " until today .
AT&T 's service is still proving to be an obstacle for new Apple iPhone 3GS buyers , according to a survey conducted by PriceGrabber.com .
AT&T 's service is still proving to be an obstacle for new iPhone buyers , according to a small survey conducted by PriceGrabber.com .
PriceGrabber , which operates a price - comparison site for online shopping , said it conducted a poll of 2,411 respondents between June 12 and July 10 , asking them about why those consumers have chosen to wait to buy the iPhone 3GS .
About 10 percent of those polled already owned one of the versions of the iPhone , PriceGrabber reported .
Roughly a third of those polled blamed AT&T for their decision not to switch over , although why they disliked AT&T was n't apparently called out .
The network provider has been criticized , however , for its dropped calls and spotty coverage .
During Apple 's conference call announcing another record quarter , however , chief operating officer Tim Cook said the relationship with AT&T was strong .
" We have an excellent relationship with them and we 're very happy with it , " he said .
One reason for not purchasing the iPhone 3GS that PriceGrabber failed to turn up was a simple lack of them .
Apple executives also revealed that the iPhone 3GS is supply - constrained ; they were n't able to predict when those supply constraints would end .

Police in Tehran today attacked hundreds of demonstrators with teargas and fired weapons into the air after the protesters defied a warning from the Revolutionary Guard that it would crush any further protests .
As helicopters hovered overhead , hundreds of police moved to disperse about 200 protesters gathered at Haft - e - Tir Square , the scene of huge demonstrations last week .
Witnesses said police prevented any groups , even small ones , from gathering .
At the underground station by the square , police prevented people from standing still , asking them to keep walking and separating those who were walking together .
The new clashes came as the authorities admitted irregularities in the disputed presidential poll had occurred on a much wider scale than previously disclosed .
The Revolutionary Guard – Iran 's most powerful military force – ordered demonstrators to " end the sabotage and rioting activities " and said their resistance was a " conspiracy " against Iran .
A statement posted on the guards ' website warned protesters to " be prepared for a resolution and revolutionary confrontation with the guards , Basij and other security forces and disciplinary forces " .
Earlier , Iran 's powerful guardian council , which last week agreed to investigate some voting complaints , admitted irregularities had been found in 50 constituencies , far more extensive than had been admitted .
A council spokesman , Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei , was quoted on the state TV website as saying the investigation showed more votes had been cast than there were registered voters in these constituencies .
He denied this had any effect on the result , a landslide victory for the incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , over Mir Hossein Mousavi .
" Statistics provided by the candidates , who claim more than 100 % of those eligible have cast their ballot in 80 - 170 cities , are not accurate – the incident has happened in only 50 cities , " Kadkhodaei said .
The admission that there were problems in " only 50 cities " was followed by today 's strong warning from the Revolutionary Guard , which in effect dared protesters to show their faces on the streets after Mousavi continued to defy an injunction against street protests by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
" The country belongs to you … protesting [ against ] lies and fraud is your right , " Mousavi , who claims Ahmadinejad won re-election through fraud , said in a statement on his website .
In a significant toughening of rhetoric , a senior Iranian politician raised the spectre of legal action against Mousavi .
" Mousavi 's calling for illegal protests and issuing provocative statements have been a source of recent unrest in Iran … such criminal acts should be confronted firmly , " Ali Shahrokhi , the head of parliament 's judiciary committee , was reported by the semi-official Fars news agency as saying .
" The ground is paved to legally chase Mousavi . "
The opposition did not hold protests yesterday amid signs it was either pausing for breath or running out of steam .
Earlier major demonstrations had thrown the regime off balance .
Young supporters of Mousavi urged people to carry black candles with green ribbons to show solidarity with victims of the recent unrest , their website said .
They also said motorists should turn on their headlights for two hours during the evening rush hour to " show their solidarity with families of martyrs killed in recent events " .
The authorities have banned a memorial service for Neda Agha - Soltan , the young woman whose death was captured on YouTube and who has come to symbolise the rebellion .
A scheduled memorial service for Agha - Soltan at the Niloofar mosque , in central Tehran 's Abbas Abad district , has been barred in case it turns into a rallying point for the opposition .
Reports suggest her body was only handed over to her family by the authorities on condition that she was buried immediately .
All other mosques in Tehran have also been forbidden from staging services in her memory .
At least 10 people were killed in clashes between demonstrators and police and the Basij militia on Saturday .
Police said 457 people were arrested that day , but did not say how many had been detained throughout a week of turmoil .
Meanwhile , Hasan Qashqavi , an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman , denounced the west for its " racial mentality " and singled out the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , for criticism .
" How can a western president , like the French president , ask for nullification of Iranian election results ? " Qashqavi said .
" I regret such comments . "
He also accused western countries and media of meddling in Iran 's affairs .
Britain , which was condemned by Khamenei as " evil " at the weekend , came under renewed fire from Iranian members of parliament .
" The members of the national security and foreign policy commission had serious criticism towards Britain 's stance and asked the foreign ministry to reconsider its ties with that country , " a commission spokesman , Kazem Jalali , was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency .
The Foreign Office said today it was evacuating the families of embassy staff in Iran , and advised against all non-essential travel to the country .
As part of its campaign to muzzle the foreign press , the Iranian government suspended the Dubai - based al - Arabiya network and detained at least two local journalists for US magazines .
Iran yesterday announced the expulsion of the BBC 's permanent Tehran correspondent , Jon Leyne , for reporting " false news and ignoring impartiality " .
In an apparent show of strength , the country launched air force exercises over the Persian gulf , Iranian state radio reported .
It said the three - day manoeuvre would use Russian - made Sukhoi and Iranian - made Saegheh jet fighters .
The warplanes will fly in Iranian airspace over the gulf and the adjoining gulf of Oman , a transit point for around 40 % of the world 's crude oil .

That is the name of a different individual .
This has been corrected .
Urban society may seem a modern phenomenon but cities have been around for a lot longer than one might think .
Indeed , once nomadic tribes began to settle in one location , they saw that it was good , became fruitful , and multiplied .
Decades , centuries and millennia passed while war , climate change and human migration all took their toll .
Relatively few ancient cities have managed to survive the test of time .
Here are 10 that have not only survived , but continue to thrive .
Damascus , Syria
( images via : Frederick Highland , Man In Demand and Historic Cities )
Damascus , the current capital of Syria , has a long and colorful history that stretches back nearly 12,000 years .
Located in a fertile region well - watered by the Barada river , Damascus was a prime target of numerous kings and conquerors – and often wound up on the losing side .
( image via : EuroMesco )
Over 4 million people live in metropolitan Damascus today and , partly due to a skilfully constructed network of canals built nearly 3,500 years ago , boasts a multitude of parks and green spaces .
Since 1979 Damascus has been UNESCO World Heritage Site .
Jericho , West Bank
( images via : Wikipedia and Bible Archaeology )
The ancient city of Jericho is the world ’s oldest walled city , with evidence of stone fortifications dating back nearly 9,000 years ; long before the “ walls came tumblin ’ down ” events depicted in the Bible .
Archaeological digs have turned up traces of habitation that are even older : up to 11,000 years ago !
( image via : SBF )
Not only has Jericho been continually inhabited for over one hundred centuries , scientists have uncovered a virtual layer cake of settlements – 20 in fact , built one on top of the other down to the present day .
Now that ’s something worth blowing your horn about … oh , wait .
Susa , Iran
( images via : Iran Facts )
Dating back to approximately 8000 BC , the ancient Iranian city of Susa rose to prominence again and again under Elamite , Babylonian , Achaemenian , Greek , Parthian , Sasanian and Persian civilizations .
( image via : CAIS News )
Today Susa is known as “ Shush ” though things have rarely been quiet there over its very long life .
Susa is where the sole representation of the Code of Hammurabi was found .
The 7 - foot tall basalt stele was taken back to Susa in the 12th century BC and rediscovered in 1901 .
It now resides in Paris ’ Louvre Museum .
Plovdiv , Bulgaria
( images via : Cultural Tourism and Virtual Tourist )
One way of measuring a city ’s age is to note the number of names it has had .
In the case of Plovdiv , the list begins with Eumolpias , changing to Philippoupolis when it was conquered by Philip II of Macedon ( Alexander the Great ’s father ) in 342 BC .
Centuries passed and Philippoupolis became Trimontium , then Philippoupolis again , then Paldin , Filibe and finally Plovdiv .
( image via : Discover Bulgaria )
Presently home to around 380,000 ( 580,000 in the metro area ) , Plovdiv is Bulgaria ’s second - largest city and one of Europe ’s oldest – signs of urban activity there go back nearly 9,000 years .
Jerusalem
( images via : Hamline University and Pierre Tristam )
Holy to a number of the world ’s leading religions , 5,000 - year - old Jerusalem was already settled centuries before any of them had their tenets put to paper , papyrus or pre-fired clay .
According to the entry on Jerusalem in Wikipedia , “ In the course of its history , Jerusalem has been destroyed twice , besieged 23 times , attacked 52 times , and captured and recaptured 44 times . ”
( image via : Trip Advisor )
Sadly , those numbers are likely not the final score for this exceptional city 747,600 people call Jerusalem , Yerushalayim , Al - Quds and … home .
Tyre , Lebanon
( image via : Skyscraper City )
Source of prized Tyrian Purple dye and home base of those legendary master traders , the Phoenicians , Tyre was truly a wonder of the ancient world .
The city was located on a walled island just off the coast of Lebanon and managed to thwart every siege until Alexander the Great built a causeway so his soldiers could march up to the city walls .
( image via : Sophismata )
( images via : Hezbollah Connect and El Baluarte De La Utopia )
The causeway changed the flow of the sea currents and caused the island to become permanently joined to the mainland .
Today Tyre is Lebanon ’s fourth - largest city and can proudly trace its history back nearly 6,000 years .
Athens , Greece
( images via : Erasmus Student Network , Destination 360 and BiblePlaces )
The capital of Greece is home to over 4 million today and is the 5th - most populous capital city in the EU .
With its soaring Acropolis and majestic Parthenon symbolizing the golden age of Classical Greece and the foundation of Western civilization , Athens has been lived in for approximately 3,400 years .
( image via : Theodora )
The city has not always enjoyed prominence , however – by the early 19th century it had deteriorated to a backwater town with only a few thousand citizens .
That all changed when Athens was named capital of Greece in 1834 , with the city truly coming of age due to the many infrastructure improvements completed in time for the 2004 Olympic Games .
Lisbon , Portugal
( images via : Galen Fry Singer and Lgougo )
Due to its exceptional harbor situated where the Tagus river empties into the Atlantic Ocean , Lisbon has always been an ideal military and commercial location – incidentally attracting settlers to serve the soldiers and traders .
Archaeologists have uncovered Phoenician objects at Lisbon dating back to 1200 BC ; remnants of what was likely a Phoenician supply base for ships voyaging to and from the British Isles , an ancient source of tin .
( images via : Wall Street Meeting and John P Pratt )
Disaster struck Lisbon in 1755 when one of the most destructive earthquakes ever to strike Europe , accompanied by a massive tsunami and wildfires , leveled much of Lisbon and killed tens of thousands of residents .
( images via : Book Depository and Links On Waves )
Lisbon quickly bounced back from the disaster to regain her rank as one of Europe ’s leading cities , a distinction she still holds today .
Varanasi , India
( image via : Sacred Destinations )
The city of Varanasi , formerly known to English - speakers as Benares , has been a religious and cultural center for at least 3,000 years .
Over one million pilgrims from across the Hindu world visit Varanasi each year to participate in ceremonies and swim in the sacred Ganges river .
( image via : Without Borders )
Varanasi is as close to being a true “ living city ” as one could imagine .
Every bit of space is utilized , every disused building is re-worked into a new purpose and over centuries of conflict and conquest , the city heals itself through the power of human conviction and devotion to a greater glory .
Cholula , Mexico
( images via : Webshots Travel and Cultura )
Arguably the oldest continually inhabited city in the western hemisphere , Choloula was a contemporary of more famous Teotihuacan yet never suffered the crisis that saw it ’s neighbor abandoned in the 6th century AD .
By the late Aztec period more than 100,000 people lived in Cholula , and the city near Puebla is home to over 90,000 today .
( image via : Rahuno )
Cholula rose to prominence in the 2nd century BC but settlement on a more modest scale goes back a further thousand years .
The partially excavated monumental buildings at Cholula are among the largest in the world , with the Great Pyramid of Cholula being the largest man-made monument ever made !
Its base covers approximately 25 acres and the pyramid ’s total volume is estimated at 4.3 million cubic yards .
What ’s it take to make a long - lived city ?
The same thing any realtor will tell you : location , location , location !
Prime real estate does tend to attract the wrong crowd – conquerors have a way of ruining anyone ’s backyard barbeque – but once all the fuss has died down people do what they ’ve always done ; keep on coming back for more .
A good movie will transport you into a separate time or era with an intriguing story , everlasting characters , and imaginative plot development .
It could have a happy , sad , romantic , or action packed theme .
As a whole , the world population adores the character actors who star in these stories .
People can personally relate to certain movie characters and individual actors .

There is a small list of actors who are not officially leading men , but have starred in some of the biggest grossing movies in history .
Many of these men contributed to the widely successful Harry Potter series , but in order to get to the level of multi-billion dollars sales , an actor must have numerous popular roles .

Yet another rumor about Apple 's fabled touchscreen tablet has emerged , with sources claiming the product will hit stores in early 2010 .
In its report , AppleInsider cites " people well - respected ... for their striking accuracy in Apple 's internal affairs , " who claim a 10 - inch , 3G - enabled tablet will turn up between January and March .
AppleInsider 's article conflicts with a rumor report posted by TheStreet 's Scott Moritz earlier this week , which stated an Apple tablet was due as soon as October this year .
Moritz 's report also said the tablet would be subsidized by Verizon .
Wired.com has more faith in AppleInsider 's report , because a 2010 launch of this product would be more realistic .
It 's unlikely Apple would release a tablet in October 2009 , because it would cannibalize sales of MacBooks during back - to - school season — when MacBooks tend to sell very well .
Plus , Apple recently slashed MacBook prices , and the company would aim to capitalize on the move during back - to - school season without introducing a competitor into its own product line .
Third , many rumor reports suggest a new iPod Touch is due in stores fall , and a tablet would likely cannibalize on sales of this product , too .
A January to March time frame would be a much wiser move for Apple .
That 's because the Consumer Electronics Show — the largest technology convention in the United States — takes place January .
Apple does not plan to attend the Macworld Expo trade show , also in January , nor does it plan to attend CES .
So a tablet timed for a January announcement would be the perfect way for Apple to steal thunder from other tech companies showing off new gear at CES .
Also , Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster laid out strong reasoning to believe an Apple tablet is arriving 2010 :
" Between indications from our component contacts in Asia , recent patents relating to multi - touch sensitivity for more complex computing devices , comments from [ chief operating officer ]
Tim Cook on the April 22 conference call , and Apple ’s acquisition of PA Semi along with other recent chip - related hires , it is increasingly clear that Apple is investing more in its mobile - computing franchise , ” Munster said in a research statement issued to clients in May .
Lastly , we 're more skeptical about TheStreet 's October prediction given Moritz 's track record , which is notoriously spotty when it comes to Apple rumors .
For example , in May , Moritz wrote a story titled " Tech Rumor of the Day : Apple , " which quoted an analyst who predicted AT&T would reduce prices for the iPhone 's monthly service plan .
Not only did that not turn out to be true ; it was n't a rumor at all — just a prediction from an analyst .
Regardless , given the number of rumors floating around , and reports that Apple 's component suppliers in China are receiving orders for parts to build a tablet , an Apple tablet almost seems inevitable .
With AppleInsider 's report , we 're placing more chips in the betting circle for a 2010 launch of this device .

By By Patrick McMahon Jul 7 , 2009 in World Former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney was released yesterday from an Israeli prison following her arrest on June 30 for running a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip .

The former Green Party presidential nominee was among 20 people arrested for attempting to deliver three tons of aid to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip .
McKinney was said to be detained this long because she refused to sign papers that would have admitted to break the blockade and would have faced deportation .
McKinney also criticized the Obama administration for failing to call for her release .

Case Shiller vs. Lawler
Nearly everyone is familiar with Case Shiller .
I suspect most have not heard of Lawler .
Interestingly there is a feud of sorts between the two as noted by the Wall Street Journal article Outlook for Home Prices Clouded by Spat Over Historical Trends .
Yale University economist Robert Shiller has often dazzled audiences with a chart showing home prices from 1890 to present .
Someone even used Mr. Shiller 's chart to make a YouTube video that puts its viewer on a roller - coaster ride over peaks and valleys in home pricing .
It 's a bumpy ride .
Now another economist , Thomas Lawler , says Prof .
Shiller 's chart is " bogus . "
Mr. Lawler says Mr. Shiller cobbled together data that are inconsistent and sometimes unreliable .
Mr. Shiller defends his work and accuses Mr. Lawler of making " wild allegations . "
No one has found a precise way to measure changes in house prices .
Because no two homes are exactly alike , changes in the price of one wo n't necessarily be matched even by apparently similar homes nearby , much less those hundreds of miles away .
But that does n't stop analysts from extrapolating from what may be dubious data .
In a March 30 report , T2 Partners LLC , a New York hedge - fund manager , drew on the Shiller chart to conclude that on average U.S. home prices need to drop another 13 % to get back in line with the long - term trend .
Mr. Lawler has created an adjusted version of the Shiller chart , backing up his view that house prices already are nearing a bottom in much of the country .
A T2 partner called Mr. Lawler 's critique " valid . "
Mortgage Debt vs. Equity
Americans Have Borrowed Heavily Against Their Homes Such That the Percentage of Equity in Their Homes Has Fallen Below 50 % for the First Time on Record Since 1945 .
Gorged In Debt
Over the Past 30 Years , We Have Become a Nation Gorged in Debt – To The Benefit of Financial Services Firms .
Surge of Toxic Mortgages
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Account for 56 % of Mortgages
Private Label Mortgages ( Those Securitized by Wall St. ) Are 15 % of All Mortgages , But Are 51 % of Seriously Delinquent Mortgages .
Mortgage Delinquencies as Percentage of Loans
Nearly 8 % of Mortgages on 1 - to - 4 - Family Homes Were Delinquent or in Foreclosure as of Q4 2008 .
Subprime Resets
The Wave of Resets from Subprime Loans Is Mostly Behind Us .
Alt - A Mortgage Resets
There Are $ 2.4 Trillion of Alt - A Mortgages and Their Resets Are Mostly Ahead of Us .

24 % of Homeowners With a Mortgage Owe More Than the Home Is Worth , Making Them Far More Likely to Default
Shiller Lawler Trendlines
Home Prices Need to Fall Another 5 - 10 % to Reach Trend Line
Change In Nonfarm Payroll Employment
The dip in initial claims from the March peak of roughly 650,000 is not accelerating very fast , if indeed at all .
Those looking for a recovery in jobs soon are going to be disappointed .
Economists expect to see unemployment by 10 % at the end of the year .
I expect to see it at 9.8 % +- by August and approaching 11 % by the end of the year .
Bear in mind the " stress - free tests " conducted by the Fed had an adverse scenario of 10.3 % at the end of 2010 .
Declines in Jobs vs. Past Recessions
The Decline from Peak Employment Now Exceeds the Past Five Recessions .
Total Bank Losses
Total Losses Are Now Estimated at $ 2.1 - $ 3.8 Trillion – And Less Than Half of This Has Been Realized To Date .
Losses & Writedowns vs. Capital Raised
Institutions Have Been Able to Raise Capital to Mostly Keep Up With Writedowns , But This Will Likely Not Continue .
Apple presents an image of quality , but an audit of its factories in mainland China showed that more than half of these were n't paying their workers properly last year .
Following an investigation on Tuesday into many Chinese companies violating recent labor laws , it 's now known through Apple 's 2009 responsibility progress report that 45 of the 83 factories that built iPhones and iPods in 2008 were n't paying valid overtime rates for those workers that qualified , while 23 of these were n't even paying some of their workers China 's minimum wage .
A deeper look at Apple 's findings found that about 25 of the 83 also discriminated to some degree against people based on ethnicity , biological issues like disabilities , or political leanings .
22 did n't meet environmental standards , while almost exactly a fifth also had problems with on - site living conditions and safety .
In a few extreme cases , seven factories had been caught having at least at one time hired underage workers , though were were n't more than 25 people involved .
Some workers at six factories also had to enter debt to a recruitment agency just to start work and were effectively forced to work to pay off their recruiters .
When contacted by Bloomberg , Apple maintained that it has regularly audited all of its suppliers in China and otherwise since 2007 and that it has actively sought to improve conditions for those contracted and migrant workers most likely to be hurt by labor abuses .
The report itself mentions that Apple goes above and beyond inspections performed by other companies and talks to contractors and migrants themselves , also insisting on ways for employees to complain about conditions without fear of retaliation .
The article " Loan- Repayment Benefit Grows for Hill Staffers " ( U.S. News , June 25 ) serves as one more reminder that while private - sector workers continue to struggle , the rewards keep flowing for people in the government sector .
No cutbacks in 401 ( k ) contributions , salary or health benefits for them .
In fact , it 's secure jobs , salary increases and lavish benefits as usual , with little or no public discussion .
Visitors to Washington should take time to tour the suburbs of northern Virginia and Maryland to see the thousands of ...

MAYBE THE TOBACKY is n’t so wacky after all .
A number of 2009 polls have reflected a major shift in public attitudes about marijuana legalization — on average , more than 40 percent of Americans are now in favor , the highest number on record since the Just Say No 1980s .
( A roughly equal number remain opposed . )
In March , the normally conservative Economist magazine declared the war on doobies a “ disaster , ” calling legalization the “ least bad option . ”
A month later , even Time magazine joined in , arguing , “ The hypocrisy inherent in the American conversation about stimulants is staggering . ”
In New York State , the strict Rockefeller drug laws are up for review , and in California , where medical marijuana is fairly easy to obtain , Governor Schwarzenegger has asked that the state study other countries ’ policies and debate economic and judicial reform .
This new attention has converged from several angles :
The capsized economy has provided a compelling financial argument for elected officials looking to find new taxable products , for one , and a judicial argument has arisen in light of violent Mexican gangs who profit from the U.S. market .
And pot legalization — like gay marriage — has gained wider support now that there is evidence from other states and countries that have legalized and found that the world has n’t , in fact , ended in a blaze of reefer madness .
The statistics website FiveThirty Eight estimates that if public support continues to grow at its current pace , legalization could happen within 15 years .
With this in mind , Print contacted four firms : Lust , a graphic design practice in Amsterdam established by Thomas Castro , Jeroen Barendse , and Dimitri Nieuwenhuizen ; the New York office of Base , which worked with its branches in Europe ; the Oslo firm Strømme Throndsen , winner of the 2009 Award for Design Excellence for its flour packaging ; and The Heads of State , a two - man operation run by Jason Kernevich and Dustin Summers in Philadelphia .

Science & Exploration ESA prepares for the next generation of human spaceflight and exploration by recruiting a new class of European astronauts
20/05/2009 6278 views 12 likes
ESA PR 12-2009 .
ESA today presented the six individuals who will become Europe 's new astronauts .
The new recruits will join the European Astronaut Corps and start their training to prepare for future missions to the International Space Station , and beyond .
The new astronauts are : 1 . Samantha Cristoforetti , Italian
2. Alexander Gerst , German
3. Andreas Mogensen , Danish
4. Luca Parmitano , Italian
5. Timothy Peake , British
6. Thomas Pesquet , French
They were selected following a Europe - wide recruitment process that started last year .
Following thorough psychological , medical and professional screening that started with 8413 valid applications , they are the first new recruits to join the European Astronaut Corps since 1992 under this second - ever astronaut selection carried out by ESA .
The new astronauts were selected following a Europe - wide recruitment process
The choice of six was made taking into account flight opportunities planned not only under ESA programmes and activities but also those planned in the frame of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) and NASA .
This was done in agreement with the Italian authorities and in accordance with the ESA Council decision in 2002 to create a single corps of astronauts in Europe .
“ We are at a turning point in ESA ’s human spaceflight activities .
Last year , with the launch of the Columbus laboratory and the Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle , ESA became a fully - fledged member of the International Space Station partnership .
We are now entering a new phase of utilisation of the unique capabilities offered by the ISS and preparation for international exploration of the Moon and beyond , ” said ESA Director General Jean - Jacques Dordain .
Europe 's new astronauts were presented at a press conference at ESA Headquarters “ This new phase required the recruitment of young talent able to draw on the experience gained by the existing astronauts , able to become , step by step , the representatives of Europe in space who , together with their international colleagues , will live , work , explore and bring back to planet Earth and its citizens their unique experience , their accomplishments and their confidence in the future .
They all represent the generation that will move from low earth orbit to the Moon , ” Dordain added .
The new recruits will join the European Astronaut Corps “ I am very proud of the result achieved with this selection , ” said Simonetta Di Pippo , ESA Director of Human Spaceflight .
“ Proud , as a European , of the calibre of the candidates , proud of the organisational efforts made by ESA and in particular by the European Astronaut Centre .
This result exceeds our greatest expectations .
Not only do we have a group of outstanding astronauts ; we also have a representation of European countries that reinforces the support for human spaceflight and exploration in Europe . ”
She added : “ With the ISS lifetime being considered for an extension to 2020 and beyond , I believe today ’s selection of six new astronauts shows where Europe stands . ”
“ This is a very important day for human spaceflight in Europe , ” continued Di Pippo .
“ These young men and women are the next generation of European space explorers .
They have a fantastic career ahead , which will put them right on top of one of the ultimate challenges of our time : going back to the Moon and beyond as part of the global exploration effort . ”
Europe 's new astronauts will start their basic training at the European Astronaut Centre ( EAC ) in Cologne , Germany .
With ESA 's ISS partners also having completed or currently finalising their own recruitment campaigns , they will also join a new class of international astronauts who will be prepared for future space missions to the International Space Station from 2013 onwards .

Auf die Gefahr hin , dass ich hier das gleiche schreibe wie unendlich viele Affen und dass ich Dinge wiederhole , will ich mich auch mal zur Kulturflatrate äußern , die ja momentan mal wieder in die Diskussion gekommen ist .
Warum eine Kulturflatrate für den Verbraucher gut wäre
Ich persönlich würde eine Einführung einer Kulturflatrate begrüßen , da ich bzw .
mein näheres Umfeld dadurch deutlich profitieren würden .
Zur Info : Ich lade keine Musik oder Filme aus dem Netz herunter .
Ich kaufe Filme und CDs , weil ich der Meinung bin , dass Menschen für ihre Arbeit entlohnt werden sollen .
Und ich gehe ins Kino .
Seit dem Umzug seltener , aber ich gehe .
Kultur kostet Geld , einige Leute leben davon , so what .
Wir leben in einer Dienstleistungsgesellschaft , in der Arbeitsteilung herrscht .
Ich muss kein Gemüse pflanzen , das tut ein anderer und verkauft es .
Ich sehe durchaus ein , dass Menschen damit Geld verdienen wollen oder müssen .
Die Frage wie sie es tun könnten ist eine andere .
Ich bin mit Sicherheit der falsche Ansprechpartner wenn es um das Entwickeln eines Geschäftsmodells für die Musikindustrie geht .
Warum das mit der Kulturflatrate nicht funktionieren kann
Es gibt in Deutschland und auf der ganzen Welt viele Künstler , manche sind Mitglied in Verwertungsgesellschaften , manche nicht .
Und nachdem man schon mal gefragt hat , wofür die Kulturflate denn gelten soll und was sie kosten soll , dann geht der Spaß erst richtig los .
Was ist zum Beispiel mit Inhalten unter CC - Lizenzen ?
Werden diese vielleicht abgeschafft bzw .
bedeutungslos ?
Wer verteilt das Geld und wie ?
Muss man an der Flatrate teilnehmen ?
Sind die „ Bedingungen zur Teilnahme “ genauso gehalten wie bei der GEZ und der GEMA ?
An welchen Geräten macht man das fest ?
Muss man bestimmte Programme nutzen ?
Opt - In oder Opt - Out ?
Wer bezahlt das bei wem ?
Und wieviel ?
Die Fragenliste könnte man ewig weiterführen .
Die Einführung einer Kulturflatrate würde ein wahnsinniges Bürokratiemonster nach sich ziehen , beleidigte Leberwürste , die sich unter Wert verkauft fühlen gibt es gratis dazu .

This post was written by Jeff Balogh .
Jeff works on Mozilla ’s web development team .
New in Firefox 3.5 , localStorage is a part of the Web Storage specification .
localStorage provides a simple Javascript API for persisting key - value pairs in the browser .
It should n’t be confused with the SQL database storage proposal , which is a separate ( and more contentious ) part of the Web Storage spec .
Key - value pairs could conceivably be stored in cookies , but you would n’t want to do that .
Cookies are sent to the server with every request , presenting performance issues with large data sets and the potential for security problems , and you have to write your own interface for treating cookies like a database .
Here ’s a small demo that stores the content of a textarea in localStorage .
You can change the text , open a new tab , and find your updated content .
Or you can restart the browser and your text will still be there .
The easiest way to use localStorage is to treat it like a regular object :
>>> localStorage.foo = ' bar ' >>> localStorage.foo " bar " >>> localStorage.length 1 >>> localStorage [ 0 ] " foo " >>> localStorage [ ' foo ' ] " bar " >>> delete localStorage [ ' foo ' ] >>> localStorage.length 0 >>> localStorage.not_set null
There ’s also a more wordy API for people who like that sort of thing :
>>> localStorage.clear ( ) >>> localStorage.setItem ( ' foo ' , ' bar ' ) >>> localStorage.getItem ( ' foo ' ) " bar " >>> localStorage.key ( 0 ) " foo " >>> localStorage.removeItem ( ' foo ' ) >>> localStorage.length 0
If you want to have a localStorage database mapped to the current session , you can use sessionStorage .
It has the same interface as localStorage , but the lifetime of sessionStorage is limited to the current browser window .
You can follow links around the site in the same window and sessionStorage will be maintained ( going to different sites is fine too ) , but once that window is closed the database will be deleted .
localStorage is for long - term storage , as the w3 c spec instructs browsers to consider the data “ potentially user- critical ” .
I was a tad disappointed when I found out that localStorage only supports storing strings , since I was hoping for something more structured .
But with native JSON support it ’s easy to create an object store on top of localStorage :
Storage.prototype.setObject = function ( key , value ) { this.setItem ( key , JSON.stringify ( value ) ) ; } Storage.prototype.getObject = function ( key ) { return JSON.parse ( this.getItem( key ) ) ; }
localStorage databases are scoped to an HTML5 origin , basically the tuple ( scheme , host , port ) .
This means that the database is shared across all pages on the same domain , even concurrently by multiple browser tabs .
However , a page connecting over http :// cannot see a database that was created during an https :// session .
Be warned , however .
The insurance industry will do everything it can to avoid being held accountable .
At first the insurance lobby ’s foot soldiers in Congress tried to shout down the public option with the old slogans : private enterprise good , government bad .
At this point , however , they ’re trying to kill the public option in more subtle ways .
The most recent ruse is the proposal for a “ trigger ” -- the public option will only become available if private insurers fail to meet certain performance criteria .
The idea , of course , is to choose those criteria to ensure that the trigger is never pulled .
And here ’s the thing .
Without an effective public option , the Obama health care reform will be simply a national version of the health care reform in Massachusetts : a system that is a lot better than nothing but has done little to address the fundamental problem of a fragmented system , and as a result has done little to control rising health care costs .
Right now the health insurers are promising to deliver major cost savings .
But history shows that such promises ca n’t be trusted .
As President Obama said in his letter , we need a serious , real public option to keep the insurance companies honest .
To be honest , I had n't heard anything about H.R. 626 , Carolyn Maloney 's Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave
Act which she introduced so it would guarantee that 4 of the 12 weeks of parental leave made available to a Federal employee shall be paid leave .
It 's what you call real progressive legislation that directly impacts the lives of real live people and makes for a better and more equitable society .
The way I found out about it was that I was on the phone talking about a national security issue with one of the bill 's sponsors , Joe Sestak , when he said he had to run over and vote .
At 8 yesterday evening the Republicans tried killing the bill with a motion to recommit that failed 171- 241 , with 8 conservative Democrats kissing up to the Chamber of Commerce by voting with the GOP -- mostly the usual shitheads like Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID ) , Henry Cuellar ( Blue Dog - TX ) , Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL ) , etc .
Ten minutes later the landmark bill passed 258- 154 , with two dozen vulnerable Republicans too scared to voted with their anti-family leadership .
Basically what the bill will do is this : it allows " federal employees to substitute any available paid leave for any leave without pay available for either the : ( 1 ) birth of a child ; or ( 2 ) placement of a child with the employee for either adoption or foster care .
Makes available ( subject to specified requirements ) for any of the 12 weeks of leave an employee is entitled to for such purposes : ( 1 ) four administrative weeks of paid parental leave in connection with the birth or placement involved ; and ( 2 ) any accumulated annual or sick leave .
" Does that sound like something the GOP should be trying to obstruct ?
And yet , the Republican leadership did just that .
First one of the worst of the GOP corporate shills , Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , offered an amendment to water it down .
They would never water down anything that make the rich and powerful more rich and more powerful , but the idea of improving the lives of working families is enough to drive a Republican insane .
154 of them ( and 3 bad Dems -- Minnick , Kosmas and Childers ) voted for Issa 's mean - spirited amendment , which failed 157-258 .
What kind of a sonofabitch would vote against paid leave ?
Well ask fake self - professed " moderates " like Mary Bono Mack ( R- CA ) , Mike Castle ( R- DE ) , Vernon Ehlers ( R - MI ) Charlie Dent ( R - PA ) , Peter King ( R - NY ) , Bill Young ( R - FL ) and Dave Camp ( R - MI ) who voted in lockstep with the worst right - wing extremists , from Michele Bachmann , Mean Jean Schmidt , Virginia Fox , Patty McHenry and Tom McClintock to garbage like Eric Cantor , Paul Ryan and Gary Miller .
No doubt some kind of hellish combination of the entire Senate Republican caucus plus Evan Bayh 's anti-Obama Bloc of conservadems will find a way to stop this from ever becoming law .
Or maybe they 're so busy working full time on destroying health care reform that they wo n't have the energy for much else .
In this morning ' sKrugman warned that the key to passing real reform is for Congress to not trust the predatory insurance industry .
Not trust them ?
The Insurance has put so much into winning the trust of Congress -- $ 315,390,117 to be presice ( not counting another $ 1,220,365,114 in lobbying -- in the last few years .
The average U.S. Senator has gotten $ 552,708 in direct " donations " from the Insurance industry since 1990 .
And if that seems like a lot , the members of the Senate who have been tasked with killing health care reform have gotten far more than the average .
The insurance industry 's top shills , or what Krugman calls " the insurance lobby ’s foot soldiers in Congress , " ( not even counting ex-presidential candidates ; of course McCain got more money than anyone ) :
Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) - $ 1,196,799 Max Baucus ( D - MT ) - $ 1,184,113Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) - $ 1,036,302 Arlen Specter ( R - D - PA ) - $ 1,035,530 Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) - $ 981,400 Miss McConnell ( R-KY ) - $ 929,207 Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) - $ 884,724Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) - $ 824,837Jim Bunning ( R- KY ) - $ 781,016Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) - $ 661,807 With the exception of Jim Bunning , who is senile , ineffective and looked at as the walking dead by his colleagues , expect this list of senators to wield the knives that murder health care reform on the Senate floor -- or in the cloak rooms -- with Schumer taking on the role of Brutus .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Astronaut Buzz Aldrin has no regrets about being the second man to walk on the moon but admits that at the time he had made a strong case for why he should have been the one to take history ’s “ giant leap for mankind . ”
In his latest book , “ Magnificent Desolation , ” Aldrin reminisces about the Apollo 11 mission ahead of the 40th anniversary next month and details his battles with depression , alcoholism and adjustment to post - Apollo life .
“ People say , ‘ Did n’t you want to be first on the moon ? ’ , ” Aldrin told Reuters in an interview .
“ Yes , from a professional point of view , I wanted to take advantage of every opportunity and project discussions about the commander , who had many responsibilities , and maybe some of those things that include things outside and going out first should be done by the other guy , ” he said .
Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong and Aldrin made the first manned landing on the moon on July 20 , 1969 .
In the lead up to the flight , Aldrin said he assumed that in keeping with previous NASA extravehicular activities like spacewalks , as the junior crew member he would be first down the ladder to take mankind ’s first steps in the lunar dust .
“ One guy will stay inside , probably the commander , ” he said .
“ Then they realized , ‘ No , we ’ll send two out . ’
There was a lot of uncertainty in the planning people .
But all that newspaper stuff about a civilian versus a member of the military was just cooked up as a possible reason for hesitation on the part of NASA . ”
Armstrong had been a U.S. Navy combat pilot but was a civilian aboard Apollo 11 .
Aldrin was still in the Air Force .
In the end the decision came down to logistics .
The lunar landing craft ’s hatch was located on Armstrong ’s side .
It would have too cumbersome , and perhaps even dangerous , for Aldrin to have climbed over his mission mate , so Armstrong went first .
DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY
Aldrin , Armstrong and Command Module pilot Michael Collins were arguably the most famous men in the world when they returned .
On a worldwide tour they were feted with parades , medals and ceremonies by heads of state in over 20 countries .
But when the cheering subsided and after achieving his life ’s goal he contemplated what to do next .
“ It ’s an unstructured , wondering , ‘ Who do I look to , where is my schedule , what is going to happen ? , ’ ” Aldrin said .
“ Being kind of unstructured and a little uncertain does n’t give you confidence . ”
After his appointment as commandant of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School , Aldrin began to suffer bouts of depression and was eventually hospitalized for a month .
When he retired from the military the following year , he did consulting , endorsement and design work but the depression returned and he turned to alcohol .
“ People in the military know how to be disciplined , and know how to relax .
It ’s what eases the unease of the situation , ” he said of his earlier , problem - free drinking .
“ But once you do n’t have these other commitments , you begin to make decisions that are not the wisest , and if you ’re a little uncomfortable in the morning , a drink really fixes it , ” he said .
“ The ‘ hair of the dog ’ is the sign of addiction . ”
After several attempts to quit drinking , Aldrin eventually turned the corner and recently celebrated his 30th anniversary of sobriety .
He married his third wife , Lois , in 1988 .
He champions the potential of space exploration and believes the United States has lost valuable ground in the next phase of “ the space race ” and should set its sights beyond returning to the moon .
“ I know in my own mind that the Russians want to beat us to Mars , ” he said .
“ They ’re doing everything that you ’d expect them to do to be first to Mars , and that ’s not going to be good for America 20 or 30 years from now . ”

When the ' secret ' of the Colonel 's blend of herbs and spices was revealed , we had to test the recipe - and then see if it could be bettered ...
Woody
Allen once opined that sex is like pizza - even when it 's rubbish it 's pretty damn good .
I feel the same way about fried chicken .
The truth is , it would take effort and skill to screw up succulent chicken meat , dredged in seasoned flour and cooked in boiling fat .
Like many other foodies I have a problem with the moral implications of KFC 's chicken meat but I can't , with my hand on my ( rapidly congesting ) heart , say it does n't taste pretty good when fresh from the bucket .
But I 'm lucky enough to also have sampled the real thing .
I lived for several years in rural North Carolina and married a local girl .
The reception was held on a hot summer evening , on the banks of a sleepy river on the family farm and was a pot - luck affair .
In the course of the evening a couple of hundred people turned up , most carrying trays covered in a cloth and containing a personal variation on fried chicken .
Your personal ' secret recipe ' for fried chicken is a pretty serious business in the South , and a newbie outsider like me could be forgiven for believing that all those family reunions , church picnics , barbecues and tailgate parties were just a front for a bitterly fought and endless competition to produce better and better fried chicken .
I personally reckon the world would be a much better place if we all got together every now and again in a ' healthy ' competition over fried chicken .
It sublimates family tensions , draws communities together and generally makes it socially acceptable to eat like a starved weasel in the name of politeness .
An online competitive chicken fry - off , then ?
Bring it on .
Thanks to a huge response from WoM posters we were able , once again , to revisit the endlessly fascinating moral arguments surrounding the eating of animals .
We were also able work out a sensible method of home cooking fried chicken , and devise a convincingly British spicing mix .
Lacking KFC 's mighty pressure fryers and mindful of the need to cook the chicken right through , we were happy to follow the suggestions of double cooking .
Most recommended some time in the oven after frying , but we thought we 'd experiment with poaching beforehand and , as many of our posters suggested an overnight marinade in milk , we decided to use the marinade as the poaching liquid .
It 's worth noting for future recipes that chicken marinaded and poached in milk has an unbelievably suave flavour and texture , and that the poaching liquid thickens to create the most soothing cream of chicken soup I 've ever achieved .
We made up two batches of seasoned flour , using Ron Douglas 's ' KFC ' mix and our own Guardian crowdsourced version - let 's call it ' GFC ' - and fried sample pieces of the poached chicken dredged in each .
' KFC ' mix
1 teaspoon ground oregano
1 teaspoon chilli powder
1 teaspoon ground sage
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1 teaspoon pepper
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon onion salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 tablespoons Accent ( MSG )
GFC mix
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp mustard powder
1 tsp sage
1 tsp celery seeds
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp dried onion flakes
2 tsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp ground white pepper
I 'm not going to lie to you .
If your paper gives you moral carte blanche to wolf it down in the name of research , and when it 's hot and fresh from the bucket , KFC is gorgeous .
I have n't eaten chain fast food for a long time and the combined hit of chicken , fat and flavour was disorientatingly powerful .
It 's the sort of comprehensive sensory seeing - to that 's both best and worst about drink , drugs and sex .
So very good and so very bad .
No wonder teenagers live on this stuff .
But trying to apply any kind of critical approach to the flavour was surprisingly hard .
I can't tell you what that famous mixture of 11 secret herbs and spices actually tastes of , because I could n't distinguish any particular flavours amid the assault .
Cooking from scratch enables us to do two things that the Colonel can't : use great chicken and drain the grease more efficiently .
This gave us a real head start , and the results were stunning .
A single bite of the homemade KFC is enough .
It 's like biting into a dew - fresh ripe peach after eating a canned one .
It 's obviously the same thing but an order of magnitude better .
As before , none of the flavours predominated enough to be identifiable but , having made up the mix from scratch , we now know the secret .
Herbs and spices be damned , that staggering , mouthfilling , umami facepunch of a flavour is down to the two tablespoonfuls of MSG .
GFC , our own mix , was very , very good .
Nice flavours , well chosen and matched .
It 's refined , elegant and I 'd proudly serve it at a family picnic .
An elegant Southern church lady would gladly remove a cotton glove to pick up an MSG - free GFC drumstick .
She would compliment us on our British reserve , our eccentric quirkiness and our general pluck , but as far as stimulating the senses goes , she 'd politely opine , " why , it 's like comparing iced tea and crystal meth " .
A View on Buddhism
LACK OF SELF - CONFIDENCE
" Self - confidence is not a feeling of superiority , but of independence . "
Lama Yeshe
" Self - confidence is knowing that we have the capacity to do something good
and firmly decide not to give up . "
His Holiness the Dalai Lama
PSYCHOLOGY
Lack of self - confidence or low self - esteem is not directly defined in the Buddhist tradition , but it would certainly be classified as a negative emotion or delusion , as it exaggerates one 's limitations in capacity , quality and potential for growth .
Briefly put , every sentient being has the potential to become a fully perfected Buddha , if one does not understand this , one is deluded in this respect .
Lack of self - confidence can be made up of several different aspects like : guilt , anger turned inward , unrealistic expectations of perfection , false sense of humility , fear of change or making mistakes , depression etc .
Depression can actually also be a result of a lack of self - confidence .
( See also the page on Depression . )
From " The Art of Happiness at Work " by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler , M.D .
" ... to have greater self - awareness or understanding means to have a better grasp of reality .
Now , the opposite of reality is to project onto yourself qualities that are not there , ascribe to yourself characteristics in contrast to what is actually the case .
For example , when you have a distorted view of yourself , such as through excessive pride or arrogance , because of these states of mind , you have an exaggerated sense of your qualities and personal abilities .
Your view of your own abilities goes far beyond your actual abilities .
On the other hand , when you have low self - esteem , then you underestimate your actual qualities and abilities .
You belittle yourself , you put yourself down .
This leads to a complete loss of faith in yourself .
So excess -- both in terms of exaggeration and devaluation -- are equally destructive .
lt is by addressing these obstacles and by constantly examining your personal character , qualities , and abilities , that you can learn to have greater self - understanding .
This is the way to become more self - aware . "
A view from Shantideva :
" Self - confidence should be applied to wholesome actions ,
Overcoming of delusions and my ability to overcome them .
Thinking , ' I alone shall do it '
Is the self - confidence of action . "
P.J. Saher writes in ' Zen - Yoga ' :
" Courage in an untrained mind leads to cruelty , and in a trained mind it leads to hope and compassion . "
Specifically in the Mahayana tradition of wishing to lead all sentient beings to enlightenment , it is important to have a healthy amount of self - confidence , self - esteem and self - respect to bring this vast task to a good end .
Obviously , overconfidence and pride are at the other side of the scale and to be avoided .
His Holiness the 7th Dalai Lama in ' Songs of spiritual change ' ( translated by Glenn Mullin ) : " Who has magnificent self - confidence
And fears nothing that exists ?
The man who has attained to truth
And lives free of error . "
In my own words : ' If a doctor would only focus on his fear for mistakes , how could he ever heal a patient ? '
Do take a moment to let the next one sink in :
" No one can make you feel inferior without your permission . "
Eleanor Roosevelt .
Not an easy one ; take some time to dig deeper into yourself to answer why you allow others to make you feel inferior ?
Why do n't they feel inferior ?
In Buddhism , in order to be cured from the problems in cyclic existence , we ourselves need to follow the instructions given by the Buddha with regard to the manner and frequency in taking his medicine , his daily diet and other relevant medical restraints .
Likewise , we need to follow the precepts and advice given by the Buddha and control / subdue our greed , hatred and ignorance .
No one can find salvation by simply singing praises of the Buddha or by making offerings to him .
Neither does celebrating festivals in honour of the Buddha , mere prayer or begging lead to enlightenment .
We need to strive hard by controlling our selfish desires and emotions in order to find a permanent solution to our problems .
" Human potential is the same for all .
Your feeling , " I am of no value " , is wrong .
Absolutely wrong .
You are deceiving yourself .
We all have the power of thought - so what are you lacking ?
If you have willpower , then you can change anything .
It is usually said that you are your own master . "
" With the realization of ones own potential and self - confidence in ones ability , one can build a better world .
According to my own experience , self - confidence is very important .
That sort of confidence is not a blind one ; it is an awareness of ones own potential .
On that basis , human beings can transform themselves by increasing the good qualities and reducing the negative qualities . "
Both quotes from His Holiness the Dalai Lama
This is even more so on the Mahayana path ; if we seriously strive to make an end to the suffering of all sentient beings , we can't expect to achieve that by fearfully ' hiding in a corner ' .
Instead , it requires us to take confidence and courage in our own skills , and to work diligently for ourselves and others .
See for an inspiring text , ' the 37 Practices of a Bodhisattva ' , and a commentary on that text by His Holiness the Dalai Lama .
Low self - esteem can actually be categorised as a form of laziness as explained by Ringu Tulku Rinpoche from Daring Steps Toward Fearlessness : The Three Vehicles of Buddhism :
" The Buddhist notion of diligence is to delight in positive deeds .
Its opposite , called le lo in Tibetan , has three aspects .
Le lo is usually translated as " laziness , " though only its first aspect refers to laziness as we usually understand it .
The first aspect is not doing something because of indolence , even though we know that it is good and ought to be done .
The second aspect is faintheartedness .
This comes about when we underestimate our qualities and abilities , thinking , " I 'm so incompetent and weak .
It would be good to do that , but I could never accomplish it . "
Not having the confidence of thinking , " I can do it , " we end up doing nothing .
The third aspect refers to being very busy and seeming diligent , but wasting time and energy on meaningless activities that will not accomplish anything in the long run .
When we do many things for no real purpose , we fail to focus on what is truly worthwhile and our path has no clear direction .
When we refrain from these three aspects of laziness , we are diligent . "
So from this point of view , a lack of self - confidence can be like an excuse for ' not - doing ' when something needs to be done , and is therefore clearly a problematic emotion .
Or , as Mahatma Gandhi said : " Fearlessness is the first requisite of spirituality .
Cowards can never be moral . ”
It can be difficult to accept others and to accept ourselves .
" I should be better .
I should be something different .
I should have more . "
All of this is conception ; it 's all mental fabrication .
It 's just the mind churning up " shoulds , " " ought tos , " and " supposed tos . "
All this is conceptual rubbish , and yet we believe it .
Part of the solution is to recognize that these thoughts are conceptual rubbish and not reality ; this gives us the mental space not to believe them .
When we stop believing them , it becomes much easier to accept what we are at any given moment , knowing we will change in the next moment .
We 'll be able to accept what others are in one moment , knowing that they will be different in the next moment .
This is good stuff for everyday practice ; it 's very practical .
From How to Free Your Mind : Tara the Liberator by Thubten Chodron .
SOME POSSIBLE SIGNS OF LOW SELF - ESTEEM :
( Note : these are mainly my personal views , not strictly Buddhist )
- Guilt : paralysing form of self - torture ; seeing one 's imperfections and believing improvement is beyond possibilities .
- Scepticism / being over - critical ; unrealistic expectation of perfection , reasoning that , " I am not perfect , so I 'm worthless " .
Scepticism and cynicism are sometimes called " crystallised forms of anger " , and can be detrimental to yourself , as you may only be focussing on faults of yourself , and rarely allow yourself to enjoy good things .
In cynicism , the fear and distrust are taken one step further , thinking , " They are imperfect , they are worthless " .
- Unforgiving : unrealistic expectation of perfection , reasoning that " People should be perfect , I and others are not perfect , and no one can be forgiven for not being perfect . "
- " I could never do this , I can only ... " : focus on my own limits rather than on my possibilities for growth and improvement .
" I am not perfect " may be very true , but is that not the best possible reason for trying to improve oneself in a disciplined manner by being positive and helping others ?
- Self - shame : keeping secrets about oneself : " I am disgusting , strange , weird , stupid , ugly " .
This creates a negative spiral , " others never talk about it , so I must be really weird " ; based on the delusion : " I should be perfect , because others are " .
- Pride : if one is genuinely self - confident , there is no need for pride ; only an empty balloon can be ' blown up ' .
It is based on the unrealistic view : " Others should be perfect and are not , but I am better " .
To cover up their own insecurity , a fair amount of people act out pride , as if they are better than others , but only because they lack self - confidence .
- Improper humility : not regarding oneself as equal to others , but less than others .
Humility is a positive quality as it avoids pride and is other - centered , often driven by active compassion for others .
Lack of self - confidence however , is often self - centred ( feeling sorry for oneself and looking for excuses to not change your own situation ) and paralyses you from doing positive actions .
In fact , this kind of false humility is categorised under pride .
- Idolising people : overestimating others is based on - or will easily lead to - underestimating oneself , see improper humility .
- Fear , uncertainty to : make mistakes , be abnormal , not be liked , change , be hurt or of responsibility .
Fear closes the heart and mind off from the outside ; leaving you alone !
Based on the misunderstanding : " I should be perfect " , which is simply unrealistic .
- Acting to be a perfect person instead of being myself : if I am self - confident , I do n't need to behave like someone else ; see pride .
Instead of leading to praise , others may easily pierce through the facade and uncover my acting .
His Holiness the 7th Dalai Lama in ' Songs of spiritual change ' ( translated by Glenn Mullin ) :
" What is like a smelly fart , that , although invisible , is obvious ?
One 's own faults , that are precisely as obvious as the effort made to hide them .
- Feeling : " the world is a bad place " ; note that the world is often a mirror of what we think of ourselves ; a negative world image and negative self - image can be two sides of the same coin ; reflects expectation of an unrealistic perfect world .
The world is neither perfect nor all bad .
- Laziness : ( in Buddhism defined as " being attached to temporary pleasure , not wanting to do virtue or only little " . )
The reason for this kind of laziness could be based on the fear responsibility or making mistakes , based on the unrealistic : " I should be perfect and not make mistakes , so I better do nothing at all " .
- Depression : indulging in self - pity , closed - heartedness : based on " I am not perfect and therefore pitiful " .
- Lack of trust in others ; when you never open your heart to others , it is hard for them to open their hearts to you .
Without this openness , we are likely to start asking ourselves if we are ' normal ' without getting any feedback .
At the same time , when we do not open our heart to others , they will usually not open their hearts to us .
In that way , we never discover that others struggle with the same problems as we ourselves do .
Real communication will simply prove there is nothing to be ashamed of to begin with - we are all humans .

SOME THOUGHTS ON LOW SELF ESTEEM
His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama :
" One can be deceived by three types of laziness :
of indolence , which is the wish to procrastinate ;
the laziness of inferiority , which is doubting your capabilities ;
and the laziness that is attachment to negative actions , or putting great effort into non-virtue . "
A remark of late Lama Yeshe :
" We have to understand the middle path : that a human has a positive and a negative side .
We have a false , ignorant side , but we also have a beautiful potential - Buddha nature . "
Question :
If we have committed a serious negative act , how can we let go of the feeling of guilt that may follow ?
Answer by His Holiness the Dalai Lama :
" In such situations , where there is a danger of feeling guilty and therefore depressed , the Buddhist point of view advises adopting certain ways of thinking and behaving which will enable you to recover your self - confidence .
A Buddhist may reflect on the nature of the mind , on its essential purity , and in what way disturbing thoughts and their subsequent emotions are of an entirely different nature .
Because such disturbing emotions are adventitious , they can be eliminated .
To think of the immense well of potential hidden deep within our being , to understand that the nature of the mind is fundamental purity and kindness and to meditate on its luminosity , will enable you to develop self - confidence and courage .
The Buddha says in the Sutras that fully enlightened and omniscient beings , whom we consider to be superior , did not spring from the bowels of the earth , nor did they fall from the sky ; they are the result of spiritual purification .
Such beings were once as troubled as we are now , with the same weaknesses and flaws of ordinary beings .
Shakyamuni Buddha himself , prior to his enlightenment , lived in other incarnations that were far more difficult than our present lives .
To recognize , in all its majesty , our own potential for spiritual perfection is an antidote to guilt , disgust , and hopelessness .
Nagarjuna says in " The Precious Garland of Advice for the King " that pessimism and depression never help in finding a good solution to any problem .
On the other hand , arrogance is just as negative .
But to present as an antidote to it a posture of extreme humility may tend to foster a lack of self - confidence and open the door to depression and discouragement .
We would only go from one extreme to the other .
I would like to point out that to set out on a retreat for three years full of hope and expectations , thinking that without the slightest difficulty you will come out of it fully enlightened , can turn into a disaster , unless you undertake it with the most serious intentions .
If you overestimate your expectations and have too much self - confidence , you will be headed for dissatisfaction and disillusionment .
When you think of what the Buddha said - that perfect enlightenment is the result of spiritual purification and an accumulation of virtues and wisdom for eons and eons - it is certain that courage and perseverance will arise to accompany you on the path . "
12 - year old Kelly Lin ( from the Sokai Gakkai site ) :
" I think that self - confidence is very important .
If you have low self - esteem , you will not dream up goals because you will think that it is impossible to reach them .
Without goals , however , life would be meaningless and boring .
Having a goal is like putting an apple in front of a horse , to make it move forward .
Each time you reach your goal , your self - confidence grows stronger and you are encouraged to set a new goal .
Each time you accomplish something you set out to do , you get a good feeling .
This feeling cannot be taken away from you .
You do n't feel good because you are better than someone else ; you feel good because of personal achievement .
After you have reached a goal , you must continue to set goals in order to move forward in life .
Why stop when you have nothing to stop you ?
The Buddha does not decide if you will be successful in life ; you decide whether or not you will achieve your goals .
No one can guarantee that you will have a good life , but many people can help by inspiring you , putting some sense into you or getting you on the right track .
The Buddha is a role model for many people .
You can look up to him and try to be like him . "
Zen Master Linji , as translated by Thomas Cleary ( Note that this original statement is from the ninth century ! )
" What I point out to you is only that you should n't allow yourselves to be confused by others .
Act when you need to , without further hesitation or doubt .
People today can't do this ... what is the affliction ?
Their affliction is their lack of self - confidence .
If you do not spontaneously trust yourself sufficiently , you will be in a frantic state , pursuing all sorts of objects , unable to be independent . "
- We can only learn by admitting we do n't know everything yet , we can only grow if we accept that we are not perfect , just like everyone else around us .
- Be light , humorous , eager to learn , courageous to change and not afraid of making mistakes .
- Emotionally beating yourself up is not helping yourself or the world ; it does not change the past , nor does it change the future ; it only makes the present miserable .
Venerable K. Sri Dhammananda Maha
Thera :
Do It Yourself
Self confidence plays an important part in every aspect of man 's life .
Knowing that no external sources , no faith or rituals can save him , the Buddhist feels the need to rely on his own efforts .
He gains confidence through self - reliance .
He realizes that the whole responsibility of his present life as well as his future life depends completely on himself alone .
Each must seek salvation for himself .
Achieving salvation can be compared to curing a disease : if one is ill , one must go to a doctor .
The doctor diagnose the ailment and prescribes medicine .
The medicine must be taken by the person himself .
He can not depute someone else to take the medicine for him .
No one can be cured by simply admiring the medicine or just praising the doctor for his good prescription .
In order to be cured , he himself must faithfully follow the instructions given by the doctor with regard to the manner and frequency in taking his medicine , his daily diet and other relevant medical restraints .
Likewise , a person must follow the precepts , instructions or advice given by the Buddha ( who gives prescriptions for liberation ) by controlling or subduing one 's greed , hatred and ignorance .
No one can find salvation by simply singing praises of the Buddha or by making offerings to Him .
Neither can one find salvation by celebrating certain important occasions in honour of the Buddha .
Buddhism is not a religion where people can attain salvation by mere prayer or begging to be saved .
They must strive hard by controlling their selfish desires and emotions in order to gain salvation .
From ' Love & Compassion ' by His Holiness the Dalai Lama :
Compassion Helps Communication .
Compassion also brings us an inner strength .
Once it is developed , it naturally opens an inner door , through which we can communicate with fellow human beings , and even other sentient beings , with ease , and heart to heart .
On the other hand , if you feel hatred and ill feeling towards others , they may feel similarly toward you , and as a result , suspicion and fear will create a distance between you and make communication difficult .
You will then feel lonely and isolated .
Not all members of your community will have similar negative feelings toward you , but some may look on you negatively because of your own feeling .
If you harbour negative feelings toward others and yet expect them to be friendly to you , you are being illogical .
If you want the atmosphere around you to be more friendly , and must first create the basis for that .
Whether the response of others is positive or negative , you must first create the ground of friendliness .
If others respond to you negatively after this , then you have the right to act accordingly .
His Holiness the Dalai Lama from ' Dzogchen '
The path to genuine co-operation is again through sincere compassion and love .
Sometimes we misunderstand compassion as being nothing more than a feeling of pity .
Compassion is much , much more .
It embraces not only a feeling of closeness , but also a sense of responsibility .
When you develop compassion , it will help you enormously to generate inner strength and self - confidence , and to reduce your feelings of fear and insecurity .
So compassion and love , embodied in an attitude of altruism , are qualities that are of tremendous importance for the individual , as well as for society and the community at large .

SOME ANTIDOTES TO LACK OF SELF - CONFIDENCE
- Find the courage to really open your heart to someone ; self - confidence is deeply related to trusting others .
Our deepest secrets are often not as hidden to others as we may think , or simply so common in the experience of others , that there is actually nothing special about them .
We often consider ourselves very special , and forget that all the others around us are just as human as we ourselves are .
- Try reality checks with others , and do not tell yourself that , " he / she is lying when saying that I am a nice person " - this is actually quite a negative attitude to people , as you assume they are lying ...
- Practice compassion and loving - kindness to others , also if they do not immediately react positive .
- Analyse reality to discover that " life is not perfect , I am not perfect ( yet ) , and neither are other people " .
- Try hard to give up unrealistic expectations of needing to be perfect right now , then forgiving and having compassion for yourself becomes possible .
- Be realistic : I am just as much a human than others ( equanimity ) , are they really that much better ?
- Study and meditate on the Noble Truth of Suffering , realising that if you do not take any action , nothing will ever improve .
- To overcome frustration afterwards , try to act when negative situations can be changed , better to have no success than never having tried .
What is there to loose , really ?
- Meditate on your potential ; unveiling your Buddha nature
- Meditate on purification ; this may make your potential clear .
- Meditate on impermanence : everything changes , even my bad " I " will change for the better !
- Meditate on karma : the only way that things will get better is to do something positive .
- Meditate on emptiness ; the ultimate antidote to all delusions .
- Try taking some precepts / vows to build your self - esteem , or simply any positive commitment to yourself which you are certain you will manage to keep .
- Dare to laugh at yourself and the world !
" Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers ,
but to be fearless in facing them .
Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain ,
but for the heart to conquer it .
Let me not crave in anxious fear to be saved ,
but for the patience to win my freedom . "
Shantideva
A few thoughts as examples of what you could reflect upon during a meditation session on self - confidence :
- If I can not accept myself as being human , how can I ever accept and trust others ?
If I can not accept and trust others , how can I respect and love them ?
If I can not respect and love others , how can they respect and love me ?
- Spirituality is going beyond our self and self - interested focussing , it requires courage , independence , faith in our own potential as a human being , even our potential to become a Buddha , and peace of mind .
Note that these aspects all refer in some way to self - confidence and self acceptance .
- By falling over and getting up many times , children learn that walking is possible .
In judo , falling many times teaches you to fall without pain ; we cannot always avoid falling , but we can often learn to avoid the pain !
- Self - confidence comes from being challenged to one 's limits , meeting them and then setting new limits .
- If I let the fear of making mistakes control my life , I could not do anything at all but lead a completely useless life , is that not something to be very afraid of ?
- Perhaps the following prayer can be a powerful motivation as well as dedication for any ( meditation ) practice : " May I become at all times , both now and forever
A protector for those without protection
A guide for those who have lost their way
A ship for those with oceans to cross
A bridge for those with rivers to cross
A sanctuary for those in danger
A lamp for those without light
A place of refuge for those who lack shelter
And a servant to all in need . "
His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama

" Early on , when our research appeared as if there would be a negative impact on lung health , I was opposed to legalization because I thought it would lead to increased use and that would lead to increased health effects , " Tashkin says .
" But at this point , I 'd be in favor of legalization .
I would n't encourage anybody to smoke any substances .
But I do n't think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance .
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm .
And in terms of an intoxicant , alcohol causes far more harm . "
[ McClatchy ]
UCLA 's Tashkin studied heavy marijuana smokers to determine whether the use led to increased risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or COPD .
He hypothesized that there would be a definitive link between cancer and marijuana smoking , but the results proved otherwise .
" What we found instead was no association and even a suggestion of some protective effect , " says Tashkin , whose research was the largest case - control study ever conducted .
For 30 years , Donald Tashkin has studied the effects of marijuana on lung function .
His work has been funded by the vehemently anti-marijuana National Institute on Drug Abuse , which has long sought to demonstrate that marijuana causes lung cancer .
After 3 decades of anti-drug research , here 's what Tashkin has to say about marijuana laws :
We 've been told a thousand times that marijuana destroys your lungs , that it 's 5 times worse than cigarettes , and on and on .
Yet here is Donald Tashkin , literally the top expert in the world when it comes to marijuana and lung health , telling us it 's time to legalize marijuana .
His views are shaped not by ideology , but rather by the 30 years he spent studying the issue .
He did n't expect the science to come out in favor of marijuana , but that 's what happened and he 's willing to admit it .
Here 's the study that really turned things around : Prejudice against marijuana and smoking in general runs so deep for many people that it just seems inconceivable that marijuana could actually reduce the risk of lung cancer .
But that 's what the data shows and it not only demolishes a major tenet of popular anti-pot propaganda , but also points towards a potentially groundbreaking opportunity to develop cancer cures through marijuana research .
Over and over again , all the bad things we 've been told about marijuana are revealed to be not only false , but often the precise opposite of the truth .
So the next time someone tells you that marijuana is worse for your lungs than cigarettes , you might want to mention that the world 's leading expert on that subject happens to be a supporter of legalization .
Zach Wamp , a fellow Republican , lives with John Ensign in a Christian group house on Capitol Hill 's C Street .
GOP stays neutral on Ensign 's future
Rep. Zach Wamp took a $ 5,000 campaign contribution from Sen. John Ensign — a fellow Republican and fellow resident of a Capitol Hill Christian fellowship house — eight days after Ensign admitted publicly that he ’d had an affair with a former staffer .
The contribution , from Ensign ’s Battle Born PAC to Wamp ’s Tennessee gubernatorial campaign , shows up on Ensign ’s latest FEC filing — and there ’s no indication that Wamp has tried to return it .

Wamp did not respond to questions about the contribution Monday ; his congressional office referred POLITICO to his gubernatorial campaign , and the campaign did not respond to several messages .
Although Wamp and Ensign live together at the C Street Christian group house , Wamp , a Tennessee Republican , has said little about Ensign ’s affair except to suggest that he ’ll abide by the code of silence that covers whatever happens in the home .
Two weeks after taking the $ 5,000 from Ensign , Wamp told the Knoxville News Sentinel : “ I hate it that John Ensign lives in the house and this happened , because it opens up all of these kinds of questions . ”
But , he added , “ I ’m not going to be the guy who goes out and talks . ”
It ’s a common sentiment among Republican lawmakers — and not just the ones who live at C Street .
Since Ensign admitted his affair last month , the surrounding scandal has taken a series of surprising turns : Ensign ’s supporters accused the husband of his former mistress of attempted blackmail ; the husband — himself a former Ensign staffer — accused Ensign of using his job as “ leverage ” to continue the affair ; Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) and former Rep. Steve Largent ( R - Okla . ) admitted knowing about the affair more than a year ago ; and Ensign admitted that his parents had given the family of his former mistress nearly $ 100,000 after she left her job on his campaign staff .
But through it all , one thing has remained constant :
Not a single GOP senator has called on Ensign to resign .
“ I personally do n’t think [ resigning ] is called for , and I leave that situation up to him , ” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn , who has said that Ensign could continue to play a role through fundraising and other matters in the 2010 election , including the race to unseat Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada .
“ I get a sense that the public is less judgmental than perhaps they have been in the past . ”
But the past is n’t so long ago .
When then - Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) was convicted on federal criminal charges in 2008 , a number of GOP leaders — including Ensign — called for his resignation .
Ensign was also on the resignation bandwagon in 2007 , when then - Sen .
Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in a Minneapolis airport men ’s room sting .
Yet when Sen. David Vitter ’s name turned up in the phone book of the alleged “ D.C. madam ” in 2007 , his GOP colleagues refused to push him aside — and he ’s running for reelection now .
So where ’s the line ?
Republican aides note that Stevens and Craig were both convicted of crimes — although Stevens ’s conviction was later reversed and Craig tried to argue after the fact that he ’d pleaded guilty by mistake .
Charles Moran , a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans , said that the “ outrage is stronger for homosexual conduct . ”
Craig faced resignation calls from his colleagues after allegedly soliciting sex from a man ; Ensign and Republican South Carolina Gov.
Mark Sanford seem poised to survive having admitted to affairs with women , and Vitter has survived being linked to a female prostitution ring .
“ Do people in the party look at it another way ?
Absolutely , ” Moran said .
“ It ’s a symptom of a larger problem of the Republican Party ” that turns away gays and lesbians , he added .
But former Rep. Mark Foley ( R - Fla . ) — who resigned in 2006 after ABC News confronted him with lewd messages he ’d sent to male pages — told POLITICO Monday that “ every situation is different . ”
One big variable : the proximity to the next Election Day .
Stevens was convicted just days before the 2008 election , and the Foley scandal dominated the news just weeks before the 2006 midterms .
“ Everything was circumstantial , ” Foley said Monday .
“ With the timing , there was a clear concern from the members , [ who were ] hearing rumors and innuendos . ”
A former Stevens aide said Monday that the approaching election made it politically convenient for top Republicans — including those on the party ’s presidential ticket — to throw Stevens under the bus .
“ I think in Stevens ’s case , the calls for his resignation were a product of election - year politics , ” the aide said .
“ If Ensign ’s or Vitter ’s scandals had become public so close to an election , I think you would have seen a similar backlash among their colleagues . ”
With the next election more than a year off , GOP senators may figure they can ride out the Ensign affair .
While they ’re not exactly embracing their Nevada colleague , they ’re not attacking him , either .
Asked whether Ensign can rebound , Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander , No. 3 in Senate Republican leadership , said : “ That ’s between John Ensign and his family and the people of Nevada . ”
On Monday , the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the FBI to launch an investigation into whether Ensign made improper severance payments to his former mistress , Cynthia Hampton .
Ensign ’s admission that his parents gave Hampton ’s family some $ 96,000 as gifts has raised questions as to whether he tried to buy the family ’s silence .
Ensign ’s lawyer has said that “ the gifts are consistent with a pattern of generosity by the Ensign family to the Hampton family and others . ”
“ All that is a cause of concern , but I ’m his friend , ” said Sen .
Sam Brownback , a conservative Republican running for Kansas governor .
“ He ’s admitted to doing some awful things in his own estimation , and I agree with him confessing that and putting that out in the public .
But that does n’t change that we ’re friends . ”
Twitter allows users to post status updates in 140 charachters or less A tenant who used the micro-blogging service Twitter to complain about mould in her Chicago apartment is being sued .
Horizon Group Management filed a lawsuit that has accused Amanda Bonnen of defaming the company with her tweet .
She sent out a message that said " Who said sleeping in a mouldy apartment was bad for you ?
Horizon realty thinks it 's okay . "
" The statements are obviously false , and it's our intention to prove that , " said Horizon 's Jeffrey Michael .
Mr Michael , whose family has run the company for the last quarter of a century , told the Chicago Sun -Times that while Ms Bonnen recently moved out , he never had a conversation about the post and never asked her to take it down .
" We 're a sue first , ask questions later kind of an organisation , " Mr Michael told the paper .
In a press statement the company later apologised for its " tongue in cheek comments " and stated that " no mould was ever found in her ( Ms Bonnen 's ) unit and was one of several that experienced an overnight leak during roof repairs in late March 2009 .
" Ultimately , all tenant grievances were quickly and amicably resolved , except Ms Bonnen's , " said the statement .
Horizon has claimed the tweet was " published throughout the world " and has severely damaged its good name .
The company 's lawsuit is seeking damages of $ 50,000 ( £ 30,900 ) for the tweet that was posted in May .
Ms Bonnen , who had just 20 followers on Twitter at the time , has been unavailable to comment on the lawsuit .
Her Twitter account has now been deleted .
" Free speech "
The blogosphere has been very vocal about the lawsuit .
Marian Wang of ChicagoNow.com asked " What IS a tweet anyway ?
Is it really considered publishing ?
Is it a conversation between friends in a public forum , like the electronic version of a coffee shop , where you can gripe privately but have your gripes overheard ? "
The issue of the lawsuit was a major topic of discussion among users Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal 's Law Blog wondered if what Ms Bonnen tweeted was " the shortest allegedly defamatory statement in history ? "
" There should be a television game show , we think , in which contestants vie to see who can defame someone , an audience member in fewer words .
( " I can defame that man in seven words Alex ! " ) " wrote the Journal 's Ashby Jones .
Other bloggers commented that by initiating a lawsuit , Horizon has given the issue the oxygen of publicity .
" If the public did n't read Amanda Bonnen 's Twitter feed before , they will now , thanks to a defamation lawsuit brought against her by Horizon Group Management in Chicago , " said Meg Marco of the Consumerist.com .
The social media blog Mashable agreed .
" We 're pretty sure Horizon Realty lost a lot more than $ 50,000 from this Twitter backlash , " said associate editor Ben Parr .
On Twitter the comments have ranged from " Oh shizzles !!
Amanda Bonnen 's page got deleted !!
And I was going to follow her " to " I wanna FOLLOW Amanda Bonnen " and from " Twitter is free speech and that should be protected " to " We should donate a dollar to Amanda Bonnen for each tweet on this . "

VANCOUVER – A 3 - year - old boy was unhurt and apparently unfazed after he floated 12 kilometres down a British Columbia river riding atop his toy truck , police said yesterday .
Demetrius Jones was camping with his family at a popular park near Fort St. John in northeastern British Columbia on Sunday when he wandered off unnoticed and somehow entered the nearby Peace River , RCMP said .
At first , the boy 's parents thought he was playing with other relatives at the campsite .
Police were later alerted and had begun a search when a boater found the boy , and the toy , about 12 kilometres away , floating in three metres of water after a nearly two - hour journey .
Demetrius , who was apparently unaware of the danger he had been in , was taken to hospital for treatment for mild exposure .
A local news report said the boy made sure the boater who found him also retrieved the toy truck .
Michael Schumacher may have shelved his holiday plans but for the rest of the Formula 1 family school is officially out for the summer .
How F1 drivers will be entertaining themselves during the three - week break before the European Grand Prix in Valencia on 23 August is a mind - boggling prospect - luckily The Mole has some answers .
Sun , sea and sand are all out for Kimi Raikkonen and Jenson Button , who are keeping the adrenalin pumping by participating in other sporting contests .
Button is taking part in the London Triathlon on 2 August for his chosen charity the Make A Wish Foundation .
But Frome 's world championship leader is no slouch , he 'll tackle a 1500 m swim , a 40 km bike ride and then a 10 km run - the same distances covered by Olympic athletes .
Raikkonen is sticking to four wheels and will make his World Rally Championship debut in Finland on 31 July .
The Ferrari man will drive an Abarth Grande Punto in front of his home crowd along with co-driver Kaj Lindstrom , who used to partner four - times world rally champion Tommi Makinen .
Regardless of how Raikkonen gets on over the Finnish gravel , the 2007 world champion is not ruling out trying to become the first driver to capture both the F1 and WRC crowns some time in the future .
" I 'm too young to stop driving , so even if I do stop in F1 , I have to do something else , " says the 29 - year - old .
Jarno Trulli is heading back to Italy to continue his fundraising campaign for those affected by April 's earthquake which claimed nearly 300 lives .
The Toyota driver will pay a visit to his home region of Abruzzo , where the quakes hit , before spending time with his family .
McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen is also homeward bound to north Finland while Red Bull 's Mark Webber , whose maiden F1 victory this month is to be commemorated on a stamp in his home country of Australia , is off to his pad in the south of France .
Lewis Hamilton , however , is keeping one eye on his day job after claiming his first win of the season at the Hungarian GP .
McLaren 's reigning world champion lives in Switzerland and says : " I will relax a little bit , spend some time with the missus ( Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger ) and with the family .
" Hopefully I 'll come will come back to Valencia with another step forward and another opportunity to get onto the podium . "
Button 's Brawn team - mate Rubens Barrichello had considered staying in Hungary to be close to friend and fellow F1 driver Felipe Massa , who is recovering in a Budapest hospital after crashing during qualifying .
Massa is said to be progressing well after surgery on his fractured skull , sustained after a spring from Barrichello 's car struck his helmet just above his left eye .
But following Massa 's improvement , Barrichello has returned to his family holiday in the United States before his two sons go back to school .
It 's not only the drivers who are having a holiday , for the first time the teams have all agreed to an enforced fortnight off for the main body of their F1 staff .
The 10 teams on the grid have signed a legally - binding agreement not to work on their car development or production for two weeks out of the next three .
" It 's a well - deserved respite for the guys , " reckons Red Bull boss Christian Horner .
" We can't keep pushing them at the rate they are going . "
The agreement wo n't be formally policed and McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh says : " There will doubtless be a few rumours and speculation of people being in breach but I think there 's a sincere attempt by everyone to honour it . "
Not everyone , however , is so keen on the idea , which aims to cut costs .
" It 's a complete waste of time , " said Williams chief executive Adam Parr .
" We went along with it because a number of people were very keen on it .
But it will increase our costs , it wo n't reduce them . "
Oh well , at least most people in F1 wo n't be spending the next three weeks battling through a gruelling training regime .
Just you on that one , Herr Schumacher .
Grayson grills
Fed chairman on destination of credit swaps
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , July 22 , 2009
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke was confronted yesterday by Congressman Alan Grayson about which foreign banks were the recipients of Federal Reserve credit swaps , but he was unable to provide an answer as to where over half a trillion dollars had gone .
Asked which European financial institutions received the money , which was handed out by The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , a component of the Federal Reserve System , Bernanke responded , “ I do n’t know . ”
“ Half a trillion dollars and you do n’t know who got the money ? ” asked Grayson .
As we have previously reported , the destination of trillions in bailout funds remains hidden after the Fed refused to disclose where it had gone despite a lawsuit filed by Bloomberg .
Bernanke said the Fed had a “ long standing legal authority ” to hand money to foreign banks under section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act , a claim contradicted by Bernanke ’s own report , as Grayson soon highlighted .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Grayson said that he had investigated one of the arrangements , a $ 9 billion dollar package to New Zealand , which works out at $ 3000 dollars for every citizen of New Zealand .
“ Seriously , would n’t it have been better to extend that kind of credit to Americans rather than New Zealanders , ” said Grayson .
The Congressman then implied that handing money to foreign institutions was unconstitutional , reading from Article I , “ No money shall be drawn from the treasury , but in consequence of appropriations made by law . ”
“ Do you think it ’s in the spirit of the Constitution for a group like the FOMC to hand out a half a trillion dollars to foreigners without any action by this Congress ? ” asked Grayson , to which Bernanke responded that Congress had approved it with the Federal Reserve act of 1913 .
Grayson responded that in 1913 , the entire GDP of the U.S. was well under half a trillion dollars .
“ Is it safe to say that nobody in 1913 contemplated that a small little group of people would decide to hand out half a trillion dollars to foreigners ? , ” asked Grayson , to which Bernanke again claimed that the authority had been used numerous times before .
Grayson debunked this claim by pointing to Bernanke ’s own report , which stated that the entire amount had been handed out starting from the last quarter of 2007 , and the amount given out before that to foreign banks was zero .

Having witnessed the anarchy , chaos and lack of leadership that has engulfed the state Capitol during the past month , I have a painful confession to make .
After three decades as a journalist covering state government , if I had to do it all over again , I ’d find another job .
I ’ve covered Govs. Hugh Carey , Mario Cuomo , George Pataki , Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson and for New York to wind up like this after 35 years of modern leadership , it ’s clear to me that my real job has been to chronicle the devolution — the decay and decline — of New York state .
We ’re going backwards , not forwards , and of late we ’ve even been falling apart .
The Empire State — once a beacon of progressive state government to the nation — is on the brink of ruin .
And it does n’t look like anything can be done to stop it .
In two words :
We ’re doomed .
Hapless Gov. Paterson and the street - fighting leaders of the state Senate have , as everyone knows , turned state government into a national laughingstock .
Within the Capitol itself , where knowledge of the disaster is more acute , the assessments are far harsher and more personally painful .
They are disbelief , disgust , and even despair .
I ’ve had a dozen low - to mid-level staffers — hallway cleaners , messengers , guards , sergeants at arms , researchers , and lawyers — buttonhole me in recent days and , in a hushed voice , make comments such as , “ I ’m ashamed to work here , ” “ I ’ve given my life for this ? ” and “ I feel like I work for morons . ”
The GOP - led Senate coup attempt that began June 8 has paralyzed state government and transformed a Senate once known for a gentility and friendliness rooted in a rural upstate sensibility into a frighteningly unrecognizable doppelganger of the fisticuffs - prone South Korean parliament .
Under the Democratic control that began in January , the Senate ’s traditional civility gave way to a crude , rude , nasty and thuggish style that has long associated with late - night New York City community board meetings , or some outer borough Democratic caucuses .
The failed coup attempt has made it worse and the Senate today stands as not just a house divided between the two major parties but as a house divided within one of the major parties as three separate Democratic factions angrily and nastily battle for control .
The most glaring example of the thug - like behavior occurred on the Senate floor Wednesday as several burly , thick - necked men suddenly began flanking the podium in an apparent attempt by Democrats , who claim to control of the chamber , to block Republicans from rushing up .
The move was shocking because the Senate already has several professionally trained and experienced sergeants at arms , many retired state troopers , who do a fine job keeping order .
Several Democratic senators including Pedro Espada of the Bronx , John Sampson of Brooklyn and Malcolm Smith of Queens have also appeared with bullish bodyguards and other “ body men ” for the first time ever .
One Democratic faction , loyal to Sampson , has begun spying on members of the faction loyal Smith , and even preparing reports on their activities .
Journalists like myself have always been granted free access to the Senate but two weeks ago Democrats sought to bar journalists from the chamber , only backing down in the face of the protests from several angry scribes .
During the long years of Republican control , the all - white GOP “ conference ” would regularly bemoan its lack of diversity , and make extra efforts to recruit minority Senate candidates and hire minority staff .
During the first five months of this year , with the Senate under the control of its first African - American majority leader , Smith , top Democrats bemoaned the lack of minority Senate staffers .
But instead of trying to recruit new hires , they fired nearly 200 almost exclusively white workers and replaced them with a large number of minority employees , many of whom were seen by their fellow workers to be unskilled at their new jobs .
The move produced severe racial tensions , made worse by the fact that , as a high - level Democratic staffer confided , “ We ’ve been told to only hire minorities . ”
We have an accidental governor widely seen as weak and irrelevant and , in recent days , he ’s become a latter - day Chicken Little issuing false warnings of disaster as the June 30 deadline approached for the expiration of mayoral control of city schools .
Even members of his own Democratic Party did n’t take the deadline serious and when it passed , no one could tell the difference .
Paterson has been publicly insulted in recent days by his fellow Democrats in a way no other governor ever was in recorded history , and he ’s refused to respond .
We saw the governor do flip - flops right before our eyes on a key issue related to the Senate dispute , confirming the now - common belief that his stands merely mirror the views of the last person he speaks with .
I first came to New York ’s magnificent Capitol building in the wake of the state ’s fiscal crisis in 1977 , when Carey , a World War II battle hero , was still winning plaudits for rescuing the city and state from the fiscal crisis .
The scrappy Carey was considered a national class political figure — as befitted a state that had produced other national class 20th century governors such as Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt , Al Smith , Tom Dewey , Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller .
Mario Cuomo , whose fame as an intellect and great orator spread nationally , followed Carey .
Republican Pataki promised sweeping reforms but quickly retreated in the face of a resistant Legislature and powerful special interests .
After 12 years of Pataki , New Yorkers yearned for change , which is why Spitzer ’s colossal political and moral failures were such a tragedy .
Paterson , Spitzer ’s unexpected successor , talked like a reformer when he took office in March 2008 , but his collapse as a leader has been so sweeping as to be unlike anything seen in the history of New York .
He ’s now the least popular governor in the United States .
Is any more proof needed that New York has gone down the drain ?

As the industry went from boom to bust , companies that had been completely focused on recruiting were reluctant to cut staff - even as customers abandoned them .
Philip Toledano
With all the talk about the deaths of various industries -- from the car companies to newspapers to mortgage brokers -- I 'm reminded of the time that my industry abruptly died on me .
It 's been more than a decade , so it 's easy to forget just how exciting the early days of the Web were .
I first caught the bug in the mid-1990s , when I came across a programmer named Philip Greenspun -- a man who was truly ahead of his time .
Along with five of his friends , Greenspun had started a Web development company , ArsDigita , at the beginning of the dot - com boom .
And long before blogs , Facebook , and oversharing online became endemic , Greenspun maintained a personal website on which he did something astonishing : Greenspun shared the whole story of the company he was building , live , as it happened .
Everything from the big vision to the technical details .
Eventually , these essays formed the basis of a book , Philip and Alex 's Guide to Web Publishing .
( The " Alex " in the title was Greenspun 's dog , a huge white Samoyed . )
The final chapter of the book was titled " A Future So Bright You 'll Need to Wear Sunglasses . "
( You can read it , for free , at philip.greenspun.com . )
It could n't help leaving its readers excited about the fantastic new opportunities available on the Internet .
Every single industry was going to be turned upside down !
New industries would be created !
Start - ups would make people rich !
Which is really nice , because it 's awesome to be rich !
And , bonus :
It 'll never be winter again !
For programmers like me , this was extremely heady stuff , because it meant that , for the first time , we might not be relegated to tasks such as fixing the code on mainframe accounting software .
We would have a new job -- designing and building the future itself !
By 1999 , everyone I knew was starting an Internet company .
The industry magazines ( Upside , Red Herring , and The Industry Standard ) had so many dot - com advertisers that each issue weighed a ton .
And these same magazines profiled some of the stupidest companies I had ever seen , led by kids who were , often as not , entirely incompetent .
( All - time stupidest company : CueCat .
Google it . )
My theory was that if I could start a company and be only partially incompetent instead of entirely incompetent , I would be ahead of the game .
By this time , Greenspun 's company had more clients than it could handle and was hiring like mad , and ArsDigita was n't even the most successful company following this template .
There were hundreds of similar Web consulting companies , including a few giant ones .
You may remember the names : Razorfish , Scient , Viant , iXL , USWeb , and on and on .
Many had wildly successful IPOs , which was perhaps the first indication of trouble .
The immediate problem all those consultancies faced in 1999 and 2000 was that , like ArsDigita , they could n't find enough great software developers to handle all the new business they were bringing in , so they had to turn away clients .
A company I knew of actually auditioned for a chance to hire Scient and was rejected for , well , just not being cool enough .
Yet , even though the consulting companies ' revenue was directly linked to the number of developers they were able to recruit , most of them still treated their staff like garbage .
They crammed developers shoulder to shoulder at crappy desks , provided them with crappy equipment , and expected them to work crappy hours .
Sure , there might be a foosball table in the corner , and the walls were painted romper - room colors to make the place seem full of energy .
But really , these companies were terrible places to work .
This , I thought , was my opportunity .
If I started a company that treated programmers like talent instead of typists , I would be able to hire the best and the brightest .
I had some theories on how to do this and , following Greenspun 's example , started writing them up and posting them on the Internet for anyone to see .
And then , I came up with what I thought was another twist .
The Web consulting business was great , but it had one problem : limited margins .
You could charge only so much for an hour of some consultant 's time -- in those days , maybe $ 200 .
Some of that went to overhead ( say $ 20 ) and some to pay the consultant 's salary ( maybe $ 70 ) .
That leaves you with a mere $ 110 per hour in gross profit .
That 's a lot of money , but it paled in comparison with margins in the software industry , in which you can produce additional copies of an application at virtually no cost .
So this was my business plan :
We 'd start out as a plain - vanilla Web consulting business .
We 'd look for situations in which we had several clients asking for the same basic thing .
Then , using consultants who were n't currently working on gigs , we 'd build an application to suit the group 's needs .
Over time , this product could be licensed far and wide .
Eventually , the software side of the business would eclipse the consulting side of the business .
That was the theory .
Sounds good , right ?
Around March 2000 , which was , not coincidentally , the very peak of the dot - com bubble , I quit my job as a programmer at an Internet service provider to start Fog Creek .
The plan was to spend a few months decompressing and writing the business plan , then take the summer off to spend at the beach .
After Labor Day , I turned in the keys to the rented beach house on Long Island , came back to the city , and started working on Fog Creek with my co-founder , Michael Pryor .
We signed a big client on our very first day in business and quickly hired a pair of programmers .
Almost immediately , clouds began to appear on the horizon -- mushroom clouds , in fact .
Our one big client made it clear it did not plan to renew , and we were n't able to land another lucrative account .
The larger Web consulting companies were struggling , too .
Razorfish 's revenue plummeted from $ 50.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 to $ 11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 .
Meanwhile , at ArsDigita , the VCs who controlled the business pushed out Greenspun and brought in new management .
At first , everybody said that the sales cycle was taking a little longer than usual .
What was really happening was that all the dot -coms that had hired droves of Web consultants were suddenly running out of money .
At the same time , all the Fortune 500 corporations that had also hired droves of Web consultants were deciding they no longer needed to pay snotty 23 - year - olds to tell them that They Just Did n't Get It .
Of course , the Web consultancies had by this time invested heavily in recruiting .
ArsDigita , which peaked at more than 200 employees , went so far as to promise a Ferrari F355 to anyone who could recruit 10 employees .
The prize was never awarded .
So when business started to slip , the only thing these companies did n't do was lay off people .
Which meant that they burned through their reserves like crazy , paying salaries to programmers who sat idle all day .
Within a matter of months , most of these companies went out of business .
One day in May 2001 , Michael and I followed suit .
We laid off our two employees and then caught an afternoon showing of Startup.com , a documentary about a Web start - up that failed after burning through $ 60 million in venture capital .
I did n't feel depressed until the next day , when I went back to work and nobody was there .
Like so many others , our consulting business had gone bust .
Fortunately , we had by that time completed a primitive version of our first software product , FogBugz .
The revenue from software licenses that month was modest :
It amounted to just $ 6,463 .
Our rent was $ 2,697 , and the company 's other expenses totaled $ 2,954 .
That left $ 812 for Michael and me to live on .
But the important thing was that FogBugz sales were increasing , and we had some personal savings , which gave us the confidence to keep at it .
We were lucky .
We started late , and we had n't had a chance to hire very many people yet , so we did n't burn through cash as quickly as others .
And we were fortunate enough to have a software product under development , so that when the Web consulting industry disappeared , we still had money coming in .
Because if you can survive the death of your industry , well , you can survive just about anything .
In the next issue , I 'll tell you how Fog Creek pulled it off .
( CNN ) -- Former Mexican President Vicente
Fox has joined three other ex-leaders of Latin American nations calling for the decriminalization of marijuana .
Former Mexico President Vicente
Fox says it 's time to open the debate on legalizing marijuana .
Fox , who was Mexico 's president from 2000 to 2006 , said the current policy is clearly not working .
" I believe it 's time to open the debate over legalizing drugs , " he told CNN on Tuesday .
" It must be done in conjunction with the United States , but it is time to open the debate . "
He pointed to how the end of Prohibition in the United States in 1933 lessened organized crime violence .
" It ca n't be that the only way is for the state to use force , " he said .

Fox say it 's time to debate legalizing drugs »
Fox was mirroring a position adopted earlier this year by his predecessor as president of Mexico , Ernesto Zedillo , and the former heads of Colombia and Brazil .
The three former chief executives are members of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy .
At a February meeting in Brazil , the commission called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in tactics in the war on drugs .
" The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results , " former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference in which the 17 - member commission 's recommendations were presented .
Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because " you have to start somewhere . "
Zedillo was president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000 .
Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994 .
And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995 to 2002 .
Fox said any change in drug laws must be accompanied by an education campaign in schools and homes .
And because the United States is a large consumer of marijuana that comes from Latin America , any steps toward legalization must be supported in Washington , he said .
Gaviria said in February that the time is right to start a debate on the subject , particularly with the pragmatic openings provided by the election of President Obama .
" In many states in the United States , as is the case in California , they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes .
And in Washington there 's some consensus that the current policy is failing , " Gaviria said .
The call for a change in strategy comes amid a horrific explosion of drug - related violence in Mexico , where officials say 10,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006 .
Calderon said in a speech earlier this year that 6,500 of those deaths occurred in 2008 .
Calderon , who succeeded Fox , ramped up the battle against the nation 's narcotics traffickers and brought in the army to reinforce often ineffective local and state police .
That was a change in tactics from Fox , who said he had chosen to strengthen federal police and intelligence - gathering operations and to create a secretary for public security .
But now that Calderon has chosen a different approach , he must prevail , Fox said in an exclusive interview with CNN .
" If you go to war , you have to win it quickly and according to regulations , " he said .
" Human rights are very important . "
It also is important that the United States " accept its responsibility , " he said .
" I would like to see some steps taken here in the United States .
We see the drugs are coming across the border and are distributed in Atlanta and Washington and Chicago and all parts of the country . "
Fox 's comparison of the current battle to Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s was recently touted by Robert Pastor , who was a Latin America national security adviser for President Carter in the late 1970s .
He called the problem in Mexico " even worse than Chicago during the Prohibition era . "
Pastor said a solution similar to what ended that violence is needed now .
" What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness , " he said , referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in the 1920s and 19'30s .
" It was the repeal of Prohibition . "
Others are not so sure .
" This has become a world of globalization , " said Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia , Mexico 's executive secretary for the National System for Public Safety .
" Globalization has many virtues but some errors .
I can't conceive that one part of the world would decriminalize drugs because it would become a paradise for drug use .
It might bring down violence , but there would be social damage . "

This research addresses the ethical dimensions of robotic weaponry and involves the generation of " an artificial conscience " for an intelligent autonomous robotic agent .
By applying limits and constraints on a robot 's actions as required by the bounds of existing ethical decision - making protocols ( e.g. , the Geneva Convention , rules of engagement , and other ethical and military requirements ) .
In particular , this research investigates the ethical application of lethal force by weaponized robotic systems from an architectural perspective as well as from the perspective of operator - robot interaction .
JERUSALEM , July 14 , 2009  -- Yisrael Katz , Israel 's new right - wing minister of transport , has revealed a plan to change the names of more than 2,500 road signs , doing away with Arabic place names and replacing them with simple translations of Hebrew names .
He says the system needs to be simplified and made clearer for the country 's drivers .
But this is Israel , home to both Jews and Arabs , so the plan has sparked a firestorm of protest and accusations of discrimination against the country 's Arab minority .
" The lack of uniform spelling on signs has been a problem for those speaking foreign languages , citizens and tourists alike , " transport ministry spokesman Yeshaayahu Ronen said .
But angry Arab Israelis accuse the ministry of trying to erase their cultural identity .
Many places inside Israel have two different names , one Arabic , the other Hebrew .
Perhaps the most famous example is Jerusalem itself : it is al - Quds to Arabs , Yerushalayim to Jews .
And , then , there 's historic Nazareth .
Arabs call it al - Nasra , Jews Natsrat .
Up until now , both names have appeared on road signs , a recognition of Israel 's ethnic diversity .
Under the plan , only the Hebrew names would appear , in both languages -- the Arabic version would be a simple transliteration of the Hebrew name .
Arab members of the Israeli parliament were quick to take offence .
Ahmad Tibi from the United Arab List said , " Minister Katz is mistaken if he thinks that changing a few words can erase the existence of the Arab people or their connection to Israel . "
Israel 's Arab community makes up 20 percent of the country 's population and many have long perceived of themselves as second - class citizens .
Tension has grown with the participation in the latest government of the ultra nationalist Jewish party " Israel Our Home , " led by foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman .
He campaigned on a platform of demanding greater loyalty from Israeli Arabs , threatening to remove their citizenship if they refused to swear an oath of allegiance .
Despite threats from Arabs to take the road sign matter to the Supreme Court , the transport ministry claimed the criticism was from a fringe minority only .
Collaborating With ' Palestinian Propaganda '
The minister 's own communications advisor , Barak Sari , said criticism was an " attempt by anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist elements to annul Israel 's identity as a Jewish and democratic state .
Anyone willing to refer to Jerusalem as al - Quds is collaborating with the Palestinian propaganda . "
ASTRONOMERS are claiming that Earth is witnessing the biggest and most powerful sunspot ever seen and the sunspot is yet to peak in intensity .
A sunspot is a magnetic storm on the surface of the sun and the area of the spot is colder than the normal surface .
The normal surface is about 5000 degrees , the temperature of a sunspot is about 3000 degrees .
The size of a sunspot varies , ranging from the size of the moon to 65 times larger than the size of earth and lasts for about a month then fades away .
This newest sunspot is thought to be 60 to 80 times the size of Earth and has occurred on the side of the sun , which is in view of Australia .
Wappa Falls
Observatory head astronomer Owen Bennedick describes the sunspot shape like the letter S and thinks it to be approximately 150,000 km long and 30,000 km wide .
“ It 's flares have not yet been measured , ” Owen Bennedick said , “ but it is like hundreds of thousands of hydrogen bombs . ”
The flares have been so bright that NASA has had trouble taking accurate pictures of the sunspot .
Mr Bennedick said the sunspot is still growing in intensity but predicts it could climax by today .
The sunspot will cause the Earth 's atmosphere to heat up , potentially creating problems to powerlines , radio transmitters and delicate equipment such as mobile phones and computers .
Mr Bennedick suggests powerline filters be installed on computers and people should put on extra sunscreen .
Sunspots appear on the sun in cycles , occurring every 11 years , the current cycle has four years until it reaches it peak .
The last sunspot happened two years ago and was the most powerful flare yet measuring x28 .
Most sunspot flares measure around x12 which is still considered powerful .
The Sunspot two years ago was 45 times larger than the earth and lasted for 45 days .
Since that sunspot , no more had been seen until Sunday , this latest one considered the most powerful yet .
The Wappa Falls Observatory is in the process of installing a new 12 inch telescope which will allow a greater view of the sky .
The new telescope was bought in honour of Kerry Mounter who recently passed away .
Mr Mounter was an inspiration to all who worked at the Wappa Falls Observatory .
The telescope will be dedicated to his memory .

Solar eclipse excites eclipse - chasers
Dragonflies may have hovered and hunted across the planet for the last 325 m years , but their modern relatives are staring extinction in the face .
Experts warn that one - third of British species are now under threat , a plight that today sees the opening of the UK 's first ever dragonfly centre to celebrate and protect one of the country 's most fascinating insects .
Located at Wicken Fen nature reserve in Cambridgeshire , the new centre hopes to reverse the decline of the 42 species found regularly in the UK .
Conservationists blame the decline on the loss of wetlands , and pesticides and insecticides drifting from farmland .
Springwatch presenter Chris Packham , who opened the centre today , said : " The loss of wetland habitat throughout the UK is having a massive impact on the long - term survival prospects for many dragonfly species . "
He warned that three British species have already become extinct since the 1960s .
Dragonflies spend much of their lives underwater as larva " nymphs " , and when the winged adult finally emerges its flying lifetime is comparatively short , ranging from just weeks for small species to a few years for the largest .
They are a key indicator of water quality and a valuable natural predator of mosquitoes and midges .
Some British species are faring worse than others .
White - faced darters have seen a signifcant loss and drying out of the bog pools where they live , while the Norfolk hawker 's limited distribution - mostly in the Norfolk Broads - has left it vulnerable to sea level rises and salt water infiltration .
As well as pressure from the historic loss of East Anglian fens , many of which have been drained and converted to farmland , British dragonflies and their prey are at risk from insecticides and pesticides .
Vicky Kindemba , freshwater officer at conservation charity Buglife , said : " Different chemicals affect invertebates differently , but one we know about is permethrin - used to treat wood and animals to remove fleas and woodworm - which can affect dragonflies when it finds its way into the water course . "
Chemicals reaching rivers and streams from agricultural run-off can disrupt dragonfly breeding patterns - reducing the number of eggs , for example .
There are signs that increasingly conservation - conscious farmers are aware of the problem .
David Felce , who runs Midloe Grange Farm near the site of the new dragonfly centre , said : " We have several types of dragonfly on the farm , including blue emperors and brown hawkers , which we 've protected by building grass buffer zones near our seven ponds and water courses .
As well as acting as a failsafe to keep insecticides away from dragonflies and other insects , the grass is a habitat for wildlife in its own right . "
Dragonflies are doing better this year compared to 2008 , according to anecdotal evidence from naturalists at the British Dragonfly Society .
" We think it 's due to the sustained wet weather during late spring and early summer last year , " said Katharine Parkes , a spokesperson for the society .
" This year , although we 've still had wet weather , it 's been showery rather than sustained , and dragonflies are very good at making the most of sunny intervals . "
However , long - term records are required to establish an accurate picture of dragonfly health , and the data collected by naturalists from 1986 to 2005 shows a third of British species are now classified as endangered , vulnerable or near - threatened under official Red List criteria .
Wicken Fen , where the dragonfly centre opened today , is one of the few bright spots for dragonflies and home to 21 of Britain 's species .
Stuart Warrington , the National Trust 's Nature Conservation Advisor for the East of England , said : " Dragonflies symbolise the importance of Wicken Fen and our ambitious project to create a 22 square mile nature reserve .
Work to develop good quality habitats for dragonflies , such as clean ditches and ponds , has led to successful breeding of all the species found at Wicken and on the land surrounding the fen . "
The new centre , staffed by volunteers , will give visitors access to educational displays , advanced courses on species identification and guided " safaris " to see the fen 's darting inhabitants , from the emperor dragonfly to the hairy dragonfly .
Dragonflies : fast facts
• There are more species in the dragonfly family than there are species of mammals
• The wings of a dragonfly beat at up to 35 times a second
• The insects can fly forwards and backwards at up to 18mph
• The eyes of a dragonfly cover a field of vision close to 360°
• The largest species have been known to fly across the Atlantic Ocean
• Dragonflies do n't sting humans
• This article was amended on 28 July 2009 .
Due to editing changes , the original said that the dragonfly family " has more species than any other mammal " .
This has been corrected .
Why is the Church of the Latter Day Saints ( Mormons ) a viable and vibrant religion ?
Why is the commitment to tithing among its members far greater than any other denomination ?
In the 1990's , I worked for a Mormon company owned by the great grandson of Mormon founder Joseph Smith .
Prior to my position as a time management trainer , I visited Salt Lake City for a week of training .
In the beginning , I felt the environment made Japan look like a " melting pot . "
It seemed homogeneous to a point that everyone looked and acted the same .
Since the vast majority of these people were Mormon , I initially thought the religion was a cult .
As I began to meet a number of coworkers who were Mormon , my perspective began to shift .
These are people of strong fiber with an incredibly deep commitment to do the work of God .
Here is a breakdown of a few of the virtues associated with a Mormon practice :
• Family :
It is not true that a man goes to Utah with one wife and leaves with six .
The Mormons believe strongly in monogamy .
The practice quantity of family ,
It is not unusual to see a Mormon couple with five or six children , regardless of income .
Generally speaking , five or six children is rare in this day and age given economic costs and career demands , More importantly is the quality of family life in Mormon households .
There is an unwritten weekly family night that is devoted exclusively to activities and togetherness .
That is refreshing .
What other religion practices this value ?
• Discipline :
On the professional side , I have observed that Mormons practice self discipline .
There is a values driven approach to tasks , planning and time management .
Spiritually , rigorous involvement begins during the high school years .
Religious training is part of the school day .
In New Jersey , a survey stated that there are 638 students who get religious training , In a Mormon school in Morristown , classes start at 6 AM .
This Spartan approach is unusual given we live in a society attached to self gratification and pleasure .
This training prepares these young people for a life of religious dedication .
• Commitment : Discipline leads to commitment .
It is not an accident that as Brigham Young University ( a Mormon school ) there is less drinking than at any other college in the country .
In addition , many young Mormons make a commitment to do missionary work .
These young people travel nationally and internationally to spread the Mormon religion .
With this kind of zeal and passion , it is easy to see why this religion is so vibrant .
The high rate of tithing is another example of commitment , love and support .
The ability to let go lets in faith and generosity .
Personally , I am not a convert to this religion but citing reasons why the growth is not an accident .
Raised as a Catholic with 12 years of parochial school , I was led to believe that Catholicism is the true religion .
Catholicism is not the only true religion but simply one way to worship God .
The Mormon faith is yet another path to serve God that has become appealing to more people .
Back in 1960 , the CIA hatched a plan to kill Patrice Lumumba by infecting his toothbrush with a deadly disease .
The Congolese leader would brush his teeth and , presto , in a few days or weeks he would be gone .
Around the same time , the CIA ’s Health Alteration Committee -- who thought that name up ? -- sent a monogrammed , poisoned handkerchief to Gen. Abdul Karim Kassem , the leader of Iraq .
And the CIA ’s “ executive action ” unit plotted for years to murder Fidel Castro .
It hired the Mafia to poison his food and tried to give him a diving suit contaminated with Madura foot , a rare tropical disease that starts in the foot and moves upward , slowly destroying the body .
The CIA also considered offing the Cuban leader with an exploding cigar , a poison pen and a seashell that would blow up underwater when he touched it .
Not one of the plots was successful .
Lumumba and Kassem were executed by their foes , and Castro is still alive .
But the plots make clear that the CIA has been licensed to kill for decades .

Congress -- especially congressional Democrats -- was outraged earlier this month when it was disclosed that , apparently on orders from Vice President Dick Cheney , the CIA for eight years concealed from Congress a program to assassinate the leaders of Al Qaeda , starting with Osama bin Laden .
But they should n’t have been surprised that such a plan was being hatched .
The CIA ’s involvement in planning assassinations goes back at least to 1954 , when it prepared a manual for killings as part of a U.S. - run coup against the leftist government of Guatemala .
The 19 - page manual , which was declassified in 1997 , makes chilling reading .
“ The essential point of assassination is the death of the subject , ” it declares , noting that while it “ is possible to kill a man with the bare hands ... the simplest local tools are often much the most efficient means of assassination .
A hammer , ax , wrench , screwdriver , fire poker , kitchen knife , lamp stand or anything hard , heavy and handy will suffice . ”
The agency ’s manual recommends “ the contrived accident ” as the best way to dispose of someone .
“ The most efficient accident ... is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface .
Elevator shafts , stairwells , unscreened windows and bridges will serve . ”
The manual suggests grabbing the victim by the ankles and “ tipping the subject over the edge .
...
Falls before trains or subway cars are usually effective , but require exact timing . ”
The manual goes on to discuss “ blunt weapons , ” noting that “ a hammer can be picked up almost anywhere in the world ” and that baseball bats are also excellent .
The manual explains the best place in the body to stab people or how to bash their skulls in and the pros and cons of rifles , pistols , submachine guns and other weapons .

During the Cold War years , the CIA plotted against eight foreign leaders , five of whom died violently .
The agency ’s role varied in each case .
After the plots were publicized by a Senate committee , President Ford issued an executive order in 1976 barring political assassination .
President Reagan broadened the ban , dropping the word “ political ” and extending the prohibition to include contract killers as well as government employees .
Although the ban remains in effect , it has largely been ignored on the premise that it does not apply in a military setting .
Consider the following :
In 1986 , Reagan ordered the bombing of Libya in retaliation for a terrorist attack on a Berlin disco that killed three people , including two U.S. servicemen , and wounded more than 200 others .
In the airstrike , Libya ’s leader , Moammar Kadafi , a target of the raid , escaped unharmed , but his 2 - year - old adopted daughter was killed .

During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , when the first Bush administration bombed Baghdad , Robert M. Gates , the former CIA director and current Defense secretary , said White House officials hoped that “ Saddam Hussein would be killed in a bunker . ”
At an air base in Saudi Arabia that year , Cheney , then secretary of Defense , and Gen. Colin L. Powell signed a 2,000 - pound laser - guided bomb destined for Iraq .
“ To Saddam with affection , ” Cheney wrote .
In 1998 , President Clinton ordered a cruise missile strike on Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan after the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa .
The White House was clearly disappointed when the strike failed to kill Bin Laden , who reportedly left one of the camps shortly before the attack .
A year later , again during the Clinton administration , NATO bombed Belgrade after Serbia forced ethnic Albanians to flee from Kosovo .
A cruise missile was lobbed right into the bedroom of Slobodan Milosevic , the Serbian leader and Yugoslav president , but he was not sleeping there and escaped injury .
In Yemen in 2002 , a CIA Predator drone fired a Hellfire missile that destroyed a car in which a top Al Qaeda leader , Qaed Sinan Harithi , was riding .

The problem with assassination , morality aside , is that the U.S. is not very good at it , as the CIA ’s farcical efforts to murder Castro demonstrate .
It seems unlikely that the CIA will kill Bin Laden with a baseball bat .
And there is the real possibility of retaliation for a state - sponsored assassination .
President Kennedy was quoted as saying , “ We ca n’t get into that kind of thing or we would all be targets . ”
Perhaps CIA Director Leon Panetta had that in mind when he canceled the assassination program .
American banks were just bailed out by us , the American tax payers , and some have not even paid us back yet .
However , they are giving out 32.6 billion dollars in bonuses .
They need to be held accountable not only for their actions that helped lead us to one of the worst years in American economic history but they also need to be held responsible for their complete disregard of the tax payers that just saved them .
On May 16th , 2009 , the Election Commission of India announced the results of its recent month - long India - wide election for their lower house of Parliament - the largest democratic election in the world .
An estimated 714 million voters ( from a population of 1.2 billion ) were eligible to cast their vote in one of five separate phases at over 800,000 polling stations , starting on April 16th .
Logistically difficult , massive in scale , and opposed by various rebel groups , separatists and protestors , the elections still managed to be held with minimal disruption , with an average voter turnout of greater than 56 % .
The big winner was the the Indian National Congress party , which will form the new government under the incumbent prime minister Manmohan Singh .
As with any photo story from India , it is impossible to capture every aspect in just a handful of pictures - collected here are only some of the scenes that played out across the nation over the last month .

Do n't let that blank , boxy look fool you : Printers can steal your money and your time if you 're not careful .
Printer manufacturers have come up with a few creative ways to drain your wallet through ink and toner cartridge costs .
Other printer models just make you waste precious minutes fooling around with complicated menu systems or stupidly designed hardware .
How do you spot a thieving printer ?
We 've identified some of the leading suspects for each specific crime .
But to determine whether your printer is pilfering from you , check its specs and our reviews for these warning signs .
1 . If the Printer Is Cheap , the Ink or the Toner Isn't
Think you got a great deal on your printer ?
Think again .
It ’s a common ploy for printer vendors to sell machines at or below their production cost -- and then make their money later on with extremely high ink or toner costs .
How can you tell ?
Do the math :
Take the cost of the cartridge and divide it by the page yield — the number of pages the manufacturer says the cartridge can print .
( Note that most vendors base their page - yield numbers on industry - standard testing that is designed to represent real - world usage .
However , the page yields you obtain may vary , depending on what you actually print . )
Some vendors make their page yield information easy to find online ( thank you , HP ! ) , while others bury it ( we 're looking at you , Canon ) .
The cost per page for the printer ’s ink or toner does not reflect other printer costs , of course , such as those for an inkjet ’s special paper or for a laser ’s belts , drums , and other longer - life consumables .
We collected cartridges prices and vendor page yield information for a number of printers .
From them , we determined that the following costs per page for black - and - white and four - color pages for inkjet and laser printers are about average .
Inkjet printers :
Plain black text : 4 cents to 5 cents per page
Simple four - color page : 12 cents to 14 cents per page
Monochrome laser / LED printers :
Plain black text : 1 cent to 2.5 cents per page
Color laser / LED printers :
Plain black text : 2 cents to 3 cents per page
Simple four - color page : 12 cents to 15 cents per page
If your printer ’s costs fall at or below these averages , that ’s good .
But if its costs exceed these averages , you should consider looking for a different printer .
A person who prints two dozen or fewer pages per week , mostly text with a little color , might tolerate a higher cost per page ; but with so many good printers out there , why go with one that 's going to soak you ?
Here are some printers and multifunction printers ( MFPs ) we 've tested recently that are n't as inexpensive as they look :
2. Lower - Capacity Inks = Higher Cost Per Page
PC World 's research has shown time and again that lower - capacity ink and toner cartridges cost you more in the long run .
If you print relatively little , it may not matter much , since the high cost is spread over a longer period of time .
But if you print a lot , look for ink cartridges with yields above 250 pages , or toner cartridges with yields above 2000 pages .
Some printers offer high - yield consumables that can save you a lot more .
Here are the worst and best models for cartridge capacity that we 've reviewed recently .
Worst : Printers with standard - size cartridges that are low - capacity and pricey :
Best : Printers that give you lots of ink or toner for a low price :
Endangered hihi birds should eat their fruit and vegetables when feeding their chicks , according to research .
Scientists from the Zoological Society of London have found that giving hihi mothers a dietary supplement of carotenoids helped to protect their chicks against parasites .
Italian bike manufacturer Pinarello have added a Sky bike to their range in colours not too dissimilar to that of the media company that is backing the British ProTour team next year .
The Pinarello Prince
Sky bike comes in black , dark blue and white shades that match perfectly the kit worn by the track trade team riders Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton , and would seem to show their intent on backing the new British team in 2010 .
Although there is nothing on Pinarello ’s site linking the bike to the new team , it would seem more than a coincidence .
Cycling Weekly can reveal that Pinarello has been in lengthy discussions with Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford , although they now look to be second favourite in the race to provide bikes for the biggest team to enter professional cycling in years .
Brailsford has been in discussions with many of the major bike builders .
He met with representatives from Look at the track worlds in Poland and Specialized are also reported to be interested .
But the favourites now seem to be Giant .
When we spoke to the world ’s biggest bike manufacturer at the Tour of California in February they told us they ’d only be interested in the team if they could also back the track riders due to the amount of publicity they now receive .
Although Giant do make a track bike , it ’s unlikely the British team would ride it after spending years developing their own equipment .
They could however put Giant stickers on the bikes if it sealed what would be a multi-million pound deal .
Rabobank are currently the only ProTour team riding Giant bikes after Columbia signed up with Scott at the end of last season .
A bike sponsorship deal will typically involve a the manufacturer supplying around 200 bikes ( road and time trial ) , plus paying whatever amount is negotiated .
Colnago famously used to claim they were the only manufacturer not to pay to sponsor a team , while Specialized ’s deal with Quick Step is believed to be one of the biggest at about € 1.4 m a year .

Jailed Iranian reformists have been tortured in an attempt to force them into TV " confessions " of a foreign - led plot against the Islamic regime , it was allegedtoday , as the country 's guardian council buried hopes for any significant revision of the disputed presidential election .
According to Iranian opposition websites , the " confessions " are aimed at implicating Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi , the defeated reformist candidates , in an alleged conspiracy .
Mostafa Tajzadeh , Abdollah Ramezanzadeh and Mohsen Aminzadeh , all Mousavi supporters , are reported to have undergone " intensive interrogation " sessions in Tehran 's Evin prison since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election .
They are among several hundred activists , academics , journalists and students detained in a crackdown coinciding with the brutal suppression of street protests .
Prisoners reportedly heard screams from Tajzadeh and Ramezanzadeh in Evin 's section 209 , which is reserved for political prisoners and is run by the hardline intelligence ministry .
Aminzadeh , a former deputy foreign minister , was heard shouting : " I am not going to give interviews . "
Amnesty International said the reports came from " very credible sources " .
The guardian Council has declared there were no major violations in the vote , which it described as the " healthiest " since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
It had already rejected a call by Mousavi , for the election to be annulled because of suspected vote rigging .
a senior cleric , Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami , told worshippers at Tehran University : " I want the judiciary to ... punish leading rioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson . "
Ominously , he used the term " mohareb " – " one who wages war against God " – a crime punishable by death .
Khatami's sermon , broadcast live on state TV , included accusations that the unrest was supported by Israel and the US , and that foreign journalists had reported falsely .
He claimed Neda Agha Soltan , who became a symbol of the opposition when her death was caught on video , was a victim of protesters , not the security forces .
" Government forces do not shoot at a lady standing in a side street , " he said .
Protests have continued for nearly two weeks , but faded in recent days after a crackdown by security forces and a perceived lack of leadership by Mousavi .
About 20 people have been killed and hundreds beaten and arrested .
This week , state television broadcast interviews with several people admitting to being " terrorists " after purportedly taking part in street demonstrations .
But forced " confessions " have been used before to humiliate and discredit opponents of the regime .
Tajzadeh 's wife , Fakhrosadat Mohtashamipour , told the pro-reform website Emruz that she and a lawyer had been denied access to him since his arrest the day after the 12 June election .
" Any quote or remarks made by these people in the current situation has no credibility .
My husband 's only crime is his efforts to secure a high turnout , " she said .
Tajzadeh , 53 , a member of the pro-reform Islamic Participation Front and the Islamic Revolution Mojahedin Organisation , has been a staunch critic of Ahmadinejad .
Renewed fears have been voiced over the health of another jailed reformist , Saeed Hajarian , a former adviser to the reformist president Mohammed Khatami who is severely disabled from a failed assassination attempt nine years ago .
Reports of Hajarian 's death were dismissed by the reformist website Parlemannews , which quoted " informed sources " as saying he was in " relative health " and being given essential medication and care .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said at a G8 meeting in Trieste : " It is for the Iranian people to choose their government , but it is for the Iranian government to protect their people .
The violence we have seen ... and the killings and the beatings are deplorable and they show a failure to protect their own people .
There is a crisis of credibility not between Iran and the west , but between the Iranian counting of the votes and the Iranian people . "
Meanwhile , state TV reported that the head of Mousavi 's information committee , Abolfazl Fateh , had been prevented from leaving Iran for Britain , where he is a PhD student .
Fars , a pro-Ahmadinejad news agency close to the country 's Revolutionary Guard , said he had been banned from travelling to allow the authorities to investigate " recent gatherings " , a reference to the pro-Mousavi demonstrations .

It did n't make many headlines , but Wednesday was probably the most depressing day in Citigroup 's ( NYSE: C ) history : the day its massive conversion of preferred to common stock finally began .
When all is said and done , taxpayers will own 34 % of the hobbled banking giant .
Lucky , lucky us .
And unlike other banks , I really mean own .
While preferred stock kept the government at a relative arm 's length , taxpayers now have direct ownership with voting rights .
This gives Uncle Sam power to start making high - level changes , which will dictate Citigroup 's future .
What 's it all mean for the company ?
A few things -- some good , some bad , some potentially disastrous .
Money for nothing ...
First , the conversion considerably boosts Citi 's tangible common equity ( TCE ) .
No new capital is being injected , but the shift strengthens the portion of equity that can absorb losses .
Before the swap , Citi's TCE was basically negligible , which could have ( and would have ) put it on the edge of blowing up , had these actions not been taken .
Post - swap , Citigroup will gain $ 61 billion of TCE .
Using data from last quarter 's balance sheet , this should boost its TCE ratio to about 4.8 % .
While that 's still below the historical banking average of 6 % , it 's also higher than rivals JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) , US Bancorp ( NYSE : USB ) , Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) , and Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) -- at least , before they went on a massive capital - raising campaign .
By most measures , Citi is now a fairly well - capitalized bank .
And that 's where all the good news ends
Not surprisingly , this comes at a price typically associated with Mafia activity .
Current shareholders are being diluted by slightly more than 75 % !
When the dust settles , Citi will have more than 23 billion shares outstanding , compared to 5.5 billion before the conversion .
This simply means that what 's left of the company is split so many ways , it 'll be hard to create even trivial shareholder value .
This is especially true when you remember that Citi sold most of its only stable unit , Smith Barney , to Morgan Stanley ( NYSE : MS ) , and that it 's drastically delevered in recent months .
There just simply is n't an earnings - power mechanism anymore .
That sad truth becomes clear when you look at its individual operating segments .
During the boom years , Citi had three units it could count on for big profits : credit cards , consumer banking , and institutional clients .
( The latter houses the investment banking unit largely responsible for pulling the company down the toilet . )
Now , the credit card unit faces oppressive new regulations and exploding delinquencies that will grow as unemployment rises .
Consumer banking has been hemorrhaging money faster than any other segment .
And much of the institutional client group is being forgotten about and shoved into Citi's " bad bank " entity , known as Citi Holdings .
CEO Vikram Pandit recently told BusinessWeek : " We want to be Citicorp , not Citigroup , going forward .
Citicorp is our global bank for consumers and businesses . "
To do so , large chunks of the company are not being revived -- they 're being killed .
Investors hoping for an eventual profit recovery should keep this sobering fact in mind .
The beginning of the end
Tie everything together , and you get a serious trifecta : Citigroup was built on a defunct business model , owns many assets incapable of turning a profit , and now calls the government its largest shareholder .
So while it will not fail thanks to government ownership , an eventual breakup of the company looks fairly likely .
Why ?
Citigroup found itself in these dire straits because its overwhelming size and complexity nearly destroyed the economy last fall .
Its new top shareholder , the government , is an organization oblivious to profits , but extremely conscious about the stability of the financial system .
It wants nothing more than to bury the words " systemic risk " six feet under .
And just as it's doing with AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) , a slow , stable , and controlled dismemberment of Citigroup would achieve the government 's goal of eliminating the " too big to fail " problem for good .
Sayonara , Citigroup ?
As we know it , yes .
This is a failed company taped together by a government whose sole mission is to ensure that a disaster of this magnitude never happens again .
After the past 18 months , there 's essentially zero chance that Citigroup will be allowed to remain in its current form indefinitely .
And you know what ?
Good riddance .
For related Foolishness :
APPARENTLY , WE ALREADY HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE ….
To appreciate why so many conservative Republican lawmakers oppose health care reform , it ’s important to remember that they generally do n’t consider the status quo that bad .
Most Americans already have some kind of insurance through their employers ; retirees are already covered through Medicare ; and everyone else can just go to the emergency room .
Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R ) of North Carolina , for example , shared these words of wisdom yesterday .
Rep. Virginia Foxx ( R - N.C. ) disputes President Obama ’s claim that 47 million Americans lack healthcare .
“ There are no Americans who do n’t have healthcare .
Everybody in this country has access to healthcare , ” she says .
“ We do have about 7.5 million Americans who want to purchase health insurance who cannot afford it , ” she says , urging Congress to adopt a new plan for healthcare reform that would n’t “ destroy what is good about healthcare in this country ” and “ give the government control of our lives . ”
“ There are no Americans who do n’t have healthcare . ”
I feel like we ’ve been hearing that quite a bit from GOP officials lately .
Last weekend , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked on “ Meet the Press ” about the 47 million Americans who go without health insurance , McConnell replied , “ Well , they do n’t go without health care , ” because they can just go to the emergency room .
It ’s a surprisingly common argument .
Last year , the conservative who shaped John McCain ’s health care policy said anyone with access to an emergency room effectively has insurance .
The year before , Tom DeLay argued , “ [ N ] o American is denied health care in America , ” because everyone can go to the emergency room .
Around the same time , George W. Bush said the same thing : “ [ P ] eople have access to health care in America .
After all , you just go to an emergency room . ”
In 2004 , then - HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson said our healthcare system “ could be defined as universal coverage , ” because of emergency rooms .
There are a couple of key angles to this .
First , it ’s true that if you ’re uninsured and get sick , there are public hospitals that will treat you .
But it ’s extremely expensive to treat patients this way , and it would be far cheaper , and more effective , to pay for preventative care so that people do n’t have to wait for a medical emergency to seek treatment .
For that matter , when sick people with no insurance go to the E.R. for care , they often ca n’t pay their bills .
Since hospitals can’t treat sick patients for free , so the costs are passed on to everyone else .
In that sense , Republicans are endorsing the most inefficient system of socialized medicine ever devised .
Second , for Foxx or anyone else to argue that every Americans “ has access to healthcare ” is absurd .
As Matt Corley explained , millions of Americans experience access problems due to medical costs every year , and skip necessary treatment because they ca n’t afford it .
Electric motorcycles are catching on like wildfire .
Traditional motorbikes are pretty fuel efficient by design but they still burn petrol and have harmful emissions .
So , if you are a looking for a chance to do your part to save the planet , check out the new Brammo Enertia .
This is an electric vehicle that runs on lithium phosphate batteries , has a power output the equivalent of 13.7 horsepower and a top speed of 55 mph .
A full charge takes only 3 hours , for which you are anointed with a 45 mile driving range .
Battery life is always an issue , but these are good for 35,000 miles of driving , meaning the average user will get 10 years of use out of them .
Most people will probably have upgraded to the next generation long before failure .
However , if you are someone who buys things and uses them until they disintegrate , at today ’s market prices , a new set of lithium phosphate batteries would run you around $ 3,000 .
The price of the Brammo Enertia is rather steep at $ 11,995 , but like all things high - design , part of the cost goes towards the cool factor .
The bike features a single headlight , narrow frame and chopped tail .
Everything is blacked out except for the orange trim around the “ fuel tank ” aka battery pack .
The Enertia weighs only 280 pounds so it ’s very manageable for smaller framed men or women .
This is an exciting offering in the marketplace and I ’ll be very interested to see what happens with subsequent generations as battery technology and electric motor functionality improves .
If the driving range can be raised to over 100 miles and the top speed up to 65 mph , the Brammo Enertia will be a true contender against its gas sipping brethren .

The differing opinions mean that the whole issue of city and state gun laws will probably head back to the Supreme Court for clarification , leading many legal experts to predict a further expansion of gun rights .
The new cases are fallout from last year ’s Supreme Court case , District of Columbia v. Heller , which struck down parts of Washington ’s gun control ordinance , the strictest in the country , and stated for the first time that the Second Amendment gives individuals a right to keep and bear arms for personal use .
But the court declined to say whether the Second Amendment in general applies to state and local governments .
In January , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , in New York , in a ruling joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor , declined to apply the Second Amendment to a New York law that banned the martial arts device known as chuka sticks , or nunchaku .
The ban was allowed to stay in place .
Then in April , a three - judge panel of the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , ruled that the Second Amendment did apply to the states , even though it allowed a California county to ban guns on government property like state fairgrounds .
That case , Nordyke v. King , is being considered for a rehearing by the full Ninth Circuit .
Those two conflicting cases set the stage for two other cases that were heard as one in the Seventh Circuit in Chicago , testing that city ’s handgun ban .
On June 2 , a three - judge panel of the court , led by Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook , a well - known conservative , ruled that there was no basis for the court to apply the Second Amendment to the states .
Such a decision , Judge Easterbrook wrote , should be made only by the Supreme Court , not at the appellate level .
( OPRAH.com ) --
Last summer , in the low - tide shallows of Cape Cod , my young son and his best friend hummed a sea snail out of its shell .
It 's a trick they 'd learned from a visiting marine biologist at their school :
The children held the shell up to their peachy , softly droning faces and the snail craned its shy neck out to listen .
The snail stretched up its tentative little horns and the children smiled back .
Wife appreciates her husband even though his communication style sometimes drives her crazy .
Oh , to be humming and gentle !
Me ?
I 'd more likely rap on his shell with restless knuckles : " Anybody home in there ?
Hel -lo ? "
I 'd nag after his soft , hidden self : " Are you even listening to me ?
Hel -lo ? "
Perhaps I 'd chide the snail for acting so withdrawn or accuse him of passive aggression .
And I 'd wonder , hurt , why he did n't reveal more of himself to me .
There may be much to recommend fierceness as a style of devotion -- what with its hunger and bared teeth , its constant crescendo of connecting -- but patience is a virtue , and I am not virtuous .
Silence is golden , and I am not golden .
Fools rush in , and , oh , I can be such a fool .
The surest way to intimacy is to turn myself into a kind of whining , boring power tool .
I trust I 'm correct in my approach here .
" What are you thinking ?
Why did you say that ?
What did you really mean ?
Then why did you put your fingers to your forehead like that ?
Yes , you did . "
The trick is to locate tiny , remote pockets of privacy and then drill at them -- zjh zjh zjhhhh -- like they 're abscesses .
The trick is to express love the way a cuckoo clock expresses time .

I have lived with him for 17 years .
For 17 years , his dark hair has fallen into his dark eyes .

Oh !
It 's my husband ! "
He 's the kind of person who picks you up from the airport , makes you a cup of tea , and listens while you talk about your feelings , his eyebrows raised in baffled alarm .

What 's wrong with being angry ?
He 's the kind of person whose affection is a wide and bottomless sea , only the water 's maybe not as salty as you thought it was going to be .
When he cares daily for our children and me -- lunch , bad dreams , the to - and - fro of car trips and conversation -- I remember the relationship between " tend " and " tender . "
His heart is a string of mild , sunny days .
And I have loved him like a hurricane .
I have loved him like a scalpel .
I have loved him like poison ivy on the dog's paws , like a rock in his shoe , like chewing gum stuck under the table of his heart .
Every day for 17 years I have been Columbus sailing up to the continent of his being , and every day for 17 years I have tried to plant my flag on its beach .
Some days the gentle people living there have grinned , turned their hands palm up , and offered me unspeakable treasures .
Other days , when it seems clear that what I 'm spreading is nonnative vegetation and disease , they 've chased me away with canoe paddles ; they 've even suggested to me , through gestures and grimacing , that colonizing might be a funny way to express one 's love .
Indeed , it might be .

How to really get through to him
He is pressed flat up against the wall of our marriage , and still I 'm saying , " Come closer , my darling . "
But there 's no room for him to move , and I 'm actually crushing his rib cage a little bit .
It 's not a Venus / Mars situation as much as an astronaut / moon one .
" What 's with your whacked - out gravitational field ? " I 'm asking .
" Why are you so far away ? "
I want to look at the photo albums from when we were young , from when we were first in love , from when the children were babies .
I want him to say , " These photographs fill my heart with a thousand white and flying doves of nostalgia . "
And he does , in a way , but the words are about a lamp we once had or a canyon we camped near or the grunting baritone goose impersonation I did while I labored with our firstborn .
He does not talk much about his mother 's catastrophically short life , but he might remember suddenly the way she cooked zucchini .
He is no fountain spraying silver arcs of feelings into the air , but he 's a cupful of snow , and if I 'm thirsty , I 'd do better to thaw it with my breath than continue to curse the cold .

Take a peek inside the male brain
But sometimes I rail against his otherness as if it were a cage or the tiger in it or one of those wedding sheets with a hole sliced into it for intercourse .
When really what I know is this :
To chip away at difference is to make the mistake of a lifetime .
You think you want him to serenade you with all your favorite songs -- and you do , of course -- but what you really want is to lie in bed and listen to the love of your life strumming the guitar , singing softly to himself when he thinks everybody 's asleep .
You think you want the topiary trimmed neatly into the shape of a husband , when what you really want is that wild and sheltering maple , all dappled starlight , its helicopter - seedpods fluttering down in the breeze .
Two identical flints lying side by side in the dark are not exactly going to make a spark now , are they ?
For some reason , I am best able to value this -- the difference and distance between two minds -- when the person I 'm talking to is a child .
In the car , with K.D. Lang on , for example , I say aloud , " Her voice always sounds like something liquid and smooth -- it makes me picture a river of heavy cream rippling down a mountain , " and my son says , " I know exactly what you mean .
Whenever you talk about time ?
About this o'clock or that o'clock ?
I think about lemons . "
I turn my face to look at him , and he smiles , all mystery and light .
Who knew ?
Another person is like a geode lined with hidden glittering .
On a clear day , I understand this :
The crystals wink out at me here and there , and I am filled with gratitude for the unseen .
On a foggy day , I wonder about taking a hammer to it , cracking it into a million pieces to get a better look .
Come New Year 's Eve , I lie with an ear to his bare chest , talking .
I 'm talking about my resolution to talk less .
I want to listen , accept , and cherish .
I 'm not a child on the beach , as sweet and sparkling with sand as a sugared pastry , but I 'm thinking about the kids with their snail and I 'm vowing patience .
" What about you ? " I say , when I am nearly done talking , " What 's your resolution ? "
There 's a moment of silence , his strong arms around my back , before he says , " You know when you tear off a piece of floss that 's really too short to use but you do n't want to waste it so you use it anyways ?
I 'm just going to throw it away and start with a fresh piece .
I 'm not even going to struggle with it . "
I lift my face to look at him , and he smiles and winks .
Then he ducks his inscrutable head to kiss me on the mouth .

Possibly a very important policy change quietly emerged in the daily schedule of Vice President Joe Biden today .
Loyal Ticket readers know that , as a patriotic duty , we monitor the longtime senator 's schedule with a close eye for detail because , after all , this man is only a heartbeat away from having to give a toast at a G - 8 summit .
We 've especially noted Biden 's innumerable " private meetings " that are closed to the press because , well , they 're private .
And we 've wondered aloud how this Democratic VP 's private meetings with unnamed people on unnamed subjects differs from the private meetings with unnamed people that his evil predecessor had that got so many Democratic senators and representatives worried about nefarious secrets .
On one recent long weekend , the man who became a Delaware senator when his future boss , Barack Obama , was an inexperienced fundraiser of only 11 , devoted an entire Monday to " private meetings " that are closed press in his Delaware home .
If that is n't dedication for the $ 208,000 salary .
Well , today 's schedule , unlike many at the end of Biden 's work weeks , contains no " private meetings . "
Not one .
Having spent Thursday traveling and successfully selling the nation on the so far hard - to - detect effects of the $ 787 - billion Obama administration economic stimulus spending plan that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave them , Biden will show up for work around 11 today .
He 'll join Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in a roundtable to discuss only the rising costs of healthcare for people who own or work for small businesses .
One suspects the absent president 's ambitious plan to spend billions more to impose his healthcare reforms might also be mentioned .
OK , so figure an hour for the roundtable , maybe 75 minutes max .
You can only talk about that stuff so long before requiring healthcare yourself .
Fifteen minutes for handshaking , cellphone photos and congratulations on the excellent roundtable .
The VP should be outta there by 12:30 .
That leaves -- what ?
-- five , maybe six hours to make it a seven - hour workday .
According to the White House schedule , Biden will not spend the remainder of the workday in private meetings that are closed press .
Instead : " The Vice President will spend the remainder of the day in meetings that are closed press . "
You get the difference , right ?
( Friday UPDATE 7 p.m. : According to the VP's weekend schedule , if you need to reach him about the stimulus plan or something , both days he will be in Delaware where " There are no public events scheduled . "
No public mention of private meetings . )

While the probability of a smoking gun contained here is marginal at best , strangers things have happened .
It was a show that premiered seven years ago and lasted only four months , yet Firefly today not only entertains viewers but inspires writers , including romance writers .
As I mentioned in an earlier post , * Lessons of Firefly : Learning from the Works of Joss Whedon * was one of the workshop choices at the Romance Writers of Americaconference earlier this month in Washington , D.C. Author Jacqui Jacoby believes that Firefly 's brief life is part of its appeal .
She said given a longer life - span , the show might have lost the quality evident in the first season .
Instead , browncoats have a something that stands the test of time .
And Whedon 's writing is also a great example of how to do things right .
" I really feel as if he 's the Rod Serling of our generation , " sad Jacoby .
Jacoby opened the workshop with a video montage of the show set to Holding out for a Hero , and it struck me during this how Whedon used very
specific heroic images to clue the reader in to Mal 's true character .
Holding Out For a Hero–Browncoat Version
In these quick cuts , we see Mal as Buck Rodgers , Mal as a western hero , Mal as a Regency / Three Musketeers duelist , or Mal as in just a plain old fist - fight .
These images brought home to me how good Whedon is at using our collective memory to enhance his characters .
According to Jacoby , the well - known re-shuffling of episodes and the production of a new pilot caused Whedon to rework a couple of key scenes from the original pilot .
How those scenes came off in the new pilot illustrates the difficulties in getting across character traits quickly to viewers .
The two scenes were Kaylee eating the strawberry and Mal shooting a Fed to preserve his crew .
Kaylee 's scene , written to showcase the senses and what life was like on - board the Serenity , made it to the new pilot intact .
Mal killing the Fed did not .
It was meant to show the moral dilemmas in the world of Mal and his crew .
In the new pilot , Mal famously knocks a bad guy into the engine .
But instead of it being seen as a hard choice , it comes across as funny .
Well , I laughed .
And I 'm not the only one .
Which is not quite what Whedon intended .
But overall , he was able to create the characters he wanted .
For instance , the cast surrounding Mal grew outward from him .
" Mal is a shattered man , " Jacoby said .
" So he 's surrounded himself with people that have the qualities that he 's lost . "
For example , Book represents Mal 's lost faith , and Kaylee shows Mal 's lost innocence , thought both characters are far more than that .
Even the character that we initially believe is irredeemable , Jayne , has depth ( and some of the best lines ) as viewers later discover that he 's supporting his family .
" He moved from shallow to beloved , " said Jacoby .
The characters are three - dimensional because Whedon spent so much time building his world .
The ship , Serenity , essentially becomes the tenth character of the show .
And the icing on the cake is Whedon 's distinctive dialogue .
" Characters are defined by dialogue , " said Jacoby .
" Simon did n't swear .
Kaylee was bubbly .
Book was careful . "
As for Whedon 's tendency to kill off leading characters , as happened in the film Serenity , Jacoby defended the unexpected death as moving to viewers , rather than just there for shock value .
She pointed to the tension added in the scenes after the death and how much they added to the emotional impact of the movie .
" If nobody dies , there is no price to pay for what you want , " she said .
I agree with her on that but after Serenity and other deaths in Whedon shows over the years , I think he 's gone to this well far too often .
It 's gotten so every time a happy couple shows up , I start looking for the target on the chest of the beta member of the pairing .
But now I am inspired to get out the * Firefly * DVD and start watching again .
This happens all the time .
My decision to drive creates traffic that imposes a cost on society .
A company 's decision to fish in the ocean imposes a cost on the world 's common stock of fisheries .
A banker 's decision to take on a huge amount of risk creates danger for the economy as a whole .
The problem is that none of these private actors adequately bears the cost of their decisions .
So , the usual solution is to increase the price of these decisions -- with congestion charges , or private property rights , or taxes -- so that private consumers take into account social costs .
Still , in the case of pollution , there 's no denying that a price mechanism will make life more difficult for consumers and energy producers , at least in the medium run .
But let 's treat this cost honestly !
For example , Palin writes :
Job losses are so certain under this new cap - and - tax plan that it includes a provision accommodating newly unemployed workers from the resulting dried - up energy sector , to the tune of $ 4.2 billion over eight years .
So much for creating jobs .
A quick note about the psychology of large numbers : $ 4.2 billion over eight years is $ 525 million a year .
( That yearly cost is just above the total cost of , I dunno , building a road that connects Juneau with the rest of Alaska . )
Or , Palin writes :
The Americans hit hardest will be those already struggling to make ends meet .
This is simply incorrect .
Cap and trade creates revenue , which can be used to mitigate the costs for consumers .
When the Congressional Budget Office did its analysis of the distribution of the costs and benefits of the House 's cap and trade bill , it found that the poorest quintile would actually benefit .
Again , I do n't want to pretend there 's no cost here .
But all this talk about " destroying America 's economy " ( Palin 's words ) sheds a great deal more heat than light .
When the Environmental Protection Agency did its medium - run projection of American Gross Domestic Product with and without a cap and trade bill , it found only a slight difference between the two cases ( this is pulled from my chart files ) :
America will remain an incredibly prosperous nation with a cap and trade bill .
Indeed , America will be a nation several times more prosperous than it is now !
I think this is a small price to pay .
Why does n't Sarah Palin ?

A paradox arises to the extent that it is true that the market is dependent on normative underpinning ( to provide the pre-contractural foundations such as trust , cooperation , and honesty ) which all contractural relations require :
The more people accept the neoclasical paradigm as a guide for their behavior , the more the ability to sustain a market economy is undermined .
This holds for all those who engage in transactions without ever - present inspectors , auditors , lawyers , and police : if they do not limit themselves to legitimate ( i.e. normative ) means of competition out of internlized values , the system will collapse , because the transaction costs of a fully or even highly “ policed ” system are prohibitive .
This holds even more so for the regulators that every market requires .
If those whose duty it is to set and to enforce the rules of the game are out to maximize their own profits , a - la - Public Choice , there is no hope for the system

Marshall Auerback , at the end of a very good piece “ Major Social Upheaval Likely if Bank Bonanza Continues , ” suggests another angle , that of payment revolt :
By contrast , the current bonanza for banks is neither economically efficient , nor politically sustainable .
What is driving the change in portfolio preference shifts is not only a misguided paradigm , but also an inability for the Obama administration to make a sensible , coherent case in what they are doing and why they are doing it .
Their actions , in fact , seem to suggest that everything is ad hoc and that they are operating out of their depth , in effect continuing the same policies of the Bush / Paulson period , but on a much greater scale .
Ironically , this ultimately will also prove highly inimical to the interests of finance itself .
When most of the home owning voters cannot pay their major debt or have no incentive to pay their mortgage debt , there will either be a debtors revolt that society will sanction or there will be a bailout of such a magnitude that mega moral hazard will affect private lending forever .
Once these things happen , you will no longer have the social rules for private risk based lending .
In other words , financial markets will be unlike anything ever seen before in private economies .
Is this really what Wall Street wants , let alone American society as a whole ?
Both FDR and JFK had a brain trust that could help forge public opinion .

In the meantime , beyond automatic stabilizers , the door appears to be shutting to further active fiscal ease .
I wonder if the stage is already being set for tax hikes , as rumors of a federal VAT ( value added tax ) have been floating around of late .
Add this to rising commodity prices and interest rates , and the profile of any recovery may become increasingly in question , a la 1937 - 8 .
Add to that additional bank write - offs , further credit contraction and a minimalist welfare system which leaves nothing in the way of social cohesion , and the prospects for major social upheaval look dangerously likely .
What is missing is a vision of a new growth path for the US .
If a public backlash is to be marshalled to something more than retribution , that needs to come to the fore .
Once you get beyond the pothole and school patching , what industries can be pushed forward through public seed capital or public private partnerships ?
The economist Hy Minsky pointed out a better way to solve both the liquidity and the income problem , while also providing full employment : by channeling government expenditure through an employer - of - last - resort program .
The current crisis could have been mitigated if increased household consumption had been financed through wage increases and if financial institutions had used their earnings to augment bank capital rather than employee bonuses .
The current system has failed because it was built on an incentive system that did just the opposite .
Auerback also points out earlier in the piece that the Great Depression government - created jobs were anything but makework :
As Adam Cohen in his new book , NOTHING TO FEAR , [ WPA ] workers constructed or repaired more than 125,000 buildings , including 83,000 schools ; 800 aiports ; 950 sewage plants ; and 650,000 miles of roads .
They built or improved 78,000 bridges and 25,000 playgrounds ; terraced 271,000 acres of eroded land ; and taught two million people to read .
They also ran a famous Federal Art Project , which hired destitute artists to create murals for public buildings , posters , and paintings .
The WPA produced a highly regarded series of state guidebooks and an acclaimed collection of interviews with former slaves , and it played a major role in building the San Antonio Zoo , New York City ’s LaGuardia and Washington ’s Reagan airports , and the presidential retreat at Camp David .
In 1965 , on the program ’s thirtieth anniversary , The New York Times quoted a dispossessed North Carolina tenant farmer living in an abandoned gas station , who had been rescued by a WPA job .
‘ I ’m proud of our United States , and everyting I hear The Star Spangled Banner I feel a lump in my throat , ’ he said .
‘ There ai n’t no other nation in the world that would have had the sense enough to think of WPA . ”
One of the towns I lived in had a very large WPA - created park , and it looked as if it must have taken quite a bit of manpower .
It is still the best feature of a largely blue collar town .
But our Darwinist model of capitlism seems to deem it wiser to blame lack of work on individuals ’ refusal to accept low enough wages , than consider that in a high - skill society with narrowly defined jobs , that labor is no longer all that fungible and people really can be unemployed through no fault of their own .
But in our current paradign , enforcing market principles takes precedence over human dignity .
And it looks like that paradigm will hold until it shatters under its own contradictions .
As revenues from sales of traditional media have plunged , the music business has been looking for alternate ways of making money from its products , including a variety of subscription services , ad - supported streams , and blanket licenses .
The focus of these efforts has largely been on how to ensure that revenue gets collected by the industry in general instead of disappearing into the black hole of piracy , but there 's a related issue that does n't receive as much attention : how that money gets distributed once it 's collected .
In an attempt to highlight this issue , the Future of Music Coalition has released a set of principles for the compensation of musicians .
Although the document focuses on money from new distribution models , it reads much more like an effort to rewrite the rules of the entire business .
The FMC calls itself a " research and advocacy organization that seeks a bright future for creators and listeners , " two groups which tend to have contentious relationships with the major record labels .
Based on the document and an accompanying explanation , the FMC is n't a big fan of the labels , either .
So , for example , one of the principles calls for the ability of artists to audit the flow of cash related to their works through the record label 's coffers .
In explaining this , the FMC states , " Music industry history is full of stories — anecdotal and otherwise — of misleading accounting by copyright owners . "
That 's hardly the only place where the copyright owners get slammed , as the discussion also states that , " the history of the music industry is littered with stories of artists who have not been paid anything for the sales of their recordings . "
That appears in the explanation of the first principle , which is that revenue should be " equitably shared " between music 's creators and the copyright holders .
Of course , said holders presumably think that the existing system is fair , which explains why a big portion of the document is spent resetting those rules .
The most critical aspect of this probably occurs in the statement on " direct payment . "
Here , the principles say that any transfer of revenues to copyright owners are limited to three years .
This would eliminate one of the common business practices , in which record companies would pay for recording , distributing , and promoting music , and then count that as a debt that entitled them to recoup their costs from the artists ' share of any profits .
Were these principles adopted , the labels would have three years to get their costs back , after which they can write it off .
The concept of direct payment is meant to ensure that the labels would never have access to this money in order to take their share past this point .
A lot of the remaining principles focus on the fact that many of the online services get their music through agreements that abstract a lot of the relationship between music and revenue .
So , for example , the labels got an equity stake in MySpace in return for providing the contents for MySpace Music .
Other bulk catalog licensing deals exist where the value of the license is a bit easier to determine .
In either case , those deals are ultimately dependent upon the content produced by artists , and FMC wants to make sure they get their cut .
The same goes for money recovered from copyright infringement lawsuits
Many of the other items are a grab bag of artists ' rights issues .
So , for example , in a digital distribution model , it should be possible to accurate track precisely what songs are getting played , so there 's no excuse to not have accurate reporting of this , and revenues distributed accordingly .
The FMC also does n't want independent musicians and minor labels left out of agreements negotiated with the major labels and , as mentioned above , wants to see transparent accounting of the revenues from these agreements , along with a right to audit for artists .
It 's unlikely that artists will get the sorts of rights that the FMC envisions ; there are too many entrenched interests involved , and a lot of groups with a financial interest in blocking these proposals from being adopted .
Still , the statement of principles is a good reminder that the music business is far from a monolithic entity , and there are many within it that have conflicting goals .
As a result , even if one of the new revenue models winds up being successful , that 's unlikely to mean the end of the power struggles .
This is how I learn languages .
Today I learned that sans huile means oil - free .

A naked man has been hit by a bus in the Mt Victoria bus tunnel in Wellington .
Inspector Paul Jermy said the man was walking or running through the tunnel about 4:45 pm when he was struck .
The man was being taken to Wellington Hospital with serious injuries , an ambulance spokesman said .
The exact nature of his injuries was unknown but they were not believed to be life - threatening , police said .
" He seems to have been able to express his dissatisfaction at being hit , " Mr Jermy said .
The tunnel will be closed while emergency services attend the scene .

Canada finished dead last in the G8 — behind even the U.S. — in a ranking of greenhouse gas emissions and planned measures to reduce them in a report sadly released on Canada Day .
Canada agreed under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce CO2 emissions to six percent below 1990 levels by 2012 , but in 2007 its emissions were 26 percent higher than in that target and our emissions are n’t heading down .
But Canada is a very large northern country with a long winter , and we require immense amounts of fuel for transportation and heating .
Is n’t our high consumption of fossil fuels part of a magnificent success story of a skilled and disciplined society utilizing technology to spread a highly complex and enriching civilization across a huge and dauntingly difficult landscape ?
Yes , certainly .
But burning fossil fuels has raised the amount of gases that cause a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere ( and raised the level of carbon generally in the Earth ’s carbon cycle system ) so that climate change is now a serious risk to Canadians , individually and as a society ; a risk to the global civilization we are a part of ; and , to some increasing degree of probability , a serious threat to humanity ’s very existence and to a large percentage of the planet ’s species .
Climate change is happening .
It is caused by putting carbon stored underground for hundreds of millions of years up into the atmosphere .
The cumulative increase of these greenhouse gases will effect global climate for centuries , maybe longer .
There are local effects right now and long - term effects for our grandkids at the end of the century .
And increasingly the science studying the past in ice cores or modeling the future in elaborate scientific computer programming warns of feedback loops and abrupt switches from one climate regime to another .
There is an increasing possibility of uncontrollable or runaway climate change or of an abrupt shifting of large - scale weather patterns , which has happened before but would be unprecedented in the eight thousand years of human civilization and be profoundly humanity - threatening .
Think of climate change risk as analogous to a serious medical condition , a heart disease problem , where if we do n’t make systemic changes in our lifestyles our health will continue to worsen over time and where the probability of sudden death through heart attack or stroke significantly increases .
If we continue to do nothing .
Canadians ’ total emissions are small potatoes compared with the U.S. or China , but we have a high annual consumption average of four to five tonnes per person and this is crucial .
Climate change is a global problem requiring global agreement about emission reduction and any global deal will require contraction of fossil fuel use in the developed countries to an equitable global average .
A 2008 report , Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Scenarios for BC , states : “ In 2004 , the global average per capita emission of carbon was 1.4 metric tonnes ( tC ) .
The average for BC was 4.3 tC , more than three times the global value ( Appendix 1 ) .
To meet the 83 per cent global reduction target required in 2050 , annual global carbon emissions that year must total no more than 1.57 GtC , and with a population estimate of 9.2 billion in 2050,28 this allows a mere 0.17 tC per person ( i.e. 170 kg ) per year . ”
The developed world has put the vast majority of greenhouse gases , which are causing the climate change problem , into the atmosphere , and we have wealthy societies with safety nets .
There will only be an effective global deal and actual emission reduction on a scale necessary if and when we lead in changing to lifestyles to produce far less carbon .
Canadians use an average 29 barrels of oil annually , Americans 25 , Aussies 17 , Britons 10 , the Chinese two , and Indians less than one .
Canada alone produces more greenhouse gas emissions than the bottom half of the world ’s countries combined .
If we continue to do nothing we all face catastrophe together .
And because we ’ve procrastinated for two decades we need that deal now , this December at Copenhagen .
In the bigger picture , our total cumulative emissions do n’t really matter except as an example of carbon - obese developed - world intransigence .
We signed on to Kyoto and then did worse than nothing — our emissions rose by 26 % .
We remain in denial about our obese carbon footprint and refuse to even consider the level of emission reduction needed or the systemic change to our lifestyles and our consumption dependent economy that this level of reduction requires .
We need to cut our emissions by two - thirds fast .
We refuse to even consider individual rationing to try and get closer to the one - tonne global average , or a moratorium on tar sands “ dirty oil ” development , for example .
We should be debating a complete shutdown of this largest contributor to GHG emissions growth in Canada — now five percent of Canada ’s greenhouse gas emissions and rising .
And now we ’re accused of being one of the nations trying to block any meaningful treaty at the end of the year in Copenhagen .
Yes , this is our dino Stephen Harper government in action .
But Harper ’s tar - sands protecting sabotage is done in our name , and as a nation we are determined to stay in denial and imperil future generations because we ’ve become weak and fat and insipid .
We are carbon addicts lying to ourselves with puny carbon taxes and green - lite shopping “ smart choices ” instead of getting serious about our carbon problem .
Pathetic addicts with no brains or backbone .
Lester B. Pearson ’s reasonable , caring , world - leading Canada has morphed into Harper ’s selfish , uncaring , neo-conning Canada .
Climate change gets increasingly more ominous and now Copenhagen is a faltering dream because of our intransigence .
And down the road , soon to be sad , ashamed , and bewildered like a drunk driver , that ’s us , the guilty party , at the scene of a horrific crash .

The Minnesota Supreme Court yesterday declared Democrat Al Franken the winner of last year 's disputed Senate race , and Republican incumbent Norm Coleman 's gracious concession at least spares the state any further legal combat .
The unfortunate lesson is that you do n't need to win the vote on Election Day as long as your lawyers are creative enough to have enough new or disqualified ballots counted after the fact .
Mr. Franken trailed Mr. Coleman by 725 votes after the initial count on election night , and 215 after the first ...
The digitally deprived have rights too , says regular columnist Bill Thompson President Sarkozy of France recently managed to get his Création et Internet law passed by the National Assembly , and if all goes well in the Senate then French internet users will soon find their activities being supervised by HADOPI , the grandly named ' Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des uvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet . '
The rights it is concerned with are not those of ordinary net users but of copyright owners , and especially the large entertainment companies that have lobbied so hard and so successfully for the power to force internet service providers to terminate the accounts of those accused of downloading unlicensed copies of music , films and software .
Once HADOPI is up and running rights holders will be able to go to it with evidence of illegal downloading , and it will issue banning orders to ISPs without any need for tiresome court proceedings .
The agency is deeply controversial , and may in fact be illegal under European law as proposed changes to EU telecommunications regulations seem likely to require the involvement of the courts in any disconnection .
But even if it is legal , it is still a bad idea and must be one of the most foolish , regressive and potentially damaging moves by a government that claims to want to capitalise on the internet 's potential to transform society .
It 's not that computers matter more than water , food , shelter and healthcare , but that the network and PCs can be used to ensure that those other things are available
Bill Thompson
The new law treats the internet as if it was simply a conduit for delivering the sort of mindless entertainment provided by most films , TV programmes and popular music and proposes to cut people off because their actions might damage the business model of one tiny sector of the economy .
But the net is far more than television with added e-mail .
As digital rights campaigner Cory Doctorow put it in an impassioned article on this issue in The Guardian last year : " The internet is only that wire that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , and freedom of the press in a single connection .
It 's only vital to the livelihood , social lives , health , civic engagement , education and leisure of hundreds of millions of people ( and growing every day ) . "
Cory is not alone in believing that net access is too important to be regulated solely in the interests of the entertainment industry .
Earlier this month Vivian Reding , the European Commissioner responsible for Information Society and Media , spoke of " a right to Internet access " and pointed out that the EU 's new telecommunications rules " recognise explicitly that Internet access is a fundamental right such as the freedom of expression and the freedom to access information " .
BILL'S LINKS
HADOPI on Wikipedia Cory Doctorow on net access Cnet : Is net access a human right ?
But if the argument against extra-judicial disconnection is so strong then surely a policy that lets network service providers keep millions of people from having a usable , fast and reliable connection to the internet must also be morally indefensible ?
If it is unacceptable to cut people off from the network because their actions are commercially damaging to the record companies , why is it acceptable to offer them poor or no access to broadband and mobile internet just because providing the service is commercially unattractive to ISPs or network operators ?
BROADBAND WORLD

And if we are to be encouraged to think of access to the internet as a fundamental human right , a prerequisite of having freedom of expression , should we not be prosecuting ISPs over the ' notspots ' in their mobile or wi-fi coverage , the communities with no access to ADSL because of the telephone network was repaired with aluminium instead of copper , or the areas bypassed by the cable providers ?
As a long - time contributor to Digital Planet , the BBC World Service programme about the impact of digital technology on people 's lives , I 've seen the growing awareness within the developing world that computers and connectivity matter and can be useful .
It 's not that computers matter more than water , food , shelter and healthcare , but that the network and PCs can be used to ensure that those other things are available .
Satellite imagery sent to a local computer can help villages find fresh water , mobile phones can tell farmers the prices at market so they know when to harvest .
The same arguments apply in the UK , but those of use who have easy , affordable and fast connectivity tend not to think of the plight of those who can't get online , just as we so often fail to notice the homeless people in our towns or let our eyes glide over deprived housing estates as we sit on the train .
Of course once the kids on the local council estate start using their new - found power to create mash - ups of their favourite bands or add soundtracks to the videos they upload onto the web we 're sure to hear calls for their net access to be restricted in some way .
But at least they 'll be able to organise a Facebook campaign for themselves , and get some attention from the rest of us .
At the moment the offline masses lack a voice as well as an internet connection .

People have been suspicious of ‘ nothing ’ going back all the way to the mathematical idea of “ zero . ”
Yet there is real value in “ nothing ” and we need to appreciate it more .
Anyone who follows the climate change debate closely will no doubt have come across Gavin Schmidt and the website he co-founded called RealClimate.org during their online meanderings .
Schmidt is a British climatologist and climate modeller based at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and he says that he helped to establish RealClimate.org to try to " provide context and background on climate science issues that are often missing in popular media coverage " .
As you can imagine , he 's a busy man .
Schmidt features in this week 's edition of The Edge as the latest interviewee in the online magazine 's Third Culture series .
This regular slot " consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who , through their work and expository writing , are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives , redefining who and what we are " .
A tad grandiose in its premise , but the Third Culture interview often makes for interesting reading .
The Schidmt interview – which runs to more than 7,000 words – allows him the time and space to explain some of the theories and practices that underpin his approach to climatology , particularly the hotly debated area of climate modelling .
But , more interestingly perhaps , it offers him the chance to stray into more personal territory , such as how he deals with the online critics who say he and his scientist colleagues are spouting nonsense , or whether it 's correct for scientists to ever engage in political advocacy — something his boss at the Goddard Institute , Dr James Hansen , is more than a little partial to .
Here 's Schimdt on whether scientists should " get involved in policy " :
Personally , I do n't pretend to be an economist ; I do n't pretend to be a sociologist ; I do n't pretend to be an expert in environmental regulation .
So I generally do n't comment on whether a cap and trade system is better than a carbon tax system , or whether or not it is better that it is being run by the [ US Environmental Protection Agency ] .
I leave that kind of stuff for the people who focus on that much more specifically , and I 'm pretty much willing to find the most interesting and objective of them and give them the benefit of the doubt .
It 's clear that there are a lot of people who talk about politics who are neither interesting nor objective .
When it comes to discussing what to do about climate change , it appears to be a fact of life that people will use the worst and least intelligent arguments to make political points .
If they can do that by sounding pseudoscientific — by quoting a paper here or misrepresenting another scientist 's work over there — then they will .
That surprised me before I really looked into it .
It no longer surprises me .
I do n't advocate for political solutions .
If I do advocate for something , ( and if you put your voice into the public sphere , then it has to be to advocate for something .
Why would you do it otherwise ? )
My advocacy is much more towards having more intelligent discussions , which is completely naive and stupid and I realise that .
And here 's Schimdt on the " noise " created by the climate change debate , a subject he 's touched on before on the Guardian :
In unmoderated forums about climate change , it just devolves immediately into , " you 're a Nazi , no you 're a fascist , " blah , blah , blah .
Any semblance of an idea that you could actually talk about what aerosols do to the hydrological cycle without it devolving into name calling seems to be fantasy .
It is very tiresome .
The problem is that the noise serves various people 's purposes .
It 's not that the noise is accidental .
A lot of the noise when it comes to climate is deliberate because the increase of noise means you do n't hear the signal , and if you do n't hear the signal you can't do anything about it , and so everything just gets left alone .
Increasing the level of noise is a deliberate political tactic .
It 's been used by all segments of the political spectrum for different problems .
With the climate issue in the US and not elsewhere , it 's used by a particular segment of the political community in ways that is personally distressing .
How do you deal with that ?
That is a question that I 'm always asking myself and I have n't gotten an answer to that one .
You can read and watch the interview in full here .
Core War : RobotWar
RobotWar is a programming game developed for the PLATO computer system at Indiana University in the 1970s by Silas Warner .
In 1980 RobotWar was ported to the Apple II and published by MUSE Software .
The aim of the game is to write a program to control the movement , radar and gun of a battle robot .
The original PLATO game placed two robots in a battle arena with the survivor being declared winner .
The Apple II release supported up to five robots in the arena .
Specification
Programs are written in small , custom language which controls the robot using 8 i/o registers .
Labels are up to 32 characters terminated by a newline .
The following commands and registers are supported :

With razor - sharp claws and lightning speed , was Banjo the most fearsome hunting dinosaur ever ?
If you thought the flesh - ripping dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were terrifying , those fearsome creatures were just puppydogs compared to the giant teeth - gnasher that once roamed the plains of Australia .
Weighing in at half a ton and measuring 16ft , Australovenator Wintonesis with its slashing claws would have been a terrifying sight to behold .
Researchers have revealed the discovery of its bones as well as two other new species of dinosaurs that roamed the huge continent , when it was joined to the rest of Asia , millions of years ago .
However , he might have been less impressed by the name ' Banjo ' conferred on him by scientists who found his bones in the Outback .
Nicknamed Banjo , Matilda and Clancy the large dinosaurs are the first unearthed in Australia since 1981 and date back 98 million years to the mid-Cretaceous period .
' Banjo ' was the fiercest of the three new species of dinosaurs discovered by scientists in a prehistoric watering hole in Queensland
This image shows the relative size of ' Banjo ; to a human being
The fearsome Velociraptors make their appearance in Jurassic Park .
At 5 m the new type of fierce dinosaur found in Australia would have towered over this species
Although ' Banjo ' is unlikely to strike fear into your heart , this was the fiercest of the three dinosaurs .
It was a giant velociraptor which could race across the plains at 40 mph , the same as the meat - eating creature that frightened movie - goers watching Jurassic Park .
' Banjo possess similar speed , razor - sharp teeth and had three large slashing claws on each hand .
this was a terrifying creature , ' said Anna Bligh , the Premier of Queensland .
The ancient bones of Australovenator Wintonensis - nicknamed Banjo after Australian poet Banjo Paterson - were found with two other species near the Queensland outback town of Winton , Australia .
Numerous other fossilised bones have been uncovered in recent years .
Palaeontologist Scott Hocknull analyses the dinosaur fossils retrieved from the Outback site
Researchers excavate at the Queensland site where three new species of dinosaurs were found
' Banjo was the fast - running cheetah of his time - light and agile , ' Queensland Museum 's palaeontologist Scott Hocknull , one of the scientists who discovered the dinosaurs said .
' He could run down most prey with ease over open ground .
Unlike some theropods that have small arms - think T.rex - Banjo was different .
His arms were a primary weapon .
' He 's Australia 's answer to the velociraptor , but many times bigger and more terrifying . '
Matilda ( above ) was a solid animal similar to a hippo .
Clancy ( below ) was more graceful like a giraffe .
Both were plant eaters .
This graphic shows the fossils found of the newly - discovered Diamantinasaurus matildae species dubbed ' Matilda ' ( right and left cross section )
The other two dinosaurs have been given named Clancy , as in Clancy of the Overflow who features in a famous Australian poem , and Matilda , of waltzing fame .
Scientists say that Matilda was no small fry .
It weighed 20 tons , stood 14ft high and was up to 70 ft long .
It was a solid and robust animal , similar to the hippopotamus of today .
Clancy was a much taller and more graceful animal and may have been Australia 's prehistoric answer to the giraffe .
Two of the dinosaurs were found buried together in an ancient ' billabong ' or waterhole .
' Billabongs are a built - in part of the Australian mind because we associate them with mystery , ghosts and monsters , ' said Scott Hocknull , lead author of the discovery .
The fossils retrieved of ' Clancy ' , Wintonotitan wattsi , and ' Banjo ' , Australovenator wintonensis are shown
Palaeontologist Ben Kear at La Trobe University in Melbourne said the discovery will pave the way for new studies on Australian dinosaurs and their environments .
' Australia is one of the great untapped resources in our current understanding of life from the age of dinosaurs , ' Mr Kear said .
' The discoveries ... will definitely reinvigorate interest in the hitherto tantalizingly incomplete , but globally significant record from this continent . '
This market is going no where fast , similar to the golfers at the US Open .

This morning we have a draft to digest that states that European leaders have Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœspotted the first signs of a sustainable economic recoveryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not about rare artifacts !
They conclude that the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlooming end of the recession makes additional stimulus unnecessaryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
They must now shift their focus as there is a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœclear need for a reliable and credible exit strategy Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Next weeks FOMC could be a snoozer , market expects that they will reconfirm low rates for a long time , but , will they say anything about an exit strategy ?
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 11 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsubduedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US data was full of surprises .
The Philly Fed did a big u-turn and improved 90 % from its last print ( - 2.2 vs. - 22.6 ) .
The reading may suggest that the manufacturing sector may be close to inventory stabilization ( shipments turning positive ) , despite being in contraction territory .
The Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœglass half - fullÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ analysts do not expect the elation to remain as they pointed out that Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsomeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ past improvements have ended up reversing substantially in subsequent months .
But looking at the details , rapidly depleting inventory levels ( a curse in the past ) suggest that manufacturers have leg room to beef up production once again .
Shipments led the improvement with the contraction in new orders also slowing significantly .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that future business activity jumped to 60.1 , which may imply expansion for the next 6 - months !
On the job front , US continuing claims and not initial jobless was the eye popping stat .
yesterday .
Initial came in on expectation ( +608 k ) , while continuing , after reaching record highs week after week fell for the 1st - time this year ( 6.687 m vs. 6.835 m ) .
On the face of it , it seems that firms are hiring again .
But , with jobless claims remaining range - bound , it suggests that firms are still cutting the workforce !
We should expect to see another 5 - handle in next months NFP when last months birth / death anomaly rights itself !
The USD $ currently is weaker against the EUR +0.31 % , GBP +0.17 % , CHF +0.11 % and higher against JPY - 0.22 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.22 % and AUD +0.57 % .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Canadian data surprised the market , headline and core-inflation rose more than expected last month ( +0.7 % and +0.1 % respectively ) .
Similar to the US trend headline CPI will likely post gains on a monthly basis , supported by high energy and food prices while core - CPI will likely moderate .
The moderation should occur because of the appreciation of the loonie and expectations that the CAD will continue to gain strength over the next year .
This will in effect put pressure on import prices which will eventually trickle into core - CPI .
Digging deeper , it was the + 8.3 % , m/ m , jump in gas prices and the +0.2 % gain in food prices that pushed the CPI headline higher .
The report will take some pressure off the BOC to initiate quantitative easing any time soon .
Stronger US data is giving both equities and commodities a leg up and by default with a higher risk tolerance investors covet higher yielding assets .
With the USD under renewed pressure expect dealers to want to buy the loonie on any dollar rallies in the short term .
In the O/N session the AUD remained better bid as positive US equity futures encouraged speculative buying of higher yielding currencies .
All week commodity currencies have been driven by the direction of global equities ( 0.8052 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 71.82 up +45 c ) .
Oil traded on the softer side yesterday mostly on the back of the surprising weekly EIA report .
The report showed a bigger - than - expected gain in supplies of motor fuel .
Gas inventories climbed +3.39 m barrels to +205 m , w/w ( the biggest increase in 6 - months ) .
The increase was more than 6 - times bigger than analysts had predicted , all in time for the holiday driving season in the US !
On the flip side , crude oil stocks declined - 3.87 m barrels to +357.7 m , double expectations .
A bearish report for commodity prices , despite the fall in crude , over the next couple of months expect the market to focus on the driving season that ends on US Labor Day .
Global concerns on the longevity of this recession continue to weigh on energy demand and by default prices .
Already this week the USD has struggled intraday , one day itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s declining on the back of BRIC countries contemplating reducing their dependency on the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœmighty greenbackÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and the next day itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s climbing as we question the length of the recession .
This market is all about the negative correlation of commodities and the USDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s movements .
With the greenback stalling in O/N action yesterday , combined with floundering equity markets has given the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ a small bid as an alternative investment for a hedging strategy this morning ( $ 933 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,786 up +82 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,833 down - 5 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,325 up + 44 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s backed up 12 bp yesterday ( 3.81 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Surprising US data is suggesting some relief is near in this recession coupled with the US governmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcement of $ 104 b
Treasury auctions next week , slightly higher than anticipated , continues to weigh on FI prices .
The Treasury will auction $ 40 b - 2 , $ 37 b - 5 and $ 27b-7Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s .

A bright spot appears in this image of Venus , captured by Venus Express on 19 July ( Image : ESA / MPS )
A new , bright spot in the clouds of Venus was found by amateur astronomer Frank Melillo on 19 July ( Illustration : Melillo / Maxson / ESA / University of Wisconsin- Madison / ALPO )
A strange spot emerged on Venus last week , and astronomers are not sure what caused it .
They hope future observations will reveal whether volcanic activity , turbulence in the planet ’s atmosphere , or charged particles from the sun are to blame .
Amateur astronomer Frank Melillo of Holtsville , New York , first spotted the new feature , which is brighter than its surroundings at ultraviolet wavelengths , on the planet ’s southern hemisphere on 19 July .
That same day , an amateur observer in Australia found a dark spot on Jupiter that had been caused by a meteoroid impact .

The Venus spot was confirmed by other observers , and images from Europe ’s Venus Express , the only spacecraft in orbit around the planet , later revealed that the spot had appeared at least four days before Melillo saw it .
Observations show that the spot had already spread out somewhat by the end of last week , and astronomers are awaiting more recent observations from Venus Express .
The spot is bright at ultraviolet wavelengths , which may argue against a meteoroid impact as a cause .
That ’s because rocky bodies , with the exception of objects very rich in water ice , should cause an impact site to darken at ultraviolet wavelengths as it fills with debris that absorbs such light , says Sanjay Limaye of the University of Wisconsin - Madison and a member of the Venus Express team .
Powerful eruption ?
Another possibility is that a gust of charged particles from the sun could have created the glow by energising a patch of the upper atmosphere .
Alternatively , waves in the atmosphere , which trigger turbulence and are thought to carry material up and down , could have concentrated bright material to create the spot .
A volcanic eruption is another suspect .
Venus boasts the most volcanoes of any planet in the solar system , and nearly 90 % of its surface is covered by basaltic lava flows , although no ‘ smoking gun ’ has yet been found for current volcanic activity .
But an eruption would have had to be very powerful to punch through a dense layer in Venus ’s atmosphere to create the spot some 65 to 70 kilometres above the planet ’s surface .
“ It ’s fair to say something unusual happened on Venus .
Unfortunately , we do n’t know what happened , ” Limaye told New Scientist .
Volcanic gases
Two spectrometers on board Venus Express might help reveal the culprit .
One directly measures the spectrum of light emanating from the planet , while the other can measure trace constituents in the atmosphere by measuring how gases there absorb sunlight .
These instruments could reveal changes in the size distribution of particles in the atmosphere and higher concentrations of molecules , such as sulphur dioxide , that could suggest a volcanic eruption .
If a volcano is to blame , proving it will be difficult .
Even if Venus Express finds higher - than - average levels of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere , the observation could be explained by non-volcanic processes , cautions Limaye .
Sunlight can break down sulphuric acid in Venus ’s clouds to create sulphur dioxide , which may not be evenly circulated in the planet ’s atmosphere .
Mystery world
This is not the first time astronomers have spotted bright features in Venus ’s atmosphere .
Bright spots have been seen from Earth for decades , although they have not been clearly explained , Limaye says .
The most recent dramatic brightening occurred in January 2007 , when areas in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the planet brightened .
Because it is localised in a spot , this new feature looks different , but it is equally mysterious .
“ This shows how much we do n’t know about Venus , ” Limaye says .
In some ways , Venus is a simpler planet than Earth – it has no oceans and because of its nearly vertical spin axis , practically no seasons , he adds .
But planetary scientists still do not understand what causes the planet ’s atmosphere to rotate 60 times faster than the planet itself .
Republicans Test 2010 Message : Cancel the Stimulus
Created : July 10 , 2009 08:46 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

The day after President Obama signed the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act , Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) took to the airwaves to offer voters a different kind of new deal .
“ If the American people will let the Republicans back in charge , ” said Gohmert on the Feb. 19 episode of Sean Hannity ’s Fox News show , “ the 60 percent of this bill that wo n’t be spent until after the next election , we ’ll cut it off and let it go to the Americans . ”
Image by : Matt Mahurin
That idea did n’t immediately take .
In February , support for the economic stimulus package that passed with no Republican votes in the House and only three ( including that of Sen. Arlen Specter , who later switched parties ) in the Senate , was above 50 percent .
The March 31 special election for New York ’s upstate 20th congressional district , an early test of a hard - edged Republican message opposing the stimulus , ended with an upset victory for now - Rep. Scott Murphy ( D - N.Y . ) .
But as unemployment numbers rise , and as the Obama administration is forced to admit that its early projections of what the stimulus package would achieve were overly optimistic , Republicans are returning to that February vote and hanging it around the necks of vulnerable Democrats .
Increasingly , they are echoing Gohmert ’s enthusiastic pledge to scrap whatever stimulus money is left in January 2011 . cancel the rest of the stimulus spending . ”
On Wednesday , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) took to Twitter to make a similar argument : the Republican National Committee gave its first - ever Grassroots Logic Award to Matthias Shapiro , a Utah IT consultant who directed a viral video that portrayed the spending and job growth promises of the stimulus as stacks of pennies being shoved off of a coffee table .
The return of the stimulus as a political weapon for Republicans as members in both houses of Congress have pre-emptively pushed back against the unpopular idea of a second crack at an economic rescue bill .
It also comes as the party and its candidates grow increasingly confident that the stimulus , by failing so far to meet the projections of President Obama and congressional Democrats , is the key to a midterm election argument that the majority party is making matters worse by spending so much money .
“ We ’re hitting this message every day , ” said one House Republican aide , who boiled the party ’s mantra down to three words .
“ Where ’s the jobs ?
Where ’s the jobs ?
Where ’s the jobs ?
[ Democrats ] ca n’t answer that . ”
There is some variance in the anti-stimulus mantra .
Not all Republicans are going as far as Gohmert , Hatch , or Kyl .
On a Thursday conference call that was organized to rebut Vice President Joe Biden on his trip to Ohio , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , would only say that Republicans would “ certainly revisit ” the stimulus , and the money left to be allocated , if they won a majority in the 2010 elections .
“ Whatever is left in January 2011 ought to get a lot of scrutiny , ” Boehner said .
“ I would suggest to you that a lot of it could be cut , because at the end of the day , most of the stimulus money was about creating more government , not creating more jobs . ”
At an event promoting his book “ Saving Freedom , ” Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) said Republicans would miss an opportunity if they did n’t talk about the stimulus in those terms .
“ We need to start talking about it , ” DeMint said , referring to the money that might be left to be allocated in 2011 , “ because we need to turn it into tax cuts instead of government spending . ”
According to Republican pollster John McLaughlin , Republicans are benefiting from an “ evolution ” in the way voters view the stimulus , and the way that it has become blurred with banking industry bailouts , foreclosure prevention plans , and other Democratic plans as a wave of spending that has failed to stem rising unemployment .
“ Initially , ” said McLaughlin , “ in February , if you asked people if they were against a stimulus program , it was like asking :
Are you against stimulating the economy ?
Since then there ’s been more of a consensus that the level of spending is too high . ”
Voters are n’t grateful for the small tax cut included in the stimulus , said McLaughlin , because “ very few people will say they got it , and it ’s been overwhelmed by the state taxes they pay , which have been going up . ”
Republicans such as DeMint have argued that doubts about the stimulus reflect increasing doubts about the growth of government and increases in spending .
Dan Schnur , a Republican strategist who is now a lecturer at the University of California , Berkeley , said that a much more simple worry was at play .
“ It ’s never been clear that people vote on the deficit , ” said Schnur , who worked for Ronald Reagan ’s 1984 re-election campaign .
“ Right now , anti-deficit concerns may be a placeholder for broader concerns about the economy .
For the Democrats to take this back and get credit for the stimulus , the economy does n’t have to be recovered , but voters have to believe it ’s recovering .
You can be a mile inside of hell as long as you ’re heading out . ”
Steve Stivers , a Republican who lost a congressional race by a razor - thin margin in Ohio last year in a district carried by Barack Obama , is one of the 2010 candidates betting that voters wo n’t be taking the Democrats ’ side on the stimulus .
He launched his bid this month , attacking Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy ( D ) for “ spending trillions , growing the size of government ” and creating a debt that “ our children ca n’t afford . ”
In an interview with TWI , Stivers declined a chance to say , like Hatch or Kyl , that he would cancel the rest of the stimulus money .
“ There were good parts and bad parts of the stimulus , ” Stivers said .
“ Some of the spending eased human suffering , and no one wants that , regardless of where you are on the political spectrum .
What you need to stay focused on is how to improve the economy in the long term .
Government spending is not going to do that unless you want a bigger government sector , and that ’s not something that creates wealth for the rest of the economy . ”
Stivers debated a recent argument made by Christina Romer , the chairman of the president ’s Council of Economic Advisers , that cutting back on spending during a recession led to disaster when it was tried in 1937 .
“ I do n’t think too many historians will argue that anything brought us out of the Depression except for World War II . ”
Republican pollsters and strategists agreed that opposing the stimulus is a safe bet for Republicans ; Schnur suggested that unless some recovery was visible by March 2010 , the electorate would decided that the president ’s policy had failed and be more receptive to Republican attacks on spending and deficits .
Liberal - leaning economists do n’t disagree .
“ Obama hurt himself politically from the outset , ” said Dean Baker , the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
“ I do n’t think he ever clearly made the case for the stimulus .
Also , Democrats have been demagoguing about the deficit for years .
It would have been very difficult for them to turn around and explain why they did n’t want small deficits right now .
They decided that they could n’t make the case . ”
The National Republican Congressional Committee has confirmed those worries , dogging Democrats in vulnerable seats with attacks on their votes for the stimulus .
On Thursday , NRCC spokesman Paul Lindsay pointed to a special election in upstate New York — a district being vacated by Rep. John McHugh ( R - N.Y. ) which , as it happens , borders the district Democrats won on March 31 — as the next test to see how the stimulus will play politically .
“ Democrats have painted a large target on NY - 23 , ” Lindsay said .
“ It ’s district they see as competitive .
They see it as one they can win .
So you ’ll probably see a lot of signs there as to whether they want to make stimulus an issue or not . ”
Legalization of Marijuana is one of the most important civil liberties issues facing Americans .
90 % of all drug interdiction efforts are aimed at marijuana .
The Denver voters voted not once , but twice , to stop marijuana arrests .
Yet the response from the Denver prosecution / police industry is to increase arrests .
It is truly a culture war issue .
Junkies are junkies but pot smokers are liberal free - thinkers .
This is why there is so much effort is put into this issue by those with a Statist mentality .
The same people who promulgate torture and indefinite detention .
I see the issues of Drug War , and serious human rights abuses over the last 8 years as closely related issues .
I hope that people consider supporting MPP , they have just a tiny group of supporters , yet we can see many successes over the last few years .
Sorry - I wo n't be able to hang around too much today , gotta put up a new server for my business .

[ This talk was presented at the A Century of Struggle — Laborism and the radical alternative : Lessons for today conference , held in Melbourne , Australia , on May 30 , 2009 .

By Jeremy Smith
Why have we scheduled this talk ?
First , I want to mark part of the historical memory of the working class in a modest way .
Second , it helps pull apart the myths of the Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) and Laborism .
Third , it addresses a century - long debate which goes back to the Victorian Socialist Party ( VSP ) and the Wobblies ( Industrial Workers of the World , IWW ) ; a debate which remains unresolved .
The high hopes held for Labor when it has been elected and the bitterest of disappointments felt after its failure to deliver leave for us lessons too easily forgotten .
We need to remind ourselves of those lessons .
I will focus on expectations held of Labor coming into office ( and the high hopes dashed ) .
The record of the ALP ’s capture of government federally suggests it is hapless to say the least , often taking power in periods of impending crisis and not in the upswings of the capitalist cycle .
This talk breaks into two parts :
From Labor prime ministers Andrew Fisher through to Jim Scullin where hopes of protection from poverty were confounded
Rudd which involved a process of ``modernisation ’’
The line of continuity from Gough Whitlam through to KevinRudd which involved a process of ``modernisation ’’
Labor after Federation through to the Great Depression
Labor ’s success in Australia had no parallel in the world to that time .
John Watson became the world ’s first Labor Party prime minister when he briefly took office in 1904 .
Andrew Fisher came next in 1910 , when Labor enjoyed a clean sweep of both houses of parliament in the election that year .
This was the first stable Labor government in the world and the first stable federal government in Australia .
It came in during times of good fortune and a buoyant economy .
With the benefit of hindsight , we can say that these were the best conditions any Labor government has met .
A number of new measures marked this government : a progressive land tax , the extension of pensions and increased welfare expenditure .
The Commonwealth Bank and Commonwealth Shipping Line were founded .
Make no mistake , this was about nation - building , not socialism .
It was white nation - building also with a distinct emphasis on the gendered division of labour .
The full system of arbitration gave the government a state institution to deflect union demands onto .
At this early time , we can see firm pressure for the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to adopt interpretation of party platform .
Along with Billy Hughes , Fisher pushed for this .
Even during the period in which Labor enjoyed the best prospects the tension between party policy and Labor ’s leaders in government was there .
Labor lost power for a short time but was elected to federal government again in 1914 .
Entry into World War I tested the bid of internationalists for strong opposition to war ( which was echoed in the VSP and Victorian Trades Hall Council ) and the pro-Empire nationalists .
Fisher said during the 1914 election campaign that Australia would ``stand behind Britain … to our last man and last shilling ’’.
This seems unsurprising , this was the party of the White Australia policy .
It was the party of stout national defence which was understood to mean defence of the wider British Empire .
For a time , the pro-Empire nationalists , led by Hughes , prevailed .
Disappointment with the Labor government ’s unwillingness to protect workers in times of heavy profit - taking ( and in fact , it attacked workers who struck for better wages ) ensued .
The indisputable conclusion of the war years must be that opposition to conscription spoiled Hughes and the Labor leadership ’s commitment of all - out sacrifice for the war .
It precipitated an undeclared split when Hughes and 21 others walked out of the Labor parliamentary caucus .
More than that , the fatigue from poverty and inequality exacerbated by war effort left federal Labor with little support .
The 1917 NSW general strike showed the loss of faith in federal Labor .
Hughes helped to form the new conservative party ( the Nationalist Party ) after he walked out .
Split and deeply demoralised , Labor lost in 1917 .
It slid from national preeminence to the purgatory of opposition until 1928 - 29 .
The 1920s is remembered mythically for ``prosperous times ’’.
However , the return to pre-war living standards was uneven and took time .
In fact , it was a period of cyclical recessions and booms , a bit like the 1990s .
There was a slump coming into the 1929 election which prompted the conservative Stanley Bruce government to try and undo the arbitration system as a prelude to an all - out assault on the trade union movement .
Scullin and the Depression
Labor ran in the 1929 election on a straightforward platform : ``Before : Bruce - Page government : Slump .
After : Labor government : Prosperity . ’’
Labor ’s prospects seemed good at the point of their 1929 victory .
Labor held all Australian governments in 1929 .
The federal swing to labor had been fairly uniform ( outside of Queensland ) .
Thus Jim Scullin came to power in mid-1929 with rising unemployment ( running at 12 % ) and strikes in mining industry and on the wharves .
But he assumed office unsuspectingly ahead of the Depression .
Labor had promised to maintain the federal arbitration system , increase tariffs and deal with unemployment .
On that basis it had smashed Bruce ’s conservative government at the polls .
However , the Senate [ Australia ’s federal upper house ] was still in the grip of a conservative majority ( Labor had only seven senators ) .
Many opportunities for a double - dissolution election presented in the first 12 months of government were not taken .
Some in the Labor caucus urged a double dissolution , but the leadership lacked the resolve to tackle the Senate and initiate more radical measures .
Labor soon faced problems that it had no experience in and had not even guessed at while in opposition .
Severe budget deficits , a critical imbalance of payments and declining commodity prices on world markets were difficulties that Labor ’s leaders had not anticipated .
They were naïve economically — indeed clueless — and lacked the will to pursue socialist solutions .
They thus drifted inexorably towards the prevailing orthodoxy of monetarism .
Remember that , strictly speaking , this was the pre-Keynesian era .
Whilst John Keynes was a working economist of some note at this time , his major works setting out the Keynesian system of public financing were yet to be penned .
There were those who believed in an expansionary approach to government spending ( in the Labor Party ’s left wing for example ) , but the dominant economic theory of the day held that balanced budgets were necessary under nearly all circumstances .
The Depression crashed down on the Labor government a mere two days after its cabinet was sworn in .
Without doubt this was rotten luck .
Early in the government ’s term , Sir Otto Niemeyer ( an establishment figure from the Bank of England ) toured Australia .
He prescribed a program of drastic cuts in public spending through all tiers of government .
Scullin and the state governments agreed – there was to be no resistance from Labor governments .
In this the Scullin government failed dismally to meet its commitments made in the 1929 election , with the one exception of tariff increases .
Note that all governments retreated into protectionism during the Great Depression .
Australia ’s trade fell by almost 60 % so the impact of increased tariffs was far less than that anticipated before the 1929 election .
Agreeing to Niemeyer ’s plan did not allow Scullin to make inroads into unemployment ( which worsened ) .
Lowered government spending cut off the avenue of public sector jobs .
A 20 % reduction in pensions was intended to pursue the holy grail of a balanced budget .
Arbitration would be maintained by legislation introduced by Labor into the House of Representatives .
But it was re-written by the Senate in 1930 and then further stripped of pro-union conciliation provisions by the High Court .
The Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) launched only muted criticisms of Scullin at this point .
Those became slightly louder when the Arbitration Court lowered wages by 10 % in January 1931 .
The ACTU ignored its own policies ; it shared the naive belief of the government that the economy was about the turn the corner at any time .
Resistance and `rats ’
Of course , there was significant resistance from within the Labor Party and amongst the union movement at large .
At the government level different plans were developed to deal with the crisis .
Joe Lyons hatched a plan of Labor ’s right wing .
``Red Ted ’’
Theodore drafted a more expansionary version of Scullin ’s approach .
It was evident that Labor was unable and unwilling to fulfill its election promises .
From Labor ’s left came the Lang plan ( after New South Wales Labor Premier Jack Lang ) .
It contained three elements : default on interest payments to British bondholders , abandon the gold standard and reduce interest on government borrowing to 3 % .
There was nothing radical about this .
The gold standard was defunct .
Lang had rejected ``repudiation ’’ of the debt at his first election ( even when the NSW peak trade union body , the NSW Labor Council had endorsed it ) , so the default on interest payments did not signal a comprehensive moratorium on debt repayments .
The Lang Plan went nowhere .
However , it marked a distinction between Lang Labor and the federal party .
Labor was devastated at the 1931 federal election .
Lyons split to the right when the Labor cabinet refused to implement his plan .
Like Hughes before him , he ratted to the conservative other side of parliamentary politics and played a crucial part in consolidating the United Australia Party – Australia ’s new conservative alliance .
Jack Lang
The Lang Plan set up a lasting conflict between federal Labor and Lang Labor , which became two separate parties .
The struggle was fought out in the federal party and in faction fighting in NSW .
Was Lang a viable pole of attraction for left opponents ?
Politically , he was a redemptive figure and a demagogue ; the ``Big Fella ’’ as his supporters called him .
But he too implemented deflationary measures , whilst railing with fiery rhetoric against the ``money power ’’ of British finance .
He also begrudgingly went along with the 1931 Premiers Plan , which included a 20 % cut in government expenditure ( including the notorious 10 % cut in wages ) .
Things came to a head in 1932 in Lang ’s confrontation with the conservative Lyons government and the crypto- fascist New Guard and Old Guard organising in NSW .
Lang ’s fate was to be sacked by the NSW governor .
Lang went quietly to fight an election ( much like Gough Whitlam would 43 years later ) .
There were mass election rallies , but no sustained mobilisation and nothing outside of the context of parliamentary elections .
Labor was lost in the wilderness until the Second World War .
Some brief comment on the John Curtin and Ben Chifley administrations are worth making .
These were wartime governments with wartime emergency measures .
They instituted a high level of regulation of business and finance .
The private banks resisted after the hostilities of war ceased .
If there was an aim it was the ``light on the hill ’’ : full employment , but not socialism .
The resistance of private banks to regulation ( which was intended to contribute to the goal of full employment ) led Chifley to the botched bank nationalisation campaign of 1949 .
This was not a socialist program , but the extension of regulatory powers necessary for reconstruction .
They did n’t sell it really as they were too fearful of an anticommunist backlash to mount a serious campaign .
In fact , the idea unified conservative forces politically .
The right was able to use bank workers even as their cadre ( note that bank workers were quite privileged in those days ) .
At the same time , Labor launched an attack on the coalminers ’ union .
Labor ’s perceived inability to ``control communist - led unions ’’ strengthened Robert Menzies new Liberal Party .
Labor lost ignominiously in 1949 .
From Whitlam on : modernising neoliberalism
The early achievements of Gough Whitlam ’s 1972 Labor government can be credited to the efforts of the social movements .
An early milestone was the end of participation in the US war in Vietnam .
But this was very clearly the culmination of years of anti-war movement mobilisations .
The equal pay case was reopened , but this was driven by a campaign of women workers .
The contraceptive pill was listed in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ; a landmark of some years of mass consciousness raising and movement activity associated with the second wave of feminism .
Subsequent to these early achievements , Whitlam funded a significant expansion of tertiary education and did so on the back of the abolition of fees and the establishment of a living student allowance .
All levels of public education were expanded .
Note that this designed to modernise Australia ’s workforce during the course of the 1970s .
It expanded and deepened the skills base and cultural capital of Australian capitalism .
The settings were then geared for a fast - growing services sector .
Certainly the investment in education was a social benefit .
But it was also oriented to an anticipated high - tech economy of late capitalism .
The universal health insurance scheme Medibank was a memorable reform .
It matched insurance schemes of other OECD countries .
It was savaged by conservative government led by Malcolm Fraser , which defeated Whitlam in 1975 .
Multiculturalism was a term coined during Whitlam ’s government which included the first minister for multiculturalism in Al Grassby .
In fact , the end of the notorious White Australia policy had come earlier in response to lively student protests in the mid-1960s .
Those protests focused the perception that Australia could be diplomatically isolated like South Africa was becoming in the 1960s ( and therefore disadvantaged economically ) .
Multiculturalism was inaugurated with Whitlam but the bulk of public policy changes occurred during the Fraser years .
Aboriginal land rights were famously promised and a number of symbolic ( though undeniably important ) measures were taken .
Legislation to institute land rights was drafted but did not pass before the dramatic November 11 , 1975 , sacking of the Whitlam Labor government by the governor - general John Kerr .
The talk of modernisation and nation - building foreshadowed Bob Hawke - Paul Keating governments of the 1980s and ‘ 90s .
It was laced with a rhetoric of ``new nationalism ’’ to distinguish it from the anachronistic Britain - loyal Liberals of the Menzies era .
They called for a new flag and anthem , which did n’t amount to much but was important symbolically .
Its policies were offset by fierce anti-US statements borne of backbencher frustration .
At the cabinet level , however , an independent role in international affairs was championed .
Australia was to be a ``medium - sized power ’’ in the region , according to Whitlam .
While foreign policy drew Australia out of the Vietnam War and damned white - minority - ruled Rhodesia , it also turned to support the US - Backed dictator of Indonesia Suharto and was complicit in the invasion of East Timor .
Openness to China was foresighted – in that Whitlam sensed a future lucrative economic relationship .
His visit to Beijing was followed within days by an announcement that US President Richard Nixon would also visit .
In matters of the state and the economy , Hawke - Keating sympathiser Paul Kelly ( in The End of Certainty ) sums matters up well : deregulation , once started , develops a momentum of its own .
If Kelly is right , then Whitlam was the starting point .
Whitlam started the long process of dismantling Australia ’s protectionism .
Industry tariffs were cut by 25 % in 1974 .
Handouts to industry .
They provided fuel for profits , with few guarantees against job losses .
Whitlam ’s enthusiasm for market forces was undeniable .
He curbed restrictive trade practices , abolished the federal wealth tax and set in place anti-inflationary policy .
The overarching aim was increased competition and marketisation of the economy .
Certainly he did not go nearly as far as Hawke and Keating .
But these initiatives were the necessary precursor to the 1980s .
The test came when times got tough .
The last Whitlam Labor budget handed down by the treasurer Bill Hayden in 1975 brought the first cuts to welfare and education spending for many years .
The Hawke - Keating years and the Accord
The key innovation of the Hawke - Keating governments was the Prices and Incomes Accord .
It was the centerpiece of Laborism in the 1980s .
Wage ``restraint ’’ was supposed to be the trade - off for a promised comprehensive improvement in the ``social wage ’’ i.e. welfare , increase health and education spending etc. .
Once inflation was brought under control , then the real purchasing power would be restored .
Tax reform would be brought in for low income earners .
This was a big promise , but it was not long before it was disowned .
Medicare [ the original Medibank was savaged by the Fraser government ] — the main lasting welfare reform of the era — came with the first tranche of ``restraint ’’ .
There was no indexed pay rises to compensate for the inflationary effects of the Medicare levy introduced with the public health insurance system .
Taken as a whole , there were few positive results in terms of the social wage early on .
Over the course of Accord Mark II ( 1985 - 7 ) there were in fact cuts to public spending .
Over the era of the different versions of the Accord , calculations of workers ’ lost real purchasing power vary depending on which source you consult or what period you are measuring ( and then whether you measure average weekly earnings or take award pat rates as a guide ) .
One reliable estimate is as follows : between the years 1982 and 1993 , 17 - 28 % was lost across award rates .
Women workers suffered disproportionately .
Look at this as a ratio of wages : profits ( this is an indicator of the terms of struggle of labour and capital ) .
Wages as a percentage of GDP fell from 74 % when Hawke took power to 63.3 % by 1990 .
Tax relief was promised .
But the largest tax cuts went to the top wage and salary earners – so much for the claims that Accord would reduce the gap between low - and high - income earners .
Taxation increased overall under Hawke , despite the fact that the government embraced economic rationalism .
It is widely recognised in the trade union movement today that the Accord failed to meet its promises .
The few of us who forecast that outcome in the early 1980s were treated as pariahs .
Perhaps the greatest problem was the strategic and political loss , and not just material losses in purchasing power .
A clue to this was that the Accords Mark III and IV introduced the principle of demonstrable productivity gains into the strategy of union negotiators .
Clever negotiation became the real art of union business rather than workplace organisation and activity .
This hints at the larger effect of Accord politics .
The Accord process bonded union leaders to the government in an unprecedented fashion .
The business of trade union organising became trying to wield influence at the level of government policy making and implementation , not shopfloor and workplace organisation and campaigning .
Grassroots workplace structures declined through neglect in many places .
Above all the government ’s relationship with unions was used to temper union militancy and independence : the smashing and marginalisation of the Builders ’ Labourers Federation , the pilots and meatworkers as the rest of a union movement was unwilling to break politically with the ALP and its Accord corporatism .
Even the state - based struggle of Victorian nurses in 1986 felt the straitjacket of the Accord .
This was the political cost of the long Labor period of 1983 - 1996 and we ’re still paying it .
It left most trade unions in no condition to take advantage what benefits could be salvaged from enterprise bargaining .
The low paid lost the benefits of centralised wage fixation .
Welfare and Indigenous rights
A promise to tackle Indigenous issues emerged .
It was symbolised in the pledge to extend Aboriginal land rights .
Hawke did n’t have the stomach to stand up to far - right scare campaign in the mid-1980s about the supposed seizure of resources which would be locked away under land rights .
The campaign was well backed by the Western Mining Corporation and its key ``New Right ’’ leader Hugh Morgan .
A treaty was pledged in its place but nothing materialised .
During the 1988 bicentennial of British colonisation , Hawke resisted strong calls for a treaty .
Hawke settled for a 10 - year ``reconciliation ’’ plan which may have had some merit in itself , but in this context postponed talking on all issues .
Howard would later withdraw support in his well - known stand - off with nearly all sections of the Aboriginal movement .
Of course there was no movement on Indigenous social issues .
Statistically , decreased inequality between households can be measured during the long Labor decade .
However , the quality of welfare , education and health enjoyed as public goods declined .
To put this another way , the ability to enjoy something closer to universal access to these as community resources declined under the growing economic rationalisation of welfare and the public sector .
User - pays principles sacrificed the ideal of universal access and social rights .
This was sold as the modernisation of Australia .
More than anything else done by the Labor governments , this underlying shift laid the ground for John Howard ’s right - wing government ’s exercise of ``mutual obligation ’’ regulation of welfare and ``voluntary fees ’’ for education and the expansion of private health insurance .
Labor achieved what no Liberal government dared to try : the deregulation of the finance sector .
Foreign banks were admitted and the Australian dollar ``floated ’’.
Major assets were sold : the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas were the largest .
Competition was introduced for Telecom .
The public sector was infused with the principles of economic rationalism while the ranks of the senior public service were re-staffed with the students of the neoliberal schools of public administration .
Kevin Rudd – continuity with modern Laborism
This is a living history so I will only offer a few comments .
Two major sets of undertakings were in the spirit of Labor ’s 2007 campaign , if not spoken in fine detail of policy statements :
The environmental crisis and global warming .
In the rhetoric before the election , it was all about the Howard government ’s failures : it was out of step and it denied the reality of climate change when only a shrinking minority did so .
Labor was short on detail , but what else could the electorate think but that a major change of direction was blowing in the wind ?
The Kyoto Protocol was signed , which looked like a good start .
Then came the Garnaut Report , by economist Ross Garnaut reporting on scientific matters .
The result was inadequate greenhouse - gas emissions targets and little real action to reduce emissions ; a disappointment to everyone alarmed about global warming , and even to Garnaut himself .
At the time of writing , Rudd ’s proposed a carbon trading scheme is in crisis and held up by the Senate .
Its design guarantees billions in free pollution permits to the worst carbon polluters .
More than 18 months since the Rudd government ’s first election , there is next to no progress in this area in which no delay is affordable .
Workchoices .
A program of staged abolition of Howard anti-worker industrial laws has been effected in favour of ``Workchoices lite ’’.
Detailed analysis is available elsewhere and I will make one general comment only .
While marginally less draconian features can be found in the Labor government ’s legislation ( in terms of a wider award safety net for instance ) , the core Workchoices provisions that have sharply curtailed union rights to organise are reproduced in full .
Rudd exemplifies the character of the ALP in government .
There are no vestiges of the language of gentle social - democratic reform ( much less the socialisation objective ) .
He is louder than any other leader about nation - building .
In the past , nation - building in Australia was state - led ( but this has been the norm for mixed capitalist economies ) and occurred through public sector .
Today , government investment occurs in and through ( in ``partnership ’’ with ) private capital .
Conclusion
The test of politics is what is done when there is a crisis .
At the height of the ALP ’s rhetoric , the ideal of socialism was sold to working class with little conviction or substance .
Labor ’s true colours can be observed in its history : Labor is a national capitalist party , the nationalist party par excellence that the traditional conservatives cannot be .
It is the political vehicle best placed to meet the national interests of Australian capital , especially in times of crisis .
His name was Rick , and he drank .
He spent his days on a sandstone ledge on the east side of the 16th Street Mall , outside a vacant building and next to a store where tourists satisfy their cravings for moccasins and carved buffalo heads .
For the most part , Rick did n’t bother anybody , and nobody much bothered with him .
Until he died .
In life , he was probably a source of pain for anyone who cared about him and of smirking derision for any of the thousands who passed him every day — at least among those who noticed him .
But in death , 55 - year - old Richard Allen Johnson commanded attention .
“ He just slumped over ”
He had spent the night of June 29 as he passed countless others : sleeping in a doorway .
At 4 a.m. on the 30th , cleaning crews in their purple shirts showed up to put a morning shine on the 16th Street Mall .
They knew Johnson and his habits well enough to know he was n’t in his regular spot , said Lyn Reed of Service Group Inc. , which contracts with the Downtown Denver Business Improvement District to do mall maintenance .
“ When he did n’t follow his normal routine , they knew he was in trouble , ” Reed said .
At about 7 a.m. , one of the workers asked Johnson to move .
Mall crews are trained , Reed said , in how to be kind to everyone — tourists , drunks , harried office workers and the homeless .
So they asked Johnson to move so he would n’t get hosed off along with the sidewalks .
He got up , Reed said , and moved to a bench between the Corner Bakery and the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory .
And then , “ he just slumped over , ” Reed said .
Mall worker Lorenzo Delgado reached a gloved hand down to Johnson ’s neck and felt for a pulse .
It was at that moment that Charlie Dalbec , practicing with his new camera on the mall , noticed what was happening and snapped a photograph that he later e-mailed to The Denver Post .
By the time Charlie Dalbec had clicked the shutter , Richard Johnson was dead .
Identifying the homeless
The last time homeless advocates tried to count them , on Jan. 29 , 2007 , they found 10,604 homeless men , women and children in metro Denver .
Of those , about 8 percent , or 412 , were considered chronically homeless , according to BJ Iacino of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless .
More than 90 percent of those were men .
Today , the number of chronically homeless — which means they ’ve had no place to live for a year or more — may be smaller , Iacino said .
Since its 2005 launch , Denver ’s Road Home estimates about 36 percent of the city ’s chronic homeless have been coaxed off the streets .
The coalition estimates that in 2007 , 357 people got a place to live who had n’t had one before .
Still , as 2009 opened , the Downtown Denver Partnership decided the 16th Street Mall needed special attention and “ asked St. Francis Center for intense outreach , ” said partnership spokeswoman Sarah Neumann .
Outreach workers at St. Francis Center , which provides shelter , food and counseling for homeless people , canvassed the mall .
They identified 23 people as chronically homeless .
Rick Johnson was one of those .
Of those , four have gotten housing , Neumann said .
Rick Johnson was not one of those .
It ’s not that they did n’t try , said Jim Boberschmidt , one of the St. Francis outreach workers .
“ At least five or six outreach workers had invited him into housing , ” Boberschmidt said .
“ He repeatedly turned down the offers . ”
Occasionally , Johnson would agree .
“ But I ’m not sure it was n’t more to get us off his back , ” Boberschmidt said .
Whatever his demons , Boberschmidt said , Johnson did n’t share them .
While the city ’s investment — almost $ 60 million by the time Denver ’s Road Home runs its 10 - year course — in affordable housing and job counseling has helped hundreds of people leave the streets , there are some who just ca n’t make it .
Or wo n’t .
Often , that stubbornness comes from a bottle , or a pill , or a mental illness , Boberschmidt said .
“ Unfortunately , an individual ’s right overtakes our ability to bring them inside . ”
Remembering the man
It did n’t take long for people who work — and live — on the mall to hear the guy they knew as Rick had died .
“ He is every day here , ” said Ablasse , who is from Burkina Faso and sells handbags from a cart parked along the same block that Johnson favored .
He never raised a fuss , never yelled accusations at passers - by , never mumbled or shouted anything about Bible verses and damnation .
But , Ablasse said , he always had an Einstein Bros. cup in his hand .
That ’s because for as long as anybody working at Einstein ’s can recall , which is about three years , Johnson was there when they unlocked the door at 5:30 a.m. every day .
“ Even on Christmas , ” said Chris Selman , who has been a bagel slinger for more than a year .
Johnson would come in , get his coffee , then go out to his spot on the ledge .
He did n’t talk much , Selman said , but did mention that he had kids .
Somewhere .
Few days passed that some tender - hearted paying customer did n’t buy Johnson a sandwich , Selman said .
And there were days when he showed up clean , shaved and combed .
Boberschmidt said Johnson ’s grooming kind of made him stand out among the homeless .
“ He was usually a well - kept guy , ” Boberschmidt said .
Until recently .
“ The last time I ’d seen him , maybe a week before he died , he had the look of someone who ’d given up , ” Boberschmidt said .
On the corner of 16th Street and Tremont Place , a woman named Lovie was hawking The Voice , the weekly newspapers that chronicle homelessness .
She , too , recognized Johnson ’s photo .
But she did n’t know much about him .
“ He never asked for money , I ’ll tell you that , ” Lovie said .
“ We think he drank . ”
All that may be true , but in order to bury him , to let any relatives he might have had know that he died , the Denver medical examiner ’s office needed a little more .
Unraveled life investigated
When he rolled into the medical examiner ’s office that last morning in June , Johnson was wearing a black leather jacket , a blue sweat shirt , a sweater , a pair of black cargo pants , grey sweat pants and white socks .
He was also wearing a wristwatch .
Johnson had a duffle bag , and in his pockets were a comb , nail clippers , a cigarette lighter , a knife and a Christian cross .
In his wallet was $ 5 , and , in a major stroke of luck for the coroner ’s investigator , an ID card and scraps of paper with phone numbers scribbled on them .
More than 100 homeless people die each year in Denver .
More often than not , they end up at the coroner ’s office .
Most undergo an autopsy , which costs , on average , about $ 2,500 .
Johnson ’s body was autopsied .
The coroner still has not determined a cause of death .
The law requires next of kin be notified when someone dies .
But many homeless people have put a lot of years , miles and empty bottles — or delusions , or whatever has hold of them — between themselves and family .
With any luck , a coroner ’s investigator at least has a name to start with .
With a little more luck , that name ’s not quite as common as Johnson .
Before he became a coroner ’s investigator a decade ago , Howard Daniel was a police chief on the island of St. Croix .
So it ’s no surprise that one of the first places he looks for clues to a deceased person ’s life is police records .
In Richard Johnson ’s case , Daniel found plenty there — just not what he was looking for .
“ When someone is arrested , they have the opportunity to name their next of kin , ” Daniel said .
“ He listed none . ”
Next , he tried Denver Health .
Johnson had been a patient there .
But once again , no family members named .
His break came from one of the names scribbled on a piece of paper that had been in Johnson ’s pocket .
It was a friend who lived in Denver and sometimes let Johnson spend the night at his apartment .
The friend , who declined to be interviewed , figured Johnson had been homeless for a decade .
Ten days after he took on the case , Daniel knew Johnson was from Colorado and graduated from Denver ’s East High School .
He had once worked as a cook , and he was married at least once .
He had a brother and a sister , and he had children .
What he could n’t say is how a life that , on paper at least , seemed to have all the right ingredients veered so irrevocably off track .
His friend ’s only explanation , Daniel said , was that “ he just did n’t want to pay alimony . ”
Arrest records for Richard A. Johnson , born Jan. 24 , 1954 , fill up nine pages and date to the 1970s .
The offenses are many and varied , but alcohol is the recurring theme .
There are DUIs , a couple of misdemeanor domestic assaults .
And as his life unraveled , his crimes reflected his plummeting status : sleeping in parks , trespassing , urinating in public .
He almost never showed up in court when he was supposed to .
His last arrest was May 26 .
Boberschmidt said he ’d noticed Johnson ’s drinking getting even worse over the past year .
“ I heard he was being belligerent toward cleaning people in recent weeks .
That ’s not his usual behavior . ”
Finally claimed
Enough people die alone in Denver — at home or on the streets — to keep Daniel busy .
Most of the time , he and his colleagues find someone , somewhere to claim them .
But a dozen times each year , they do n’t .
When that happens , the medical examiner ’s office calls on a handful of mortuaries that take turns donating services , said Michelle Weiss - Samaras , Denver ’s chief deputy coroner .
For families who just can’t afford burial , there may be help from the state .
Every year , the homeless coalition hosts a candlelight vigil for men and women who died on the streets during the previous year .
Last December , volunteers read the names of 142 men and 22 women who lived and died on the streets of the Denver metropolitan area .
“ A half - a - dozen times a year , I get a call or contact from a family member who maybe has Googled and found a loved one on the website , ” the coalition ’s Iacino said .
Sometimes they ’ve been searching for years for a brother or sister , or a parent .
Every time , she said , they thank her for the memorial vigil .
This year , Johnson ’s name will be on that list .
But at least his family wo n’t learn about his death by happenstance .
On July 11 , Daniel called a number in Nebraska , and Johnson ’s daughter answered .
She said she had n’t spoken to her father in 15 years .
Nevertheless , she was concerned about her father and grateful for the call .
She ’ll bury her dad .
In the meantime , Richard Johnson has a place to stay .
For a few more days .

Denver Post researcher Barry Osborne contributed to this report .
Yesterday , Joe Sudbay took a look at the first campaign finance report in the Maine marriage campaign that was released yesterday and found out that national Religious Right groups were dumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into the fight .
Today , the Lewiston Sun Journal took a look as well and concluded that “ the group hoping to overturn Maine ’s same - sex marriage law has out - raised the measure ’s proponents by more than two to one ” :
Stand for Maine Marriage , the group leading the effort for repeal , raised a total of about $ 343,000 from nine donors as of July 5 , the end of the reporting period .
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland contributed $ 100,000 , the Knights of Columbus of Washington , D.C. , chipped in $ 50,000 and Focus on the Family , a Christian group based in Colorado Springs , Colo. , donated $ 31,000 to the political action committee seeking to repeal the gay marriage law .
Nearly half of the group ’s fundraising , $ 160,000 , came from the National Organization for Marriage , a New Jersey - based group established in 2007 “ in response to the growing need for an organized opposition to same - sex marriage in state legislatures , ” according to its Web site .
While Stand for Marriage raised more than $ 340,000 , Maine Freedom to Marry raised about $ 138,000 – but the amazing thing is that of the donations brought in by Freedom to Marry , $ 80,000 came from residents of Maine .
Guess how much of the money raised by Stand for Marriage came from Maine residents ?
The campaign finance report also shows four Maine citizens contributed a total of $ 400 to the cause .
$ 400 ?
That means that , out of the total amount raised , the amount donated by actual residents of Maine to the effort constituted a whopping .1 % , whereas the amount donated by Religious Right groups like NOM and FOF made up the other 99.9 % .
I ca n’t wait to see how this right - wing effort manages to spin this and produce ad claiming to speak on behalf of Mainers who want to protect “ traditional marriage ” considering that actual residents of the state do n’t seem to support the effort at all .
Google ( GOOG ) engineering director Mark Lucovsky will quit the company and join VMware , TechCrunch reports .
The news is a bit ironic because when Google hired Mark from Microsoft ( MSFT ) in 2004 , it angered Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer so much that he threw a chair and called Google CEO Eric Schmidt " a fucking pussy . "
We know this because Mark gave testimony about it in 2005 .
Prior to joining Google , I set up a meeting on or about November 11 , 2004 with Microsoft 's CEO Steve Ballmer to discuss my planned departure .... At some point in the conversation Mr. Ballmer said : " Just tell me it 's not Google . "
I told him it was Google .
At that point , Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office .
Mr. Ballmer then said : " Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy .
I 'm going to fucking bury that guy , I have done it before , and I will do it again .
I 'm going to fucking kill Google . " ....
Thereafter , Mr. Ballmer resumed trying to persuade me to stay .... Among other things , Mr. Ballmer told me that " Google 's not a real company .
It 's a house of cards . "
Mark 's departure is just the latest in a long line of top executives , lawyers and engineers to quit the company this year .

Science in Christian Perspective
Making Sense of Genesis 1
Rikki E. Watts
Regent College
Used by Permission , 2002 .
I nterpreting Genesis 1 continues to be a controversial issueóand for all sorts of people .
This is hardly surprising for at least two reasons .
On one level , how one reads Genesis 1 has in some circles become a litmus test of Christian orthodoxy , whether conservative or liberal .
Hold the " wrong " view and one is either a dupe of secular critical theory or a troglodyte literalist .
This hardly bodes well for the unity of that new humanity that God is forming in Christ .
On another level , the importance of stories of origins cannot be overestimated .
They define us .
They tell us who we are and what it means to be human .
In terms of our topic , whatever the technical merits or otherwise of Darwinís theory of biological evolution , its widespread acceptance has gone a long way toward discrediting a " literal " reading of Genesis 1 and with it the standing of Christianity and its vision of humanity .
Consequently , and rather more provocatively , it is hard to imagine the modern North - American trade in aborted baby body parts or the horrors of Holocaust and Gulag were it not for the stark materialism of , and the eugenic theory inherent in , the more imperialist and triumphalist forms of twentieth - century Darwinism .
However , it must be recognized that it will be difficult if not impossible to reverse these trends if resistance is not undergirded by a more convincing and coherent alternative view of human origins than Darwinism can offer .
And this in terms of both the objectiveówhat happenedóand the subjectiveówhat it means .
For Christians such an alternative must include Genesis 1 and that necessarily involves the question of how it is to be read .
If in the end we find that Genesis 1 ought to be read " literally " , then so be it .
On the other hand , the more work I do on the world out of which this account emerged , the more I am led to question whether the " literalist " reading is in fact truly faithful to the text .
In my experience most Christians and readers of the Bible come to Genesis 1 with many of their beliefs already in hand .
This is not to be dismissed as a typical example of blind private faith versus well - attested public fact , as Bertrand Russell so gloriously misconstrued things .
It is an inescapable part of being human .
Michael Polanyi reminded us that taking a great many things on trust is the essential first step to knowledge , even and perhaps especially in that highest and holiest of all modern callings , science .
All of us , Christians and scientists together , simply have to take a great deal on trust , to assume much , if we are ever to get started on the path to knowing .
The saying is sure , without assuming something no one shall know anything .
But having said that , it is important regularly to reassess those assumptions in the light of our growing knowledge and in doing so to recognize that truth in this kind of historical and literary endeavour is much more a matter of coherence than of certainty .
Bernard Lonergan rightly understood that the first step in knowing was to pay attention to all of the data , then to apply our intelligence in seeking to understand , and finally to use our reason to judge between hypotheses .
This is the advice , which , to the best of my ability , I intend to take here .
Reading Ancient Documents
Our problems begin in that most of us read Genesis 1 in our mother tongue , and that tongue is not Hebrew .
This is both helpful and potentially misleading .
The help is obvious , the potential harm less so .
The fact remains that this story was originally written in another language , a very long time ago , and in a culture whose world , while not totally other than ours , was both different and very differently understood .
In one sense they no doubt looked out on the same physically constituted landscape , but as Lonergan also reminded us : seeing is not the same as knowing .
The assumptions that they once brought and we now bring to the textóGadamerís horizonsóare very likely to be rather different .
That this is so can hardly be contested as the divergent interpretations of Genesis 1 even in our own day bear witness .
The same ink spots generate some very different understandings .
The upshot is that if we are not attentive , the fact that Genesis 1 is in our own language can lull us into assuming that familiar words and phrases are intended to invoke the understandings and assumptions of our twenty - first - century world .
This is , of course , just as much a mistake as reading Shakespeare as though he was writing in twenty - first - century Vancouver or Hong Kong .
Not surprisingly , the less we " modernize " Shakespeare the more foreign he appears and the less likely the error of anachronism .
It is useful , then , to remember that Genesis 1 was originally written in Hebrew , and even better to read it in the same .
The question arises : but even so , whose understanding is correct ?
Do not our individual perspectives mire us in a hopeless relativism ?
Not at all .
These ink spots are not merely signs .
They are particular signs in a particular order .
They are the readersí " marching orders , " designed by the writer to communicate what he intended to the competent reader .
The terms of those marching orders are indicated by the genre , the contract made between writer and reader as to how the signs are to be read .
This is really nothing new since we all get along very well every day on this basis , almost unconsciously using genre to distinguish between the truth claims of Peanuts ( no , there is not in fact a canine whose philosophizing rivals Plato ) and The Vancouver Sun ( but how we wish that some of our politicians were more like Snoopy ! ) .
The trick is to do as much work as we can in determining the genre and in seeking to understand the worldview out of which Genesis 1 emerged .
This will involve not only looking at Genesis 1 in detail but also paying attention to similar stories elsewhere in order to get a feel for the kinds of issues with which the ancients were concerned and the language they used in dealing with them .
The last sentence might generate some anxiety .
There is no need .
When a good preacher or exegete does word studies he or she is not confined only to the biblical texts as though they were written in an hermetically sealed environment .
They also consider how the language functioned in the broader cultural context of the day .
The same surely applies here .
But bear in mind the distinction : we are not talking about borrowing or dependence but rather about the use of common motifs and ideas to deal with common concerns .
The central truth claims of Genesis 1 can be very different from the origins stories of the surrounding cultures even if it uses , as we would expect it to , the language and imagery of the day .
Genre as Reading Contract : Form and Content
Literary genre is communicated to the reader through form and content .
Consider " The Simpsons . "
First , we notice the form .
It is a cartoon , replete with exaggerated colour and character features .
The Simpson family seems to be suffering from a very serious kidney or liver problem , while Margís blue haystack is beyond wonder .
Second , the content .
Ned Flanders can hardly be real , can he ?
Is anyoneís life really this crazy and dysfunctional ?
Further , we have seen other such cartoons and know that they are not " real . "
The form and content together combine to inform us , as competent viewers , that this is not to be taken as an accurate historical account .
But does this mean that " The Simpsons " is not true ?
Of course not .
One of the reasons for its on - going popularity is its caustic wit and perceptive social satire .
William Blakeís famous couplet , " Tiger , tiger , burning bright , in the forests of the night , " is another case in point .
It is true ?
Not if one reads it " literally " as a description of the propensity of feral cats to ignite spontaneously during their nocturnal wanderings .
And protesting with increasingly agitated vigor " Blake says it , I believe it , and that settles it " does not help much .
What Blake actually says is a matter of genre , that is , of form and content .
We recognize the form : poetry .
That means we need to be alert to metaphor , image , and poetic license , whether simplification or hyperbole .
It would be folly , if not downright and culpable stupidity , to demand technical precision from poetry .
We also consider the content .
Tigers do not in our experience habitually explode whilst wandering in dark forests .
These two considerationsóform and contentóhelp us understand what it is that Blake is trying to say .
So is his description true ?
In one very real sense , yes .
Ask yourself , what gives a better understanding of the essence of tigerness : Blakeís simple and stylized couplet or a fifty - five - volume DNA map of tiger genes ?
Two important considerations emerge .
First , in our scientific world it is easy to forget that there are ways of telling the truth other than algebraic formulae or Western - style history .
Furthermore , some of the most important and meaningful things in our lives are best shared using metaphor and poetic image .
Listen to the top 40 and see how often lyrics such as E=mc2 dominate the charts .
The same applies to the biblical text , large slabs of which are not in plodding prose .
Most of the prophets preferred poetry .
This does not mean that what they say is not true .
But in order to make their message more memorable and compelling , they use a genre best suited to that task .
Now , I am not attempting to stack the deck for a particular reading of Genesis 1 .
I am only trying to establish the fact that some of us have a subconscious suspicion of anything other than one particular kind of truth - telling genre to which certain parts of our culture or our upbringing have accustomed us .
In my experience this immediately gives rise to a second question : but if we read Genesis 1 like this , where will it all end ?
What is to prevent everything solid from wilting into some kind of metaphorical jelly ?
The answer is again genre .
Take , for instance , Jesusí walking on the water .
Bultmann , like Schweitzer before him , regarded these stories as myths , largely on the grounds that people do not do this kind of thing .
And they are , in part , right .
We have never seen such things and we ought to be amazed and sceptical .
But remember , content is only half the story .
There is also form .
Although there is some debate , it seems clear to me that the form of the gospels will not allow myth , fairy tale , novel , or legend as viable genre options .
At this point , form overrides the content consideration .
Whatever else the gospel writers were trying to do , to the best of our present knowledge the form of their stories indicates that they are convinced that these things really happened .
So with all this in view , what can we say about the genre and consequently the truth claims of Genesis 1 ?
Genesis 1 : Form and Content
Turning first to the form , even a cursory reading of Genesis 1 reveals a great deal of repetition : " and God said " ( vv. 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 20 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 29 ) , " let there be " ( or some form thereof ; vv. 3 , 6 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 20 , 24 , 26 ) , " and it was so " ( vv. 3 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 15 , 24 , 30 ) , " and God made " ( or similar action ; vv. 4 , 7 , 12 , 16 , 21 , 25 , 27 ) , " and God saw that ëxí was good " ( vv. 4 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 21 , 25 , 31 ) , some form of naming or blessing ( vv. 5 , 8 , 10 , 22 , 28 ) , " there was evening and there was morning " ( vv. 5 , 8 , 13 , 19 , 23 , 31 ) , and then a designation of the day as first , second , etc. ( vv. 5 , 8 , 13 , 19 , 23 , 31 ; 2.2 ) , with most of these occurring seven times .
Usually we associate this kind of repetition with poetry .
But we have examples of ancient Hebrew poetry ( e.g. , Exod 15 ; Num 23 - 24 ; Deut 33 ; Judg 5 ) , and Genesis 1 is clearly not the same thing .
But equally , if not more so , neither is this repetition characteristic of straight narrative , as a quick glance at even Genesis 2 or 1 Samuel will reveal .
That modern translators and the vast majority of commentators recognize the poetic character of Genesis 1 is indicated by the printed format used in nearly all modern versions of the Bible .
There are other indications that this text is highly stylized .
In ancient writing it is not uncommon to find the opening sentences offering clues to the structure of what followsósomething like their version of a table of contents .
Genesis 1:2 tells us that the earth was without structure ( formless ) and empty .
With this in mind , it has long been recognized that days 1 - 3 and 4 - 6 are correlated with days 1 and 4 , 2 and 5 , and 3 and 6 concerning the same elements of creation :
Day Structuring Filling Day 3 water / land land animals / humans 6 2 waters above ( sky ) / waters below birds / fish 5 1 day / night sun / moon and stars 4
Entirely in keeping with Genesis 1:2 , we have two sets of three days : the first concerning giving form to or structuring what was formless and the second concerning filling the newly created but empty forms .
Furthermore , in both sets there is a progression from heaven to earth , with the preparation of the land and the formation of humanity respectively as the climactic moment .
This progression is further highlighted by the nature of Yahwehís creative acts .
Days 1 and 4 have a single act , days 2 and 5 one creative act of two parts , and finally days 3 and 6 consist of two creative acts .
It seems to me that unless we have a previous agenda this kind of detailed and highly stylized literary patterning strongly cautions against taking this account too concretely .
This is not to say it is not true , only that its truth claims may not be of the kind we associate with " literal " reading .
So much for formal indications .
What about the content ?
The first thing we note is the twenty - four hour periodóor , to be more precise , a working period of twelve hours from morning to evening ( the day ending with evening and the following announcement of morning indicating the beginning of a new day ) .
While it is true that " day " ( yom ) can elsewhere mean a longer period ( e.g. , Ps 90:4 ) , it seems to me that the use of evening / morning terminology and Yahwehís rest on the seventh day ( in the light of the Sabbath commandment , Exod 20:11 ; more on this below ) makes it all but undeniable that twenty - four hour periods are in view .
We also note that there is no mention of any ending of the seventh day .
This is probably because the narrative has arrived at Yahwehís rest in his completed creation , and there is no need to go further .
More to the point perhaps is the question : why did the various creative acts of the six days take the same amount of time ?
One would have thought that creating the sun , moon , and stars with all their mind - numbing extent throughout our vast universe would require considerably more time than creating birds and fish .
And why would separating the waters above and below take as long as creating all of the land - dwelling creatures ?
Even the notion of a firmament in which the heavenly bodies are placed is hardly in keeping with what we now understand .
And why exactly twelve hours and not two or forty - seven and a quarter ?
Why should it take God any time to do anything ?
Why should he work only in daylight hours ?
Surely he does not need to rest at night , and the idea that it was too dark for him to see is ludicrous .
And what about the flightless land birds and the amphibians which seem not to fit any of the categories ?
Then we notice that Genesis 2:4 - 7 suggests that the creation of plants was delayed until apparently the creation of humanity to work the fields .
But in Genesis 1 plants are created several days beforehand .
It is hard to understand how three days without tillage could be such a problem .
None of this is intended to be taking cheap shots .
It is , however , intended to suggest something about the genre , and thus about the kind of truth communicated in Genesis 1 .
When we ask questions and get answers like these , our customary response is to recognize that whatever the truth claims of the account might be , it is not what we normally call " literal " history .
Strangely , some readers of Genesis at this point suddenly decide to ignore the genre contract between writer and reader which they customarily and everywhere else observe .
One cannot help but wonder if there is some other agenda at work .
Based at this point solely on the text itself and applying the same standards we use everywhere else for assessing genre , that is , to consider form and content , it appears that Genesis 1 is not intended to be read " literally , " at least in the popular usage where it usually means " concretely " or strictly and without the possibility of metaphor , hyperbole , or symbol .
This does not mean Genesis 1 is not true .
It does , however , mean that its truth claims are of a different nature .
Genesis 1 in Its Ancient Near Eastern Environment
How then are we to approach our reading of Genesis 1 ?
As in the reading of any document , it helps to have some familiarity with comparable materials , in this case other ancient creation stories .
What we are after , in dealing with the ancientsí view of origins , is some idea of the kinds of questions they asked and how they answered them .
Again , this is not to assume that Genesis 1 is identical to , or of the same genre as , these other stories or has borrowed from them .
We are simply interested in trying to understand what issues a second - millennium B.C. culture might have been interested in .
I am , however , assuming that they were not trying to do modern science nor attempting to show that Darwin was wrongóhardly likely since neither was around at the time .
It is impossible here to carry out a thorough comparison of ancient creation stories , but a cursory overview will be helpful in giving us a feel for the kinds of concerns that the first audience of Genesis 1 might have brought to the text .
(1) Sumerian ó
We have very little from the Sumerians of the third millennium B.C.
They have no epic origins poem , and instead all we have are some brief indications in introductions legitimating their social order .
One story describes a very early division between heaven and earth where Enlil , god of the air , separates An and Ki ( heaven and earth ) .
Another begins with Nammu , a watery goddess , who then becomes mother of heaven and earth and all the gods .
As increasing order emerges from an amorphous whole , humans , who had previously been animals , become a special kind of creature .
(2) " Babylonian " ó Although often regarded as " Babylonian , " the Atrahasis and Enuma Elish myths are probably of more complex origins .
Not only had Babylonian culture inherited materials from the Sumerians , but it was also influenced by a mid-third - millennium incursion of Semites and a late - third - millennium takeover by the Amorites .
Although most of our sources derive from the Assyrian or Neo-Babylonian period , the traditions themselves are probably more ancient .
The Atrahasis myth , whose earlier form is found in the Sumerian account of Enki and Ninmakh , was probably the standard Babylonian version of the creation of humanity .
At first the gods and humans were not differentiated .
The weaker gods , the Igigi , performed irrigation and drainage , but growing tired , they threatened rebellion .
Humans were then created , by mixing clay with the blood of a god , to take over these tasks .
Our earliest records of the Enuma Elish have been dated from the 1300s , although they too are probably derived from earlier sources .
More recently this account has been regarded as a late and sectarian story concerned with the localized elevation of Babylon and her god Marduk as both rose to prominence around 1500 B.C.
In any case , Tiamat , the seawater , and her husband , Apsu , the fresh groundwaters , are the first to rise from primeval chaos , and their intermingling engenders other generations of gods .
Apsu , seeking rest in his maturity , becomes agitated at the increasing activity and noise of the younger deities and plots their extermination .
He is thwarted , however , by Ea , the god of the heavens , who casts a sleeping spell upon him , murders him , and builds his palace upon Apsuís water - corpse .
Ea and his wife , Damkina , have their first son , the precocious Marduk , who is twice as strong , wise , and glorious as any other god .
In time , the younger deities seek to avenge Apsuís murder , and Kingu , new consort of Tiamat , is chosen as their leader .
The other gods , terrified , choose Marduk , son of the usurper Ea .
As battle is joined , Kingu is cowed by Mardukís magnificent appearance , but Tiamat with an accompanying host of serpent monsters is undeterred .
However , with the help of the mighty north wind that distends Tiamatís watery body , Marduk shoots an arrow down her gullet .
He celebrates his victory by dividing her watery carcass in two , creating heaven and earth , then the stars , plants , and other living things .
After the battle , Kingu and his host are reduced to servitude but soon complain that this role is not fit for deities .
Kingu is slain and his blood mixed with earth to create humans who are now to perform forced labour for the gods .
They are particularly to provide for Marduk in his Temple at Babylon , which is then established .
There is no mention of humans being made in the image of the deities , although the reference to the Lamga gods may imply some sense of humans reflecting divine statuary .
It should be noted , however , that this story is not primarily an explanation of creation , but is rather an aetiology to elevate Marduk , the chief god of the Babylonian pantheon , showing how he attained his supremacy in cosmological terms and to explain why Babylon ( with its Temple ) is the chief city .
Some fifty names celebrate Marduk as the sustainer of life on earth and in heaven .
His glorification undergirds and legitimates both divine and human institutions of governance , namely , the Temple and the kingship , which are the sine qua non of great Babylonís existence .
(3) Egyptian ñ
Surprisingly , although Israel had just spent 400 years in Egypt , relatively little attention has been given to Egyptian creation accounts which one might otherwise expect to provide the dominant background against which Genesis 1 was heard or read .
And considering that Genesis is traditionally described as one of the books of Moses , from a literary standpoint it seems right to read it in the light of Israelís exodus .
At the outset , it should be noted that there is no unitary or common Egyptian creation story but rather a range of variations depending on which deity is in view .
Egyptians apparently accepted a variety of myths and rejected none with the result that the often meagre data derives from a range of diverse texts .
Nevertheless , some characteristic themes emerge .
Unlike the Mesopotamians who believed in a number of creator gods , the Egyptians held only one deity responsible for their universeóreferred to as " heaven and earth " ówhether in the New Kingdom or in Memphite theology .
The act of creation is described in various ways .
In the Pyramid texts ( c. 2350 -2176 B.C. ) there is a sudden emergence of a primordial mound (s ) or hillock (s ) ( which the Pyramids symbolized ) out of the watery void of Nun , upon which Atum materialized in an act of self - creation .
These became the sitesóthe Holy Places of creationóupon which Temples were built .
Atum then creates the lesser gods , all of whom are personifications of various elements of the natural world .
In the Memphite texts ( Old Kingdom , c. 2500 - 2200 B.C. ) which polemicize against Atum theology , Ptah not only creates all , he is also the primeval waters that begat Atum .
In the little known stela of Ptah and Sekhmet we find the idea of creation through lordly speech where Ptahís tongue commands what his mind thinks ó
" One says in his mind ( heart ) ë Look , may they come into being í" óno preexistent material is used ( cf. Ps 33:6 ) .
This idea of creation by fiat is also found in a Coffin Text , where life is created " according to the word of Nun in NuÖ " and Atum creates animal life through his command .
Similarly , Genesis 1 is thoroughly , even characteristically , permeated by the idea of Yahweh speaking creation into being .
Creation emerges from the deep , the darkness , the formlessness and emptiness , and the wind .
The Coffin texts mention the Hermopolitan Ogdoad ( also known as the Octead , see below ) who are eight primordial beingsófour pairs of cosmic forces and their consorts with the four males being toads and the four females snakesówho inhabited the primeval slime from which creation emerges .
There is some debate over their identification .
On one view , Nun is a formless deep , Keku is darkness , Amun is a breath , and Hehu ( the least clear ) is some kind of illimitable chaos .
On another reading , these eight consist of Nun and Naunet , representing primordial matter and space , Kuk and Kauket , the idea of the illimitable and the boundless , Huh and Hauhet , for darkness and obscurity , and Amon and Amaunet , representing the hidden and concealed .
In Memphite theology these arise from Ptah , and out of them emerges the sun .
Interestingly , the biblical record begins with Elohim and then speaks of a formlessness and emptiness , a deep , a darkness , and a hovering wind ( Gen 1:1 - 2 ) .
In terms of the order of creation , the god Re first creates light out of darkness , and only after this the sun-god .
This resembles Genesis 1 where Elohim creates light before the creation of the sun .
Separation is also a key idea with Ptah separating earth and sky and Atum separating Geb ( earth - god ) from Nut ( sky - goddess ) .
In the Hermopolitan story the primordial hill becomes the firmament which divides the upper and lower waters .
Given that the biblical idea of the " firmament " has connotations of beaten metal , it is interesting that another Egyptian tradition describes the resurrected king as taking possession of the sky and then splitting or separating its metal .
In the Hymn to Khnum , we are told that the god " made plants in the field , he dotted shores with flowers ; he made fruit trees bear their fruit , " and this apparently precedes the creation of human beings .
A similar sequence is found in the Great Hymn to Amon , who puts the stars in his path , and creates fish to live in the rivers and birds to live in the sky , while Atum forms the Nile and calls it " the lord of fish and rich in birds . "
One notes here the similar sequence of Genesis 1 , beginning with the sun , moon , stars , and then fish and birds , with the latter together in the one set and even in the same order ( Gen 1:20 - 21 ) .
The fashioning of the animals and humanity is also linked in the Egyptian accounts , as it is in day six in Genesis 1:24 - 26 .
Unlike the Babylonian traditions , the Egyptians grant a special role to humans .
According to the Great Hymn to Atum , the god " created mankind and distinguished their nature and made their life . "
We also find the making of man from clay with either Khnum being seen as a potter molding humanity on his wheel ( Great Hymn to Khnum ) or Ptah molding humanity with his hands .
In the Instruction of Amenemope , " Man is clay and straw , and God is his potter " and in a few texts there is even the idea that humanity is made in the image of the god , as per the Instruction of King Merikare : " They are his [ Re ] own images proceeding from his flesh . "
The Egyptian word used here ( snnw ) is often written with a determinative in the shape of a statue .
This is similar to Genesis 1ís notion of humanity being made from the dust of the earth in Elohimís image ( tselem ) , a word which initially meant a piece cut from an object and which would be entirely appropriate for a piece of clay cut for a sculpture .
As far as I can ascertain there is no notion in Mesopotamian stories of humanity being imparted breath by the gods .
But in the Instruction of King Merikareó " [ A ]nd he ( Re ) made the air to give life to their ( men ) nostrils " óthe impartation of life occurs through the breath of the creator - deity .
On the other hand , the reason for the creation of humanity is unclear , though it seems a possibility that it was to carry out the creator - godís purposes .
Finally , the idea of the deity as craftsman is implied by the use of words that describe the metal worker who hammers and casts , or the master potter who molds , which would fit with the concept of a hammered firmament and with humans being fashioned from the earth .
Comparisons between Genesis 1 and Ancient Near Eastern Creation Myths
Some significant contours should be evident .
For the ancients the very order and coherence of the natural world implied some kind of personal agency .
There is not a hint of the idea that the ordered world emerged from chaos by purely natural means .
My point here is that no one wrote these texts to argue for the existence of the gods .
That much was simply assumed .
On this basis , Genesis 1 is unlikely to offer much succour for those who want to argue against Darwin .
It was never designed to do so .
More probably it was designed to answer the question : which god/s ordered and filled the heavens and the earth ?
Whereas for moderns the process of creation is thoroughly materialistic with the earth emerging merely as part of a larger solar system and life , if discussed at all , being considered in only the most primitive form , for the ancients the primary concern is with the earth as the setting for the appearance of a fully formed human community and culture .
In terms of the starting points , the motifs of water / watery deep , wind / storm , and formlessness are common , and , in the Egyptian Coffin Texts , one also finds the primeval darkness .
Thus most stories , including in part Genesis 1 , begin with either an amorphous mass or primeval chaos , out of which through increasing differentitation heaven and earth are separated and ultimately a particularly social order emerges .
Genesis 1 is unusual in that although it begins with the same basic elements it is more universal and seems less interested in legitimating a specifically Israelite social order , though in the larger context of the Torah one might perhaps be expected to understand as much .
Certainly Yahwehís lordship is assumed as the fundamental datum of all existence .
In contrast to modern origins stories which utterly reject any psychologizing of what is seen as a purely " objective " materialist account , ancient storiesówith the noteable exception of Genesisósimply assumed a continuity between personified " nature " and the appearance of humanity .
If one might be permitted the aside : it seems that the Genesis account manages to hold together the tension between nature and personhood in ways that neither the ancients nor modern materialism can .
The idea of warfare , though absent from Egyptian or Sumerian accounts , is prominent in the " Babylonian " stories , and particularly in the defeat of the chaos - storm - monster ( cf. the allusions in Job 26:12 ; Ps 89:10 ; Isa. 51:9 ) .
Here cosmogony was essentially a conflict of wills from which one party emerged victorious ( so Ea / Apsu ; Marduk / Tiamat ; cf. Baal and Yam / Mot ) .
Babylonian stories also involved the use of magic on the part of the deities .
In the Egyptian stories , however , there is only one creator god who creates and this by fiat through divine speech .
But even so , their stories are still theogonic , that is , concerned with the emergence of the gods as personifications of aspects of nature .
Apart from the single creator and creation by speech alone , none of these features is found in Genesis 1 .
In the Babylonian materials humans are created to undertake menial labour for Babylonís gods who are now free to take their ease .
The Egyptian sources by way of contrast are unclear as to humanityís purpose .
The notion of humans bearing the deityís image is found only in Egypt and Genesis 1 .
In the latter , all humanity , not just a single individual , act as Elohimís vice regents superintending his creation .
Apart from Genesis 1 there appears to be no concern with duration or a literary framework wherein time is broken into a series of consecutive days .
Only in the Baal palace - building storyóand again there is debate over whether this is a creation narrative ( fn. 11 ) óis there mention of a seven - day program to build Baalís palace - temple ( cf. seven years for Solomonís temple ; 1 Kgs 6:37 -38 ) .
Before considering this temple connection further , it is worth recalling Israelís exodus experience .
They had just seen Yahweh , the god of the Fathers , uncreate Egypt by overturning the rule of Pharaoh , son of Amon - re , with the ten plagues that effectively dissolved the boundaries that gave the land of Egypt its order and form .
And then at the Reed Sea ( Exod 14:19 - 31 ) they had witnessed Yahweh cause light to shine in the darkness and a divine wind to drive back the deep of the Yam Suph ( a sea that the Egyptians also regarded as the being at the edge of the world and the abode of Apophis the chaos serpent ) and so to reveal dry land .
Not only so , but Pharaohís crown carried a Urea , an enraged female cobra , which functioned both as a symbol and the actual repository of Egyptís power .
Pharaohís " father , " the sun - god Re , after traveling through the heavens , would descend into the watery underworld of the dead , the sea of reeds .
Escorted by two fire - breathing cobras he would do battle with Apophis the chaos serpent and emerge victorious each morning to bring life to Egypt .
Like father like son , Pharaoh was to bring order and justice to Egypt by restraining the chaos of lawlessness .
One can understand why Pharaoh , as Amon - Reís son , thought he too could send his armies into the watery deep of the Yam Suph and emerge victorious .
But as with Mosesí first signóthe transformation of his judicial staff and symbol of his authority into a serpent that swallows those of Pharaohís magiciansóso too with the last , when Pharaohís Urea -led armies are engulfed by the unrestrained sea , and that at Yahwehís command .
It is hardly surprising , then , that the sight of the Egyptiansí dead bodies on the shore of the Yam Suph ( cf. the Sea of Reeds and Pool of the Dead ) had a considerable impact on Israel ( Exod 15 ) .
It is , therefore , probably not by accident that one can hear echoes of light in the darkness , the wind over the deep , and the appearance of dry land in Genesis 1 : they had seen Yahweh do this when he delivered them at the Yam Suph .
This considerable similarity with the Egyptian accounts raises a very interesting question .
It is sometimes suggested that the other ancient creation stories are distorted echoes of the original creation story , namely Genesis 1 .
This is always a possibility .
But then one is left with a strange fact .
How does one explain that it happens to be Egyptian stories , the place where Israel has just spent 400 years and which stories antedate considerably Israelís stay in Egypt , whose scattered details on the whole bear a greater resemblence to Genesis 1 than those , for example , of Mesopotamia ?
Might not a better explanation be the exact opposite ?
Namely , that it was the details of the varied Egyptian accounts that have influenced the language of Israelís creation story precisely to make it all the more effective against the gods of Egypt ?
Might it not be that Genesis 1 was written with a particular concern to declare that it was Israelís god , Yahweh , and not Ptah , Atum , or any other of Egyptís failed deities , who was alone responsible for the good and perfect order of creation ?
It might also be that the clear literary art and architectonic patterning of Genesis 1 is a deliberate artistic device intended to underline the good order and patterning of Yahwehís creational activity .
If so , what do we do with the order of the parallel three days ?
It seems to me that they are designed to reflect the same emergence of increasing orderóform and fullnessówe have seen elsewhere in the ancient world and particularly Egypt , but now at Yahwehís command .
But why " three " days ?
I suggest it comes from the ancientsí perception of the basic structures of their reality .
The fundamental given of human existence is the experience of night and day , no matter whether one is above or below , or on sea or land .
The next level of complexity is above and below , and then finally , on the below , the division between land and sea .
These three days together delineate the fundamental structure of the ancient world as the ancients experienced it .
But the structure was not created to remain void or empty , and so on the second set of three days
Yahweh fills each of the realms with , as it were , their rulers ( cf. Gen 1:16 ) up through finally the appearance of the image - bearer ( Gen 1:26 - 27 ; see below ) .
To return to the temple motif noted earlier , a key feature in a number of the stories is that the gods , having defeated the chaos monster , construct their palace - temples .
( In Hebrew " palace " and " temple " are represented by the same word , which in certain circumstances is synonymous with " house " óe.g. , house of Yahweh óthe idea going back to the Sumerians , where the word for temple is " big house " ) .
As Arvid Kapelrud has argued , when one has defeated oneís foes , be one human or divine , and has established oneís realm , one builds a palace or temple .
Creation as Godís Palace - Temple
I want to pick up for a moment on the palace - temple image .
If we ask how ancient peoples might have conceptualized their world , the answer seems to be as a palace - temple , such that creation becomes an act of palace - temple building .
Egyptian sources contain hints of this , with several traditions mentioning some poles that lift the heaven over the earth and which are oriented toward the cardinal points .
This might also explain the Egyptian practice of building Temples at various sites associated with the Holy Place /s of creation .
At the same time , the Egyptian cultic complex of the exodus period was a model of cosmic origins , with its lake of reeds and stately temple .
In the " Babylonian " Enuma Elish , the outcome of Eaís victory over the watery god Apsu is not creation but the building of a palace - temple on the body of his foe .
Likewise , after Mardukís defeat of Tiamat he divides her corpse and stretches out one half like a roof to form the heavens , apparently forming the earth from the remainder , though the text is unclear at this point .
Similarly in the Canaanite story of Baalís victory over Yam , after Baal gains dominion , a house ( temple ) is constructed for him ( as already noted opinions are divided over whether this is an account of creation but my interest here is the form of conceptualization ) .
However , if Baalís temple is a microcosm as it seems to be , then this act of temple - building could perhaps correspond to creation such that creation , kingship , and temple - building all belong together .
Interestingly Baalís temple is created in seven days and Yahwehís Jerusalem Temple , itself a microcosm , in seven years ( 1 Kgs 6:37 - 38 ) .
The " creation as temple - palace " metaphor is hardly surprising if one reflects for a moment on the realities of the ancient world .
If the biggest threat to a settled agricultural existence was chaos , usually through war , lawlessness , or flood , then who was it that established order and security ?
Naturally , it was the great king who defeated the enemy , who promulgated and upheld the law ( his word ) , and who supervised and orchestrated the building of dykes , etc. , to restrain the devastating floods .
Having established his realm he would then build his palace .
If kings do this on a micro scale , then surely the gods do it at a cosmic one .
In fact , it is in recognition of this connection that victorious kings , having entered into their rest , built temples for their deities .
But is there any evidence of this notion in the Bible ?
The data is overwhelming .
In Psalm 104:2 - 3 we are told that Yahweh " wraps himself in light as with a garment ; he stretches out the heavens like a tent and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters . "
Isaiah 24:18 declares that " the windows of heaven are opened , and the foundations of the land tremble . "
One notes especially Job 38:4ff :
Where were you when I laid the earthís foundation ?
Ö . Who marked off its dimensions ?
Surely you know !
Who stretched a measuring line across it ?
On what were its footings set , or who laid its cornerstone Ö .
Who shut up the sea behind doors Ö .
When I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place Ö .
Have you entered the storehouses of the snow Or seen the storehouses of the hail ?
In fact , the Hebrew Bible is awash with architectural imagery when describing creation .
It speaks of the foundations of the earth ( Ps 18:15 ; 82:5 ; 102:25 ; 104:5 ; Prov 8:29 ; Isa 51:13,16 ; 2 Sam 22:8,16 ; Zech 12:1 ; cf. 2 Sam 22:8 ) , the pillars of the earth and of the heavens ( 1 Sam 2:8 ; Job 9:6 ; Ps 75:3 ; Job 26:11 ) , the heavensí windows ( Gen 7:11 ; 8:2 ; Isa 24:18 ; Mal 3:10 ; 2 Kgs 7:2 ; Ps 104:2 ) , the stretching out of the heavens like a canopy / tent ( Isa 40:12,22 ; 42:5 ; 44:24 ; 45:12 ; 48:13 ; 51:13 ; Jer 10:12 ; 31:37 ; 32:17 ; 51:15 ; Amos 9:6 ; Zech 12:1 ; Job 9:8 ; Ps 102:25 ) , and storehouses ( Deut 28:12 ; Jer 10:13 ; 50:25 ; 51:16 ; cf. Ps 33:7 ; 135:7 ; Job 38:22 ) .
But what kind of building is this ?
As Isaiah 66:1 makes clear , " Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool .
Where is the house you will build for me ?
Where will my resting place be ? "
Where does one find a throne and a footstool if not in a palace , and what is the palace of Yahweh if not a temple ?
And note too the image of resting in his house ( = Temple ) in the light of Yahwehís resting in his completed abode on the seventh day of Genesis 1 .
In this sense , the whole of creation is seen as Yahwehís palace - temple , and hence the reason for his Jerusalem temple itself being a microcosm , a mini universe : it serves to remind Israel that the whole world is Yahwehís .
Granted , Genesis 1 does not explicitly describe Yahweh as actually rolling up his sleeves and " building " ówhy should it when a truly Lordly Yahweh would merely have to give the word ?
But given the rather widespread Ancient Near Eastern notion linking creation , defeat - of - chaos , and temple - building , and the thorough - going architectural imagery which characterizes the biblical conceptualizing of creation , it would be very odd if Genesis 1 were not to be understood along the lines of cosmic palace - temple building .
As the Great King , Elohim naturally creates realms for the lesser rulers ( cf. Gen 1:16 ) as he forms his palace - temple out of the deep and gives order to and fills it .
And as the Great King , having ordered his realm , he now rules over all in " Sabbath " rest ( see Exod 20 ) , sitting in the great pavilion of his cosmos - palace - temple ( cf. Ps 93 ) .
This might also explain some elements of Johnís Revelation where he describes the New Jerusalem as coming down out of the heavens to earth ( Rev 21 ) .
One striking feature is the absence of any Temple ( Rev 21:22 ) .
The odd cube shape of the city might explain this .
The only other biblical objects in a similar setting that are cube - shaped are the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle ( 10 cubits , probably ) and Solomonís temple ( 20 cubits ; 1 Kgs 6:20 ; 2 Chr 3:8 ; cf. the Holy Place in Ezekielís temple , 500 cubits square , Ezek 42:16 - 20 ; 45:2 ) .
If so , then this suggests that the reason there is no temple in the New Jerusalem is because the city itself has become , not just the Temple , but the very Holy of Holies ( cf. also Ezek 45:2 - 3 ) .
But what about the surprising size of the city : 12,000 stadia ( approximately 1,500 miles ) along each axis ?
The significance of these dimensions might lie in the observation that the size of the city corresponds to that of the then - known Greek world , while the height emphasizes the co-mingling of heaven and earth .
In other words , the climax of the new creation is not the abandonment of the earth , but instead the coming of Yahweh himself to the earth to dwell among us .
Here , then , is the climax of Genesis 1ís six - fold affirmation of the goodness of creation with its progression in both sets of days from heaven to earth .
The final goal is not the destruction of creation , but rather the unification of heaven and earth such that the renewed earth itself now becomes Yahwehís very throne room .
Further support for this palace - temple conceptualization is found in the final act of creation : the forming of humanity , male and female , in the image of Elohim .
Long the subject of debate , the image of God language makes a great deal of sense within the palace - temple context .
After all , what is the last thing placed inside the deityís house , if not his image ?
So here in Genesis 1 on the last creative day , Yahweh fashions his own image and places it in his palace - temple .
At the same time , as Shelleyís poem Ozymandias so evocatively describes , ancient kings frequently placed images of themselves throughout their realms as signs of their power and sovereign authority .
It is highly likely that in the biblical account humanity serves the same function .
Thus , both Israel ( Exod 4:22 ) and her king ( Ps 2:8 ) are called to be Godís son in the sense of being faithful bearers of his image , that is , to reflect his character and act as his vice - regents as they live in his palace - temple .
From this perspective , Genesis 1 is a " poetic " account in which Yahweh , Israelís god , is proclaimed the builder of creation , his palace - temple .
It is he who by the fiat of his kingly command provided the fundamental structures of ancient human experience and who filled these sub-realms with their rulers , over all of which he has placed humanity , his image - bearer , as his vice regent .
Conclusions
What might we conclude about the truth claims and significance of Genesis 1 ?
Given its genreóa highly stylized form and unrealistic contentóI would suggest that it is not to be taken " literally " in the popular modern Western sense as a blow - by - blow , chronologically accurate , account of creation .
No one in the ancient world , apart from the isolated account of the time taken to build Baalís palace , seems particularly concerned with these kinds of questions .
Our chronos - fixated age measures things in nanoseconds and smalleróbut not theirs .
Rather , the pattern of days probably derives from the ancientsí understanding of the structure of their worldóday / night , above / below , and land / seaóthis being conceptualized in terms of the deityís construction of his palace - temple as he gives it form and fills it .
The fundamental issue is that it is Yahweh , Israelís God , a God who cares for slaves , non-entities , and even non-Israelites ( cf. the mixed multitude who are also delivered from Pharaohís genocidal proclivities ; Exod 12:38 ) , who brought order to the world , not the failed deities of oppressive Egypt nor , to a lesser degree , those of Canaan or Mesopotamia .
And in doing so , it uses the language and imagery to which that world , and particularly Egypt , was accustomed .
This is hardly suprising .
On this reading the twenty - four hour periods , or more accurately dawn - to - dusk days , probably reflect the notion of the customary daily periods of work .
Yahweh is the builder , and each day he speaks and thus by divine fiat builds or fills a discrete part of his realm .
Consequently , the injunction to keep Sabbath is less intent on imitating six literal twenty - four - hour days of creation than it is a summons for Israel to live out her creation storyóstructured as it is in the nature of the case by six days with a seventh to restóand so to declare herself to be Yahwehís " son , " imitating him in continuing his creation work of bringing order with the ultimate goal of Sabbath rest .
So in what sense is this true ?
If this kind of metaphor , symbol , or antiquated way of seeing the world is all that is intended , how does it translate into our modern world ?
In what sense can this be meaningful for us ?
The answer is surprisingly modern .
We recall that for the ancients the fundamental concern of their stories was the emergence of humanity , society , and culture .
It was the same for Israel .
Yahweh has designed this palace - temple , this pavilion , to be the habitation of his image - bearer , namely , humanity .
This , it seems to me , is nothing other than the ancient version of the recently formulated Anthropic Principle , which in its various forms reflects the fact that the fundamental structures of this world , the observed values of its cosmological and physical quantities , appear to have been fine - tuned with human existence in view .
To observers both then and now there are strong hints that this creation was designed for us .
And Genesis 1ís answer , it seems to me , is not so much concerned with the " how " in the technical or mechanical sense as it is with the " who , " namely , Yahweh .
It is Israelís God who has created this world , and humanity will never truly know what it means to be human until we learn to reflect his image .
There is truth here , but it is more like the pungent and memorable truth of Blakeís " Tiger , Tiger " than the serried ranks of mathematically precise gene maps .
Two final observations .
If this creation is Yahwehís palace - temple , then we had best take good care of it .
Far too many of us treat our homes far better than we treat this creation .
We would never tolerate toxic waste or unbridled pollution in our living rooms , and yet we seem happy to do so when it comes to Godís palace - temple .
While some have mistakenly read the apocalyptic language of purging fire as a carte blanche to do whatever they will to this present earth , we might do well to remember the warning in Revelation 11:18 : God will destroy those who destroy his earth .
Given that it is his palace - temple , and that far from people going to heaven , heaven is coming here ( at least if Revelation 21 is to be believed ) , Godís anger against violators of the earth is perfectly understandable .
It is his palace - temple they are defiling , whereas he is committed to renewing it .
Second , if humans are made in Godís image , then the repercussions are serious indeed .
In the ancient world , to deface the image of the king or deity was tantamount to high treason .
If one did not want to live in his realm or under his kingship , that could be arranged , either by exile or death .
If we take the Genesis 1 account seriously , namely , that every human being is made in Godís image , then we need to know that any act of abuse against another human being is an act of high treason against the God whose image we bear and to whose kingship and sovereignty we therefore inherently bear witness .
With this in mind , it is not hard to comprehend why Jews and Christians have historically put such a high value on human life , whether women , slaves , gladiators , newly born , or even unborn children .
It seems to me that this kind of reading of Genesis not only makes good sense of the text within its cultural horizons , but puts the emphasis back where it belongs .
Perhaps it is time to stop warring , for example , over the length of the days and instead to recall what Genesis 1 is more likely about .
This world is Godís temple - palace and he has not abandoned it .
If we are truly to bear his image , then neither should we .
Not only so , but every human being is made in Godís image .
From this perspective , it makes a great deal of sense for Jesus as Godís son among us not only to cleanse Israelís microcosmic temple , but also to restore our imageóopening blind eyes , deaf ears , raising the dead , etc. Little wonder Paul speaks of a new creation .
With these truths firmly in mind and heart , it would be difficult for Christians not to change the world .

Sergeant Crowley suggested that he and Professor Gates come to the White House to share a beer with the president .
Mr. Obama then conveyed that idea in his phone call with Professor Gates .
— The Times
The Oval Office .
Late .
President Obama sits across from Professor Henry Louis Gates , Jr. , and Officer James Crowley , who share a couch .
They sit amidst several empty beer bottles .
No one ’s wearing shoes .
CROWLEY : Can I say something ?
And I mean this .
Ya know what ’s awesome is pizza .
GATES : Pizza is awesome .
Why is it so awesome ?
OBAMA : We could go get pizza right now .
I have a plane .
GATES : That ’s awesome .
OBAMA : I could pick up the phone right now , get the plane , we could go to Italy for pizza .
CROWLEY : You ’re amazing .
And really good - looking .
GATES : You are good looking .
You ’re a very good - looking man .
OBAMA : I like giving speeches .
I like press conferences .
CROWLEY : You give a lot of press conferences .
Maybe , like , too many ?
GATES : I think he ’s right .
Maybe do n’t give so many .
OBAMA : But you should see the speeches I have lined up .
They ’re all so…emotional .
I ’ve got a new one on infrastructure that quotes Rosa Parks for no reason .
But it makes you cry .
GATES : My ex-wife is white .
OBAMA : My mother was white .
CROWLEY : There are times I wish I was Jewish .
GATES : I know exactly what you mean .
CROWLEY : It just dawned on me .
I ’m the minority in this room .
All laugh .
GATES : ( laughing , leaning over to hug Crowley )
You ’re insane …
Crowley laughs and loses his balance , falling with Gates off the couch onto the floor .
They ’re still laughing as Secret Service officers enter the room through three different doors .
The President waves them off .
With some trouble the three men get to their feet and back onto the couch .
OBAMA : We should get more beer .
CROWLEY : We should definitely get beer .
GATES : I really like beer .
Are we going to Italy ?
OBAMA : So hey .
Hey .
Seriously .
What happened ?
CROWLEY : What ?
You mean with the thing ?
OBAMA : Yeah .
CROWLEY : Oh .
I thought he was a burglar because he was black .
GATES : And I was a jackass because I assumed he was a racist Irish cop .
CROWLEY : He was so angry .
He said mean things about my mother .
I thought he was a racist .
GATES : And I thought he was a racist .
So I said mean things about his mother .
Then he arrested me because I annoyed him .
CROWLEY : I arrested him because he annoyed me , which was stupid .
But it did n’t help that you called me stupid .
OBAMA : That was stupid of me .
CROWLEY : Turns out we both love ballroom dancing and bridge .
GATES : We should play bridge now .
We need a fourth .
CROWLEY : No .
What we should do is watch “ Tommy Boy . ”
GATES : Did you just say “ boy ? ”
All laugh .
GATES : If Chris Farley had been black do you think he still would have been overweight ?
CROWLEY : No .
I think he would have been thin but not funny .
OBAMA : I think he would have been funny , thin , and Swiss .
GATES : The Swiss are n’t funny .
CROWLEY : That ’s so true .
Why is that ?
GATES : Have you ever been stopped by the police just because of your color ?
CROWLEY : I was on Cape Cod one summer and really really tanned , and I was stopped by the police .
They thought I was Brazilian but we ended up just laughing about it and I remember thanking my lucky stars I was n’t Brazilian or black .
OBAMA : That ’s tragic .
GATES : This is what I ’m talking about .
CROWLEY : I guess I ’m lucky I ’m white .
Except , you ’re both rich and famous .
GATES : You think we ’d be famous rich guys in Switzerland ?
The Swiss are afraid of black people .
CROWLEY : Some people are afraid of cops .
GATES : Are people afraid of black cops ?
OBAMA : No .
CROWLEY : No .
They love them .
There are times when I wish I was black .
OBAMA : Ya know what was a good show was “ The West Wing . ”
CROWLEY : That show was so good .
GATES : I own it .
On DVD .
I own it .
We could go to my house and watch it .
CROWLEY : We could break into your house and watch it !
Crowley and Gates laugh and fall onto the floor again .
The door opens and a waiter brings in a tray of beer .
Obama slumps into his chair , legs out .
Gates and Crowley lie next to each other on the floor , staring at the ceiling .
All are quiet for a time .
CROWLEY : ( crying )
Ya know what I think is just wrong ?
GATES : What ?
CROWLEY : That this is called the White House .
GATES : ( to Obama ) :
This is a good man .
This is a lovely man .
CROWLEY : I mean …why ?
Why do we have to judge and hate based on race ?
Why ca n’t we love ?
GATES : We should get tattoos .
They struggle to sit up , lean against the couch .
CROWLEY : I ’m sorry I arrested you because you were obnoxious .
There ’s no law that says that a Harvard professor ca n’t be obnoxious in his own home .
GATES : And I ’m sorry I called your mother a Bangkok whore .
I have no idea where your mother is from .
I was exhausted from the flight from China and was annoyed that you were a white man .
OBAMA : What have we learned ?
GATES : That we like beer .
OBAMA : What else ?
GATES : If you ’re going to break into your own house go in through the back door ?
CROWLEY : If you ’re going to arrest someone on false charges plant something on them to make the charges stick ?
OBAMA : Good .
We ’ve made progress here today .
GATES : Well , I think we all know — all of us here — that people are the same wherever you go .
CROWLEY : There is good and bad in everyone .
GATES : We learn to live …
GATES : …we learn to give each other …
CROWLEY : … what we need to survive together alive .
OBAMA : Favreau needs to hear this .
This is good stuff .
Gates and Crowley stand and move to the center of the room .
GATES : ( to Obama )
Watch this .
They begin ballroom dancing .
More beer arrives .
You would n’t drink and drive .
But would you drink and write ?
Maybe a glass of wine could be just the thing to get you started on that poem to your sweetheart .
But how about a few beers before writing an important e-mail ?
Or a business proposal ?
Could you do with a shot of whisky before taking a phone call from a client ?
How about some Dutch courage before a big presentation ?
It sounds absurd when I put it like that .
But did you know that there is strong research evidence that the popular working practice of multitasking can reduce your performance level to that of a drunk ?
Here ’s molecular biologist John Medina on the subject of multitasking while driving :
Until researchers started measuring the effects of cell phone distractions under controlled conditions , nobody had any idea how profoundly they can impair a driver .
It ’s like driving drunk … Cell - phone talkers are a half - second slower to hit the brakes in emergencies , slower to return to normal speed after an emergency , and more wild in their “ following distance ” behind the vehicle in front of them …
More than 50 % of the visual cues spotted by attentive drivers are missed by cell - phone talkers .
Not surprisingly , they get in more wrecks than anyone except very drunk drivers .
( John Medina , Brain Rules )
That may sound like an extreme example , but by attempting two tasks simultaneously ( driving and talking on the phone ) these drivers were essentially doing the same thing as an office worker who is simultaneously writing a document , checking and responding to e-mail , fielding phone calls , surfing the web and / or engaging in conversations via social networking sites .
Yet multitasking is often spoken of with approval , a skill to be cultivated .
Multitaskers are admired for their efficiency and seen as people who get things done .
Do n’t get me wrong – multitasking would be great , if it existed .
But it does n’t .
There ’s No Such Thing As Multitasking
In Brain Rules , Medina points out that the brain cannot multitask :
Multitasking , when it comes to paying attention , is a myth .
The brain naturally focuses on concepts sequentially , one at a time .
At first that might sound confusing ; at one level the brain does multitask .
You can walk and talk at the same time .
Your brain controls your heartbeat while you read a book .
A pianist can play a piece with left hand and right hand simultaneously .
Surely this is multitasking .
But I am talking about the brain ’s ability to pay attention …
To put it bluntly , research shows that we ca n’t multitask .
We are biologically incapable of processing attention - rich inputs simultaneously .
If you ’ve ever put on a CD to listen to while working , and then noticed with surprise that the music has finished and you ca n’t remember hearing any of it , you ’ll know what Medina is talking about .
Because we can only concentrate on one thing at a time , when we try to do multiple tasks that require attention , we end up switching between tasks , not doing them simultaneously .
Business coach Dave Crenshaw , author of the book The Myth of Multitasking , makes the same point :
When I speak of multitasking as most people understand it , I am not referring to doing something completely mindless and mundane in the background such as exercising while listening to this CD , eating dinner and watching a show , or having the copy machine operate in the background while you answer emails .
For clarity ’s sake , I call this ‘ background tasking ’ .
When most people refer to multitasking they mean simultaneously performing two or more things that require mental effort and attention .
Examples would include saying we ’re spending time with family while were researching stocks online , attempting to listen to a CD and answering email at the same time , or pretending to listen to an employee while we are crunching the numbers .
( Dave Crenshaw , Switchtasking )
So there ’s no such thing as multitasking .
Just task switching – or at best , background tasking , in which one activity consumes our attention while we ’re mindlessly performing another .
How Task Switching Affects Your Work
We ’ve already seen that multitasking on the road is the equivalent of drinking and driving .
Other research cited by Medina shows that people who are interrupted – and therefore have to switch their attention back and forth – take 50 % longer to accomplish a task , and make up to 50 % more errors .
When I trained in hypnosis , we were taught that one of the easiest ways to create amnesia is to interrupt someone .
Have you ever had the experience of chatting to a friend in a cafe or restaurant , when the waiter interrupts to take your order – and when he ’s gone , neither of you can remember what you were talking about ?
This effect is so powerful that it even happens when you ’re fully aware of what ’s going on .
I remember it happening when I had coffee with Johnnie Moore a few months ago – we were amused to discover that even though both knew what had happened , it took us 20 minutes to remember what we had been discussing when the waiter arrived .
As well as amnesia , task switching creates delays .
According to Medina , each time you switch tasks , your brain has to run through a four - step process to disengage the neurons involved in one task and activate the neurons needed for the other .
The more you switch , the more time you lose .
More research , reported by the New York Times , has attempted to quantify the effect of interruptions and multitasking on office productivity :
In a recent study , a group of Microsoft workers took , on average , 15 minutes to return to serious mental tasks , like writing reports or computer code , after responding to incoming e-mail or instant messages .
They strayed off to reply to other messages or browse news , sports or entertainment Web sites .
… The productivity lost by overtaxed multitaskers cannot be measured precisely , but it is probably a lot .
Jonathan B. Spira , chief analyst at Basex , a business - research firm , estimates the cost of interruptions to the American economy at nearly $ 650 billion a year .
So next time you ’re tempted to ‘ multitask ’ and ‘ switch effortlessly ’ between phone , e-mail , word processor and web browser , you might like to stop and think about the likely effect on your productivity – and ultimately , your profitability .
Focus Creates Creative Flow
If overtaxed multitasking is so unproductive , what does a high - performance state look like ?
We ’ve already caught a glimpse of it on Lateral Action , in psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ’s concept of creative flow .
Flow is a state of consciousness experienced during periods of peak performance .
It ’s characteristics include pleasure , clarity , serenity and timelessness – and focus .
In Dr. Csikszentmihalyi ’s words , during flow we are “ completely involved in what we are doing – focused , concentrated ” .
Whereas our limited attention bandwidth is a hindrance when it comes to multitasking , it is a positive advantage when it comes to flow .
According to Csikszentmihalyi , when we devote all our attention to the task in hand , we tune out distractions from our environment , and can even lose our sense of self .
Here ’s Csikszentmihalyi’s description of a composer in the act of writing music :
When you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new – as this man does – he does n’t have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home .
He ca n’t feel even that he ’s hungry or tired , his body disappears , his identity disappears from his consciousness because he does n’t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration and at the same time to feel that he exists .
( From Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s TED talk about creative flow )
How to Be Single Minded
It ’s not rocket science .
It ’s not even news .
Medina , Crenshaw and Csikszentmihalyi are hardly the first to tell us to do one thing at a time :
“ When you are walking , walk .
When you are sitting , sit . ” ~ The Buddha “ Always do one thing at a time , that of the present moment . ” ~ George Gurdjieff
You may not be as hard - core as the Buddha or Gurdjieff .
Russell Davies points out that there ’s a lot to be said for distractions and interruptions – they stimulate our creativity and are part of what makes us human .
First thing in the morning and towards the end of the afternoon , I like nothing better than to idly flick through my blog feeds while chatting and following links on Twitter .
But when it ’s time to get down to work , it ’s time to switch all that stuff off .
So feel free to let your attention wander across multiple software applications , browser tabs , e-mail , Twitter , instant messaging , phone calls , and the music playing in the background .
Just do n’t confuse it with being productive .
Multitasking and You
Do you believe in multitasking ?
What effect do you notice when you try to do several tasks simultaneously , vs doing one thing at a time ?
What were we talking about just now ? 🙂
This is an extract from Mark McGuinness ’ book Productivity for Creative People – a practical guide to getting your real work done amid the demands and distractions of modern life .
S -exp vs XML , by Erik Naggum
From : Erik Naggum erik@naggum.no
According to Xinhua latest report ( July 6 ) , the violence in Urumqi , capital of northwest China 's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , has led to at least 140 people dead and 828 injured .
The regional government said that the mass incident was masterminded by the World Uyghur Congress .
However , Uyghur independent activist explained that the unrest was sparked by anger over a confrontation between Han Chinese and Uyghur factory workers in Shaoguan city .
Shaoguan June 26 riot
So what had actually happened in Shaoguan ?
According to the Chinese official report , the conflict on 26 of June was caused by a rumor about a sexual assault of Han Chinese woman worker in a factory campus by Uyghur worker .
The armed fight between Han and Uyghur workers had led to the death of 2 Uyghurs ( some unconfirmed sources said the number of death was up to 18 Uyghurs ) .
The Youtube videos below showed the June 26 riot :
Ethnic policy and hatred
While the Chinese government continued to use western conspiracy theory in addressing the ethnic conflict , Drunken Pig pointed out from a Han Chinese perspective that the Shaoguan incident and other similar ethnic conflicts are a result of government 's ethnic policy :
汉人女工被强奸的事情在广东经常发生，但是由于作案者大多能够得到有效处理，很少酿成大规模群体事件。这次因为涉及到维族群体，而且传说是涉案者被政府释放而不受惩罚的事情重复发生之后，才导致大规模群体仇杀。
In Guangdong , sexual assault cases involving Han woman workers are not rare , but in most cases , the criminals would be arrested and would not result in massive gang fight .
This time , the case had involved Uyghurs and the rumor said that local government had released the criminal without any punishment .
Massive gang fight seeking for revenge thus took place …
这些年的群体事件，大多出于民众对特权阶层的仇恨，而这些特权阶层的背后，都是国家暴力。中国政府的民族政策，把流到内地的维族群众变成了这样一个特权团体，但是同时也剥夺了维族人本该拥有的信仰权和自治权。
Most mass incidents in the past few years were generated by hatred towards the privilege class supported by the State .
The ethnic policy of the Chinese government has turned the Uyghur in Han regions into privileged social group , while at the same time , the Uyghur is deprived of their religious freedom and autonomy back home in the northwest region .
Repressing religion freedom
由于中宣部的丰功伟绩，普通民众对其他宗教所知甚少，甚至有些人以为穆斯林不吃猪肉是因为猪是他们的祖宗。无知导致的种种误解…可以说，很多仇恨都是政府的宣传机构煽动出来的…
Because of the propaganda department 's achievement , most Han people have very little knowledge and respect of others ’ religions .
For example some Han Chinese believe that pig is the ancestor of Muslim and that 's why they do not eat pork .
Ignorance leads to prejudice …
Much of the hatred is incited by the government propaganda department …
在广东，虽然有很多维族人，但是你很难看到清真寺。我相信礼拜和祈祷对减少穆斯林的犯罪率是有效的。
In Guangdong , the Uyghur population is quite large , but we have very few Muslim temple .
I believe religious activities can lower the crime rate .
那些杀人的汉人，在这次冲突中表现得非常残忍。但是平心而论，他们长期以来是受害群体。在广东，几乎所有的政府部门都护着新疆人。镇压汉人群体事件不会有大问题，但是镇压维族人，会遇到很大的阻力。因此地方政府迫于当地民众压力清理新疆流氓的行动，有时候竟然要借用黑社会和便衣联手的方式。
The Han Chinese engaged in the killing ( in Shaoguan ) are very cruel .
However , they have been suffering from injustice .
Local government tends to protect the Uyghur people .
In case of mass incident , it is common for the government to repress the Han Chinese , but they would be very careful in handling Uyghur people 's protest .
Sometimes the government would let the triad society to solve the Xinjian gangster problem .
Social minority and unemployment problem
Uighur online disagreed with Drunken pig's Han centric viewpoint and presented the other side of the story :
成千上万的维吾尔孩子被拐骗到内地毒打虐待做小偷是事实，你们有多少人想到背后的社会问题？一个人、一个民族谁天生愿意做小偷？ZF采取过什么有效的干预措施？在我看来：一部分维吾尔孩子沦为小偷的事实恰恰说明了一个真实的现状：维吾尔人在他们的故乡处于是社会的最下层地位。
Thousands of Uyghur kids were kidnapped and beaten to become thieves in Han Chinese region .
Can we say that Uyghur people are natural born thieves ?
Has the government done anything to help them ?
The fact that so many Uyghur kids have become thieves indicates that Uyghur people are at the lower strata of the society .
DXXX ( account protected ) from twitter also pointed out that :
在新疆名义上是维吾尔自治区，但是维吾尔在新疆是弱势民族。仅就汉语的使用,就是当地维吾尔族处于极大的劣势，所有招聘单位都由汉语主导。很多企业排斥招收维吾尔员工。金融、通讯、银行、石油化工，天然气等诸多领域，维吾尔人都是限制。由于政府的歧视政策,造成维吾尔人就业困难。
In theory the Uyghur region is autonomous , in reality Uyghur is social minority in Xinjian .
Han Chinese is the dominant language in the job market .
Many corporates refuse to employ Uyghur .
In sectors such as finance , communication , bank , oil and natural gas , Uyghur people could not enter .
Government 's discrimination has led to unemployment problem among Uyghur .

Let ’s take a look at a few studies that have come out recently and see if we can find a common thread .
A West Virginia University researcher found that “ coal mining costs Appalachians five times more in early deaths as the industry provides to the region in jobs , taxes and other economic benefits , ” reports the Charleston Gazette .
The Mountain Association for Community Economic Development found that “ the coal industry takes $ 115 million more from Kentucky ’s state government annually in services and programs than it contributes in taxes , ” reports the Lexington Herald - Leader .
A recent peer - reviewed paper in the journal Science found that areas of Brazil that cut down their rainforests to sell the wood or plant crops “ do see a short - term boost in per-capita income , life expectancy , and literacy rates , ” reports The Vine .
“ But once the trees are gone , those gains disappear , leaving deforested municipalities just as poor as those that preserved their forests . ”
The International Fund for Animal Welfare found that “ in 2008 whale - watching generated $ 2.1 billion of tourism revenue worldwide … more than double the estimated $ one billion generated by the industry in 1998 , ” reports Agence France - Presse .
Said Australia Environment Minister Peter Garrett , “ Whales are worth much more alive than dead . ”
The University of Michigan found that “ the Detroit Three automakers can become more profitable and slow the growth of their Japanese rivals if they simply meet tougher new government - mandated fuel economy standards , ” reports the Detroit Free Press .
These are disparate areas of study and disparate conclusions .
One thing they all have in common : an environment - degrading practice often defended as necessary to economic health is revealed , upon closer inspection , to be uneconomic .
I wonder how many other allegedly economic environment - degrading practices would also be revealed uneconomic if examined with a fresh eye ?
It ’s almost like the economy is embedded in an environment , and degrading the latter ultimately degrades the former .

This week , Team Obama took their dog and pony show on the road .
Treasury Secretary Geithner went to China , Fed Chairman Bernanke to Capitol Hill , and the President himself began a Mideast tour in Saudi Arabia .
This full - court press is not coincidental , and comes just as the federal government has begun unloading trillions of dollars in new Treasury obligations .
The coordinated charm offensive is meant to assure the world - at - large that the United States can repay these obligations without destroying the dollar .
Given the renewed weakness in the dollar and the recent expressions of concern from China , our largest creditor , about the safety of its current holdings , this is no easy sell .
Not only must our leaders convince holders of our debt not to sell what they already own , but to back up the truck and buy a whole lot more .
The hope is that a dream team consisting of a charismatic politician , a skilled Wall Street banker with longstanding ties to China , and a respected Fed Chairman , can close the deal .
However , no matter how slick the sales pitch , no amount of lipstick can dress up this pig .
The most obvious fear the trio must address is that oversized deficits will persist indefinitely .
Reading from a carefully scripted rebuttal book , all three proclaim that as soon as the stimulus revives our economy , the government will take all necessary steps to rein in the deficits that result .
Bernanke ’s testimony showcases this rhetorical shift .
The Fed Chairman claimed that catastrophe has been averted and that the recession is nearly over .
As a result , he advised Congress to now focus on debt management .
How he expects them to do that was left unexamined .
Setting aside the fact that the recession is far from over and that the stimulus will actually weaken the economy in the long run , Bernanke ’s words were less a practical guide to Congress than a bromide for our foreign creditors .
Meanwhile , Obama carefully peppers his speeches with calls for Americans to live within their means , to save more and spend less , to produce more and consume less .
But nothing in the government ’s current fiscal or monetary policy will encourage such behavior .
In fact , the objective of economic stimulus is to prevent such changes from taking place !
The laughter of Chinese students that greeted Secretary Geithner at Peking University shows how ridiculous this spiel sounds overseas .
Actions speak louder than words , and the actions of the current Administration are deafening .
Multi-trillion dollar deficits , bailouts , nationalizations , quantitative easing , and grandiose plans for government - provided healthcare , education , and alternative energy , render all their claims of future prudence meaningless .
If our leaders will not make tough choices now , why should anyone believe they will do so later when those choices will be even harder to make ?

Of course , it ’s not just major holders , like China and Saudi Arabia , that need to be convinced .
Since the largest holders are already in so deep , they have the greatest short - term incentive to play ball .
While throwing good money after bad is certainly a lousy investment strategy , it is politically expedient as it delays the need to officially acknowledge losses .
The spin is designed to keep all the smaller , more nimble holders from dumping their Treasuries .
The major holders can publicly pledge their commitment to Treasuries , while they privately planning their exit strategies , as long as they feel that the smaller holders wo n’t spook the market by front - running their trades .
However , once the psychology turns , there is no way to stop the rush for the exits .
Remember how quickly the secondary market for subprime mortgages collapsed ?
One day , investors were lining up to buy ; the next day , the stuff could n’t be given away .
Make no mistake about it , we are issuing subprime paper and no amount of political spin can alter that reality .
Bogus credit ratings aside , I think the world already knows this and it ’s just a matter of time before someone admits it .
In the meantime , by continuing to lend , our creditors merely supply us the shovels to dig ourselves into an even deeper economic hole .
Their credit enables our government to grow when it needs to shrink , finances bailouts of companies that should be allowed to fail , and enables a nation that should be saving and producing to continue borrowing and spending .
As a result , the more money the world loans us , the less capable we are of paying it back .
I really wish the world would stop doing us favors , as neither party can afford the consequences .
For an timely example , just look at California .
With an unmanageable $ 20 billion deficit , California recently asked Washington for a bailout .
With none immediately forthcoming , California was forced to make real and needed budget cuts .
The hard choices , which will benefit California in the long run , would not have been made if federal funds had been committed .
We all should be so lucky .

The migrants who came from eastern Europe to live and work in Britain over the past five years have made a positive contribution to the public purse , research reveals .
Poles , Czech and others who moved here after the EU expanded in 2004 have paid far more in taxes than they received in benefits , academics at University College London found .
Professor Christian Dustmann said the immigrants made a " substantial net contribution to the UK fiscal system " .
In 2008 - 09 , arrivals from new EU members the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia paid 37 per cent more in taxes than they took in welfare payments and from public services , he said .
" From the fiscal point of view , this immigration has not been at all a burden on the welfare system .
Rather , it has contributed to strengthen the fiscal position , " he added .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Prof Dustmann found immigrants were , on average , younger and better educated than the native population , but also prepared to work for much lower wages – on average a third less – and 60 per cent less likely to claim benefits .
After a year here , their job prospects improved significantly and their average wages increased , he said .
The study of arrivals between 2004 and 2008 found that about 90 per cent of working - age men and 75 per cent of working - age women had jobs .
During the recession , migrant workers may fare better in the employment market than native Britons because of their better skills and qualification , Prof Dustmann concluded .

WHOLE FOODS
Market is a highly profitable corporation that far outperforms its competitors , while maintaining an aura of commitment to social justice and environmental responsibility .
Its clientele is attracted not only to its brightly lit array of pristine fruits and vegetables , organically farmed meats and delectable ( yet healthy ) recipes , but also to the notion that the mere act of shopping at Whole Foods is helping to change the world .
In 2007 , Whole Foods launched its " Whole Trade Guarantee , " stating its aim as advancing the Fair Trade movement -- encouraging higher wages and prices paid to farmers in poor countries while promoting environmentally safe practices .
In addition , Whole Foods announced that 1 percent of proceeds will be turned over to its own Whole Planet Foundation , which supports micro-loans to entrepreneurs in developing countries .
Meanwhile , the company 's Animal Compassion Foundation seeks to improve living conditions for farm animals , while stores periodically hold " 5 Percent Days , " when they donate 5 percent of sales for that day to an area non-profit or educational organization .
Columnist : Sharon Smith Sharon Smith is the author of Subterranean Fire : A History of Working - Class Radicalism in the United States , a historical account of the American working - class movement , and Women and Socialism , a collection of essays on women ’s oppression and the struggle against it .
She is also on the board of Haymarket Books .
Whole Foods also has a distinctive reputation for rejecting traditional corporate management models in favor of decentralized decision - making , described as an experiment in workplace democracy .
There are no departments at Whole Foods stores , only " Teams " of employees .
And Whole Foods has no managerial job titles , just Team Leaders and Assistant Team Leaders .
Nor does the company admit to having any workers , only Team Members who meet regularly to decide everything from local suppliers to who should get hired onto the Team .
Generally , the company strives to achieve consensus at Team meetings , where workers brainstorm about new ways to raise productivity .
And new hires need to win the votes of at least two - thirds of Team Members in order to make the cut .
The liberal dress code at Whole Foods allows nose rings , Mohawks , visible tattoos and other expressions of individuality to help promote a stated goal of " Team Member Happiness " for its relatively young workforce .
Each Team takes regular expeditions , known as " Team Builds , " to local farms or other enterprises to educate themselves on how to better serve their customers .
When Team Members show extra effort on the job , Team Leaders award them with " High Fives " that can be used to enter an onsite raffle to win a gift card .
When a Team Member gets fired , it is sadly announced as a " separation . "
For all its decentralization , the " unique culture " so beholden to Whole Foods ' supporters bears the distinct stamp of its cofounder and CEO , John Mackey , who declared in 1992 , a year after Whole Foods went public , " We 're creating an organization based on love instead of fear . "
The former hippie is known for shunning suits and ties , and wearing shorts and hiking boots to meetings -- and for insisting that before the end of every business meeting , everyone says something nice about everyone else in a round of " appreciations . "
In a 2004 Fast Company article , business writer Charles Fishman favorably quoted a former Whole Foods executive calling Mackey an " anarchist " for his eccentric executive style .
BUT SOMETHING sinister lurks beneath the surface of Whole Foods ' progressive image .
Somehow , Mackey has managed to achieve multimillionaire status while his employees ' hourly wages have remained in the $ 8 to $ 13 range for two decades .
With an annual turnover rate of 25 percent , the vast majority of workers last no more than four years , and thus rarely manage to achieve anything approaching seniority and the higher wages that would accompany it .
If Whole Foods ' workers are younger than the competition 's , that is the intention .

But another secret to Whole Foods ' success is its shockingly high prices .
When Wal - Mart began promoting its own organic products last year , Whole Foods ' Southwest regional president Michael Besancon scoffed at the notion that Wal - Mart could present serious competition .
" There 's no way in the world that we'd win a price battle with Wal - Mart , " he told the Rocky Mountain News .
" I 'm relatively smarter than that . "
On the contrary , Whole Foods orients to a higher - income clientele willing to pay significantly more for somewhat higher quality foods .
Whereas the average supermarket chain 's profits traditionally hover at around 1 percent , Whole Foods was able to sustain a profit margin of 3 percent for 14 years after it went public in 1992 .
After hitting a low of 1 percent in the economic downturn in late 2008 , " now the margins are expanding again , " according to the Cabot Report 's investment adviser Mike Cintolo on April 26 .
Indeed , Mackey is no progressive , but rather a self - described libertarian in the tradition of the Cato Institute .
He combines this with a strong dose of paternalism toward the company 's employees .
Mackey complained about his unique dilemma at the helm of Whole Foods to fellow executives in an October 2004 speech :
I cofounded the company , so I 'm like this father figure at Whole Foods .
I'm this rich father figure , and everybody 's pulling at me saying , " Daddy , daddy , can we have this , can we have that , can we have this , can we have that ? "
And I 'm either like the kind , generous daddy , or the mean , Scrooge daddy who says " No . "
Using a carrot and very large stick , Mackey managed to " convince " Whole Foods workers across the country to vote in 2004 to dramatically downgrade their own health care benefits by switching to a so - called " consumer - driven " health plan -- corporate double - speak for the high deductible - low coverage savings account plans preferred by profit - driven enterprises .
As Mackey advised other executives in the same 2004 speech , " [ I ] f you want to set up a consumer - driven health plan , I strongly urge you not to put it as one option in a cafeteria plan , but to make it the only option . "
There have been setbacks for Mackey , to be sure .
He suffered public humiliation in 2007 when he was exposed as having blogged under the false user name " rahodeb " -- his wife 's name spelled in reverse -- between 1999 and 2006 at online financial chat boards hosted by Yahoo .
For seven years , he backstabbed his rivals -- including the Wild Oats franchise that Mackey later purchased as an addition to the Whole Foods Empire .
The Wall Street Journal reported a typical post : " ' Would Whole Foods buy ( Wild Oats ) ?
Almost surely not at current prices , ' rahodeb wrote .
' What would they gain ?
( Their ) locations are too small . ' "
At one point , rahodeb even admired Mackey 's latest haircut , gushing , " I think he looks cute ! "
PREVENTING WHOLE
Foods workers from unionizing has always been at the top of Mackey 's agenda , and the company has been successful thus far at crushing every attempt .
Perhaps the company 's most notorious attack on workers ' right to unionize occurred in Madison , Wis. , in 2002 .
Even after a majority of workers voted for the union , Whole Foods spent the next year canceling and stalling negotiation sessions , knowing that after a year , it could legally engineer a vote to decertify the union .
Mission accomplished .
At the mere mention of the word " union , " Whole Foods still turns ferocious .
Even when United Farm Workers activists turned up outside a Whole Foods store in Austin , Texas , where Mackey is based , the company called the police and had them arrested for the " crime " of passing out informational literature on their current grape boycott .
And as Mother Jones recently reported , " An internal Whole Foods document listing ' six strategic goals for Whole Foods Market to achieve by 2013 ... includes a goal to remain ' 100 % union - free . ' "
Mackey launched a national anti-union offensive in January , in preparation for the ( remote ) possibility that President Barack Obama , upon his inauguration , would make it a legislative priority to pass the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) , allowing workers to win unionization when a majority of a company 's workforce signs a union card .
Although union card check is standard procedure in many countries , Mackey claimed to the Washington Post that it " violates a bedrock principle of American democracy " and has vowed to fight to prevent its passage here .
" Armed with those weapons , " Mackey argued , " you will see unionization sweep across the United States and set workplaces at war with each other .
I do not think it would be a good thing . "
Workers do n't want to join unions anymore , Mackey declared , contradicting every recent opinion poll : " That so few companies are unionized is not for a lack of trying , but because [ unions ] are losing elections -- workers are n't choosing to have labor representation .
I do n't feel things are worse off for labor today . "
In January , Whole Foods launched a nationwide campaign , requiring workers to attend " Union Awareness Training , " complete with Power Point presentations .
At the meetings , store leaders asserted , " Unions are deceptive , money - hungry organizations who will say and do almost anything to ' infiltrate ' and coerce employees into joining their ranks , " according to Whole Foods workers who attended one such meeting .
" According to store leadership , " the workers continued , " since the mid 1980s , unions have been on decline because , according to Whole Foods ' theory ' , federal and state legislation enacted to protect workers rights has eliminated the need in most industries ( and especially Whole Foods stores ) for union organization ... No need to disrupt the great ' culture ' that would shrivel up and die if the company became unionized . "
When rumors recently began circulating that a union drive might be brewing in San Francisco , the response from the company was immediate -- including mandatory " Morale Meetings " to dissuade employees .
But company leaders failed to address workers ' complaints that they have gone without any pay raises , sometimes for more than two years , because Team Leaders have neglected to hold " Job Dialogue " meetings ( known as " annual performance reviews " in traditional corporate - speak ) .
There was a time in decades past when liberalism was defined in part by its principled defense of the right to collective bargaining .
That liberal tradition was buried by the market - driven neoliberal agenda over the last three decades , allowing companies like Whole Foods to posture as progressive organizations when their corporate policies are based upon violating one of the most basic of civil rights : the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively .
Indeed , Whole Foods has ridden its progressive image to absorb its smaller competitors and emerge as a corporate giant .
As the Texas Observer argued recently , " People shop at Whole Foods not just because it offers organic produce and natural foods , but because it claims to run its business in a way that demonstrates a genuine concern for the community , the environment and the ' whole planet , ' in the words of its motto .
In reality , Whole Foods has gone on a corporate feeding frenzy in recent years , swallowing rival retailers across the country ...
The expansion is driven by a simple and lucrative business strategy : high prices and low wages . "
Indeed , Whole Foods now stands as the second largest anti-union retailer in the U.S. , beaten only by Wal - Mart .
Most of Whole Foods ' loyal clientele certainly would -- and should -- shudder at the comparison .

Celebrating Independence Day in the U.S. capital , the two Muslim women were doing what generations of Americans have done before them : blending their faith and lifestyle with a U.S. national identity .
Eight years after Middle East militants carried out the September 11 attacks , Muslim Americans are raising their profile , encouraged by the election of Barack Obama , a U.S. president proud of his Kenyan father ’s Muslim heritage .
The president , who is a Christian , used his middle name , Hussein , at his inauguration .
He called for new dialogue with Islamic nations and named a special envoy for the Middle East on his second full day in office .
“ We are more optimistic about the future for us here , ” said Alqaisi , an accountant .
“ They changed the way they communicate with the Muslim countries .
We feel like we have more value here now .
We hope that will continue in the future . ”
Like other immigrant groups in a country of immigrants , Muslims were drawn to the United States seeking opportunity and relief from poverty in their home countries .
Arabs went to industrial centers , south Asian Muslims to the West Coast .
Some arrived to study in universities ; some arrived as slaves .
A 2007 Pew Research Center study says 21 percent of Muslim Americans arrived from abroad during the 1990s .
The September 11 attacks put a magnifying glass on what until then had been a largely invisible Muslim American community , prompting many to organize .
The Patriot Act limited civil liberties .
Many felt they were being profiled .
The Council of American - Islamic Relations , a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group , said more than 60,000 people were subject to new government actions such as interrogations , detentions , raids and the closure of charities .
CAIR reported a 64 percent increase in the number of civil rights complaints in the year after September 11 , 2001 .
GREATER SCRUTINY
The greater scrutiny prompted Muslims to engage more with one another and politically , said U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota , the first Muslim member of Congress .
“ The Muslim community has learned the lesson that if you want things to change for you in America , you have to be involved in the process , ” he said .
“ Political engagement of the Muslim community is higher than I have ever seen it . ”
In the last two years , two Muslims have been elected to Congress , five have won seats in state legislatures and many more have been elected on more local levels , Ellison said .

The Islamic Society of North America Convention took place in Washington over the July 4 weekend and had a large number of sessions with a political focus .
Some 35,000 people attended .
Obama , who took office on January 20 , enjoys wide support from the newly active community .
After his first 100 days in office , Obama ’s approval rating among Muslims was at 85 percent , a level of popularity rivaled only by a 79 percent approval rating among Jews , according to a Gallup poll released in May .
During the U.S. presidential campaign , some Muslim leaders did not think it best for Obama to be associated with Islam because of the negative reception the faith received under President George W. Bush .
They advocated quiet , measured support .
Zeba Khan disagreed and decided to actively support Obama ’s candidacy .
“ It did n’t sit well with my understanding of what it means to be a Muslim and what it means to be an American , ” said Khan , the daughter of South Asian Muslim immigrants .
She started Muslim Americans for Barack Obama a few months before the November 2008 election .
“ I felt that it was my duty both as an American and a Muslim to vote but also to organize and mobilize because that ’s better for my community and the country , ” she said .
WORRY
Obama extended an open hand to the Muslim world in a first interview after his inauguration with Al Arabiya television and gave weight to his readiness for warm diplomacy in speeches in Turkey and Egypt .
On January 22 , Obama named George Mitchell special envoy for the Middle East , giving the region priority .
“ He moved very fast in transforming U.S. policy toward the Muslim world into a more favorable orientation , ” said U.S. academic and political commentator Ali Mazrui .
American Muslims worry nonetheless .
“ There ’s still anxiety to whether he is doing enough to improve their position .
His domestic policies leave a lot to be desired because they seem to be a continuation of the Bush administration , ” said Mazrui , who leads global cultural studies at the State University of New York , Binghamton .
Mazrui referred to the continued enforcement of the Patriot Act , border detentions , immigration issues , scrutiny of charitable giving and the FBI ’s use of informants in mosques .
Opinion polls and anecdotal evidence suggest economic opportunities and a commitment to democratic inclusion may encourage greater civic engagement among Muslims in the United States than those in other countries .
Three percent of Muslim Americans say they are struggling compared with two out of three Muslims in France and 69 percent in Britain .
The most notable division within the U.S. Muslim community is between the largest group of African Americans , who make up 35 percent , and immigrant Muslims from varied origins .
“ They are brought together by religion but they are separated by other aspects of culture , ” Mazrui said .
Obama appeals to both sets .
“ He is definitely a point of convergence , ” said Dalia Mogahed , director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies .
“ It ’s his inclusive point of view of what it means to be an American . ”
It is this inclusion and participation in society that Muslim Americans say they are starting to embrace as a means of improving their lot .
“ Until Muslims demand their seat at the political table , they are going to continue to be defined by extremists abroad and political ‘ nut jobs ’ at home , ” Khan said .
The Scientific Way of Warfare : Order and Chaos on the Battlefields of Modernity
Antoine J. Bousquet
( Columbia University Press , 2009 )
Warfare , for those willing to risk the denigration of so doing , can be described as a search for meaning .
Soldiers stake their lives on a cosmic wager that what they undertake is equal to the ante .
Commanders must orchestrate performances more compelling than theater and more sacred than peace , all the while inflicting as much damage as possible .
The sum resources of a culture — its science , its religion , its poetry , its prejudice — mobilize in the service of that cause .
These are as much the technologies of war as the weapons themselves .
At least since Carl von Clausewitz first spoke of the “ fog of war ” ( an inevitable unknowing that reigns over every battlefield ) , the challenge of warfare has been to lend order to chaos .
There is a war within every war , one pitting the ballet of orderly abstractions against the scrambling movements of armed and terrified human beings .
Upon these abstractions hangs a fragile sense of sanity , one as crucial to any war effort as lead for bullets or the sex appeal of a man in uniform .
Antoine Bousquet ’s recent study , The Scientific Way of Warfare : Order and Chaos on the Battlefields of Modernity , tells how military thinkers have sought to clear the fog of war , before Clausewitz and since .
His analysis takes the form of genealogy : a succession of technoscientific paradigms , each promising to bring the melee of combat under the control of its sober - minded masters .
The book leads us through a dazzling menagerie of historical gizmos , ingenious weapons , and pseudoscientific disciplines .
Through them , he suggests that the preferred instruments of warfare express the whole meaning - making apparatus of the society from which they come .
The progression begins with the early modern world ’s competing kingdoms and ends with the mess of the present , intransigent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan , where the most over - armed and over - theorized institution the world has ever seen struggles to defeat bands of insurgents and warlords .
Insofar as science defines the modern worldview , Bousquet shows how science also sets the terms for how we think about warfare .
In the first chapter , he places his thinking in the Continental lineage of knowledge , representation , and power : Nietzsche , Heidegger , Foucault , Deleuze / Guattari , and DeLanda pop up in the footnotes .
Their presence insists that warfare , in its way , is an act of philosophy .
Bousquet begins with the inception of modern science : the revolutions in knowledge of the 17th century .
Newton ’s promise to describe the universe as a calculable clockwork seduced military thinkers as much it did astronomers .
His mechanics not only offered equations for the course of a cannonball , it provided the vision for an ideal battlefield .
By this logic , as Bousquet explains , the more that soldiers could be trained to operate like gears of a mechanism , the smoother their deadly work could run .
The Prussian army ’s 1726 manual divided the process of loading and firing a musket into 76 separate stages .
Commanders drilled such precision into their soldiers with minute efficiency , teaching them to march in geometric columns ( at exactly 75 steps per minute ) against the enemy ’s geometric fortifications .
King Frederick the Great ’s army could fire sustained volleys with only three ranks of musketeers , compared to the ten ranks required by the state - of - the - art 150 years before .
Frederick ’s mastery of clockwork warfare made Prussia a great power of the late 18th century and its army a model that rivals sought to emulate .
Thomas Kuhn famously explained the progress of science as a succession of paradigms ; sets of theories that science clings to until they are so full of fissures and self - contradictions that a revolution becomes necessary , and a new paradigm takes the place of the old .
Bousquet applies the same logic to the progress of scientific warfare .
Over the course of the century between Napoleon and the First World War , a crop of new technologies and strategies outgrew the mechanistic battlefields on which they had been designed to fight .
A second paradigm of scientific warfare emerged , which Bousquet calls the thermodynamic .
No longer should a fighting force tick like a clock ; it should put out energy like an engine .
Napoleon , who began his military career in the artillery corps , conquered most of Europe by trusting overwhelming force more than geometry .
Long - range cannons , whose capabilities the emperor knew so well , had collapsed the distances that the earlier paradigm depended on .
This is why Clausewitz , writing in the years following Prussia ’s defeats against Napoleon , rejected mechanistic logic and turned instead to the new science of energy and force .
He had come to understand war as an “ explosion , ” guided more by probability than by laws of consequence ; the precisely defined formations of earlier tacticians could n’t help but boil over with the heat of unexpected “ friction . ”
By the 20th century , in Bousquet ’s account , machine guns , repeating rifles , and airplanes had turned soldiers into fuel for the engine of war .
They spent the World War I huddling in trenches , charging enemy lines , and being slaughtered by the new machines .
But the fullest expression of thermodynamic warfare came in World War II : blitzkriegs , tanks , bombing raids , and charnel houses .
The apotheosis of the thermodynamic paradigm came with the fission bomb that exploded over Hiroshima on August 6 , 1945 , unleashing the force locked inside every atom .
This obsession with energy continued through the early years of the Cold War , as the superpowers raced to build the fastest fighter planes and pack the most megatons into their nukes .
But soon this logic unraveled too , as it became clear that neither could fight a thermonuclear war without being destroyed in the process .
The science of energy , Bousquet writes , with its promise of a comprehensible formula for the modern battlefield , had blown itself into absurdity .
As the push for greater firepower reached the point of mutually assured destruction , another tool , the computer , born of the Second World War came to prominence and with it Bousquet ’s third paradigm : cybernetic warfare .
Computers offered strategists the hope of protecting the mushrooming nuclear arsenal from human error while also deploying conventional weapons with greater precision than ever before .
War began to look like little more than a grand information - processing problem , solvable with the right programming and hardware .
Cold War projects like SAGE ( Semi- Automated Ground Environment ) — which was more expensive than the Manhattan Project that built the first atom bomb — and WWMCSS ( World Wide Military Command and Control System ) sought to connect US military forces around the globe into a single , centralized computer system .
Arch - bureaucrat Robert McNamara , who served as secretary of defense between 1961 and 1968 , was perhaps more responsible than anyone for making “ systems analysis ” into the Pentagon credo .
“ Do n’t give me your poetry , ” he once retorted to a White House aide ’s dour assessment of the war in Vietnam .
“ Give me something I can put in the computer . ”
But cybernetics did n’t do much good in a war where there was no clear line between enemy and friend .
During a supposedly limited war , more bombs fell from American planes than in all of World War II .
Bousquet also notes the irony that , according to a Nixon - era computer simulation of the conflict , the United States should have defeated the communists in 1964 .
The account of Vietnam occasions his most prophetic passages about the chronic shortcomings of scientific warfare .
It was , he writes ,
a misplaced faith in the technoscientific approach to war which gave the war planners an illusory sense of what could be achieved through only military means and caused them to pay insufficient attention to both their own political strategy and that of the North Vietnamese .
Mapping the clean lines of scientific theory onto government - sponsored bloodshed can provide ( can seem to provide ) not merely a recourse of last resort but a tool of ordinary statecraft .
War becomes , as Clausewitz wrote , an extension of politics by other means .
But cybernetics went further , promising , with the right data and sufficient processor power , to make obsolete the fog of war that Clausewitz warned about .
The 1991 Gulf War showed cybernetics at its most seductive .
With a precision air - raid campaign and a hundred - hour ground war , the U.S. - led coalition beat back Saddam Hussein quickly and decisively .
Minimal firepower was expended for maximum , localized , effect .
By then , though , the cybernetic paradigm ’s underpinnings in the technoscientific world - picture were beginning to erode .
Moore ’s
Law may have kept up its shocking pace , promising exponential growth in computer processor power , but in the decade that followed , the importance of that power nonetheless diminished .
The new revolution came in networking .
Processing information was not so important as sharing it .
Talk of chaos theory and “ complex adaptive systems , ” developed by a new generation of internet - savvy scientists , made its way into the Pentagon as the cyberneticists ’ promise of a single , all - knowing machine went unfulfilled .
Out with the centralized structure of a cybernetic force ; networks could facilitate self - organizing “ swarms , ” units that would adapt to their environments while remaining in constant contact with their comrades .
By the time Donald Rumsfeld took the helm at the Department of Defense , the words “ network centric ” were on every ambitious young officer ’s lips .
Bousquet names this fourth and final paradigm with the neologism “ chaoplexic . ”
He makes it a primary task of his book to show that the US military remains more cybernetic — and less chaoplexic — than it likes to think .
The generals have n’t given up their cybernetic right to micromanage .
Intoxicated by the prospect of total situation awareness that the latest satellites and computer networks offer , they still insist on the possibility of running a war from thousands of miles away .
Nowhere is this habit more evident than in the unmanned drones that chase the Taliban with Hellfire missiles , controlled by pilots safe and sound in the Nevada desert .
With every headline about a village full of civilians pulverized by these machines comes a reminder that even the most high - tech awareness is far from total .
Bousquet argues that only a fuller embrace of chaoplexity can face the fog of today ’s wars .
Nevertheless , the scientific way of warfare is much more than a set of tactics ; it is a pattern of speech and a cipher of meaning .
John Boyd , an ace Air Force pilot who became one of the Pentagon ’s leading strategists , helped set the groundwork for a chaoplexic approach to military challenges .
A glance through one of his few writings , the 1976 essay “ Destruction and Creation , ” offers an uncanny view of the scientific way of warfare at work .
It is a treatise on decision - making in chaotic environments , where “ Gödel , Heisenberg , and the Second Law of Thermodynamics ” rest comfortably beside “ the basic goal of individuals and societies ” — as well as , by implication , soldiers .
The direct relevance of the scientific ideas to his point is questionable , but they constantly poke through , as kernels of the twentieth century ’s metaphysical imagination .
For Boyd , the legacy of these scientific ideas lends a habitable sense of order to his task , just as when Clausewitz turned to the new science of energy to help explain the success of Napoleon to his fellow Prussians .
“ Science is not an activity separate from other contemporary social developments and intellectual trends , ” Bousquet insists .
Neither is warfare .
Combining the two , his book shows , comes naturally to the condition of modernity .
The business of war - fighting fits into an organic relationship with the fixtures of ordinary life , from the essential gadgets to the favored gods .
Cosmic War
If science dictates the structures of military thought today , perhaps religion served a similar function in times before .
One need n’t look any further than the Psalms : “ My refuge and my fortress ; my God , in whom I trust …
His faithfulness is a shield and buckler . ”
Martial imagery pervades religious writings from around the world , even if interpretation over time often renders it “ just ” metaphorical .
Bousquet rightly warns us not to belittle metaphors ; they “ constitute a means of ordering experience by imposing existing structures of meaning over the chaos and confusion produced by the eruption of novelty . ”
While reading The Scientific Way of Warfare , one might think of it as the start of a much broader study of all the ways we ’ve dressed up the chaos of combat in more orderly clothes .
The Cosmic Way of Warfare , it might be called .
The same society that produced the psalm shows plenty of evidence of taking divine action seriously as a military mechanism .
In the sixth chapter of the book of Joshua , the deity issues specific tactical orders to the Israelite army : a six - day program of horn - blowing , marching , and shouting .
On the seventh day the walls of the city fall flat , leaving it naked for the slaughter of almost every man , woman , child , and animal within .
The Hebraic tradition ’s Latin inheritors were prone to a similar tactical physics .
The night before marching on Rome in the year 312 , the pagan Constantine I had a dream and ordered the sign of the cross painted on the shields of his warriors .
When Constantine ’s outnumbered force won a swift victory the next day against Maxentius ( acting on divine prophecies of his own ) , he gave enough of the credit to Jesus that , within a few years , nascent Christianity was on its way to becoming the official cult of the empire .
It is common to think of religion as a primitive form of science , one that asks virtually the same questions and plays a commensurate role in the life of societies .
To be sure , there is a vast religious prehistory to be written that would carry The Cosmic Way of Warfare farther back than Newton .
But Newton — an alchemist obsessed with decoding prophecy — hardly spelled a definite break in which the religious transmuted into the scientific .
And religious ways of warfare hardly disappeared as scientific ones arose .
A fuller cosmology of warfare would embrace both .
Religion and science each provide resources for thinking through the chaos of combat .
If , as Bousquet suggests , we are to take metaphors seriously , let ’s hear out General Tommy Franks ’ turn of phrase when Baghdad fell in 2003 , quoted on the first page of the book : “ I ’ve died and gone to heaven and seen the first bit of net - centric warfare at work ! ”
Or , more to the point , consider President Bush ’s remarks that year to several Palestinian dignitaries , whom he reportedly told , while speaking about the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan , “ I ’m driven with a mission from God . ”
From the commander - in - chief on down , militarized Christianity may be nearly as much a part of the US military ’s control structure as the chain of command .
General David Petraeus , who led the “ surge ” campaign in Iraq , caused controversy by recommending that an evangelical handbook “ should be in every rucksack for those moments when soldiers need spiritual energy . ”
Revelations since 2005 and since showed that cadets and officers at the Air Force Academy were proselytizing to their subordinates and harassing non-Christians .
Meanwhile , increasingly conservative military chaplains serve as moral engineers of the modern battlefield .
Holy war theology has provided ideological infrastructure for the present wars as much as any cutting - edge science .
Both contributed to the fatal mix of brash arrogance and blindness to politics on the ground that permitted the invasion of Iraq to take place and set the stage for a disastrous occupation .
Ironically , the terrorists and insurgents who have made the occupation so vicious appear to grasp the scientific ways of warfare without the benefit of the Pentagon ’s billions .
“ This enemy is better networked than we are , ” lamented General John Abizaid at a 2007 conference in Virginia Beach .
Bousquet also quotes the 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Mohammed boasting , “ I know that the materialistic Western mind cannot grasp … how this works . ”
Such savvy , so removed from MIT or the complexity theorists at the Santa Fe Institute , runs in tension with Bousquet ’s master narrative that links scientific war - making with elite scientific fads .
But works like Olivier Roy ’s Globalized Islam show how network - consciousness has infiltrated contemporary Muslim cultures through informal theology , preached from Jakarta to London in audio lectures and online forums .
The traditional concept of the ummah , or community of believers , has become , in Roy ’s words , a “ virtual community , ” linking alienated elements of the Muslim diaspora through cheap communications technology and easy air travel .
Islamist military tactics ( Web sites as command centers , commercial airplanes as weapons ) developed not simply from Hollywood movies , as was so often claimed following the 2001 attacks , but from the experience that constitutes the Muslim sacred community .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is therefore at least partly right in insisting that spiritual and not merely material forces are at play .
There is no use faulting Bousquet for neglecting a 1,000 - page addendum on religion in his 250 - page book about scientific warfare .
But science was not the beginning of the quest for order on chaotic battlefields , nor is it the end .
Take one startling passage , which he cites as a signal of thermodynamic thinking :
Witnessing Napoleon riding past after his victory at Jena in 1806 , Hegel saw in the Emperor the “ world - spirit , ” the embodied march of History .
No longer merely serving the ambitions of an aristocratic class , wars were now “ engines ” of history , crucial junctures at which nations , peoples , and classes revealed their true nature and purpose , fulfilling their historical destiny .
Clearly , the technoscientific side of Hegel ’s impression is only part of the story .
The Weltgeist was , quite explicitly , a concept through which Hegel sought to synthesize Christian metaphysics with a secular , scientific modernity .
While Napoleon was indeed an actor in the rational mechanics of history , he was no less a harbinger of the Holy Spirit .
The religious valence of Hegel ’s political thought was precisely what made his vision so magisterial and so attractive to a society eager to square Christianity with Enlightenment values .
The Prussian elite adopted this religioscientific philosophy to secure their own rational and divine right to rule and fight .
Seeking their overthrow , after all , Hegel ’s most influential disciple wrote that the critique of religion is the beginning of all critique .
Embracing Complexity
Just as The Scientific Way of Warfare leaves out religion , it falls short on critique .
The latest ambitions of modern militarism escape unscathed .
To its credit , this means the book could be read as profitably at West Point as at the War Resisters League .
Yet in the sequence of Bousquet ’s scientific regimes — from the mechanistic , to the thermodynamic , to the cybernetic , to the chaoplexic — no logic of warfare lives up to its promises , and each comes bearing terrible , unexpected consequences .
The sensation of order each paradigm provides turns out to be a sham .
Bousquet chronicles how clockwork tactics could n’t stop Napoleon ’s cannons , how thermodynamics brought on an age of assured nuclear destruction , and how cybernetics produced a Vietnam War fought in terms of bombing raids and body counts instead of human politics .
The ways of scientific warfare ( or religious , or cosmic warfare ) make war comprehensible enough to be possible in the first place , but they also , as Bousquet ’s book shows , lull us into forgetting the intractable chaos that always accompanies battle , despite every effort to organize it .
After reading his account of the mechanistic , thermodynamic , and cybernetic paradigms , it is hard to imagine hearing their metaphors uncritically again .
But Bousquet serves the chaoplexic no such fate .
“ This approach , ” he said in an interview with the Complex Terrain Laboratory , “ is in my view more in tune with the nature of war and therefore more likely to be successful . ”
War is complex and chaotic , so how better to fight than chaoplexically ?
For him , the error of the Pentagon is not its uncritical embrace of chaoplexic jargon , but its failure to embrace chaoplexity more fully .
If the pattern of the previous three paradigms is any guide , however , chaoplexity will license and unleash on the world a whole new species of militarism , less controllable than what has gone before .
Its own metaphoric vocabulary offers some sense about what this new regime might look like .
Chaoplexic discourse involves “ swarms ” of “ runaway processes , ” “ self - organizing ” by way of positive feedback loops .
Such a force should radically embed itself into the environment , even to the point of being inseparable from it .
Bousquet and the Pentagon agree that , in certain respects , the most chaoplexic fighters are the ones that we ’ve been facing since 2001 .
Self - organizing , embedded , runaway swarms : check , check , check .
So how did al Qaeda get so chaoplexic ?
A utopian religious ideology with no tolerance for subtlety .
Guided by such single - minded objectives , there ’s no need to bother with formal , centralized leadership .
With access to drug money , oil wealth , cheap weapons , and consumer - grade digital toys , they do n’t have to worry that 93 % of people in the Muslim world still refuse to condone the 9/11 attacks .
No one can control them : not their communities , their politicians , their leading clerics , nor even their ostensible figurehead , bin Laden himself .
When forced out of one area , the fighters re-create another in their own image , as we see now in northwest Pakistan , marrying local women and investing in communities .
That ’s what a runaway process looks like .
And by fostering a subculture of hardened “ warriors ” rather than of soldiers bearing ethical responsibilities , where homosexuality means expulsion and theocratic elements run rampant , the Pentagon has been following its enemies ’ lead .
Second - best to the terrorists in chaoplexity is the army of private contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan on the Pentagon ’s payroll .
Often impervious to both military regulations and local laws , these companies have operated with tremendous latitude , forging business and security relationships on the ground that will make them very difficult to extract should the politicians ever want to .
Already outnumbering the regular soldiers deployed in Iraq , this highly adaptable force blurs the lines between business and warfare , military and civilian .
Contractors have taken part in human trafficking , accounting fraud , and murderous outbursts that usually escape prosecution .
In place of religious fundamentalism , their way of warfare follows another kind of science : that of American big business , keeping profits high and accountability low .
In a conversation with Bousquet in London , architectural theorist Geoff Manaugh noted that , in the war on terrorism , “ we find it increasingly difficult to distinguish between states of peace and war . ”
Manaugh spoke of the Conquistadors as a model we should expect to see again in the chaoplexic age : self - organizing , entrepreneurial swarms licensed to do what they will , free from political constraints on their brutality .
But documents like The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo , who fought alongside Cortés , reveal how these Spanish privateers also came by chaoplexity through religion .
After yet another battle against the natives , Castillo speculates that it was only his sins that prevented him from seeing , with his own eyes , the tactical assistance God had surely lent the Spaniards through the apostles James and Peter .
Bousquet may be right that going chaoplexic is the only way Western militaries can vanquish the terrorist villains .
The much - touted surge in Iraq has had success by bringing soldiers out of their bases and into civilian communities , where they can embed and adapt to local conditions as fixtures of everyday life .
But it has also made the prospect of a meaningful exit strategy ever more remote .
The old American theology of manifest destiny has swelled to insist that our bases abroad are there by divinely - ordained right .
We ’re now almost a decade into an Orwellian state of perpetual war - at - a - distance .
Yet Bousquet writes that we are still only in the “ birth pangs ” of the chaoplexic paradigm .
God save us from what this baby looks like when it ’s born ; and from the belief systems that soldiers will need to entertain in order to enact it .
The root of Bousquet ’s credulity regarding the chaoplexic may come from taking too seriously Clausewitz ’s axiom that war equals complexity .
Beyond the foggy complexity , beyond the technoscientific order , beyond every religious mythification of warfare ( past and present ) , there is a lurking simplicity in war as well , something from which all those contrivances serve to distract : horrific , unconscionable violence .
One of the biggest issues facing us right now is global warming .
Its effects on animals and on agriculture are indeed frightening , and the effects on the human population are even scarier .
The facts about global warming are often debated in politics and the media , but , unfortunately , even if we disagree about the causes , global warming effects are real , global , and measurable .
The causes are mainly from us , the human race , and the effects on us will be severe .
Global Warming Effects and Causes : A Top 10 List
1. Global Warming Cause : Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants
Our ever increasing addiction to electricity from coal burning power plants releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
40 % of U.S. CO2 emissions come from electricity production , and burning coal accounts for 93 % of emissions from the electric utility industry [ EPA , pg. 10 ] .
Every day , more electric gadgets flood the market , and without widespread alternative energy sources , we are highly dependent on burning coal for our personal and commercial electrical supply .
2. Global Warming Cause : Carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline for transportation
Our modern car culture and appetite for globally sourced goods is responsible for about 33 % of emissions in the U.S. [ EPA pg. 8 ]
With our population growing at an alarming rate , the demand for more cars and consumer goods means that we are increasing the use of fossil fuels for transportation and manufacturing .
Our consumption is outpacing our discoveries of ways to mitigate the effects , with no end in sight to our massive consumer culture .
3. Global Warming Cause : Methane emissions from animals , agriculture such as rice paddies , and from Arctic seabeds
Methane is another extremely potent greenhouse gas , ranking right behind CO2 .
When organic matter is broken down by bacteria under oxygen - starved conditions ( anaerobic decomposition ) as in rice paddies , methane is produced .
The process also takes place in the intestines of herbivorous animals , and with the increase in the amount of concentrated livestock production , the levels of methane released into the atmosphere is increasing .
Another source of methane is methane clathrate , a compound containing large amounts of methane trapped in the crystal structure of ice .
As methane escapes from the Arctic seabed , the rate of global warming will increase significantly .
4. Global Warming Cause : Deforestation , especially tropical forests for wood , pulp , and farmland
The use of forests for fuel ( both wood and for charcoal ) is one cause of deforestation , but in the first world , our appetite for wood and paper products , our consumption of livestock grazed on former forest land , and the use of tropical forest lands for commodities like palm oil plantations contributes to the mass deforestation of our world .
Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , and this deforestation releases large amounts of carbon , as well as reducing the amount of carbon capture on the planet .
5. Global Warming Cause : Increase in usage of chemical fertilizers on croplands
In the last half of the 20th century , the use of chemical fertilizers ( as opposed to the historical use of animal manure ) has risen dramatically .
The high rate of application of nitrogen - rich fertilizers has effects on the heat storage of cropland ( nitrogen oxides have 300 times more heat - trapping capacity per unit of volume than carbon dioxide ) and the run-off of excess fertilizers creates ‘ dead - zones ’ in our oceans .
In addition to these effects , high nitrate levels in groundwater due to over - fertilization are cause for concern for human health .
Scientists predict an increase in sea levels worldwide due to the melting of two massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland , especially on the East coast of the U.S.
However , many nations around the world will experience the effects of rising sea levels , which could displace millions of people .
One nation , the Maldives , is already looking for a new home , thanks to rising sea levels .
7. Global Warming Effect : More killer storms
The severity of storms such as hurricanes and cyclones is increasing , and research published in Nature found :
“ Scientists have come up with the firmest evidence so far that global warming will significantly increase the intensity of the most extreme storms worldwide .
The maximum wind speeds of the strongest tropical cyclones have increased significantly since 1981 , according to research published in Nature this week .
And the upward trend , thought to be driven by rising ocean temperatures , is unlikely to stop at any time soon . ”
8. Global Warming Effect : Massive crop failures
According to recent research , there is a 90 % chance that 3 billion people worldwide will have to choose between moving their families to milder climes and going hungry due to climate change within 100 years .
One of the main causes of this will be the spread of desertification , and its accompanying effects .
“ Climate change is expected to have the most severe impact on water supplies .
“ Shortages in future are likely to threaten food production , reduce sanitation , hinder economic development and damage ecosystems .
It causes more violent swings between floods and droughts . ” ” – Guardian : Global warming causes 300,000 deaths a year
9. Global Warming Effect : Widespread extinction of species
According to research published in Nature , by 2050 , rising temperatures could lead to the extinction of more than a million species .
And because we ca n’t exist without a diverse population of species on Earth , this is scary news for humans .
This 6th mass extinction is really just a continuation of the holocene extinction which began at the end of the last ice age and has resulted in the extinction of nearly all of the Earth ’s megafauna animals , largely as a result of human - expansion .
“ Climate change now represents at least as great a threat to the number of species surviving on Earth as habitat - destruction and modification . ”
Chris Thomas , conservation biologist at the University of Leeds
Widespread species loss and lists of endangered species just keep growing .

10 . Global Warming Effect : Disappearance of coral reefs
A report on coral reefs from WWF says that in a worst case scenario , coral populations will collapse by 2100 due to increased temperatures and ocean acidification and its effects .
The ‘ bleaching ’ of corals from small but prolonged rises in sea temperature is a severe danger for ocean ecosystems , and many other species in the oceans rely on coral reefs for their survival .
“ Despite the oceans ’s immensity — 71 per cent of the Earth ’s surface with an average depth of almost 4 km ( 2½m ) — there are indications that it is approaching its tipping point .
For reefs , warming waters and acidification are closing in like a pair of jaws that threaten to make them the first global ecosystem to disappear . ”

Oh , I used those textbooks .
There 's got to be something in there on liquidity traps .
Well , not in the index .
And I looked up Bernanke 's PhD thesis , which was on the Great Depression , and I realized that when you 're writing in the 1980s , and there 's a mindset that 's almost universal , you miss a lot of the nuances of what actually happened during the depression .
I am regarded as a Keynesian .
My book , which over a period of about 50 years sold millions of copies , for the first time brought home -- not only to advanced Ivy League places but also to community colleges and high schools -- the gist of the Keynesian macroeconomic system .
I thought it would be a success because it was one Keynesian book by Lorie Tarshis , which for reasons I 've never understood got completely tarred by a kind of a fascist group , and by Bill Buckley , as unsound and so forth .
And unfairly that book never got a good chance .
He had actually been a student of Keynes .
And my book came along and swept the field , and set a pattern so that every time somebody -- this is just scuttlebutt -- so that every time some economics textbook writer sued another textbook writer for plagiarism , it never got anywhere because the judge would just say , 'it 's all Samuelson lite , ' so to speak .
Anyway .
Things swept so badly that I had distrust -- after 1967 , let 's say -- of American Keynesianism .
For better or worse , US Keynesianism was so far ahead of where it started .
I am a cafeteria Keynesian .
You know what a cafeteria catholic is ?
I think so .
Someone who picks and chooses the bits of the doctrine that they find agreeable .
Yeah .
I might go to mass every week , so I 'm a good catholic , but I do n't regulate my family size the way the Pope would like to .
So which bits of the Keynesian doctrine do you not take out of the cafeteria ?
Well , let me give you a bit of boring autobiography .
I came to the University of Chicago on the morning of January 2 , 1932 .
I was n't yet a graduate of high school for another few months .
And that was about the low point of the Herbert Hoover / Andrew Mellon phase after October of 1929 .
That 's quite a number of years to have inaction .
And I could n't reconcile what I was being taught at the university of Chicago -- the lectures and the books I was being assigned -- with what I knew to be true out in the streets .
My family was well off but not rich .
I spent the four years I was an undergraduate working on the beach .
And it was n't because I was lazy ; it was because my freshman class would go to a hundred different employers and would n't get a nibble .
That was a disequilibrium system .
I realized that the ordinary old - fashioned Euclidean geometry did n't apply .
And I applauded when the major members of the Chicago faculty -- maybe even a few years before Keynes 's general theory -- came out with a petition to have a deficit - financed spending without taxation in order to create a new increment of spending power .
And I was for that .
And Franklin Roosevelt , who was not a trained economist , and who experimented and made a lot of mistakes , in his first days , by good luck or good advice got the system moving .
It was in a sense an easier problem because the pathology was so terrible .

Never let it be said that Congress never did anything for you .
In recent weeks , the Senate Commerce Committee has been holding hearings about handset exclusivity .
That ’s when a phone maker ( like Apple ) offers a particular model ( like the iPhone ) to a carrier ( like AT&T ) exclusively for a period of time ( like five years ) .
Come to think about it , that example  the iPhone  is pretty much the only one anybody cares about .
These are n’t handset - exclusivity hearings ; they ’re “ Why ca n’t we have the iPhone on Verizon ? ” hearings .
Look , it ’s great that our elected officials are looking out for us .
The last time Congress got involved , we wound up with phone - number portability , meaning that you can keep your number when you switch phone companies .
That ’s unequivocally a good thing .
But the exclusivity point is not such a slam - dunk .
Sure , everybody would love a Verizon iPhone .
But there are some valid arguments against banning exclusivity deals altogether .
Almost 19 years to the day after Saddam Hussein 's legions invaded Kuwait – and less than 18 years since the US coalition liberated it – the Croesus - rich emirate is still demanding reparations from Baghdad as if the dictator of Iraq was still alive .
Only this week , the Kuwaitis were accusing the Iraqis of encroaching on their unmarked border while insisting at the United Nations that Iraq must continue to pay 5 per cent of its oil revenues to Kuwait as invasion reparations .
Hamid al - Bayati , Baghdad 's UN ambassador , has pleaded at the UN for an immediate reduction now that Saddam 's regime has been gone for more than six years .
Up until April of 2009 , Iraq had paid $ 27.1 bn of the total compensation but still owes Kuwait alone another $ 24bn , " a heavy burden on Iraq , " as Mr Bayati put it , " which needs the money for services , reconstruction and development . "
Nouri al - Maliki , the Iraqi Prime Minister , has now told the UN that reparations can surely be reduced since modern - day Iraq no longer poses a threat to anyone .

He was speaking to the deaf .
Kuwait is currently being as ruthless – or greedy – in its demands as it was before Saddam invaded on 2 August 1990 .
In the weeks before the attack , Kuwait had raised its oil production from 1.5 million barrels a day – the Opec quota – to 1.9 million .
Saddam claimed that a fall of just $ 1 a barrel – it had already fallen from $ 18 to $ 14 – would cost Iraq , which had only two years earlier finally concluded its eight - year war with Iran , $ 1bn a year in lost income .
Saddam also claimed that Kuwait had been stealing oil from Iraq 's southern fields by boring northwards along their mutual frontier ; in other words , Kuwait was thieving the resources of the nation whose armies saved it from Iran 's revolution .
Exclusive as these claims appeared to be – although no one could contradict the rise in Kuwaiti oil production – this formed part of the background to the frontier dispute which Kuwait is still haggling over .
Kuwait is still demanding not only reparations but another $ 16bn in loans that funded the war with Iran , a conflict that has already entered the history books .
No wonder , then , that poor old Iraq – whose current oil revenues have fallen from $ 7bn just over a year ago to just over $ 2bn in May – is considering a request for $ 7bn in loans from the International Monetary Fund .
Since the current Iraqi government is effectively a Shia Muslim administration , Mr Maliki has reason to feel aggrieved .
The Shia suffered more from Saddam than the Kuwaitis , and Iraq today is a friendly nation – if it really is a state – rather than an international pariah .
The debt burden to Kuwait is beginning to sniff like that other outrageous set of reparations levelled against another state , Germany , in 1919 .
Which is why a number of countries to whom Iraq owed debts – the United Arab Emirates has just written off $ 7bn – have abandoned their reparations demands after the usual American pressure .
So is this just typical Kuwaiti meanness , an oil - dripping emirate with a per capita income of $ 41,000 further crushing a nation with a per capita income of less that $ 4,000 ?
Middle East oil analysts have their doubts .
" The Kuwaitis have always had a reputation for stinginess , " one said yesterday in despair .
" But I think there is more to this than you think .
Kuwait was a founder of the Gulf development fund and in the '60s , '70s and ' 80s , treated Palestinians and Lebanese without restrictions – and the Palestinians then betrayed the Kuwaitis by falling in with Saddam after the 1990 invasion . "
But there is more – and it involves the ethnic balance in the two nations ' populations .
" Maybe 40 per cent of people in Kuwait are now Shia rather than Sunni Muslims and these people are now investing heavily in southern Iraq , " the oil man said yesterday .
" The Kuwaiti Shias are becoming ' Basra - ites ' and vice versa .
More and more Shia from the south of Iraq are becoming businessmen and trading with Kuwait .
This causes a blurring of the border between the two countries , a feeling that the two economies are becoming linked .
No wonder the Kuwaitis want to stand by the letter of the law . "
There are some unpleasant precedents for the Kuwaitis .
The crushing debt which the Treaty of Versailles heaped upon Germany was lesson enough ; Germany 's financial loss became Hitler 's gain .
Maybe the Kuwaitis should pull out some history books and ponder what Iraq will look like – and who its leader may be – in 20 years ' time .
Washington
ABDULLAH GHULAM RASOUL and Said Ali al - Shihri may be the two best arguments for why releasing detainees from Guantánamo Bay poses a real risk to America .
Mr. Rasoul , who was transferred to Afghanistan in 2007 and then released by the Kabul government , is now the commander of operations for the Taliban in southern Afghanistan .
Mr. Shihri , sent back to his native Saudi Arabia in 2007 , is now a leader of Al Qaeda ’s affiliate in Yemen .
Are these two men exceptional cases , or are they emblematic of a much larger problem of dangerous terrorists who , if released , will “ return to the battlefield ” ?
To help answer that question , a Pentagon report made public on Tuesday concluded that 74 of the 534 men who have been freed from Guantánamo were “ confirmed or suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activities . ”
This is a recidivism rate of around 14 percent , which was up from the Pentagon ’s previous estimate in January of 11 percent .
But are things this bad ?
While we must of course be careful about who is released , these numbers are very likely inflated .
This is in part because the Pentagon includes on the list any released prisoner who is either “ confirmed ” or just “ suspected ” to have engaged in terrorism anywhere in the world , whether those actions were directed at the United States or not .
And , bizarrely , the Defense Department has in the past even lumped into the recidivist category former prisoners who have done no more than criticize the United States after their release .
Because of national security concerns , the new report does not include the names of the majority of those believed to have engaged in violence  45 of the 74 .
There is surely some legitimacy to that claim .
Yet the omissions make it hard to scrutinize the report .
That said , thanks to previous Pentagon documents and other public records , we do have a good picture of what the 29 men the report does name have been up to .

WHEN WE THINK of the drug war , it ’s the heavy - duty narcotics like heroin and cocaine that get most of the attention .
And why not ?
That ’s where the action is .
It ’s not marijuana that is sustaining the Taliban in Afghanistan , after all .
When Crips and Bloods descend into gun battles in the streets of Los Angeles , they ’re not usually fighting over pot .
The junkie who breaks into your house and steals your Blu-ray player is n’t doing it so he can score a couple of spliffs .
No , the marijuana trade is more genteel than that .
At least , I used to think it was .
Then , like a lot of people , I started reading about the open warfare that has erupted among the narcotraffickers in Mexico and is now spilling across the American border .
Stories of drugs coming north and arsenals of guns going south .
Thousands of people brutally murdered .
Entire towns terrorized .
And this was a war not just over cocaine and meth , but marijuana as well .
And I began to wonder : Maybe the war against pot is about to get a lot uglier .
After all , in the 1920s , Prohibition gave us Al Capone and the St. Valentine ’s Day Massacre , and that was over plain old whiskey and rum .
Are we about to start paying the same price for marijuana ?
If so , it might eventually start to affect me , too .
Indirectly , sure , but that ’s more than it ever has before .
I ’ve never smoked a joint in my life .
I ’ve only seen one once , and that was 30 years ago .
I barely drink , I do n’t smoke , and I do n’t like coffee .
When it comes to mood altering substances , I live the life of a monk .
I never really cared much if marijuana was legal or not .
But if a war is breaking out over the stuff , I figured maybe I should start looking at the evidence on whether marijuana prohibition is worth it .
Not the spin from the drug czar at one end or the hemp hucksters at the other .
Just the facts , as best as I could figure them out .
So I did .
Here ’s what I found .
In 1972 , the report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse urged that possession of marijuana for personal use be decriminalized .
A small wave of states followed this recommendation , but most refused ; in Washington , President Carter called for eliminating penalties for small - time possession , but Congress stonewalled .
And that ’s the way things have stayed since the late ’ 70s .
Some states have decriminalized , most have n’t , and possession is still a criminal offense under federal law .
So how has that worked out ?
I wo n’t give away the ending just yet , but one thing to know is this :
On virtually every subject related to cannabis ( an inclusive term that refers to both the sativa and indica varieties of the marijuana plant , as well as hashish , bhang , and other derivatives ) , the evidence is ambiguous .
Sometimes even mysterious .
So let ’s start with the obvious question .
DOES DECRIMINALIZING
CANNABIS HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL ?
It ’s remarkably hard to tell — in part because drug use is faddish .
Cannabis use among teens in the United States , for example , went down sharply in the ’ 80s , bounced back in the early ’90s , and has declined moderately since .
Nobody really knows why .
We do , however , have studies that compare rates of cannabis use in states that have decriminalized vs. states that have n’t .
And the somewhat surprising conclusion , in the words of Robert MacCoun , a professor of law and public policy at the University of California - Berkeley , is simple : “ Most of the evidence suggests that decriminalization has no effect . ”
But decriminalization is not legalization .
In places that have decriminalized , simple possession is still illegal ; it ’s just treated as an administrative offense , like a traffic ticket .
And production and distribution remain felonies .
What would happen if cannabis use were fully legalized ?
No country has ever done this , so we do n’t know .
The closest example is the Netherlands , where possession and sale of small amounts of marijuana is de facto legal in the famous coffeehouses .
MacCoun and a colleague , Peter Reuter of the University of Maryland , have studied the Dutch experience and concluded that while legalization at first had little effect , once the coffeehouses began advertising and promoting themselves more aggressively in the 1980s , cannabis use more than doubled in a decade .
Then again , cannabis use in Europe has gone up and down in waves , and some of the Dutch increase ( as well as a later decrease , which followed a tightening of the coffeehouse laws in the mid-’90s ) may have simply been part of those larger waves .
The most likely conclusion from the overall data is that if you fully legalized cannabis , use would almost certainly go up , but probably not enormously .
MacCoun guesses that it might rise by half — say , from around 15 percent of the population to a little more than 20 percent .
“ It ’s not going to triple , ” he says .
“ Most people who want to use marijuana are already finding a way to use marijuana . ”
Still , there would be a cost .
For one thing , a much higher increase is n’t out of the question if companies like Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds set their finest minds on the promotion of dope .
And much of the increase would likely come among the heaviest users .
“ One person smoking eight joints a day is worth more to the industry than fifty people each smoking a joint a week , ” says Mark Kleiman , a drug policy expert at UCLA .
“ If the cannabis industry were to expand greatly , it could n’t do so by increasing the number of casual users .
It would have to create and maintain more chronic zonkers . ”
And that ’s a problem .
Chronic use can lead to dependence and even long - term cognitive impairment .
Heavy cannabis users are more likely to be in auto accidents .
There have been scattered reports of respiratory and fetal development problems .
Still , sensible regulation can limit the commercialization of pot , and compared to other illicit drugs ( and alcohol ) , its health effects are fairly mild .
Even a 50 percent increase in cannabis use might be a net benefit if it led to lower rates of use of other drugs .
SO WOULD PEOPLE JUST SMOKE MORE AND DRINK LESS ?
Maybe .
The generic term for this effect in the economics literature is “ substitute goods , ” and it simply means that some things replace other things .
If the total demand for transportation is generally steady , an increase in sales of SUVs will lead to a decrease in the sales of sedans .
Likewise , if the total demand for intoxicants is steady , an increase in the use of one drug should lead to a decrease in others .
Several years ago , John DiNardo , an economist now at the University of Michigan , found a clever way to test this via a natural experiment .
Back in the 1980s , the Reagan administration pushed states to raise the drinking age to 21 .
Some states did this early in the decade , some later , and this gave DiNardo the idea of comparing data from the various states to see if the Reagan policy worked .
He found that raising the drinking age did lead to lower alcohol consumption ; the effect was modest but real .
But then DiNardo hit on another analysis — comparing cannabis use in states that raised the drinking age early with those that did it later .
And he found that indeed , there seemed to be a substitution effect .
On average , among high school seniors , a 4.5 percent decrease in drinking produced a 2.4 percent increase in getting high .
But what we really want to know is whether the effect works in the other direction :
Would increased marijuana use lead to less drinking ?
“ What goes up should go down , ” DiNardo told me cheerfully , but he admits that in the absence of empirical evidence this hypothesis depends on your faith in basic economic models .
Some other studies are less encouraging than DiNardo ’s , but even if the substitute goods effect is smaller than his research suggests — if , say , a 30 percent increase in cannabis use led to a 5 or 10 percent drop in drinking — it would still be a strong argument in favor of legalization .
After all , excessive drinking causes nearly 80,000 deaths per year in the United States , compared to virtually none for pot .
Trading alcohol consumption for cannabis use might be a pretty attractive deal .
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GATEWAY EFFECT ?
This has been a perennial bogeyman of the drug warriors .
Kids who use pot , the TV ads tell us , will graduate to ecstasy , then coke , then meth , and then — who knows ?
Maybe even talk radio .
Is there anything to this ?
There are two plausible pathways for the gateway theory .
The first is that drug use of any kind creates an affinity for increasingly intense narcotic experiences .
The second is that when cannabis is illegal , the only place to get it is from dealers who also sell other stuff .
The evidence for the first pathway is mixed .
Research in New Zealand , for example , suggests that regular cannabis use is correlated with higher rates of other illicit drug use , especially in teenagers .
A Norwegian study comes to similar conclusions , but only for a small segment of “ troubled ” teenagers .
Other research , however , suggests that these correlations are n’t caused by gateway effects at all , but by the simple fact that kids who like drugs do drugs .
All kinds of drugs .
The second pathway was deliberately targeted by the Dutch when they began their coffeehouse experiment in the ’70s in part to sever the connection of cannabis with the illicit drug market .
The evidence suggests that it worked : Even with cannabis freely available , Dutch cannabis use is currently about average among developed countries and use of other illicit drugs is about average , too .
Easy access to marijuana , outside the dealer network for harder drugs , does n’t seem to have led to greater use of cocaine or heroin .
So , to recap : Decriminalization of simple possession appears to have little effect on cannabis consumption .
Full legalization would likely increase use only moderately as long as heavy commercialization is prohibited , although the effect on chronic users might be more substantial .
It would increase heroin and cocaine use only slightly if at all , and it might decrease alcohol consumption by a small amount .
Which leads to the question :
CAN WE STILL AFFORD PROHIBITION ?
The consequences of legalization , after all , must be compared to the cost of the status quo .
Unsurprisingly , this too is hard to quantify .
The worst effects of the drug war , including property crime and gang warfare , are mostly associated with cocaine , heroin , and meth .
Likewise , most drug - law enforcement is aimed at harder drugs , not cannabis ; contrary to conventional wisdom , only about 44,000 people are currently serving prison time on cannabis charges — and most of those are there for dealing and distribution , not possession .
Still , the University of Maryland ’s Reuter points out that about 800,000 people are arrested for cannabis possession every year in the United States .
And even though very few end up being sentenced to prison , a study of three counties in Maryland following a recent marijuana crackdown suggests that a third spend at least one pretrial night in jail and a sixth spend more than ten days .
That takes a substantial human toll .
Overall , Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron estimates the cost of cannabis prohibition in the United States at $ 13 billion annually and the lost tax revenue at nearly $ 7 billion .
SO WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF LEGALIZATION ?
Slim .
For starters , the United States , along with virtually every other country in the world , is a signatory to the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs ( and its 1988 successor ) , which flatly prohibits legalization of cannabis .
The only way around this is to unilaterally withdraw from the treaties or to withdraw and then reenter with reservations .
That ’s not going to happen .
At the federal level , there ’s virtually no appetite for legalizing cannabis either .
Though public opinion has made steady strides , increasing from around 20 percent favoring marijuana legalization in the Reagan era to nearly 40 percent favoring it today , the only policy change in Washington has been Attorney General Eric Holder ’s announcement in March that the Obama administration planned to end raids on distributors of medical marijuana .
( Applications for pot dispensaries promptly surged in Los Angeles County . )
The real action in cannabis legalization is at the state level .
More than a dozen states now have effective medical marijuana laws , most notably California .
Medical marijuana dispensaries are dotted all over the state , and it ’s common knowledge that the “ medical ” part is in many cases a thin fiction .
Like the Dutch coffeehouses , California ’s dispensaries are now a de facto legal distribution network that severs the link between cannabis and other illicit drugs for a significant number of adults ( albeit still only a fraction of total users ) .
And the result ?
Nothing .
“ We ’ve had this experiment for a decade and the sky has n’t fallen , ” says Paul Armentano , deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano has even introduced a bill that would legalize , tax , and regulate marijuana ; it has gained the endorsement of the head of the state ’s tax collection agency , which informally estimates it could collect $ 1.3 billion a year from cannabis sales .
Still , the legislation has n’t found a single cosponsor , and is n’t scheduled for so much as a hearing .
Which is too bad .
Going into this assignment , I did n’t care much personally about cannabis legalization .
I just had a vague sense that if other people wanted to do it , why not let them ?
But the evidence suggests pretty clearly that we ought to significantly soften our laws on marijuana .
Too many lives have been ruined and too much money spent for a social benefit that , if not zero , certainly is n’t very high .
And it may actually happen .
If attitudes continue to soften ; if the Obama administration turns down the volume on anti-pot propaganda ; if medical dispensaries avoid heavy commercialization ; if drug use remains stable ; and if emergency rooms do n’t start filling up with drug - related traumas while all this is happening , California ’s experience could go a long way toward destigmatizing cannabis use .
That ’s a lot of ifs .
Still , things are changing .
Even GOP icon Arnold Schwarzenegger now says , “ I think it ’s time for a debate . ”
That does n’t mean he ’s in favor of legalizing pot right this minute , but it might mean we ’re getting close to a tipping point .
Ten years from now , as the flower power generation enters its 70s , you might finally be able to smoke a fully legal , taxed , and regulated joint .
Sunday , May 31 , 2009
Last year at GDC I was talking to the Wild Shadow Studios guys about traditional classes in fantasy RPGs ( ranger , wizard , barbarian , cleric , etc. ) .
Some of our complaints about classes in many multiplayer RPGs :
Classes come with roles such as “ tank ” , “ healer ” , “ ranged ” , “ melee ” , “ crowd control ” , etc .
If you want to join a group that needs a tank , but your class is about melee damage , you can't join the group .
The beginning of the game is a bad time to choose a class , which impacts you for the entire game .
It 's too early in the game to know what style of play you might like or what kind of roles are needed / useful .
By the time you can make this decision it 's too late ; you 've already invested lots of time into the game .
Either you throw all that away or you keep playing the class that 's not best for you .
Every class 's play style can be considered “ content ” , and by choosing just one the player is missing out on other styles of play .
As a game developer , if you have 5 classes , and players only play one of these on average , you 're spending a lot of money on “ content ” that most players wo n't see , especially if armor / weapons are written for just a few classes in mind .
In Diablo 2 , you picked a class but you could also customize that class by choosing skills as you level up .
For example , Barbarians could choose skills such as Taunt or Double Swing .
The skills had level requirements and prerequisites ; for example , Double Swing was only available if you already had Bash .
The trees were divided into three specialties per class ; each of these effectively acts as a sub-class , so you had 15 styles of play instead of just 5 classes .
The skills available to you were fairly limited at the beginning of the game , so you 're not overwhelmed , and you do n't have to make your choices at the beginning .
This partially addresses complaint # 2 .
In Guild Wars and Titan Quest , you get to pick two classes .
Multiclassing has been around since the D&D days , but these two games makes two classes the default and one class an option .
Multiple classes can help with complaint # 1 , since everyone has two roles .
It also helps with complaint # 3 , by adding lots of variety without having to create new content around it .
In Silverfall , World of Warcraft , and Titan Quest , I can change my skills later in the game , but not my class .
WoW also has hybrid classes such as druid and shaman that can perform multiple roles .
This also helps slightly with complaint # 1 , but it 's quite a hassle .
( Recently , WoW introduced “ dual specs ” , which help quite a bit by letting you set up two sets of skills that can be swapped with one button . )
Being able to change my skills later greatly increased my desire to experiment .
In Diablo 2 , I would pick skills based on the recommendations of others .
Decisions you can't change are more likely to be conservative .
But in WoW , I am much more willing to try out new things , because I can undo them .
In Dungeon Siege II , there are skill trees but no classes .
You essentially define your class by choosing skills along the way , but you do n't have to decide anything at the beginning of the game .
Titan Quest also delays the decision - making of your first and second classes .
Either approach addresses complaint # 2 .
Another way to address all three complaints is to have more than one character , each one trying out a different class and play style .
But when playing these characters , you start over from scratch .
What I 'd like is ( a ) delaying decisions about classes / skills , and ( b ) allowing trying out other choices after I'm “ finished ” with my current class .
So here 's the idea : as you progress in the game , you are given choices of specialties .
If you later master multiple specialties , you can become a generalist .
Here 's a diagram :
After you 've played for a short time , you get to choose weaponry or magic .
I choose weaponry .
After playing more and leveling up with weaponry skills , I am able to specialize again , and I learn melee .
After learning all the melee skills , I specialize in swords .
After a few more levels , I am now fully specialized by mastering swords , and there 's no more for me to learn .
This is the equivalent of “ level 80 ” in WoW .
At this point , it 's time to try the branches I had n't tried .
This could either be by starting over with a new character at the novice level ; or it could be by restoring a previous savegame where I was still at weaponry ( playing a “ clone ” in a scifi setting ) , and choosing the ranged path instead ; or it could be by using my current character to go back and learn ranged attacks .
I do n't know which of those approaches would be best for a game .
In any case , I 'm now trying out other play styles , just as with current RPGs .
Where this design differs is that there 's something gained in - game by learning multiple specialties .
This is the lower half of the diagram .
If I master both the sword and axe , that unlocks the halberd .
If I master both ice and death magic , it unlocks wizardry skills .
By playing and mastering all types of characters , I become a Master .
An open question is how you handle the huge number of skills once you 've pursued multiple paths .
Titan Quest and Guild Wars limit your classes to two , so that it 's not too bad .
WoW lets you have two sets of skills , and you can swap back and forth at any time .
Guild Wars further gives you a fixed number of skills at any time , and you can swap these out when you 're in a major city .
In a scifi setting , such as a robot or spaceship based game , you could assign the skills to the robot / vehicle you 're in , and then jump into a different robot / vehicle to swap skills ( Wild Shadow Studios is working on a tank - based MMO that does this ) .
Choosing sets of skills before you go into combat seems like a reasonable way to limit the complexity , and also encourage planning ahead .
This skill graph addresses complaint # 2 : you do n't have to make permanent choices at all , and the choices you make come after you 've been playing the game for a bit .
It also addresses # 3 : there 's a path for the player to experience all the “ content ” the developers create .
It partially addresses # 1 , by allowing you to play different roles at different times .
Novice players can follow a recommended path to specialize in just one “ class ” , whereas experienced players can experiment more and try out new combinations .
I think it could be fun to play with such a system , but I 'm not planning to write an RPG any time soon .

A few years ago a single mother who had recently moved to town came to my office asking me to prescribe the stimulant drug Adderall for her sixth - grade son .
The boy had been taking the medication for several years , and his mother had liked its effects : it made homework time easier and improved her son ’s grades .
Be careful what you write on social networking sites .
That 's the recent message from a California appellate court .
Those who post on MySpace cannot assert invasion of privacy claims if their words are republished in a newspaper without consent .
The case , California 's first on the issue , concerns a University of California student who ranted on her MySpace account about how much she hated her hometown of Coalinga in the Central Valley .
The Coalinga Record , the local newspaper , published Cynthia Moreno 's " Ode . "
She sued the paper for invasion of privacy after members of the local community allegedly ran her family out of town and threatened to kill them .
The state appeals court , however , ruled she had no privacy rights to her internet speech .
" Here , Cynthia publicized her opinions about Coalinga by posting the Ode on MySpace.com , a hugely popular internet site , " the 5th District Court of Appeal wrote .
" Cynthia 's affirmative act made her article available to any person with a computer and thus opened it to the public eye .
Under these circumstances , no reasonable person would have had an expectation of privacy regarding the published material . "
However , the court said the woman could sue for infliction of emotional distress .
Those allegations target the principal of the local high school who forwarded the MySpace essay to the newspaper for publication .
Cynthia Moreno's family received death threats and a shot was fired at the family home , forcing the family to move out of Coalinga last year , according to the court .
Due to severe losses , the father closed the 20 - year - old family business .
The principal who forwarded the rant to the newspaper , according to court records , was Roger Campbell .
Cynthia Moreno's little sister was attending the school when the letter was published .
" We believed he foresaw there would be a serious reaction to this , " the Moreno family attorney , Paul Kleven , said in an interview .
The principal 's attorney was not immediately available for comment .
The court also ruled the local paper , which published Cynthia Moreno 's diatribe in the letter 's section , had a First Amendment right to publish the MySpace essay .

Reds boss Rafa Benitez has denied rumours that French attacker Franck Ribery is set for a move to Merseyside .
Speculation was rife following Skybet bookmakers slashing the odds on Ribery joining Liverpool after a series of bets were placed .
But Rafa says we should n’t expect any big money signings this summer .
“ I do n’t think we will be signing anyone else for big , big money – just maybe the ones who can fit into our team ” said the Spaniard .
Instead the manager indicated it is more important to keep Alonso and Mascherano , “ I will be really pleased if we can keep this squad together because I do n’t think we need to do too many things to get us in position .
“ Now we are just thinking of improving the fitness of the players , not thinking of the transfer market .
We have the quality and will have chances again . ”
The Mirror report that Benitez is still looking to sign Valencia ’s Spanish midfielder David Silva , but only if the fee can be around Â£ 15 m .
Young goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis has joined Wrexham on loan for the season .
“ We know that what ’s accessible in our minds can exert an influence on judgment and behavior simply because it ’s there , it ’s floating on the surface of consciousness , ” said Jamie Arndt , a psychologist at the University of Missouri .

The empirical evidence of this influence has been piling up in recent years , as Dr. Wegner documents in the new paper .
In the lab , psychologists have people try to banish a thought from their minds  of a white bear , for example  and find that the thought keeps returning , about once a minute .
Likewise , people trying not to think of a specific word continually blurt it out during rapid - fire word - association tests .
The same “ ironic errors , ” as Dr. Wegner calls them , are just easy to evoke in the real world .
Golfers instructed to avoid a specific mistake , like overshooting , do it more often when under pressure , studies find .
Soccer players told to shoot a penalty kick anywhere but at a certain spot of the net , like the lower right corner , look at that spot more often than any other .
Efforts to be politically correct can be particularly treacherous .
In one study , researchers at Northwestern and Lehigh Universities had 73 students read a vignette about a fictional peer , Donald , a black male .
The students saw a picture of him and read a narrative about his visit to a mall with a friend .
In the crowded parking lot , Donald would not park in a handicap space , even though he was driving his grandmother ’s car , which had a pass , but he did butt in front of another driver to snag a nonhandicap space .
He snubbed a person collecting money for a heart fund , while his friend contributed some change .
And so on .
The story purposely portrayed the protagonist in an ambiguous way .
The researchers had about half the students try to suppress bad stereotypes of black males as they read and , later , judged Donald ’s character on measures like honesty , hostility and laziness .
These students rated Donald as significantly more hostile  but also more honest  than did students who were not trying to suppress stereotypes .
In short , the attempt to banish biased thoughts worked , to some extent .
But the study also provided “ a strong demonstration that stereotype suppression leads stereotypes to become hyperaccessible , ” the authors concluded .
I t is undoubtedly the largest case of Israeli spying in the United States  that has been made public  since 1986 .
In June 2001 , an investigative report detailed the activities of more than one - hundred Israeli agents , some presenting themselves as fine arts students , others tied to Israeli high - tech companies .
All were challenged by the authorities , were questioned , and a dozen of them are still imprisoned .
One of their tasks was to track the Al - Qaida terrorists on American territory  without informing the federal authorities .
Elements of this investigation , taken up by American television Fox News , reinforce this thesis : that Israel did not transmit to the United States all the evidence in its possession on the preparation of the September 11 attacks .
The latest issue of the Online Intelligence Letter , a publication specializing in questions of information , has revealed that a vast Israeli spy network operating on American territory was dismantled .
It is the biggest affair involving the Mossad ( the Israels external security agency ) in activity against the United States since Jonathan Pollard , an employee of the US Navy , was condemned to life in prison , in 1986 , for spying for Israels benefit .
Which was the real scale of this network ?
The facts evoked by an American investigative report do not indicate if the network obtained the information it was after , or if the authorities dismantled it in its initial phase .
According to the chief editor of Online Intelligence , Guillaume Dasquié , this " vast network of Israeli intelligence agents was neutralized by the counter - espionage services of the Department of Justice . "
The Americans " would have apprehended or expelled close to 120 Israeli nationals . "
M. Dasquié gives a report on a " 61 - page review article " from June 2001 , given to the American justice department by a " task force " made up of agents of the DEA ( Drug Enforcement Administration ) and some INS ( Immigration and Naturalization Service ) agents " who were associated with the FBI and the office of investigation of the US Air Force . "
Questioned by Le Monde , Will Glaspy , of the Public Affairs department of the DEA , authenticated this report , and said the DEA " holds a copy . "
This is not the first time that information relating to Israeli espionage appeared in the United States since the Pollard affair .
In June 1999 , the review Insight had described , at length , a " secret " investigation by division 5 of the FBI regarding Israeli phone - tapping targeting the White House , the State Department and the National Security Council .
After the attacks of September 11 , very little detailed information had come out about the arrest of some sixty Israelis .
Finally , from the 11th to the 14th of December 2001 , the Fox News television channel aired an investigation in four parts into Israeli espionage in the United States , in the broadcast " Carl Cameron Investigates . "
The Israeli embassy in Washington immediately responded by stating that it did not contain " anything true . "
American Jewish organizations such JINSA ( Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ) , AIPAC ( America - Israel Political Action Committee ) and others , denounced the report as a " machination . "
Fox withdrew from its Internet site , one day and half after its posting , all the material related to this investigation .
Le Monde requested three times with Fox News to provide a tape of the broadcast .
It was never done .
On February 26 , Fox told our correspondent in New York that sending it posed " a problem , " without being specific .
Le Monde , however took note of the whole script in this investigation .
Carl Cameron evokes " a vast secret investigation held there " relating to " 140 Israelis made to pass for students of the University of Jerusalem or Betzalel Academy of Arts [ which have ] unceasingly sought to come into contact with civil servants and , according to a document , targeted and penetrated military bases , dozens of buildings of the DEA , FBI , and others . "
His investigation focused on two aspects .
Firstly , could the Israelis have had preliminary knowledge of the September 11 attacks and not informed the Americans ?
His sources , explains Carl Cameron , tell him : " The principal question is how they could they have not known ?  "
On the screen , his editor - in - chief tells him thus : " Certain reports confirm that the Mossad sent representatives to the United States to warn them , before September 11 , of the imminence of a major terrorist attack .
That does not go in the direction of an absence of warning . "
Camerons response : " The problem is not the absence of warning , but the absence of useful details " compared to those which American services suspect Israel of having held .
The second round of the investigation touched on Israeli companies providing administrative services for American companies , which would conceal information .
It was aimed at the manufacturer of Amdocs software , placed on Wall Street , which lists , for the 25 major telephone companies of the United States , all the calls coming into and originating from American territory , as well as the companies Nice and Comverse Infosys , the latter providing the data - processing programs to American law enforcement agencies authorized to eavesdrop on private phone conversations .
Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the " catch gates " in order to " intercept , record and store " these wire - taps .
This hardware would render the " listener " himself " listened to . "
Question to Cameron : " Are there reasons to believe the Israeli government is implicated ? "
Answer : " No , none , but a classified top - secret investigation is underway . "
The broadcast had been shown beforehand to the highest persons in charge of the CIA , the FBI , the NSA ( the agency in charge of phone - taps ) , the DEA and the American Justice Department , none of which objected to its airing .
The report submitted to the American Justice Department , to which Le Monde had access , shows that many of the " fine - arts students " suspected of illicit activity have a military past in Israeli information or advanced technology units .
Some entered and left the United States on several occasions , remaining each time for short periods .
Several are related to the hi-tech Israeli companies of Amdocs , Nice and Retalix .
Challenged , a " coed " saw her guarantee of $ 10,000 paid by an Israeli working at Amdocs .
Questioned , two others admitted being employed by Retalix .
Le Monde obtained other information not contained in this report .
Six of the intercepted " students " had a cellular telephone bought by an Israeli ex-vice - consul in the United States .
Two others , at an unspecified time , arrived in Miami by direct flight from Hamburg , and went to the residence of an FBI agent , to try to sell him artwork , left again for the Chicago airport to go to the residence of an agent of the justice department , then again took a plane directly for Toronto  all in one day .
More than a third of these " students , " who , according to the report , moved in at least 42 American cities , stated they resided in Florida .
Five at least were intercepted in Hollywood , and two in Fort Lauderdale .
Hollywood is a town of 25,000 inhabitants to the north of Miami , close to Fort Lauderdale .
At least 10 of the 19 terrorists of 9/11 were residing in Florida .
Four of the five members of the group that diverted American Airlines flight number 11  Mohammed Atta , Abdulaziz Al - Omari , Walid and Waïl Al - Shehri , as well as one of the five terrorists of United flight 175 , Marwan Al - Shehhi  resided all at various times in ...
Hollywood , Florida .
As for Ahmed Fayez , Ahmed and Hamza Al - Ghamdi and Mohand Al - Shehri , who took over United flight 75 , like Saïd Al - Ghamdi , Ahmed Al - Haznawi and Ahmed Al - Nami , of United flight 93 which crashed September 11 in Pennsylvania , and Nawaq Al - Hamzi , of AA flight 77 ( crashed into the Pentagon ) , they all at one time resided at Delray Beach , in the north of Fort Lauderdale .
This convergence is , inter alia , the origin of the American conviction that one of the tasks of the Israeli " students " would have been to track the Al - Qaida terrorists on their territory , without informing the federal authorities of the existence of the plot .
Two enigmas remain .
Why was the Israeli network a priority of drug enforcement agents ?
An assumption : the DEA is the main American agency inquiring into the money laundering .
A network such as Al - Qaida used " dirty " [ funding ] , and the Talibans Afghanistan was the primary exporter of opium in the world .
Why this astonishing " cover " of false students canvassers for poor artwork ?
The Israeli network seemed to hold lists of names .
Its members knew at which office or which private residence to go .
The objective was apparently to make contact , even for a short time .
According to an Israeli specialist in espionage , " this story is a ridiculous joke , and is not serious . "
Contacted , the services of the Israeli Prime Minister still had not , as of Monday evening March 4 , answered our questions .
The American Justice Department indicated to us that " a dozen " of these " students " would still be imprisoned indefinitely , and all the others had been released or deported .
The FBI indicated to us that it will not make " any comment at this stage . "
The CIA , the FBI , the DEA , the INS , the NSA , the Justice Department and the Pentagon have all designated an investigator on this file .

The men lived in a simulated space capsule without windows
Six European volunteers have emerged from a simulated space capsule in Moscow after spending more than three months locked inside .
They were part of an experiment into how astronauts might deal with the very cramped conditions and prolonged isolation of a journey to Mars .
The four Russians , a German and a Frenchman seemed none the worse for wear after their " trip " .
The capsule , without windows , had never left the ground during the 105 days .
It was designed to make them feel as isolated as they would be on a real trip to Mars , including very cramped accommodation and radio communication delayed by up to 20 minutes .
Just before coming out on Tuesday , the German member of the group admitted that he had completely lost all track of time .
However , 105 days is not nearly long enough to get to Mars and back .
So next year another group of volunteers will enter the same cramped capsule and be sealed inside for a daunting 520 days - nearly a year and a half .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A zombie movie made using a camcorder for less then the price of a DVD box set is set to be distributed in cinemas across the UK .
" Colin " director Marc Price who spent 18 months making the film , working nights at a private car hire firm .
" Colin , " made by budding British director , Marc Price , will now get its own DVD as well as hitting the big screen in time for Halloween alongside Hollywood blockbusters like " Zombieland . "
" It 's kind of scary in a cool way , " says Price of his success on a shoestring .
Price wrote , directed , shot and edited " Colin " over 18 months while working nights at a taxi company .
The 30 - year - old first - time director says he managed to make the film for so little by advertising for volunteer zombies on social networking site , Facebook .
He also borrowed make - up and taught himself special effects by endlessly re-watching making - of featurettes and director 's commentaries from his personal DVD collection .
Price says he spent the $ 70 on " a crowbar and a couple of tapes , and some tea and coffee -- just to keep the zombies happy . "
Since " Colin's " success Price has been contacted by hundreds of fledgling filmmakers from around the world inspired to try making their own films despite a lack of money .
" That 's the best bit , " he said .
" That someone like me at 16 , wondering how they can make their movie will see mine and think , ' My mobile has better resolution than his camcorder . '
" Hopefully there 's a chance that other filmmakers will make use of what resources they have to tell the best story they can . "
Price says he will be putting his own making - of featurette on the " Colin " DVD to help young directors .
" We will blow the lid on all of our little tips and tricks , " he told CNN .
" The illusion will be completely destroyed , but I think it 's important that other people see what we did . "
" Colin " ingeniously spins the zombie genre on its head by telling the story entirely from the zombie 's perspective .
It follows Colin , played by Alastair Kirton , who slowly transforms into a zombie after being bitten .

Kaleidoscope Entertainment picked up the film after it generated buzz among distributors at Cannes film festival earlier this year -- many of whom were astonished to find out quite how little money was spent on making the film .
" Colin " will be released in between 6 and 15 cinemas across the UK , as well as showing at a number of festivals .
There are currently no plans for international cinema distribution .
Price has now moved on to his next project , which he describes as a World War II drama with a horror element .
" It 's even got a creature at the end , " he said .
The script is written , the cast is in place -- they even have a composer .
Now all he needs is funding .
" We 'll need funding , not much , but a hell of a lot more than for ' Colin , ' " Price added .
My own Ian Knot ( yes – I'm the inventor ) is the World 's Fastest Shoelace Knot .
Make a loop with both ends and simultaneously pull them through each other to form an almost instant knot .
Quick Preview :
Before we begin , here 's a small GIF animation of my Ian Knot to prove that it really is the world 's fastest .
Step 1 :
Begin with a regular Left - over - Right Starting Knot .
Step 2 :
Make both ends into “ loops ” by simply doubling them back onto themselves .
Hold the left ( yellow ) lace around the left thumb and forefinger , using the other fingers of the left hand to hold the lace taut .
Hold the right ( blue ) lace between the right thumb and forefinger .
Step 3 :
Twist both loops anti-clockwise so that the left ( yellow ) loose end is at the front and the right ( blue ) loose end is at the back .
The right middle finger pushes the right ( blue ) loose end to the back .
Step 4 :
Cross the loops with the left ( yellow ) loose end in front .
The left thumb pushes the left ( yellow ) loose end over to the right , while the right middle finger continues to push the right ( blue ) loose end all the way between the left thumb and forefinger to end up inside the left loop .
NOTE : The diagram at left shows somewhat exaggerated crossed loops .
They are really more “ alongside ” each other , which is difficult to illustrate .
Step 5 :
Each hand uses the two fingers inside its own loop to grab the loose end of the other hand 's loop .
The left thumb and forefinger grab the right ( blue ) loose end , while the right thumb and middle finger grab the left ( yellow ) loose end .
Step 6 :
Each hand releases its own loop and pulls the loose end of the opposite loop through its own .
Take care not to pull the ends all the way through , as this will form a “ knot ” instead of a “ bow ” .
In fact , this is a quick way to tie a “ Starting Knot ” ( although the finger movements must be reversed left / right to balance the finished knot ) .
Step 7 :
Pull both loops tight to complete the knot .
With practice , I can now tie my shoelaces in about one third of the time of a conventional knot !
John Bailey thought it was great when his neighbor was elected to the House of Representatives in 2007 .
“ Not everyone lives next door to a congresswoman , ” he said .
But two years later , he does n’t feel so lucky .
The congresswoman ’s house is abandoned and in disrepair , “ a blight on the neighborhood , ” Bailey said .
He thinks the way that Rep. Laura Richardson ( D - Long Beach ) has treated her Sacramento home tells far more about her than her voting record .
Advertisement
“ I would n’t want anyone that irresponsible to represent me , ” said Bailey , like Richardson a liberal Democrat .
“ What I do n’t get is how she has the time to visit with Fidel Castro but does n’t have time for her own house .
If you ca n’t manage your own household , you probably should n’t get involved in international affairs . ”
He ’s not alone .
Neighbors have complained to the city , written letters and e-mails to Richardson and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , but the three - bedroom house remains an eyesore .
Neighbors just wish she would sell it or let it go into foreclosure , anything to get it into the hands of someone who would care .
“ She shows total disregard for everyone in the neighborhood , ” said Sean Padovan , a retired police sergeant .
“ She ought to be embarrassed and ashamed . ”
Richardson did not return phone calls for this story .
Advertisement
The problems with the house began shortly after Richardson was elected to the Assembly in 2006 from Long Beach and bought the two - story house in the leafy Curtis Park neighborhood .
It was n’t long before Padovan , 62 , angry that the lawn was n’t being mowed , knocked on Richardson ’s door , told her he was a neighbor and asked if she minded if he cut the grass .
He hauled out his hand mower , and when Richardson still seemed to have no interest in taking care of her yard , he stuck a gardener ’s card in her door with a note saying that she should call him if she had questions .
He never heard from Richardson , not a thank - you or a wave as she walked past .
After Richardson was elected to Congress in 2007 in a special election , she moved out around Labor Day .
She told Bailey that she planned to rent out the house .
Later that year , he sent her an e-mail with a link to a real estate agent who could help .
He never received a response .

With no one living in it , the house continued to deteriorate .
Angry at the demise of the once stately home and worried about what it would do to their property values , neighbors took things into their own hands .
Carrie Thomsen would walk across the street with her hose and water the yard .
Janet Carlson sent her gardener to Richardson ’s house once a month for six months to mow the lawn .
She paid kids $ 20 during the fall to rake the leaves .
They once peeked inside and saw a dead bird in the living room .
Her husband turned on the sprinklers the last two summers , worried that dry weeds would turn into a fire hazard .
Things got so bad that in the fall of 2008 rats began breeding in Richardson ’s backyard and soon moved into L. Kraft ’s house next door .
It took him two months to get rid of them .

Richardson ’s house , he said , “ has become such a hideous place . ”
The congresswoman has gained a degree of infamy in the Sacramento neighborhood .
The two - story house , gray with red trim , is badly in need of paint .
The front lawn is a patchwork of grass and weeds with brown splotches of dirt .
Much of the once lush ivy covering the chain - link fence has died .
The red wooden gate sprawls on the lawn , unless someone props it up .
A toilet sits on the back patio .
The backyard weeds , which neighbors said had grown three or four feet high , were cut a day after The Times wrote about them a few months ago .
Dead leaves have gathered behind the hot tub .
Rosebushes are struggling from lack of water , since the sprinklers are never turned on .
Gone are the rose of Sharon , miniature crape myrtle and primroses the previous owner had labored over for years .

Brown paper covers many windows .
There is no furniture inside .
Two beer cans are in the kitchen sink surrounded by dirt .
The city declared the house a public nuisance in August .
In late May , after a neighbor complained that the front lawn was out of control , the city filed a violation notice .
The lawn was mowed a few days later .
Most recently , another neighbor filed another complaint , saying that Richardson ’s house was “ a vacant structure with a blighted appearance . ”
Now residents are discussing whether to hire a lawyer to try to force her to fix it .
Richardson ’s house sits in stark contrast to the rest of the upper - middle - class neighborhood .
Curtis Park is one of Sacramento ’s oldest , with a mix of Tudor , Spanish and Craftsman - style homes built in the 1910s , ‘ 20s and ‘ 30s , among others , and where owners work hard to keep them up .
Advertisement
Located a couple miles from the Capitol , the neighborhood is known for its liberal politics and is filled with legislators , lobbyists and lawyers .
Mayor Kevin Johnson owns a home there , and former state Sen .
Al Rodda lives a couple of houses from Richardson .
Richardson bought the house in early 2007 for $ 535,000 .
She already owned two other houses that she had defaulted on six times .
The house went into foreclosure last year and was sold to real estate investor James York for $ 388,000 in May .
Washington Mutual took back the house and returned it to Richardson .
York sued .
The case was settled privately .
In April 2008 , Bailey sent a letter complaining about the condition of Richardson ’s house to Pelosi , then - state Democratic Party chief Art Torres and his congresswoman , Doris Matsui( D - Sacramento ) .
Advertisement
Pelosi’s was the only response he received .
She said she could n’t comment .
More recently , Peter Thomsen sent Richardson an e-mail telling her that she should be responsible and fix the house for the neighborhood ’s sake .
He received an e-mail back saying that he did n’t reside in her district .
But help could be on the way .
Advertisement
Max Fernandez , Sacramento ’s director of code enforcement , said a Richardson staffer told his office that she had talked to a contractor about fixing the place up .
Thomsen does n’t believe that she will do anything .
“ After a year of seeing the condition the house is in ?
No . ”
Kraft , though , said someone recently repaired the gate .
“ It is one of the most impressive things I ’ve seen so far , ” he said .

TOKYO — Toyota ’s dreaded moment is finally here :
The Japanese automaker is set to shutter a major factory for the first time in its 73 - year history , pulling the plug on a joint venture with General Motors and marking a new era of more aggressive cuts at the Japanese automaker .
Toyota will soon enter discussions to dissolve New United Motor Manufacturing , a 50 - 50 venture based in Fremont , California , that employs about 4,550 people , said Toyota spokesman Paul Nolasco .
GM quit the venture , dubbed Nummi , as part of its reorganization under bankruptcy protection last month .
A final decision on closing the plant is expected in August , after talks between Toyota and the entity charged with liquidating GM assets , the Motors Liquidation Company or MLC .
“ We have decided to discuss with the MLC what we would need to do to withdraw from our joint venture , ” Mr. Nolasco said in Tokyo .
“ We ’ve never shut down and ended a plant , ” he said .
“ But we are in a really tough situation . ”
Since the early 1960s , Italian coachbuilders have been retrofitting Corvettes .
For example , a 1963 Pininfarina Corvette that first appeared at the 1963 Paris Motor Show recently showed up on the auction block from Barret - Jackson , who branded the car as “ an American in an Italian suit . ”
Things have n’t changed so much since the Chevy Corvette is still a favorite to customize with new sheetmetal , performance tuning and interior modifications .
SV Motor Corporation is the latest to celebrate this time - honored tradition by creating the new 9 Competizione based on the C6 Corvette .
A cross between an Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and a Corvette , the SV 9 C dons some new Italian clothes in the form of carbon - fiber bodywork but is still very recognizable as the American workhorse .
The biggest change is a revised front end with a large mesh grill and air vents on the hood .
The back of the car also gets reworked as the Corvette ’s dual taillights on each side are consolidated down to just one and the exhaust pipes are moved from the center to the far left and right .
Performance mods include a new intake and tuned exhaust system that helps add an additional 14 horsepower , thereby pushing the engine output up to 450 hp with 445 lb - ft of torque .
These changes , along with a weight reduction of 132 pounds , give the SV 9 C consistent 0 - 60 mph times in the 4 second range and a 12 second quarter - mile .
A new set of alloy wheels wrapped in Pirelli PZero Rosso tires helps facilitate 1.03g of lateral grip and a braking distance of only 107 feet to drop from 60 - 0 mph .
The SV 9 C can be customized in any way a buyer sees fit .
There are 25 exterior colors available with 4 choices of wheels , five interior trim options and 5 colors for brake calipers .
It ’s the company ’s fondest dream that no two cars from its 1000 unit production run are identical ( so we ’ll keep it a secret that we plan to order ours in Special Edition green with black wheels and red brake calipers for that in your face , “ check me out , dawg ! ” look ) .
Actually , click on the Your SV 9 option selector to deck out your own ride .
It ’s not a super comprehensive Aston Martin - style configurator but you do n’t need to download 23 browser plugins to make it work either .
The SV 9 Competizione has a starting price of $ 99,995 , which includes the donor Chevy Corvette C6 .

Write wrappers for more kernel system calls .
Write wrappers for such Win32 ( GDI , USER ) system calls that modify data ( to tell the tool what memory has been written to , to avoid invalid warnings about use of uninitialized data ) .

Does SEH need any handling ?
Read MSVC debugging information ( .pdb files ) .
( Either using Microsoft 's APIs , or the existing code in Valgrind . )
Test on Vista and Windows 7
Make it cross-compilable from Linux
Make it buildable with Microsoft 's tools .
( Either just a makefile for nmake , or a Visual Studio project . )
Once it works well enough , some kind of integration with Visual Studio
During the ongoing Novell Hack Week I have been working on a port of Valgrind to Windows .
I had done some initial hacking on this earlier this year in my spare time , but then left it to rest .
At first I had to resolve lots of SVN merge conflicts after doing an SVN update for the first time in months .
The code for Darwin had been merged into Valgrind 's trunk and this of course had touched lots of the same places that also my changes touch .
After getting it to build again I was relieved to find that it still worked more or less like last time I had hacked on it , and I could continue with real coding .
Despite warnings from upstream developers that a Windows port of Valgrind would basically mean a total rewrite , it has n't turned out to be that bad .
In most of the source files with conditional compilation for the different platforms , the Windows code is basically just one more elif branch .
Many parts of Valgrind , like the VEX virtual CPU or the Stabs and Dwarf debug information handling , practically work as such also on Windows .
So , does Valgrind work on Windows ?
Yes but actually no ;) For trivial console programs , sure , it kinda works , Memcheck detects the kinds of errors it is supposed to detect .
( Memcheck is the only Valgrind tool that builds so far . )
But for " real " programs with a GUI it basically does n't work .
A lot of work remains to be done , and some mysteries remain to be solved .
A healthy dose of pessimism is useful : I am not that sure it will ever work well enough to be useful .
What kinds of applications could Valgrind eventually be useful for on Windows ?
Personally , I would look forward to the possibility to use it on Open Source applications based on Open Source libraries like the GTK + and ( partial ) GNOME stacks .
GIMP or Evolution come to mind .
Why not Qt - based applications , too .
Perhaps even OpenOffice.org .
I am not personally interested in making Valgrind work for applications based on weird proprietary technologies like COM .
I have been hacking it on 32 - bit XP .
Some minor additions are needed to handle also WOW64 , i.e. 32 - bit code on 64 - bit Windows , and more major additions for 64 - bit Windows .
So , what can you do to help ?
If you are an application developer with no in - depth Windows knowledge , do n't bother .
If you are an experienced Windows hacker with knowledge of kernel and Win32 subsystem system calls ( or are prepared to learn about such things , like I was ) , you can help .
For anybody interested in helping , prerequisites would be as follows : What remains to be done ?
Lots of things .
Off the top of my head :
It is a bit sad that when doing web searches for undocumented Windows information useful in a project like this , a lot of the times you end up at information originating in the malware - oriented community .
Making Valgrind buildable with Microsoft tools would not be impossible .
If I get offers of help from otherwise qualified people who would want to help but can 't / wo n't use MinGW , I might try .
A couple of short inline assembly parts would need MSVC syntax versions .
A couple of assembler source files would need MASM syntax versions .
Does MSVC support vararg macros in its preprocessor ?
I have diffs at http://www.iki.fi/tml/valgrind/ .
Apply to valgrind trunk from SVN as of the time indicated .
Making binaries available is not really useful at this stage ( if ever ) .

Undisclosed " sponsored " blogging may soon go the way of the dodo , the T. Rex , or the quagga under some strict new guidelines under consideration by the Federal Trade Commission .
The FTC says it is looking at bloggers who write about certain products or services in exchange for money or favors from the companies behind them , potentially misleading the Internet - reading public about an apparent conflict of interest .
The Commission hopes to introduce new guidelines this summer to better define how bloggers can write about these products .
In case you 're not familiar with the practice of " sponsored blogging , " imagine that Your Favorite Blog written by Joe Schmoe of Little Rock , Arkansas often gives rave reviews of certain home appliances that he allegedly uses .
Joe might have purchased those things himself , and he might really love them — but he might be getting paid by GE to push the company 's new washer and dryer .
Or , if he 's not receiving money , Joe might be the recipient of paid trips to Hawaii or prepaid gift cards .
All of these things can and do happen in the blogosphere , and there are no rules on disclosure .
That 's why the FTC wants to get involved — the organization is hoping to set guidelines for what kinds of blog posts might trigger investigations , what might be considered a false claim , and how bloggers might disclose any conflicts of interest .
" If you walk into a department store , you know the ( sales ) clerk is a clerk , " the FTC 's assistant director of advertising practices Rich Cleland told the Associated Press .
" Online , if you think that somebody is providing you with independent advice and ... they have an economic motive for what they 're saying , that 's information a consumer should know . "
Needless to say , the blogging world has mixed reactions to the news .
Some bloggers fear that they will constantly be investigated by the FTC if they so much as hint at liking something on their blogs .
Others say that they already disclose their sponsors for each post and that their readers already understand their relationship with companies that pay them to write .
" It 's been an issue , regardless of the FTC , " fashion blogger Yuli Ziv told the AP .
" It 's about trust . "
The FTC wants bloggers to disclose any compensation they 're receiving and for them to back up any claims they make about a particular product .
Although any blog would fall under the guidelines , blog posts about mundane details like your cat 's food preferences would n't be likely to spark an FTC investigation .
The FTC declined to go into detail on how any of this would work , but Cleland indicated that the FTC would focus largely on issuing warnings and going after repeat offenders .
The concept of sponsored blogging has always been a contentious one .
One of the leading pay - per- post companies PayPerPost decided to change its policies in late 2006 to require disclosure by bloggers who accept money to talk about products or websites , but others still count on the public 's ignorance in order to operate .
Galileo knew he had discovered a new planet in 1613 , 234 years before its official discovery date , according to a new theory by a University of Melbourne physicist .
Professor David Jamieson , Head of the School of Physics , is investigating the notebooks of Galileo from 400 years ago and believes that buried in the notations is the evidence that he discovered a new planet that we now know as Neptune .
A hypothesis of how to look for this evidence has been published in the journal Australian Physics and was presented at the first lecture in the 2009 July Lectures in Physics program at the University of Melbourne in the beginning of July .
If correct , the discovery would be the first new planet identified by humanity since deep antiquity .
Galileo was observing the moons of Jupiter in the years 1612 and 1613 and recorded his observations in his notebooks .
Over several nights he also recorded the position of a nearby star which does not appear in any modern star catalogue .
" It has been known for several decades that this unknown star was actually the planet Neptune .
Computer simulations show the precision of his observations revealing that Neptune would have looked just like a faint star almost exactly where Galileo observed it , " Professor Jamieson says .

But a planet is different to a star because planets orbit the Sun and move through the sky relative to the stars .
It is remarkable that on the night of January 28 in 1613 Galileo noted that the " star " we now know is the planet Neptune appeared to have moved relative to an actual nearby star . "
There is also a mysterious unlabeled black dot in his earlier observations of January 6 , 1613 , which is in the right position to be Neptune .
" I believe this dot could reveal he went back in his notes to record where he saw Neptune earlier when it was even closer to Jupiter but had not previously attracted his attention because of its unremarkable star - like appearance . "
If the mysterious black dot on January 6 was actually recorded on January 28 , Professor Jamieson proposes this would prove that Galileo believed he may have discovered a new planet .
By using the expertise of trace element analysts from the University of Florence , who have previously analyzed inks in Galileo 's manuscripts , dating the unlabelled dot in his notebook may be possible .
This analysis may be conducted in October this year .

" Galileo may indeed have formed the hypothesis that he had seen a new planet which had moved right across the field of view during his observations of Jupiter over the month of January 1613 , " Professor Jamieson says .
" If this is correct Galileo observed Neptune 234 years before its official discovery . "
But there could be an even more interesting possibility still buried in Galileo 's notes and letters .
" Galileo was in the habit of sending a scrambled sentence , an anagram , to his colleagues to establish his priority for the sensational discoveries he made with his new telescope .
He did this when he discovered the phases of Venus and the rings of Saturn .
So perhaps somewhere he wrote an as - yet undecoded anagram that reveals he knew he discovered a new planet , " Professor Jamieson speculates .
Professor Jamieson presented at the first of a series of lectures in July , aimed at giving an insight into fundamental questions in physics to celebrate the 2009 International Year of Astronomy .

I asked Hamed R. , who added the video on facebook of the young lady killed yesterday [ update : no more accessible ] in Iran , where his video came from and what was her name .
He explained to me that he received this video from a neighbour in Tehran .
And that her name was Neda .
Let ’s not forget her .
NB : And here is the first public mention of Neda on Twitter : http://twitter.com/egoblog/statuses/2257562290
Je crois que de toutes les images que j’ai pu voir en provenance d’Iran sur la toile , celles - ci ont été les plus éprouvantes .
J’ai été profondément choqué en les visionnant .
Une jeune femme qui décède en pleine rue , hier , pour avoir protesté contre le régime .
Attention la video est absolument horrible : ici [ maj : plus accessible ]
Elle a été mise en ligne sur facebook et ailleurs .
Mais nulle part son nom ou son prénom .
Une autre de ces victimes anonymes qu’on croise sur la toile .
J’ai voulu en savoir plus sur l’origine de la vidéo et surtout je voulais pouvoir nommer la victime .
Qu’elle ne soit pas que cette jeune fille morte en direct sur facebook ou youtube .
J’ai donc contacté celui qui a mis la vidéo en ligne sur facebook , Hamed R. Cet iranien est actuellement au Pays - Bas .
Il a reçu la terrible vidéo d’une de ses amies qui habite à côté de chez lui à Téhéran .
L’auteur de la vidéo a préféré passer par Hamed R. par sécurité et lui a dit que la victime s’appelait Neda .
Neda , on ne t’oubliera pas .

( CNN ) --
As American families try to stretch their food budgets during the recession , some are turning to the backyard , rather than the grocery store , as the place to look for produce .
Susan Hopper of Tampa , Florida , uses her garden to teach her students where food comes from .
Recession gardens are catching on with many first - time planters who want a healthy meal at an affordable price .
The gardeners are following seed - strewn paths laid by Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt , both of whom have used the White House lawn to show the value of a garden during tough times .
The scope of today 's trend is shocking even to those in the gardening industry .
W. Atlee Burpee & Co. , the largest seed and gardening supply store in the country , says it has seen a 25 to 30 percent spike in vegetable seed and plant sales this spring compared with last .
" I 've been in the business for 30 years , and I 've never seen anything like it -- even remotely like it , " said George Ball , chairman and CEO of the company .
In 2008 , there was a 15 to 20 percent uptick in seed sales because of high food and gasoline prices .
Not since the ' 70s , when the company saw sales increases in the 10 percent range , has gardening seen such buzz , he said .
The National Gardening Association expects 43 million American households to grow their own fruits , vegetables , herbs and berries this year .
That 's up 19 percent over last year , according to a 2,559 - household survey the group conducted in January .
Tell us about your garden on iReport.com
About a fifth of the gardeners this year will be new to the activity , the survey says .
Most -- 54 percent -- said they will garden because it saves them money on food bills .
A slightly larger group say they garden because homegrown food tastes better .
There 's evidence that recession gardeners stand to see substantial savings at the grocery store checkout .
Last year , Burpee released a report saying a family will get an average 25 - to - 1 return on its investment in a garden .
So , by that count , a family that spends about $ 200 on a medium - to - large garden , as Michelle Obama reportedly did , will save $ 5,000 in grocery bills over the course of a year .
That statistic is inflated , said Mike Metallo , spokesman for the National Gardening Association .
Metallo 's group says a $ 70 investment in a garden will yield $ 600 in produce for the year .
To get those savings , a gardener has to know what to plant , when to plant it , where to plant it , how to deal with different soil types and how to care for the garden .
Watch the community of Serenbe bring food from farm to table »
That knowledge is n't innate these days , especially for urban dwellers .
Bobby Wilson , president of the American Community Gardening Association , says all of that interest is great , but he worries that Americans are n't equipped to grow their own food without some help .
" Many of the people that want to get into the gardening and greening movement right here have never gained the skills , " he said .
" Many of them came up in an era where there was no vocational education , so there was no need to learn anything about horticulture or agriculture . "
He said all of the country 's elementary schools should have gardens so future generations will learn how to save money and fend for themselves .
Susan Hopper , a 41 - year - old elementary school teacher in Tampa , Florida , said she started a garden last year , partly to teach her family and her students about the food chain .
See Hopper 's garden on iReport.com
" I have three children of my own , and they think chicken comes in tenders and nuggets , " she said .
" I was concerned about their health , and I wanted them to understand that food is a process that we 're a part of , and it just does n't come in neat packages . "
Hopper grew up watching her older family members garden , but when she first decided to plow a patch of her own yard , she was n't too successful .
Florida 's growing season is somewhat reversed , she said , so even though she had read Internet articles about how to garden , she did n't know the local tricks needed to make her plants survive .
In the process of digging back into the soil , though , some new gardeners are struggling with the fact that they 're several generations removed from a farm .
Pamela Price , a 38 - year - old mom in San Antonio , Texas , said her garden is n't profitable just yet because of droughts in her state .
See Price 's " victory garden " on iReport.com
She grew up in a family of ranchers and farmers , but she 's forgotten much of what she learned when she was young .
" We are fortunate that we do n't have to rely on [ the garden ] , but I certainly want to make sure that , in the event that something happens , we would know how to , " she said .
" It 's a life skill . "
Price said she 's started to look at her local environment anew as she learns which plants will or wo n't grow in the harsh climate .
That gives her a connection with history , too , she said .
She recently read a book about how some of Texas ' residents a century ago had similar issues .
Wilson , of the community garden association , said new gardeners should seek advice from neighbors .
On every block , there 's a gardener who is willing to talk about the process , he said .
Face - to - face conversations are more helpful than Internet searches when it comes to learning about the local environment , he said .
One way to tap local garden knowledge is to join a community garden , where neighbors turn up communal plots together .
The activity is expected to see a fivefold increase this year , with 5 million households saying they 're at least " very interested " in participating in a community garden , said Metallo , of the National Gardening Association .
New gardeners should start out small , he said .
That way you 'll learn as you go and wo n't get as frustrated .
" You do n't have to go hogwild crazy , " he said , adding that people who tear up their entire yards are usually disappointed .
" Get comfortable with it . "

' This is going to be big , ' says Sen .
Whitehouse
UPDATED : Hearing now scheduled for Wed. , March 4th ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/25/2009 , 10:13 am PT
[ Updated at end of article , with details on hearing announced for next week . ]
The Senate is quietly preparing plans to investigate allegations of torture under President George W. Bush , according to comments published Wednesday by Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy ( D - VT ) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) .
The Senate Judiciary Committee could announce a hearing to consider various plans to probe allegations of torture as early as today , according to Salon 's Mark Benjamin , citing Committee Chairman Pat Leahy and members of his staff .
Leahy 's office told Raw Story Wednesday morning that a press release would be sent out shortly .
Sen .
Whitehouse said he's " convinced " the investigation will move forward .
" Stay on this , " he told Benjamin .
" This is going to be big . "
Whitehouse , Senator from Rhode Island , is " spearheading " the efforts , and as a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees , " is privy to information about interrogations he can't yet share , " the magazine noted .
Neither Salon 's nor RAW STORY 's coverage made it completely clear whether the Senators are discussing an idea that is different from Leahy 's previously - floated " Truth Commission " --- where immunity would be granted to many who testify , in questionable exchange for making " the truth " known --- though this investigation does seem to be distinct from that one .
We 'll try to keep our eye out for Leahy 's press release today , in case it offers some clarity .
[ Update : See details of Leahy 's announcement added at bottom of article . ]
One point from Salon , also worth highlighting , is that the tenacious Sen .
Whitehouse seems keen on using this investigation to help disprove the often asserted notion that the Bush , um , " enhanced interrogation " policies saved lives , despite the lack of evidence supporting that wishful thinking , and the growing body of evidence and testimony --- from those who actually know --- which plainly disputes it .
Retired Maj. Gen. Tony Taguba , who led the investigation of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib , is quoted from a recent interview as disputing those who have claimed --- from the comfort of their keyboards --- that torture saved lives : " Some of those activities were actually not effective and those who thought so were in the academic or pristine settings of their offices , " Taguba told Salon .
" What would they know ? "
Whitehouse adds : " It is important to prove the point , because they keep saying , ' We saved lives .
We interrupted plans .
We did this , that and the other .'... Well , when you drill down , there is never a fact there .
It turns into fog and evasion . "
Again , with Whitehouse on both the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees , with access to much more information than has been made public to date , he oughta know .
At least slightly more so than the Wingnuts who rule the public airwaves and , with it , the public " debate " on these issues to date .
UPDATE 1:34 pm PT : On the Senate floor today , Leahy announced his plans for a hearing next Wednesday , March 4th at 10 am ET ( including a live webcast ) , called " Getting to the Truth Through a Nonpartisan Commission of Inquiry . "
Details follow ... As RAW STORY reports ( with video ) :
He called his commission a " middle ground " for both sides of the aisle to meet in .
" Such a commission 's objective would be to find the truth .
People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences , not for the purpose of constructing criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts , to know what happened and to make sure mistakes are not repeated , " Leahy said .
" While many are focused on whether crimes were committed , it is just as important to learn if significant mistakes were made , regardless of whether they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury to be criminal conduct .
We compound the serious mistakes already made if we limit our inquiry to criminal investigations and trials . "
...
Though Leahy stressed that his commission would not be about just prosecuting criminal cases , Glenn Greenwald speculated that the presence of Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island on any fact - finding war - crimes commission might result in prosecutions anyway .
Whitehouse is on both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committee .
" Critically , he is also a former federal and state prosecutor and thus instinctively considers lawbreaking to be wrong no matter who is doing the lawbreaking , " writes Greenwald .
This recipe is originally from Cooking Light magazine , but it ’s so delicious I do n’t know whether I can believe it ’s actually light !
It ’s cheesy and creamy and … bacon-y !
If you do n’t love butternut squash , this recipe might change your mind .
Then again , cover anything in cheese and bacon and it instantly becomes great anyway .
This does take some time to make , so it ’s usually a weekend dinner for us .
The great part is that it makes enough for lunches for the next couple days .
And it ’s great cold too so you ca n’t really go wrong .
There have been a few times that the leftovers did n’t quite make it to lunch and were eaten straight out of the fridge , cold .
That ’s a good sign !
Butternut Squash and Bacon Mac ‘n Cheese ( 4 - 6 servings )
1 Butternut Squash , peeled and cubed
Cooking Spray
1 Tbsp Dried Rosemary
S&P
1 box Pasta of choice
7 slices of Bacon
1 cups Shallots , diced
1/4 cup Flour
2 cups Milk ( 1 or 2 % )
1 cup Italian Blend shredded cheese
1/3 cup grated Fresh Parmesan
Preheat to 425 .
Coat the squash lightly in cooking spray , rosemary , and S&P .
Roast in a pan for 45 minutes until squash is tender .
While the squash is roasting , cook the pasta , and fry the bacon .
When the bacon is done , pour off all but 1 Tbsp of the drippings .
Set aside the bacon , and cook the shallots 7 minutes or until translucent in the leftover drippings .
Crumble the bacon and set it aside with the shallots .
When the squash is done roasting , mix in the bacon and shallots and turn the oven up to 450 .
Put the flour in a heavy - bottomed sauce pan over medium - high heat and slowly whisk in the milk .
When all the milk has been added , bring to a boil for 1 minute or until slightly thickened .
Remove from heat and stir in the shredded cheese .
Combine the pasta and the squash mixture in a 9×13 casserole dish , and pour the milk and cheese mixture over the top .
Stir to coat .
Top with grated parmesan and pop back in the oven for 10 - 15 minutes , or until the cheese starts to brown .
Serve warm , or cold , on a plate or in a bowl or straight out of the casserole dish if your house is anything like mine !
By Friedrich Nietzsche
He who has a why to live can bear almost any how .
Once again I have to say it ’s the little things in life that can get you through when life is getting you down .
It ’s up to you to find them , to find the whys in life that will get you through whatever challenges you will face in life .
Too many people focus on the why nots .
They convince themselves that they ca n’t be or are not meant to be happy .
When in fact its just the opposite , everyone is supposed to be happy and can be if you let it happen and focus on the things that make you happy .
Instead a lot of people focus on what they do n’t have and what everyone around them does have .
It might be wealth , love , a special someone , or anything that they think might make them happy .
What one should do is not dwell on what they do n’t have they should dwell on the good things they do have .
Do n’t let jealousy of what others have that you do n’t drag you into the trap of depression and hate that can then mislead you into not trying to find that little thing you need to get you through and let you be happy .
I know …I know it ’s easier said then done , but trust me I have been through a lot of things in my short time here on this earth and if it was n’t for those little things , those whys I would n’t still be here .
Sure I slip and catch myself getting jealous of others around me sometimes , but this is when you have to correct your thought and move on .
Redirect the energy you would have used being jealous and do something that will make you feel better about yourself .
Go workout , complete a project , or read a book .
Do something , some little thing that you want to do that makes you and your life better in some way .
Doing these little things then lead you to the whys in life that will keep you going .
When faced with sudden adversity in your life you will be able to step back and instead of thinking all is done for .
You will be able to use these whys to get you through the adversity .
Why am I putting myself through this ?
It ’s because I want to finish that book .
It ’s because I want to to go workout later .
Practice this and you will find life tends to be a lot fuller and a lot easier to navigate through .
The glass is half full is what I say and when life gets you down and hits you with adversity just take it as it comes and deal with it and move through it .

While it may sound quite like a scene from the famous whale movie ‘ Free Willy ’ , recent news reported a Beluga Whale that sensed the distress of a free diver and saved her from drowning by pushing her up to the surface .
Free diver Yang
Yun owes her life to a Beluga whale named Mila at Polar Land in Harbin , north east China .
News reported that the 26 year old free diver had been taking part in a free diving contest without any breathing apparatus .
Competitors had to swim to the bottom of a 20ft arctic pool and stay there for as long as possible .
The large tank was home to beluga whales one of which spotted diver Yang Yun struggling as her legs paralyzed with crippling cramps due to the cold temperatures .
Lucky
Yun told a reporter : “ I began to choke and sank even lower and I thought that was it for me – I was dead .
Until I felt this incredible force under me driving me to the surface . ”
The Beluga Mila was said to have helped Yun by grabbing on to her leg with it ’s mouth before organizers even noticed the problem and they watched in amazement how using her sensitive dolphin like nose the whale guided the helpless diver safely to the surface .
Beluga whales like dolphins , are known for their intelligence , sensitivity as well playfulness towards humans .
These social creatures can grow up t 15 ft ( 5 m ) in length and are a striking white color with a humped head .
Beluga ’s are popular for their amusing facial expressions unlike other whales and they have an almost perpetual smile giving them a friendly face .
An amazing fact about this whale is that it unlike most whales can swim backwards .
Unfortunately the dwindling numbers of this species has put it on the Endangered list .
Found particularly in very cold waters around Alaska , Canada , Greenland and Russia , the biggest threat to the whale is human caused pollution from our rivers which flow out to the oceans where this whale resides .
Hunting is another reason .
Let the remarkable story of Mila the hero Beluga whale , one of our world ’s beautiful creatures be a reminder to us all of the plight of our oceans today .

Votey comics back online !
Also , I 've pruned the forum down to two simple sections .
I 'm hoping to encourage a little community to grow these days , so my eternal gratitude for anyone who starts an inane topic .
More than a week after saying Americans are n’t pure because they marry other ‘ species and ethics , ’ Fox News host Brian Kilmeade decided to apologize Monday .
“ I made comments that were offense to many people , ” confessed Kilmeade .
“ Looking back at those comments I realize they were inappropriate .
For that , I sincerely apologize . ”

“ America , a huge melting pot and that is what makes us such a great country , ” Kilmeade concluded .

Geothelphusa ancyclophallus has little defence against habitat destruction
Two thirds of all species of freshwater crab maybe at risk of going extinct , with one in six species particularly vulnerable , according to a new survey .
That makes freshwater crabs among the most threatened of all groups of animals assessed so far .
The study is the first global assessment of the extinction risk for any group of freshwater invertebrates .
Crab species in southeast Asia are the most at risk , from habitat destruction , pollution and drainage .
Scientists from the Zoological Society of London and Northern Michigan University led the survey , which produced the first International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) Red List of Threatened Species for the 1280 known species of freshwater crab .
Of those , the survey found that 227 species should be considered as near threatened , vulnerable , endangered or critically endangered .
For another 628 species , not enough data exists to adequately assess their future , says the survey published in the journal Biological Conservation .
However , while the most optimistic scenario is that 16 % of all species are at risk , the worst case scenario suggests the figure could be as high as 65 % , or two - thirds of all species .
Keystone species Freshwater crabs are essential to many freshwater ecosystems .
Some feed on fallen leaves and algae , while other species help cycle nutrients by eating vast quantities of detritus .
The crabs themselves are an important source of food for a range of birds such as herons and kingfishers , reptiles such as monitor lizards and crocodiles and amphibians such as frogs and toads .
Mammals that like to dine on freshwater crabs include otters , mongooses , civets as well as wild boar and even macaque monkeys .
Because most species require pristine water to survive , they are also excellent indicators of good water quality .
But species are increasingly being impacted by habitat destruction and pollution .
The Singapore freshwater crab Johora singaporensis lives on an island , making it particularly vulnerable to disturbance and pollution Most vulnerable are crabs living in southeast Asia , which is also home to the greatest diversity of species .
For example , 40 of 50 species living in Sri Lanka are threatened .
Those species that live a semi- terrestrial life , breathing air , living in burrows and dividing their time between water and land , appear most at risk , possibly because their habitats are most easily disturbed by human activities .
No species are yet known to have gone extinct , but some species such as the terrestrial crab Thaipotamon siamese and the waterfall crab Demanietta manii from Thailand have not been seen alive for over a century , and their original habitats have since been built over by urban developments .
The loss of natural forest to land development and agriculture has also impacted almost every habitat in which freshwater crabs live , the report notes .
The proportion of freshwater crabs threatened with extinction is equal to that of reef - building corals , and exceeds that of all other groups that have been assessed except for amphibians .
" We must set clear goals to reverse these trends and ensure that our enduring legacy is not to wipe out the small things that provide us with great benefits , such as nutrient cycling , " says Ben Collen , one the survey scientists from the Zoological Society of London .
