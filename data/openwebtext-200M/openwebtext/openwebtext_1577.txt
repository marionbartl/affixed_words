THE decision of the European Central Bank to start buying government bonds follows a path trodden by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and 2009 .
Both entered politically charged territory to save the financial system at great risk to their reputations .
For the Fed , one consequence is that the big financial - reform bill making its way through the Senate — a vote was expected after The Economist went to press — will leave it more powerful but more beholden to Washington , DC .
The Fed has fought for , and kept , its supervision of banks .
It acquires important new powers to regulate big non-bank financial companies and even to break up firms deemed a threat to the financial system .
Its only significant loss of turf is direct oversight of consumer protection .
The Fed keeps its emergency - lending powers , though it needs the Treasury 's approval to use them ( it has usually sought such approval anyway ) .
It can not lend to failing firms because that job now sits with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the bill 's new resolution authority .
The price of these powers , though , is to be drawn closer into politicians ' embrace .
Since its birth the Fed 's governance has reflected a mix of political and financial influences .
Monetary policy is the joint responsibility of governors in Washington , DC , appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate , and presidents of the reserve banks , some of whose directors are , or are appointed by , bankers .
Critics have long seen the bankers ' role in the running of the Fed as an affront to democracy .
Under the reform bill the president will now nominate and the Senate will confirm the New York Fed president ( the most important of the regional governors ) .
Fed - supervised banks will lose any say in the governance of the reserve banks .
Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , wants to go further , either stripping all reserve - bank presidents of their votes on monetary policy or making them more accountable .
Such changes have some worried that the Fed will adopt a looser monetary stance .
In the near term , these fears are overdone .
The economic environment remains deflationary .
Excluding food and energy , inflation fell to a 49 - year low of 0.9 % in April .
Political pressure for more expansionary policy has also been surprisingly slight .
Opponents of Ben Bernanke 's confirmation to a second term as Fed chairman in January were more likely to criticise lax policy before the crisis and the Fed 's interventions during it , not its failure to maintain full employment .
Inside the Fed , the pressure is also for tighter policy .
Some officials are pressing for a quick sale of its holdings of mortgage - backed securities , although minutes of its April meeting suggest that will not happen before the Fed begins raising short - term rates .
The greater risk to Fed independence is not pressure from outside , but the temptation from inside to broaden its macroeconomic remit as the lines between regulatory and monetary policy blur .
Financial stability has been formally added to the Fed 's duties , alongside full employment and price stability .
More governors will be chosen for regulatory and legal expertise ; one will be designated vice - chairman for supervision .
If Barack Obama 's latest nominees are approved , only three of the seven governors will be economists ; two will be lawyers .
Decisions on which financial firms to regulate , which to support and which to liquidate will increasingly be made with an eye on the broader economy .
Interest - rate decisions will more heavily consider the impact on the financial system .
A hard job has got harder .
The Gulf of Mexico oil spill , five times worse than originally thought , could easily surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster in both volume and ecological devastation .
The slick has already hit the Louisiana coast and is headed for Mississippi , and the Obama administration is treating it as a national emergency .
" I am frightened , " says David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
" This is a very , very big thing . "
How bad will it get ?
Here , six likely effects :
1. A ' catastrophe ' for wildlife
The oil slick has already affected Louisiana 's delicate coastal wildlife preserves , and is headed for the shorelines of Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida .
The petroleum could severely damage the habitats of hundreds of species of birds , fish , and other animals — ranging from blue herons to sperm whales .
The president of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport , MS calls the spill potentially " the worst environmental disaster " in the history of the United States .
2 . A seafood shortage
One - fifth of U.S. commercial seafood comes from the Gulf — including 75 percent of our shrimp .
George Crozier , executive director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , says that the crude oil entering coastal estuaries areas may cause a dramatic drop in " seafood recruitment " ( as he calls it ) for years to come .
Louisiana commercial shrimpers have filed a class action suit against BP and its partners .
This is already " the worst case scenario for shrimpers , oyster harvesters , crabbers — all the commercial fisherman , " says a local expert .
3 . Higher gas prices
The 210,000 gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf each day is is a fraction of total U.S. oil consumption .
But , if it takes BP weeks to stem the gushing , as seems likely , the spill " may be the final catalyst to push U.S. gasoline prices ... solidly above $ 3 a gallon , " says Charley Blaine in MSN Money .
4 . A murky future for coastal drilling
Obama maintains that he still intends to open up vast new areas of the coastline to exploration and drilling — but some commentators wonder if a constant stream of images of ecological devastation will redefine the issue .
" This could have an enormous political impact , " says Robert Brulle , a sociology professor at Drexel University , as quoted in The New York Times .
" This will make opening up offshore oil drilling very difficult . "
5 . Untold billions in losses for BP
Exxon Mobil ended up paying out more than $ 4 billion for its Valdez spill ( and that 's before the sum is adjusted for inflation ) .
But the cleanup and settlement cost might not be the worst of it for BP : " The long - term damage to BP ’s reputation — and possibly , its future prospects for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico — is likely to be far higher , " reports The New York Times .
6 . More hardship for the Big Easy
Nearly five years after Katrina , New Orleans finally seemed to be recovering .
Now , local news outlets are reporting that a " strong odor blanketing much of coastal Louisiana and the metro New Orleans " may cause " nausea , vomiting or headaches . "
That 's just the start , though :
In a city that relies heavily on tourism , the oil spill " could potentially have a devastating impact on the economy , " New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu told The Times - Picayune .

One of the challenges of trying to be scientific , and an honest intellectual , is that judgment is often required in assessing a claim or topic .
The problem with relying upon one ’s judgment is that it is fraught , even overwhelmed , with personal bias .
The “ default mode ” of human behavior ( which means most people do this most of the time ) is to construct an elaborate rationalization for what we already believe , and want to believe .
The more intelligent we are , the more sophisticated and elaborate our rationalizations – giving more confidence in our conclusions , but not necessarily deserved .
The solution to this problem is to develop a specific intellectual skill set – knowledge of the many and various ways in which we bias our thinking and the constant application of this knowledge to our own beliefs .
In other words , we need to be skeptical , especially of ourselves .
But not just skeptical in attitude , systematically skeptical of the process of our own thought .
But since this is necessarily self - referential ( we can bias our assessment of our biases ) it is also necessary to check your beliefs and thinking against other people , people with different perspectives – from different backgrounds , areas of expertise , and cultures .
The opposite of this approach is to be insular , to have a self - contained belief system that feeds on itself but which is completely disconnected from logic and reality .
Humans seem to have an unfortunate penchant for falling into such self - contained belief systems , cults being the ultimate expression of this tendency .
Conspiracy theories are another manifestation .
One manifestation in particular I want to discuss today is the “ demonization ” of a person , belief , or system that we do n’t like .
You can make anything sound sinister and broken , if you exaggerate and emphasize the flaws and weaknesses of a system and ignore or downplay the virtues .
For example , if you really wanted to make a case that democracy is broken , you could point out the corruption in the system , the power of lobbyists , the failures of the election system and the electoral college .
The 2000 election would stand as a prime example .
You could then conclude that we need to reject democracy for something else – anarchy , or perhaps a benign dictator .
This is exactly what Dana Ullman has done to science at the Huffington Post .
He essentially says that science is broken and not to be trusted – therefore trust my pseudoscience ( homeopathy ) and help this new medical science to replace what we have now .
It is a remarkable piece of propaganda .
His primary strategy is to point out weaknesses in the practice of science ( not the underlying philosophy or methods ) , as if this is news to anyone .
Science is a human endeavor , and is subject to all the frailty of humans .
Skeptics and science educators ( like Carl Sagan ) are the first to point this out .
The application of science can fail in a hundred ways , which is why we need to be vigilant , exacting in our evaluations , and rely upon consensus of evidence and consensus of interpretation .
Ullman , of course , simply does not like the consensus of logic , evidence , and opinion that homeopathy is pure bunk , and so he rails against the practice of science as if it will save him and his preferred belief .
There are too many examples for me to dissect every one here , so I will give some salient examples .
He writes :
Modern medicine uses the double - blind and placebo - controlled trial as the gold standard by which the effectiveness of a treatment is determined .
On the surface , this scientific method is very reasonable .
However , serious problems in these studies are widely acknowledged by academics but remain unknown to the general public .
Fundamental questions about the meaning of the word “ efficacy ” are rarely raised .
He contradicts himself here – academics acknowledge this problem but it is also rarely raised ?
This is a case of what we call – making shit up .
Ullman clearly has insufficient direct familiarity with clinical research , where fundamental questions about efficacy are constantly raised and discussed .
I have actually been involved with designing clinical trials , and a great deal of time , thought , and care has always been given to exactly what we would measure , and what it means .
Do we follow a clinical marker of disease , net clinical outcomes , overall quality of life , or all of these things ?
In most trials multiple endpoints are followed in order to blanket the notion of “ efficacy ” as much as possible .
We want objective measures to know that something biological is happening , clinical measures to know that there is relevant benefit , and quality of life measures to know that patients will actually feel better .
We also consider how long we need to follow subjects – are benefits sustained or temporary ?
Frankly , saying that clinical scientists do not question the notion of efficacy is profoundly ignorant and naive – the kind of thing someone writes when they are trying to build a case against science , not fairly assess it .
Then we discover what Ullman is really getting at .
For instance , just because a drug treatment seems to eliminate a specific symptom does not necessarily mean that it is “ effective . ”
In fact , getting rid of a specific symptom can be the bad news .
Aspirin may lower your fever , but physiologists recognize that fever is an important defense of the body in its efforts to fight infection .
Sleep - inducing drugs may lead you to fall asleep , but they do not lead to refreshed sleep , and these drugs ultimately tend to aggravate the cycle of insomnia and fatigue , while conveniently ( for the drug companies ) tend to create addiction .
Long - term safety and efficacy of many modern drugs for common ailments remains unknown , despite the high hopes and sincere expectations from the medical community and the rest of us for greater certainty .
Again – more nonsense .
A great deal of ink , as they say , has been spilled exploring all of these questions in the medical literature .
A low grade fever is not a problem , but a high fever can cause damage to the brain , lead to seizures in young children , and should absolutely be treated .
Fever is not essential for the body to fight off an infection .
Sleep inducing drugs are tricky to use well .
First we need to distinguish sleep onset problems vs sleep maintenance problems .
For sleep onset problems a sedative may be effective , and in fact will restore the sleep cycle .
But it must be done in conjunction with what we call sleep hygiene – no napping during the day , avoid eating late at night , etc .
Sure , some primary care doctors with insufficient training and experience with sleep disorders may just prescribe a sedative .
That is a reason to improve education and practice , not chuck the whole system .
Because those with more experience and training take a very sophisticated approach to sleep .
Start with sleep hygiene .
Then treat either sleep onset , maintenance , or both as needed .
The goal is to reestablish a normal circadian rhythm and then wean off the medications .
Addictive medications are to be avoided – some sleep medications are not addictive , but patients may become dependent upon them if they do not also work on sleep hygiene , or if they have another unidentified sleep problem .
So if this approach does not work – then order a sleep study or perhaps consult with a sleep expert .
The point of going over sleep medicine is to contrast the reality to Ullman ’s cardboard cartoon .
His goal is not to understand or elucidate , but to confuse and poison the well .
But also to support an alternative to the scientific view – the homeopathic view that all symptoms are good – they are the body ’s way of fighting disease .
Treating symptoms is therefore counterproductive .
While this may be true is a minority of cases , this is not a general rule of medicine or biology .
It is a homeopathic philosophy , nothing else , and is not based upon evidence .
Pain does not help the body fight off any ailment that causes pain .
Pain only warns us of a problem .
So you would not want to numb someone to all pain , because then you cannot follow it as an outcome .
But you do want to provide relief to improve quality of life .
Pain should be treated – just with care and thought .
Further , there are two kinds of pain : nociceptive and neuropathic .
Nociceptive pain is the body sensing tissue damage , and provides a protective and warning function .
It should be alleviated , but not masked .
Neuropathic pain serves no function , it is a malfunction of the nervous system , caused by trauma , disease , and sometimes even genetic mutations that alter nerve function .
With neuropathic pain , the pain is the disease .
There are specific medications that may reduce neuropathic pain – not regular pain medication , but neurologically active medications that suppress the abnormal pain generation or pathways .
Homeopaths like Ullman white wash over all this nuance and complexity .
To them , symptoms are good , and all symptomatic treatment is bad .
And then they criticize science - based medicine from their own childish perspective .
Later on comes this gem :
Conventional drugs used today are so new that there is very little long - term research on them .
There are good reasons why a vast majority of modern drugs used just a couple of decades ago are no longer prescribed : they do n’t work as well as previously assumed , and / or they cause more harm than good .
Drugs used today have been available for a variety of time .
Some drugs in common use have been used for decades .
I routinely prescribe drugs that have been around for 40 - 50 years – so - called tried and true drugs .
There are few surprises in store when using such drugs .
Others have been around for 10 or so years – enough time for post - marketing experience to have been tracked and for doctors to have a good fix on long term efficacy and safety .
And sure , there are also new drugs always coming on the market .
It is acknowledged that with such drugs we , by necessity , lack long term experience .
And so they are used with more caution , while their effects in the real world are tracked and studied .
Some drugs ultimately fail at this stage , while others go on to become established drugs .
Again we see the complex reality , and Ullman ’s self - serving cartoon .
I would also like to hear what an alternative to this system would be – how do we gain decades of experience with large numbers of patients without , you know , using drugs for decades in large numbers of patients .
Ullman has his alternative – chuck the whole system and replace it with nonsense and pseudoscience – his particular flavor of pseudoscience .
Trust in the gurus , not science .
Conclusion
To a physician , Ullman ’s rant is a transparent and naive polemic .
But to someone not personally familiar with the intricacies of modern medicine , who can not put his claims into perspective , his case can seem superficially compelling .
Reading his article is like watching Loose Change without any further background knowledge about 9/11 .
If you pile up a bunch of biased misinformation in one place , the sheer size can seem impressive .
Ullman also entirely misses the big picture that medical science is self - critical and self - corrective ( unlike , say , homeopathy which is insular and protective ) .
All of the criticism he exploits to attack medicine are self - criticisms that academic physicians and scientists have and continue to raise .
We are asking the questions – how long do we need to study a drug before we can confidently extrapolate its long term effects ?
Then we look back and ask – how is this working ?
Maybe we need to follow these drugs longer before approval .
Maybe we need to follow different outcomes .
Maybe we need a different strategy .
In that way medicine continues to scratch and claw forward .
It ’s a messy process , fraught with error , missteps , even bias and fraud .
But just like democracy , it may be a frustratingly flawed system , but it is the best we have .
And I would no more want to chuck science - based medicine for the wishful thinking and magic Dana Ullman is selling , than I would want to chuck democracy and accept a dictator .

Pitiless slaughter of magnificent minke whales for meat no - one wants :
How I harpooned the viking whalers
When I began reporting on the environment for the BBC , I was inclined to avoid the more obvious themes : the rainforest , ozone , the drying of Central Asia 's Aral Sea .
Surely they are hyped or old , covered to the point of boredom ?
But one editor is particularly interested in my doing a report on whaling .
Sitting in his office , it 's easy to say yes .
Norway is the closest whaling nation , so I board the whaler Reinebuen at the port of Tromso and unwittingly begin what will become one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life .
Sea of shame : A minke whale is hauled on board the Reinebuen to be butchered for its meat
Up on deck , skipper Bjorn Andersen is busy .
In a brief moment of calm , I ask him to show me our likely route : out of Tromso , up towards North Cape , the top of Europe , on towards the border with Russia .
We 'll be there in a day or two , he says .
Then I raise the question I really want answered : how rough will it be ?
' Not too bad , ' says Bjorn , 'it 's a good time of year . '
It is May .
Up at the bow , we film Bjorn working on a harpoon .
In the winter , Bjorn and his crew fish for cod and herring , but when their quotas are filled they turn to hunting whales .
Their target is minke whales , among the smallest of the species .
We 've been given unusual permission to join an expedition to record how it 's done .
This season , there 's a quota of 700 minke whales .
I 'd grown up with the campaign to save the whale .
Whaling seemed so obviously wrong back then but I 've given it little thought since .
So I ask Bjorn whether he thinks killing whales is right .
' We eat the cows , ' he says , ' so why not the whales ?
It 's better than farming in a factory . '
And he adds what he hopes will be an overwhelming argument : whale meat is free - range , it 's natural .
You can call it " organic " .
I smile at the ingenuity of the pitch .
While it may be true that the minke population in this part of the ocean is relatively healthy , there is another fundamental issue , one that has continued to fuel the passion to stop whaling : that it 's less about numbers and more about objecting to a practice that is simply inhumane , that it 's immoral to kill these gentle , giant mammals .
Bjorn breaks off from the conversation because he 's having trouble preparing the harpoon .
What he has to do is insert a heavy steel spear , about 3ft long , into the weapon .
To ensure it flies out rapidly , Bjorn has to wrestle it in .
Horrifying : The BBC's David Shukman was struck by the gruesome spectacle of whaling
Despite the cold , he 's sweating .
Next comes the fitting of the deadliest part of the weapon .
The spear will penetrate the whale 's thick skin but that wo n't kill it .
So , at the tip of the spear , Bjorn fits an explosive charge about the size of a tin can .
I ask him where he aims .
The heart , not the head , he says .
He admits accuracy can't be guaranteed .
The whale only breaks the surface briefly , and the boat is always moving .
It 's real hunting .
The Norwegians say that in nearly all cases , this technique - a hand grenade exploding inside the heart - kills the whale instantaneously , that very few of the animals take longer than two minutes to die .
The official line is that it takes one shot for a neat death with no pain , a claim that protesters have long dismissed as propaganda .
I mention to Bjorn that David Attenborough has written movingly of our inability to hear the whales suffering .
If we could hear their screams , he wrote , there 's no way whaling would be allowed .
Bjorn shrugs - ' You 'll see ' - and leads us to supper .
We bunch around a table , cameraman Martin Roberts , four Norwegians and me .
We left port only a few hours ago , yet most of the meal looks as if it 's been cooked from frozen .
Only the small potatoes are fresh : small and fairly new , they are cooked with their skins on .
I watch amazed as these tough men delicately peel away the skins with their knives and forks , a fiddly task which brings to mind the daintiest of tea parties .
Conversation is awkward : the crewmen think we 're in the way , asking too many questions .
Any mention of the anti-whaling movement produces a look of loathing .
Bjorn 's cousin tells a story of two French journalists who once came on board .
They were so seasick they had to leave .
The crewmen pause in their potato - peeling to laugh , and Martin and I feel obliged to join in .
Within hours , we 'll feel like crying .
We go to bed .
The note of the engine keeps changing - reversing , revving , slowing .
I realise the boat must be manoeuvring .
This can only mean the crew have either just killed a whale or they 're about to .
We race upstairs to find the worst has happened .
We 've missed the big event .
If there 's one thing worse than seeing a whale harpooned , it 's being a news team that sleeps through it .
I 'm furious the crew did n't wake us , as promised , and even more angry when I think through the implications : without filming the harpoon being fired , there 's no way we can leave this purgatory .
As that thought sinks in , the adrenaline of the past few minutes wears off and my innards remind me of the Arctic swell .
Within seconds Martin and I are hanging over the railing .
Magnificent mammal : A minke whale breaches the ocean surface , but such animals prove no match for the harpoons of the Norwegian whalers
This time Bjorn can't resist a jibe : ' You Englishmen , you are like women . '
His crew roar approval .
It occurs to me that we 've ended up on a modern - day version of a Viking longboat .
I want to come back with a clever riposte but my mind , like my belly , is empty .
Another day passes and Martin is in marginally worse shape than me , too weak to curse the Norsemen , too sick to come on deck .
So when I hear the battle cry go up - ' Het Waal ' - signalling that a whale has been spotted , I know I 'll be doing the filming .
At the bow , Bjorn is gripping the harpoon , eyes scanning the waves of the Norwegian Sea , off the North Cape .
Everyone is tense , poised for a sight of the whale .
There 's a flash of black off to one side and a lot of yelling .
I switch on the camera .
The sheen on the water is dazzling , the swell still nauseating .
I have no idea where to point so I choose the widest possible setting , including in the frame Bjorn and the harpoon and a big expanse of sea .
I spot the rise of a black shape in the trough between two waves .
Then there 's a deafening bang and a cloud of smoke brings the whiff of high explosive .
The boat stops .
Bjorn peers over the side .
I move closer but he waves me back .
I 've no idea if the whale has been hit .
But then I see Bjorn picking up his rifle .
Earlier he'd told me he only uses it if the animal does not die instantly .
Clearly he needs to finish it off but it's in the wrong position for him to open fire so the boat has to move .
I imagine the whale in agony .
I keep the camera running .
Bjorn fires two shots , then three more .
The whole process , from firing the harpoon to the last shots , has lasted well over two minutes ; the camera 's timecode is irrefutable evidence .
The crew use long hooks to bring the whale to the loading ramp at the side of the boat .
Bjorn had missed the heart .
Ropes are lashed around the whale 's tail and it is hauled on board by a winch .
The animal is much longer than the boat is wide , so when its belly is on the deck , its head hangs over the side and a stream of blood flows into the sea .
I notice a massive eye , staring lifeless at the sky .
The gulls are gathering .
It falls to the cook to handle the butchery .
His first action is to cut open the whale 's belly .
It 's a female so it could be pregnant .
The knife enters the pale skin , just below the chest , and draws a red line down towards the tail .
There is no foetus , but the belly is full of shrimp and the stench hits me hard .
After removing its innards , the cook sets about carving out the fillets , which are the size of railways sleepers - the largest steaks in the world .
Steam rises into the air .
Blood is now flowing in torrents , the crewmen 's rubber boots sloshing through streams of red .
The steaks are laid on the deck to cool .
The rest of the whale is unwanted , so the massive carcass slides off the ship and crashes into the sea .
I hope for a final sight of that massive , sad eye , but the gulls are swarming too thickly .
Bjorn is excited .
This early haul will help cover his costs and , if he's in the right area , he 'll land a lot more .
I ask him whether he feels anything for the whale .
' Do you feel anything for a cow ? ' he responds .
But what about all the blood , and the risk that the whale was in calf ?
' Well , it was n't in calf , ' he says .
' And you get the same amount of blood in any slaughterhouse , you just do n't see it , ' he replies .
But what about the length of time it took the whale to die ?
' It was n't so long . '
But , I explain , I timed it on the camera .
Bjorn grimaces .
' You 're right , ' he agrees , ' this time it took longer than two minutes , that 's unusual . '
The whale was n't able to scream but the pictures will .
Our job is done and although Bjorn would love to be rid of us , he 's also reluctant to leave this spot .
Initially he offers to drop us at some place a few miles away , but when I check the map I realise it's an island , so I object .
After much argument , we settle on Europe 's northernmost village , Gamvik .
Lying on the cold concrete of the harbour , still queasy , we watch the Reinebuen race back to the hunt .
The whale meat is natural , and this particular catch , if tightly limited , is possibly sustainable .
But compared to the mechanised slaughter of an abattoir , this is hit - and - miss .
As in ancient times , aim is everything and what I witnessed was a bungled shot and a horribly slow death , an example of how whaling can be inhumane .
After my report is aired , a Minister quotes from it in a debate about whaling in the House of Commons .
The Norwegians , used to this kind of criticism , increase the quota the following year , even though the evidence suggests the hunt is n't worth it .
That 's because Bjorn and the rest of Norway 's whalers land more meat than Norwegians eat .
It 's on sale in supermarkets but does not fly from the shelves .
One consignment of whale blubber , offered to Japan , was refused because it contained too many contaminants - the deadly chemical acronyms of modern industrial life , the PCBs and the PAHs , toxic by - products of fossil fuels .
So I wonder about the real motive behind the killing .
There 's no single answer , but the national pride of a seafaring nation is a factor ; another is the need to woo voters in fishing communities .
It 's certainly not about getting meat to Norwegian tables .
I 've left the ship with relief and a sense of futility : wasted effort , needless cruelty , pointless slaughter .
Martin and I are slumped on our bags , waiting for a lift to the local airport .
Martin asks me whether I was sick in the bathroom the night before .
I was n't .
But he asks again , because he insists someone was .
We puzzle over this until a glorious reality dawns .
If it was n't him or me , then it must have been one of the Norwegians .
At last I have a riposte to Bjorn - too late , but cheering nonetheless .
It is n't just Englishmen who are like women .
Vikings get seasick , too .
The comedians at Westboro Baptist Church have the right to say mean , terrible things about Americans , even while they ’re being buried — or so we ’ve argued .
But what if the Constitution , which bars the government from inhibiting the freedom of expression , does not bar the government from creating a law that lets private citizens do just that ?
This is less a thorough legal argument on our part and more of a thought exercise , but let ’s roll with attorney Nathan Tucker ’s interesting premise .
The father of the fallen marine , Albert Snyder , sued the protesters for , among other things , intentional infliction of emotional distress .
The jury awarded Mr. Snyder $ 5 million in damages , a verdict that was later overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on the grounds that the protesters ’ speech was protected by the First Amendment .
The First Amendment , however , provides that , “ Congress shall make no law ?
abridging the freedom of speech . ”
But there is no federal , state or local law at issue in this case .
No one is arguing that the government tried to suppress Mr. Phelps ’ speech in any way .
This suit is entirely private in nature .
It involved the offensive remarks made by one private individual against another private individual at a private event .
In a type of personal injury suit , the aggrieved party sued the harasser in court for emotional damages .
How , then , does the First Amendment apply to this case at all ?
In cases such as New York Times v. Sullivan and Shelley v. Kraemer , the Supreme Court attempted to justify the First Amendment ’s reach into private suits by relying on the tenuous argument that , because the power of the state is used to enforce the verdict ( through the court system ) , the government is suppressing the speech at issue .
In essence , the court reasons that , since the court system coercively transfers money from A to B because of A ’s speech , that it becomes a government restriction on speech .
It is an ingenious but dangerous argument that brings every single court action under the Constitution ’s orbit .
So long as there is a plausible political or social commentary behind one ’s actions , he is now immune from liability .
If this were the case , a minority resident would have no recourse against his prejudiced neighbors if they decided to demonstrate outside his property every night , day after day .
Or a host could not evict a rowdy house guest who was becoming verbally abusive if that guest was doing so as a political commentary .
And suits for slander and libel would be impossible .
And taking the court ’s precedent to its logical conclusion , no one could sue for monetary damages because , if awarded , the court would be depriving the defendant of private property without just compensation , in violation of the 5th Amendment .
And no marriage could be dissolved , because the Contract Clause prohibits states from breaking contracts .
Since these results were clearly not intended by the Constitution , the court should use this case to overrule its past precedents and affirm that the mere application of neutral principles to enforce private suits does not constitute government action .

Oriented Matroids : The Power of Unification Posted May 2003 .
Feature Column Archive 1 . Introduction
Matroids were invented by Hassler Whitney as a way of generalizing a variety of properties that were common to structures such as vector spaces and graphs ( see a previous Feature Column , Matroids : The Value of Abstraction , for more information on matroids ) .
The properties of bases of a vector space , all of which have the same size , are an example of a property of a vector space that is generalized in a matroid .
One way of thinking of matroids is to have them developed in terms of the circuits in a graph .
Digraphs ( short for directed graphs ) , diagrams consisting of dots and line segments ( edges ) with arrows assigned to the edges , are a generalization of the graph concept .
Analogously , oriented matroids are a generalization of matroids that mimic the way that matroids are related to graphs by looking at the circuit structure of digraphs .
It is hard to single out the birth of the study of oriented matroids , but in a very short period of time matroids have proved to be a powerful way to view a variety of geometrical , combinatorial and topological ideas that have also pointed at a variety of applications .
Early researchers in what emerged as the subject of oriented matroids were R. Bland , J. Folkman , M. Las Vergnas , and J. Lawrence .
Despite the fact that they generalize a variety of geometrical phenomena , oriented matroids are associated with ideas that can be illustrated with concrete examples .
At one time Italy and Germany consisted of a lot of small provinces , each of which acted more or less independently of the other provinces in the area .
This meant that there was no central system of planning , or currency , or standards , etc .
When these provinces became unified into a single national state , much more could be accomplished .
There is an analogy here for mathematics .
When mathematical ideas are encapsulated into small chunks without the ties between the chunks , it is sometimes not possible to achieve the full power of what might be done .
The concept of oriented matroids has helped unify a broad collection of seemingly isolated mathematical ideas ( some arising in graph theory , the study of polytopes , and arrangements of lines ) and that has encouraged researchers to find in other areas the analog of what has been fruitful in a specific area .

A number of institutions are beginning efforts to improve the quality of their science and to make their work more transparent .
The official British climate agency is undertaking a complete review of its temperature data and will make its records and analysis fully public for the first time , allowing outside scrutiny of methods and conclusions .
The United Nations panel on climate change will accept external oversight of its research practices , also for the first time .
Two universities are investigating the work of top climate scientists to determine whether they have violated academic standards and undermined faith in science .
The National Academy of Sciences is preparing to publish a nontechnical paper outlining what is known — and not known — about changes to the global climate .
And a vigorous debate is under way among climate scientists on how to make their work more transparent and regain public confidence .

Some critics think these are merely cosmetic efforts that do not address the real problem , however .
“ I ’ll let you in on a very dark , ugly secret — I do n’t want trust in climate science to be restored , ” Willis Eschenbach , an engineer and climate contrarian who posts frequently on climate skeptic blogs , wrote in response to one climate scientist ’s proposal to share more research .
“ I do n’t want you learning better ways to propagandize for shoddy science .
I do n’t want you to figure out how to inspire trust by camouflaging your unethical practices in new and innovative ways . ”
“ The solution , ” he concluded , “ is for you to stop trying to pass off garbage as science . ”
Ralph J. Cicerone , president of the National Academy of Sciences , the most prestigious scientific body in the United States , said that there was a danger that the distrust of climate science could mushroom into doubts about scientific inquiry more broadly .
He said that scientists must do a better job of policing themselves and trying to be heard over the loudest voices on cable news , talk radio and the Internet .
“ This is a pursuit that scientists have not had much experience in , ” said Dr. Cicerone , a specialist in atmospheric chemistry .
The battle is asymmetric , in the sense that scientists feel compelled to support their findings with careful observation and replicable analysis , while their critics are free to make sweeping statements condemning their work as fraudulent .

I had a cathartic experience last week courtesy of Lawrence Lessig , legendary open source champion and Harvard law professor .
Though the choice of Lessig as keynote speaker at Storage Networking World in Orlando was odd -- he was n't going to be talking about storage , after all -- he delivered an electrifying speech on broadband , Net neutrality , God , the universe , and everything .
Suffice it to say , I was fired up .
After the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision last week to overturn the FCC 's authority to enforce Net neutrality , I was peppered with requests for a response , probably because I 've taken a hard line defending Net neutrality before .
I should have had something to say , but a thousand obligatory words decrying the court 's decision seemed pointless .
I figured a response would come to me eventually , and it did -- about 60 seconds into Lessig 's talk .
[ Read Paul Venezia 's classic letter to the enemies of Net neutrality .
|
The normally snarky Robert X. Cringely has some serious thoughts about the awful Net neutrality ruling . ]
There 's no way to do justice to his presentation in print .
Fortunately , you can watch the whole thing [ 7 ] for yourself , and I encourage you to do so right now .
It 's nearly an hour long , but worth every minute -- seriously .
At times , it has seemed like there was no point in assailing the enemies of Net neutrality .
Even the FCC itself seemed to believe that Washington was n't ready for a coordinated effort to free us from the shackles of the carriers .
No matter the logic , the proof , or the reality of the situation , the companies who pour buckets of money into Washington seem to have it all locked down so tight there 's no room even for discussion .
As Lessig points out , that 's true inside the Beltway -- but those of us on the outside can keep pushing the issue .
In fact , that may be the only way to turn this tide .
And oh , but does that need to happen .
Some of the more shocking points in Lessig 's talk revolved around the reality of broadband access speeds , pricing , and openness around the world .
Oft - used comparisons between the United States and South Korea or Japan are generally dismissed as non-comparable given the population density of those countries -- so Lessig chose to examine France .
In France , Internet access generally costs $ 33 a month , provides 20 M bps fixed broadband to the home , and includes unlimited local and long - distance calling to 70 countries , plus HDTV and even wireless voice and data access through cooperative agreements .
That 's about what AT&T charges just for the 3G data plan on an iPhone in the United States .
France also has open network legislation in place .
Yeah , that 's right : France .
( Désolé . )
I added up what I pay for access here in the States .
Between HDTV and data through Time Warner , voice through FairPoint , and wireless through AT&T , I pay over $ 350 a month for slower access , though some of that cost is due to a business - class Internet circuit .
If I delete that extra cost ( ye t it 's 10 Mbps -- half of the French example ) , I 'm still at $ 275 per month .
Worse , the carriers are looking for a way to charge higher rates for certain data and retain carte blanche to do whatever they like with my traffic .
That 's just insane .
Yet it 's reality in the United States .
Lessig goes beyond the simple fact that the United States is getting screwed out of the future by the big ISPs : He conjures the specter of an Internet Patriot Act .
Just as 9/11 provided the Bush administration with an opportunity to ram through the Patriot Act and gain vast new powers to spy on American citizens , a total crash of the Internet ( caused by accident or design ) could be a pretext for hurriedly passed legislation that grants the U.S. government sweeping Internet monitoring powers by a fearful and technologically irrelevant Congress .
If that 's not enough , he brings it all home by discussing the disturbing Beltway economy that underlies all of these decisions : the lobbyists who pour so much money into politics that it's no longer a matter of right or wrong , only how much .
I realize that assessment goes well beyond tech issues , even for The Deep End .
But if there 's one thing that all technologists know , it 's that fixing the problem at the core is always the best solution .
Addressing the symptoms alone wo n't get us anywhere .
Viva la revolucion !

9/11 Made us Safer ?
There ’s an essay on the Computerworld website that claims I implied , and believe , so :
OK , so strictly - speaking , he does n’t use those exact words , but the implication is certainly clear .
In a discussion about why there are n’t more terrorist attacks , he argues that ‘ minor ’ terrorist plots like the Times Square car bomb are counter - productive for terrorist groups , because “ 9/11 upped the stakes . ”
This comes from an essay of mine that discusses why there have been so few terrorist attacks since 9/11 .
There ’s the primary reason — there are n’t very many terrorists out there — and the secondary reason : terrorist attacks are harder to pull off than popular culture leads people to believe .
What he ’s talking about above is the tertiary reason : terrorist attacks have a secondary purpose of impressing supporters back home , and 9/11 has upped the stakes in what a flashy terrorist attack is supposed to look like .
From there to 9/11 making us safer is quite a leap , and not one that I expected anyone to make .
Certainly a series of events , before , during , and after 9/11 , contributed to an environment in which a particular group of terrorists found low - budget terrorist attacks less useful — and I suppose by extension we might be safer because of it .
But you ’d also have to factor in the risks associated with increased police powers , the NSA spying on all of us without warrants , and the increased disregard for the law we ’ve seen out of the U.S. government since 9/11 .
And even so , that ’s a far cry from claiming causality that 9/11 made us safer .
Not that any of this really matters .
Compared to the real risks in the world , the risk of terrorism is so small that it ’s not worth a lot of worry .
As John Mueller pointed out , the risks of terrorism “ are similar to the risks of using home appliances ( 200 deaths per year in the United States ) or of commercial aviation ( 103 deaths per year ) . ”

Happy New Year !
Some 13,000 years ago the Earth was struck by thousands of Tunguska - sized cometary fragments over the course of an hour , leading to a dramatic cooling of the planet , according to astronomer Professor Bill Napier of the Cardiff University Astrobiology Centre .
He presents his new model in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
The cooling , by as much as 8 °C , interrupted the warming which was occurring at the end of the last ice age and caused glaciers to readvance .
Evidence has been found that this catastrophic change was associated with some extraordinary extraterrestrial event .
The boundary is marked by the occurrence of a " black mat " layer a few centimetres thick found at many sites throughout the United States containing high levels of soot indicative of continental - scale wildfires , as well as microscopic hexagonal diamonds ( nanodiamonds ) which are produced by shocks and are only found in meteorites or impact craters .
These findings led to the suggestion that the catastrophic changes of that time were caused by the impact of an asteroid or comet 4 km across on the Laurentide ice sheet , which at that time covered what would become Canada and the northern part of the United States .
The cooling lasted over a thousand years , and its onset coincides with the rapid extinction of 35 genera of North American mammals , as well as the disruption of the Palaeoindian culture .
The chief objection to the idea of a big impact is that the odds against the Earth being struck by an asteroid this large only 13,000 years ago are a thousand to one against .
And the heat generated by the rising fireball would be limited by the curvature of the horizon and could not explain the continent - wide occurrence of wildfires .
Professor Napier has now come up with an astronomical model which accounts for the major features of the catastrophe without involving such an improbable event .
According to his model , the Earth ran into a dense trail of material from a large disintegrating comet .
He points out that there is compelling evidence that such a comet entered the inner planetary system between 20 000 and 30 000 years ago and has been fragmenting ever since , giving rise to a number of closely related meteor streams and comoving asteroids known as the Taurid Complex .
In the course of the giant comet 's disintegration , the environment of the interplanetary system would have been hazardous and the Earth would probably have run through at least one dense swarm of cometary material .
The new model indicates that such an encounter would last for about an hour during which thousands of impacts would take place over continental dimensions , each releasing the energy of a megaton - class nuclear bomb , generating the extensive wildfires which took place at that time .
The nanodiamonds at the extinction boundary would then be explained as having come in with the comet swarm .
One recent meteorite is known which may have come from this giant comet progenitor : the Tagish Lake meteorite , which fell over Yukon Territory in January 2000 .
It has the highest abundance of nanodiamonds of any meteorite so far analysed .
Professor Napier sums up his model : " A large comet has been disintegrating in the near - Earth environment for the past 20,000 to 30,000 years , and running into thousands of fragments from this comet is a much more likely event than a single large collision .
It gives a convincing match to the major geophysical features at this boundary . "
Apple 's next - gen iPhone ?
Source : Gizmodo.com
Gizmodo , which posted photos today of what it said was the next - generation iPhone , paid $ 5,000 for access to the smartphone , said Nick Denton , head of Gawker Media , which publishes the blog .
In an e-mail reply to questions , Denton said " $ 5 k " when asked how much Gawker paid for access to the purported iPhone .
Earlier today , Denton had tweeted , " Does Gizmodo pay for exclusives ?
Too right ! "
Denton repeated what his Gizmodo reporter , Jason Chen , had said in his story -- that the disguised iPhone had been found in a Redwood City , Calif . , bar by the person or persons whom Gawker paid .
" [ It is ] our understanding that the phone was lost , " he said .
Just before 6:30 p.m. Eastern , Denton posted another tweet that reinforced his lost - not - stolen contention .
" iPhone update .
We think we 've identified the sorry Apple engineer who left the next - gen phone at the bar , " he wrote .
Apple 's attorneys have not contacted Gawker Media , Denton added .
" No official communication , no , " he said , leaving open the door to some other form of contact .
That may be how Apple will play it , said Barry Cohen , an intellectual property attorney at Thorp Reed & Armstrong LLP .
" It 's hard to predict Apple 's response , but they may not comment on it , because any act on their part would actually validate the story , " Cohen said .
" By not commenting , they could create an air of mystery that this is , in fact , the [ next ] iPhone . "
In any case , although Apple and its CEO , Steve Jobs , might be furious about the leak , this is n't the same as if a trade secret had been disclosed , Cohen argued .
" This is n't the Coca - Cola formula ; that 's been secret for forever , " he said .
" Cell phone technology changes so fast , for one thing , and if they 're going to launch this themselves in one , two or three months , they do n't need to worry about trade secrets . "
Denton did n't express any concern about what steps , if any , Apple might take , and cited a January 2008 lawsuit by the Church of Scientology and actor Tom Cruise against Gawker for posting video clips of a " private [ Church of Scientology International ] religious event " as proof .
Denton said today when asked what Gawker 's plans would be if it were faced with legal threats from Apple : " Formidable though Steve Jobs may be , the Church of Scientology has a more vicious reputation for litigation . "
Cohen hesitated to define Gawker 's liability but said that the firm would be unlikely to face charges if , in fact , the iPhone had been lost .
If it had been stolen , as others have speculated , things could change .
" There are criminal statues on [ states ' ] books for the receipt of stolen property , " Cohen said .
" I would be wary of buying something from someone not knowing the provenance .

I have never been able to understand the cultural dynamics of what is called the Pakistan fashion industry , particularly the notion of holding ‘ fashion weeks ’ which , at least to me , seem to last for months .
There is nothing new in saying that the so - called Pakistan fashion scene constitutes the minutest percentage of the population when we start counting the number of designers , models , ‘ fashion journalists , ’ and audience members for fashion shows in this country .
Their activities carry not an iota of social relevance whatsoever .
To me they ’re quite a useless bunch and I am sure after reading this they would be thinking the same way about me as well .
Fair enough .
However , I do have the right to raise a few questions when the enthusiastic fashionistas – who entirely exist in a colourful timeless void – go on to make statements to the effect that they are ‘ defying extremism ’ and how their events have more to do with matters of business and economics than mere , decedent entertainment .
Well , in no way are these jazzy events akin to a bunch of cosmetic ladies and men standing up to the specter of extremism .
The truth is this ( albeit widely covered ) fringe has always been around .
They were there even during the most myopic and reactionary days of one General Zial Haq as well .
Thus , even if this country ’s military , politicians and people do manage to fail themselves by whining out democracy and submitting to monsters like the Taliban , it is my guess , Pakistan would still be holding fashion weeks .
These trendy folks , about whom we are forced to read and see so much of in our newspapers and on TV , are actually quite a miniature lot .
Their existence in the public eye is mainly due to the fact that they make great eye candy and software for Sunday papers to splash their pages with .
But like I said , even if we have Mullah Omar as our ruler , blowing away the heads of poor ‘ underclass ’ women for daring to take a peek from their jet - black burqas , or chopping off the hands of men who dare to shave , the fashionistas would be holding a fashion week at some big shot ’s haveli because that big shot will most probably have some friends or connections in the Mullah ’s brigade .
And anyway , the class these fashion kings and queens belong to would probably be the first to exit a burning , turning Pakistan .
Some might ask , should not a liberal man like me , who wants to see his country evolve into one of the most dynamic , diverse , and democratic nations in the Muslim world , feel happy when events like fashion weeks take place in this country during such testing times ?
I ’m afraid not .
Like I said , these fashionista types have always been around and never have they managed to exhibit the kind of relevant meat ( pun not intended ) required for reviving the country ’s cultural health .
This can only be done through the aggressive promotion of things like popular theatre and cinema , indigenous folk music ( of all the languages that are spoken in this country ) , literature that clearly reflects the political , economic and social challenges of the times , and debates on faith and national identity involving accomplished intellectuals , historians , politicians and the masses , and not papaya - faced cranks masquerading as talk show hosts or ‘ experts ’ on TV .
Dances with wolves
The other day while flipping through the gazillion TV channels out there , I stopped for a while at a channel that was covering this year ’s ‘ Pakistan Fashion Week . ’
Lo and behold !
I noticed that one of the sponsors of the event was a foreign bank that recently laid - off hundreds of its employees as a ‘ cost cutting measure . ’
Now , why ( rather how ) would an organisation that is willing to dump many of its employees to cut cost , end up paying for a floozy event like a fashion week ?
There you go then .
In addition to Mullah Omar ’s rule , even if the nation is facing an economic meltdown , there will always be some rich corporate dude willing to keep the wheels of ‘ fashion ’ turning .
‘ Social responsibility ’ they call it in corporate lingo .
Model citizens , indeed ( pun intended ) .
Supposedly the Pakistani ‘ fashion scene ’ ( sometimes audaciously called an ‘ industry ’ ) has grown manifold , but it has never fought against the forces that want to clamp down on it .
How can they ?
This batch of hip liberals in the shape of fashionistas and pop musicians is the third in line of a generation , most of whose parents quietly went along with the Zia regime after greatly benefiting from all that American and Saudi money floating around during the dictatorship .
This ubiquitous minority was quietly allowed by the ‘ Islamic ’ regime to have their parties , booze , and fashion shows behind closed doors , as Zia ’s moral brigade went about harassing the majority in the name of “ purging vulgarity from society . ”
The economics of this class was never threatened .
And anyways , culturally , they already had their little Paris , New Yorks , and Londons operating in their drawing rooms .
But of course , this was / is a highly opportunistic class as well .
Because the moment things started to open up , especially during the second Benazir Bhutto government , the second generation of this class of hipsters suddenly arrived upon the scene with their catwalks , guitars and what not because there was good money to be made .
However , the moment the second Benazir government fell , so did ( for a while ) that hyped “ cultural revolution ” this class was chanting about from concert halls , catwalks , and award ceremonies .
And since most among this generation of hip liberals were bought up in apolitical , tight .
and compartmentalised elite environments by their prospering parents , they had no clue what had hit them .
One example I would like to quote here of such a scenario is when , in February 1997 , the second Nawaz Sharif government took over , and I actually saw members of a band celebrating the coming of a new era !
Though most of their contemporaries in the fashion industry and the music scene had absolutely no idea how politics worked and what it meant to have a ‘ Ziaist ’ back at the helm , those who tried could not go beyond knee - jerk reactions based on speculative political gossip and conspiracy theories originating in cosy drawing rooms .
Well , many years and openings later the scene is quite the same .
The opportunists are out in force courting brand new TV channels , FM stations , fashion shows , and the music scene .
There maybe newness in how openly they are operating , but there is not an iota of substance in their “ cultural events ” that can actually challenge the obscurantist mentality and forces that challenge them .
In fact , sometimes the case is quite the contrary .
Thus , my suggestions to the fashionistas would be to stay the heck away from making political statements .
By suggesting that you are ‘ challenging extremism , ’ you are actually sounding as silly and dunce - like as those long - haired ( and , indeed , bald ) rock stars of ours who ended up sounding like well - fed drawing room fascists in a recent video by The New York Times .
Anyone for Pathanay Khan or Reshma , instead ?
When pop ate itself
According to my own experience as a journalist covering the Pakistan music scene in the 1990s , it is never a good idea to encourage pop musicians to start making political statements .
As an idea it can be exciting , but since much of the modern pop music scene in Pakistan originates from middle - class settings , one can thus expect nothing more than self - righteous droning and quasi- reactionary demagoguery usually found in the urban bourgeoisie and petty - bourgeois sections of society .
Surveys and studies of these two classes in Pakistan show them to be among the most conservative , with a history of backing assorted military dictators ( especially Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf ) .
Of course , there have also been clear exceptions in this regard , but it is true that over the years the overall conservatism of these classes has seen certain sections from within become both supporters and financiers of the more extreme strains of Islamic thought .
There have been recorded cases against many middle - class shop - owners and traders for financing jihadi organisations ; whereas many sections among the more ‘ modern ’ bourgeois class have largely exhibited their own version of extreme beliefs by passionately patronising ( as supporters and clients ) a number of Islamic televangelists and drawing - room preachers whose numbers have grown two - fold from 1990 onwards .
Consequently , there has also been a dramatic increase in the number of young men and women from the middle - class now preferring to adorn beards and hijabs , and taking religious rituals a lot more seriously ( compared to the situation till the late 1970s ) .
But this class still constitutes a large number of ‘ westernised ’ youth as well .
However , compared to their more socially conservative class contemporaries — who have been seen to follow right - wing groups from the Jamaat - i- Islami to the supposedly defunct Sipah - i - Sahaba , from the Sunni Tehreek and the Tableeghi Jamaat to individuals such as Dr Israr Ahmed and Amir Liaquat — the more ‘ modern ’ lot in this respect have not exactly fallen to the left as a reaction ( like they did between the 1950s and the early 1970s ) .
Instead , in spite of whole - heartedly embracing the economic , aesthetic , and cultural fruits of liberal economics and politics , they have retained their class ’ inherent political conservatism .
Many western journalists and Pakistanis alike are now trying to understand why , for example , many educated , westernised , and modern Pakistani pop / rock stars and their fans are all gung - ho about anti-Americanism but at the same time keep quiet about matters such as religious extremism , terrorism , and the Taliban .
The funny thing is , this is happening even when there are disturbingly tangible and physical examples of the ubiquitous carnage and mayhem being caused by so - called jihadis ; whereas conspiratorial notions such as the ever - present explanation of a ‘ foreign hand ’ remains a largely unsubstantiated and thus somewhat air - headed perception .
Adam Ellick ’s interviews with former rock star turned loud reactionary mutt , Ali Azmat , and bubblegum - rock poster boy , Ali Noor , in his NYT video feature are the cases in point .
Both hail from modern , middle - class settings and represent the more westernised sections of the Pakistani bourgeoisie .
In spite of overtly mimicking the aesthetic , cultural , and linguistic strains of western pop culture , both refuse to see any contradiction whatsoever in conveniently attacking ‘ western imperialism ’ as the reason behind the terror attacks in Pakistan .
Azmat is seen in a T - Shirt and shorts , with an expensive Apple laptop by his side , sitting in a room decorated like an arty version of an American college dude ’s bachelor pad , and the following is what he had to say : ‘ It ( suicide bombing ) is the agenda of neocons to de-Islamise Pakistan … ’
In his recently acquired wisdom ( which , according to columnist Fasi Zaka , Azmat gained “ from watching a total of two YouTube documentaries ” and following the rhetoric of Azmat ’s newfound guru , Zaid Hamid )
Azmat is convinced that the Taliban are not behind the bombings of girls ’ schools , but “ foreign forces ( CIA , RAW and Mossad ) , ” are to be blamed !
Where else but in Pakistan can one find a rock star with a history of being a ‘ party animal ’ and lucratively sponsored by various western multinationals become a shameless and witless apologist of men who in the name of faith not only blow themselves up in public , but are also known to have used three - to - six - year - old children for the same deed .
Then , in the same documentary , we see yet another scion of the increasingly warped Pakistani bourgeoisie , Ali Noor , the long - haired , guitar - slinging lead vocalist of Noorie .
Amidst terrifying footage of blown - up cars , shops , and body limbs , he announces that “ the Taliban only constitute a tiny problem . ”
And , of course , it is the Americans who are to be blamed .
While spouting this profound insight , Noor gestures the ‘ tiny ’ part of his grand statement with his hand and you wonder , should n’t that gesture be explaining the size of his brain ?
No wonder he is incapable of realising the irony of him now appearing on TV to plug cones made by a western multinational .
Is all this symptomatic of mere delusion , or of some unprecedented form of collective psychosis that this class is now suffering from ?
I think ‘ educated , ’ westernized , modern idiots like the failed Times Square bomber , Faisal Shahazad , have the answer .
In fact , I think he is the answer .

British Airways tonight threatened to suspend co-operation with Britain 's largest trade union after last - ditch talks failed to prevent a three - day strike by cabin crew starting today .
In a dramatic escalation of the bitter industrial dispute with Unite , BA warned that it will scrap an agreement that gives shop stewards the use of company offices and time off to represent members – unless a new framework is drawn up .
One industrial relations expert said that ending the arrangement , which stipulates how much work BA employees can do for Unite and what facilities they use , would reduce co-operation to the " bare minimum " .
The failure of the peace talks is a bitter blow to Gordon Brown , who was desperate to banish the spectre of large - scale industrial action 46 days before the likely election date .
Tonight an extensive strike - breaking plan moved into gear at BA as the airline prepared to move 65 % of its passengers over the next three days with a workforce of 1,000 volunteer cabin crew and 22 chartered jets , including three Ryanair planes complete with no -frills flight attendants .
Millions of Britons face transport disruption in the run-up to Easter , after signallers at Network Rail voted to strike in a move that could see them join a walkout with thousands of maintenance workers over the bank holiday .
BA cabin crew have also called a further , four - day strike from 27 March if there is still no agreement by the end of next week .
The first BA cabin crew strike since 1997 begins tomorrow morning after talks between Willie Walsh , BA chief executive , and Tony Woodley , joint general secretary of Unite , collapsed in acrimony this afternoon .
The dispute centres on BA 's decision to unilaterally cut staffing levels on every flight by at least one crew member .
Citing Walsh 's request for a " radical , far - reaching review " of BA 's relationship with Unite , Woodley warned that BA was bent on breaking trade unionism 's grip on the airline .
" BA does not want to negotiate and ultimately wants to go to war with this union , " he said .
And in a letter to Woodley outlining a formal peace offer , Walsh stepped up the pressure by saying he would scrap the facilities agreement that regulates BA 's relationship with Unite if the union does not renegotiate its relationship with the carrier by 18 June .
Marc Meryon , industrial relations partner at Bircham Dyson Bell , said : " It is effectively holding a gun to the union 's head and saying , unless you reach a deal on reworking this relationship we are going to walk away from it . "
Meryon said BA would struggle to derecognise Unite , which represents 12,000 BA cabin crew , because of its size .
Walsh said : " It is deeply regrettable that a proposal I have tabled to Unite , which I believe is fair and sensible and addresses all the concerns of cabin crew , has not been accepted .
The offer remains available , but it will be withdrawn once industrial action commences .
Tens of thousands of BA people now stand ready to serve our customers .
BA will be flying tomorrow and will continue to fly through these periods of industrial action . "
A No 10 spokesman said : " The prime minister believes that this strike is in no one 's interest and will cause unacceptable inconvenience to passengers .
He urges the strike be called off immediately .
He also urges BA 's management and workforce to get together without delay to resolve what is a dispute about jobs and wages . "
The talks breakdown was pounced on by the Conservative party , which has sought to make political capital out of the funding links between Labour and Unite , one of the party 's biggest donors .
" Labour 's union paymasters at Unite are determined to inflict travel misery on thousands of families , " said Theresa Villiers , the shadow transport secretary .
Preparations were under way tonight to have picket lines at seven points around Heathrow .
Under an agreement with BAA , the airport 's owner , striking cabin crew will not be allowed to protest directly outside airport terminals .
A BA spokeswoman said the 30,000 daily passengers unable to travel due to the strike – around 45,000 will be able to travel – were almost certain to have made alternative plans .
" We do n't expect vast numbers of disgruntled people because we put our revised schedule out on Monday .
We have also been contacting them proactively through email . "

DOSE :
repeated inhaled Nitrous Oxide ( gas )
BODY WEIGHT : 190 lb
Two nights ago while sitting in a local fast - food restauraunt , discussing our lives and various stray topics , a lady friend of mine told me that she had tried Nitrous Oxide for the first time the night before .
The first thing she recommended was that I tried it at least once .
I agreed and we traveled to the local porn palace which is known to distribute packs of 24 .
We weaved through aisles displaying videos for those with anal and goat fetishes and finally arrived at the main counter .
After splitting the cost of a pack , ten bucks each , we drove to a park near my house and found a dark corner to stop the car .
Keeping an eye out for any black and whites prowling the neighborhood , we busted out the shit .
She was the first to partake , in order to show me the proper method .
Never before have I witnessed a female having an orgasm without any form of sexual contact until that moment when ( let s call her Nozzie . )
Nozzie inhaled a balloon - full of N2O .
After dropping the balloon , she leaned back her seat and began moaning .
Her back arched as her eyes closed and lips parted .
As her breasts reached toward the night sky , Nozzies head moved from side to side as purring , quaking whispers softly poured from her throat .
After about thirty seconds passed , she lay back in her seat , sighed , and smiled contently .
Needless to say , at that moment , I wanted nothing more than to breathe pure Nitrous Oxide into my lungs .
So I did .
Being the nervous N2O virgin that I was , my first inhalation wasnt as spectacular as I had expected .
Although I did experience mild sound distortion and a sense of complete bodily relaxation , it didnt have the same power upon me as it seemed to have had upon Nozzie .
I was disappointed as hell .
But Nozzie ( the sweet , empathetic person that she is ) had the perfect cure for that : she told me to close my eyes and wait a few minutes .
When I opened them , she had a new balloon prepared for me a double dosage of N2O .
I thanked her and prepared myself exhaling completely , I cleared my lungs of all oxygen .
Inhaling completely , I filled them with the cool , sweet gas and continued the pattern of inhalation / exhalation into the pink punching balloon .
After four repetitions , I began to feel the night close around me .
Enjoying the sudden onrush of sensory distortion and closing my eyes , I continued to breathe from the balloon .
Suddenly appearing behind my eyelids was a white mass , strands and patterns of greenish purple dancing throughout .
I felt all physical sensations dissapear as I became something else , something divine , something that could SEE reality for what it was .
While , in truth , the orgasm of the N2O high lasted for a grand total of 10 seconds , it felt as though time meant nothing and that I was on a journey through forever .
When the cerebral pleasure had subsided , I realized to my dismay that I was merely a human being , that I wasnt swimming through the river - streets of some undiscovered city in the heavens .
I also realized that , although Ive smoked massive quantities of grass before , I had never in my life been this high .
It was the most magical state of mind that I have ever reached .
For the next round , she and I decided to enjoy a simultaneous experience .
We both agreed that a double - dose would be perfect .
Before inhaling , I put one of my favorite new cds in the player : A Perfect Circles  Mer de Noms .
( which I highly recommend .
This band is fucking amazing .
If you re a fan of Tool or just a fan of note - for - note vocals and true beauty , you must hear this album . )
I played the song  Orestes and we prepared ourselves for the next round .
As the world disappeared , the vocals of Maynard James Keenan and the atmosphere of the music pressed me into a void where the music acted as a soundtrack to a land of perfection .
While there , I felt nothing but content .
As the most potent effects wore off , the intensity of Orestes increased , creating a perfect balance for the situation .
I stared at the carpeted inner-roof of my car and enjoyed the beauty of the moment as Nozzies N2O orgasm reached its crescendo .
What happened next will go down in the annals of my life .
As the song continued , a lyric that perfectly represented the situation was sung by Maynard :  One more medicated peaceful moment . 
So so so true .
Breathing in a toxic gas that we bought at a XXX video store , this girl Nozzie and I had together discovered a sense of peace that we had never felt before .
When I told her this , she merely sighed and emitted a final groan .
In the state of transcendental realization that I was feeling , the beauty that lay beside me in the dark car seemed beyond what was real .
To see if she truly existed , I moved to kiss her lips .
It was passion at its fullest .
Our first kiss , our first taste of each others life .
Amazing .
Feverishly , we filled the balloons again , another double .
Inhaled , exhaled .
Kissed .
Only one part of me felt her lips and tongue against mine , the physicality of me .
My spirit body felt pure , burning , molten human flesh coursing down my throat and throughout my veins .
Her breath became my breath , her flesh my flesh , and her soul my soul .
Ten minutes later , we lay on the cool grass in the center of the park with our limbs intertwined .
Our eyes stared into the black sky and its burning white embers , our humanity slowly returning to us but our minds never to be the same .
" Do n't catch your suit on anything sharp . "
Danforth was waiting in the lock with his armor on , wristlights lit , and as always he was spouting useless advice to the rookie .
It was just his way of dealing with tension , so everybody ignored him .
They always did before a dive .
Shela was checking her tools , made fast to her bandolier ; Monnon was tapping his boot toes on the deckplates .
Pariah was edging towards the hulk , making small incremental burns as the grapplock rotated greasily , servo s whining , to track some weak point the cameras had located on the hulk 's hull .
Strath , the rookie , was watching the ' lock turn back and forth a nervous look on his face behind the synthetic sapphire of his visor .
" Do n't smack your faceplate , Strath , it 's hard but you do n't wanna scratch it up and screw your visibility . "
" Okay , Dan . "
" Leave off him , Dan , huh ? "
Shela tapped the last device with practiced fingers and looked up .
" He checked out in drill .
He 'll be fine . "
" Yeah , in drill .
This is ... "
" He knows what this is .
C'mon , do n't ride the kid just to make your own nerves easy . "
She shot Strath a grin to let him know this was n't about him , which he returned gratefully .
" Sorry . " Danforth shrugged at him apologetically .
" No , it 's okay , I need all the tips I can get .
I 've never been on a live dive , after all . "
" Aw , Christ , kid , do n't tell him that , we 'll be listening to him all damn day . "
Monnon 's drawl was laced with mock horror , the tap - tap - tap of his boots traversing his suit fabric to underly his voice transmission .
Pariah shuddered to a hard braking burn .
The hulk was close .
A tone in their suit phones heralded the ship 's Monitor .
" Attention .
Grapple in ten seconds .
Prepare for impact . "
They all took hold , Strath looking apprehensive , the rest suddenly relaxed .
Seconds ticked , then -
BO - O-O-OMMMMM
" That 's it , we 're locked . "
Danforth 's voice was noticeably calmer , relieved .
" Okay , recorder .
Salvage and investigation team Seven Seven Alpha , timestamp .
Crewmembers Danforth Abizaid , Monnon Coyle , Shela Arakel , Strath Leukis .
Monitor of record FSS Pariah .
Attached to target ; effecting entry through grapplock as per standard procedure , no information as to target condition .
Going to automatic suit recording now . "
He motioned them all into the lock ; when they were all within its confines , Shela palmed the red glowing plate and the inner door cycled with the floor - shaker and atmospheric buzzer .
There was a brief delay while the atmosphere was pumped out , then the lights cycled to orange as the grapplock 's systems worked on the target .
Finally the Monitor spoke again .
" Target lock engaged .
Systems functional .
Opening outer door .
Soft seal .
Open .
Opening lock for transfer .
Good luck . "
" Thanks , Pariah .
See you on the flipside . "
Danforth swung the lockbar and the outer door slowly rotated outward into darkness .
As it passed forty - five degrees , the lightbars mounted on the outside flickered to life to show the strait confines of the sealtube ; at the other end , a scarred and pitted standard outer lockdoor waited .
They moved out of the lock one at a time , Danforth huge in his armor moving all the way to the far door .
Shela moved up behind him in case her tools were needed .
Monnon remained midway , weapons active ; Strath , his various access modules quiescent until jacked in , hung just outside the door they left .
Danforth waved an arm , and Strath reached back to palm the green plate outside the lock , watching as Pariah sealed itself again , the plate flipping to red .
" Good seal , Commander . "
" Thanks , Strath .
Okay , here we go . "
He punched the matching plate on the other lock door .
Nothing happened for a moment , then with a groaning noise the other door swung slowly outward .
" Hey , that 's promising . "
The foreign lock remained dark , however .
Danforth waited until the door had stopped , then angled his bulk inside .
His wristlights illuminated a perfectly standard looking airlock , with FNS Vaicoeur stencilled along two surfaces in Navy - standard blue .
" Looks like our pigeon .
Pariah , call it in . "
" Affirmative , Commander .
Commander , sensors have detected extensive battle damage to the exterior hull of Vaicoeur as well as outgassing in several sectors .
No EM - range signals have been detected .
Gamma and warp radiation are also manifesting in sporadic bursts , indicating both primary and secondary core damage .
Caution is advised . "
" Acknowledged , Pariah .
Thanks .
What sort of outgassing ? "
" Atmospheric and various system components , along with unidentified organics , possibly from hydroponics . "
" Understood . "
Danforth waved the others in .
Strath , last up , squeezed into the darkened lock with trepidation as Shela unclipped a panel and shined a hand torch into it , muttering to herself .
After a few moments , a wan light came up in within the walls , and the outer door began to rotate shut .
" There 's emergency power , Commander .
Cycling the lock now . "
She closed the panel .
" Right . "
Danforth positioned himself before the inner door , poised to grab it with his gauntlets if it looked to hesitate .
Strath watched the outer door cycling shut and tried not to gulp .
Monnon , seeing this , clapped his shoulder .
" Do n't worry , kid .
If Shela 's magic tricks can't get us out of here , Dan 's armor can probably rip the doors off .
If it can't , I can cut through the outer door in about five minutes without draining my ready reserve power . "
Strath tried to grin at him , but it was hard .
The outer door seated with a thud felt through the gauntlet he had braced against the wall .
There was the normal five - second delay , then the inner door began to open .
It made it halfway , then ground to a halt ; Danforth grabbed the edge and levered .
It swung slowly to the stop , and they filed in .
The suit foyer was lit dimly .
There was a chaos of disorganized bits of suit armor lying around , but it did n't look like the foyer had taken battle damage ; rather , it looked like there had been an attempted evacuation , interrupted in the middle , but there were no survivors or corpses anywhere .
Greaves , gauntlets and breastplates lay scattered about , with softsuit unders lying on the floor and racked in lockers .
It was impossible to tell if any were missing .
" Okay .
Stick together .
Head for main Engineering , we need to see what kind of shape the cores are in before we get any ideas . "
Danforth waved towards the bounce tube at the rear of the foyer .
" Before we go , though , let Strath try his magic . "
Immediately outside the armored door to the gravity shaft , Strath unhitched his access probe from his belt and tried to connect to the ship 's Monitor through the hardport in the panel .
There was no response , not even a heartbeat or network acknowledgement .
He shrugged at Danforth , who nodded .
" Okay , people , shaft time . "
They forced the door open .
The bounce tube was pitch black , but unblocked for as far as their lights could reach .
While they were leaning into the shaft , Strath unhooked his probe and reattached it to his belt .
As he did so , a slight movement at the side of his faceplate startled him , and he spun around ; his wrist smacked into Shela 's back .
She in turn jumped and cracked her arm against the doorframe .
" What --"
Strath was peering frantically into the darkness back towards the airlock , still gaping open where they 'd left the door .
Nothing was moving that he could see .
Light flooded the area as Shela and Danforth , seeing where he was looking , directed their suit lights in that direction .
" Strath , what ? "
" Nothing . "
He hoped they could n't see his blush through his faceplate .
" Sorry .
I thought I saw movement .
It 's nothing . "
" You probably did . "
Shela said , patting his shoulder .
" We probably kicked a suit component ; standby grav is n't much at all in here , and it probably tumbled . "
" Yeah ... "
Strath was n't sure about that , but held his tongue .
One at a time , they moved into the tube ; Danforth first , Shela , then Strath , then Monnon in the rear , moving sternwards towards the engineering spaces .
Their radcounters started spiking as they traversed the heavy damage areas , indicating ordnance residue still embedded in the hull .
Strath checked at three more access points , but either Vaicoeur 's Monitor was truly dead or the network was breached in too many places to get a link through to it .
Given the lack of power in ship 's systems , he was n't willing to place bets either way .
Thoughts of the massive salvage bonus that Fleet was willing to pay if the Monitor 's network could be reactivated were starting to look like forlorn hopes , though .
They emerged from the bounce tube , guided by Danforth 's inertial guide and detailed schematics of the Fleur de Lys class assault carrier .
Instead of the armored portal into Engineering Alpha , though , they found themselves in a vehicle bay , reflecting the number of ' minor ' differences that every military construction contract since time began had accrued between design and commissioning .
Cursing , Danforth and Shela scouted to starboard while Strath and Monnon went to port , looking for Engineering .
Strath was only three or four meters from Monnon , trying to determine whether the hatchway he was looking at opened to a passageway or a closet , when there was a sudden burst of light .
He turned to find a smoking area of decking where Monnon had been , and nothing else .
" Monnon ? "
There was no answer .
He looked up , convulsively , turning his flash on the confusion of liftcranes and manipulators that rested over the cradle in which a large armored vehicle slept .
Nothing .
Shining the light on the deck revealed a burned patch , no longer bubbling , where Monnon 's armor had apparently discharged its weaponry .
Strath shivered and chinned his commo .
" Commander ? "
The voice was clear .
" Strath ?
What is it ? "
" Monnon ...he's ... he's gone . "
" What ? " Sharp .
" What happened ? "
" I do n't know .
I was n't looking at him .
There was a light , I think he fired , and now there 's no sign of him . "
" Stay where you are .
We 're coming to you . "
" Roger . "
Strath slowly backed up to put the wall against his shoulder blades and reached down to his belt with his right hand .
The gyp was there , still attached ; he drew it and held it in both hands , aiming the chunky weapon at the deck in front of him as he swept his eyes back and forth .
Nothing moved .
" Strath ? " Danforth 's voice was slightly labored .
" Strath , you still there ?
We 're coming up on you now .
Do n't shoot us . "
" I'm here , Commander . "
Strath made sure his finger was off the trigger .
A patch of wobbly light was approaching from starboard ; it resolved into Danforth 's armor , moving carefully around the various equipment in the bay .
Strath took one hand off the pistol and waved .
Danforth 's figure waved back ; Strath frowned .
There was only one shape .
" Commander , where 's Shela ? "
" She 's with me . "
" Sir , she 's not . "
He watched Danforth stop and rotate clumsily , looking .
" Shit ! " Danforth turned back , loped towards him , drawing his own weapon .
" She was right behind me when we started .
What -"
He saw the burned decking .
" Is this where Monnon was ? "
" Yeah .
He did n't even say anything .
We were looking for hatchways , so I was n't looking at him . "
" Okay .
Do n't turn away from me .
Keep your eyes on me , okay ? "
Danforth glared at him , intense in his concentration .
When Strath nodded , sweating now , Danforth looked from side to side .
They stood there for a moment , rocket pistols clutched between them , held slightly out the the side , talismans of fear .
Danforth looked back at Strath , spoke again .
" Monitor ? "
" Receiving , Commander . "
" Monitor , we 've lost contact with Shela and Monnon .
Do you have their locators on scan ? "
" I do , Commander .
They are colocated in Sickbay . "
" Sickbay ? " Danforth looked puzzled , then grim again .
" Right .
We 're on it .
Strath , with me ? "
Strath gulped .
" Yessir .
Right with you . "
" Good man .
Okay , stay to my left . "
They moved out of the bay and made their way forward along a companionway , Danforth checking his inertial guide frequently .
The emergency lights were on , but spaced fairly far apart .
Twice Strath spun , seeing movement out of the corner of his eye , but found nothing there ; both times , Danforth spun with him , looking , then nodded and motioned him on .
Ten minutes and a single detour around a mangled area , open to dark space , brought them to a white blast door with a caduceus painted on it .
Without speaking , Strath moved to the other side of it as Danforth put his back to the wall alongside , and at Danforth 's nod , plugged his access probe into the port there .
There was a response .
Weak , automatic , but a response .
He nodded furiously at Danforth , then returned his attention to the jack .
The Sickbay systems were online in emergency mode ; he entered the override command Fleet 's salvage division had given him and waited .
There was a grinding through the wall behind him that spoke of damaged mechanisms , and the blast door rose into the overhead .
Yanking his probe out , he followed Danforth into the bay .
The blast door rolled down behind them automatically .
The sickbay was covered in blood and debris ; gauze pads , offal and surgical tools strewn throughout telling of frantic battles fought by medical staffers against their traditional enemy with no hints as to the handicapping .
Danforth was checking the beds along the back of the bay , but they were empty .
" Monitor , locator check please . "
" Crew locators intermittent ; apparent signal interference on all locators due to core radiation .
Last known location of Lieutenants Coyle and Arakel , Main Engineering . "
" Damn it ! " Danforth swore .
" What the fuck - "
" Commander ? " Strath ventured .
" What ? " Danforth swung to face him .
" Where are the crew ? "
" Engineering ! "
" No , Vaicoeur 's crew . "
" They 're - " Danforth stopped .
" Good question .
We have n't seen any bodies .
They might be in the shelters if they had rad leaks and atmosphere loss . "
" Maybe , but there 's atmosphere in most sections we 've been through , other than the breached areas . "
" Look , I do n't know .
It 's possible they abandoned .
I have more urgent problems right now , damn it . "
" Yessir . "
Strath looked away .
" Okay , Monitor , we 're heading back to Engineering .
Let us know ASAP if our locators drop off . "
" Affirmative , Commander . "
Danforth opened the main door .
As he did so , Strath saw something scuttle past his feet .
Shouting , he spun about , bringing up the gyp ; without waiting to see if Danforth had turned , he moved towards the back of the sickbay , positive he 'd seen movement .
His helmet lights shone on the detritus lying about the deckplates as he cast about for whatever had passed him , the nose of the rocket pistol questing .
He had just lifted his gaze from the floor to the back of the bay when the shape resolved from the darkness , all sticks and bands , scrabbling , and his hand squeezed reflexively but the shell burst PAM against the back wall and then it was on him and he felt himself bowled over on his back , borne down to the deck against the feeble gravity , watching as the twiglike shapes fluttered towards his faceplate and there was a giant HHHSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHH and everything went out
" - Strath ? "
" uhhhhh "
" Strath ? "
The voice was familiar in his ears , if hoarse and painful .
" Strath , damn it , wake up . "
He opened a gummed eye .
There was weak light , and indistinct shapes .
He felt awful ; hot , ill , swollen .
His joints ached .
He could n't move .
Something was holding his wrists in an implacable grip .
He closed his eyes again and squeezed them shut , trying to work whatever was gumming them closed out of his orbits , and then opened them again .
Both opened this time .
" Shela ? "
" You 're awake . "
The relief was palpable .
" Can you see ? "
" I... think so . "
He blinked .
It helped , somewhat .
" Wait , where 's my suit ? "
" They took them . "
" They ? "
" The bots . "
He peered around .
He was standing against a metal wall , in what had to be engineering ; huge machines lurked everywhere .
He looked left , towards the voice .
Shela was standing there , her suit gone as well .
She looked florid and just as rumpled as he felt .
Looking down , he saw ther their wrists were locked to the wall by crude restraints .
He tested them ; metal clinked against metal , wrongly , but they did n't move .
" What bots ?
What the hell ... "
" There are some kind of bots wandering around here .
I think they 're ship 's manuatics , but I do n't know . "
" Ship 's - damage control ? "
" Yeah . "
Strath thought about that for a second .
" Any sign of Danforth and Monnon ? "
" They 're to my left , down a few yards .
They 're still out . "
" What the hell 's going on ? "
" I do n't know . "
She laughed , short and hard .
" But look to your right . "
He did , sucked in breath .
Clustered around a rough - looking cylinder were four figures , clothed in the dark blue of Fleet .
They were shriveled , almost mummified ; milky eyes looked out of faces screaming silently in gape - mouthed fear .
" Oh , Jesus . "
" Yeah . "
" What happened to them ? "
" I have no idea .
But I can't help thinking it 's gonna happen to us . "
" Why ? "
" Look at their hands . "
He did .
The four figures were restrained at the wrists , but that was n't all , there was something strange about the way they were chained in .
He could n't quite make it out .
Before he could angle his neck further , though , movement to his left snapped his head back around .
A jumble of metal rods , which was now identifiable as a standard damage control bot in the light , shambled forward and faced him , lenses clicking as they rotated .
" Bot , release me . "
He snapped the command out .
It was worth a try .
It ignored him .
" I tried that . "
Shela said absently .
" They 're not listening . "
" Bot , override Sigma Seven Niner Three Desiderata Five , acknowledge . "
Strath recited the Fleet override , hoping .
Nothing .
The bot reached for his wrists and gripped them securely , undoing the shackles with its secondary manipulators .
" Shit . "
" Strath , if you get a chance , there 's a gun in my boot , okay ? "
He kept his voice calm .
" Which boot ? "
Shela laughed .
" Both of 'em . "
Surprising himself , he laughed too .
" Remind me not to hit on you in a downside bar . "
The bot pulled him away from the wall , towards the cylinder .
He looked down , and almost fainted ; his wrists were scarred , with metal bands embedded in the flesh on their inner surfaces .
That was what had produced the clinking when he 'd struggled .
" What the hell is that ? "
" What ? "
" There 's some kind of metal on my wrists - "
The bot pulled one of the corpses off the cylinder and sat him forcibly on the small ledge it had occupied , then placed his wrists beneath the restraints .
He struggled , but was no match for electromagnetic servos .
He felt a sickening click as the metal sockets on his wrists mated with the mechanism on the cylinder , then the restraints locked down over the joints and he was unable to move them a millimeter as they were pressed painfully into their places .
" Strath , what 's it doing ? "
" I do n't - " he grunted , struggling as the bot moved to his right towards an access port and inserted a probe .
" It 's got my wrists locked to this damn cylinder and AIIIIIIIGH ! "
The scream was pure pain , as molten lava flooded into his arms .
His fingers curled instantly into claws .
He felt himself urinate into his utilities , but it was far away and unimportant ; there was a whining sound and a module that looked strangely familiar lowered itself from the ceiling to surround his upper body .
Somewhere , someone was shouting his name , urgently , but it did n't matter , through the pain that was moving up his forearms and into his thorax .
Blessed cold seeped through him , needles of ice from the module as it tried to caress him and fight off the fire .
The fire and the ice fought , and in between , Strath screamed .
Danforth came to , muzzily , at the screaming .
" Whuzzat ? "
" Danforth ?
Christ , Danforth - "
It was Shela 's voice , and she sounded like she was crying .
" Shela ?
What the hell is going on ? "
He snapped awake , struggled against the restraints , looked around .
" Oh , Christ , what are they doing to the kid ? "
" I do n't know , D , I do n't know .
He said something about there being metal in his wrists , and then they plugged him into that thing , and then he started screaming and that thing came down over him . "
" He screamed , and then that thing came down ? "
" Yeah , why ? "
" That 's a hospital support module . "
" So what ?
Jesus , they 're killing him ! "
" No , wait .
If he screamed first , then that thing 's not what 's doing it . "
" SO WHAT ? "
" So something else is , and the module 's keeping him alive .
So there 's a purpose to whatever 's hurting him .
Who did this ? "
" It 's the repair bots , Dan , the ship 's bots . "
" MONITOR ! "
The voice was faint , but legible , repeated through the implanted conductor in his mastoid .
" Yes , Commander . "
" Monitor , status ! "
" All crew locators in main Engineering .
Slight increase in outgassing .
Lowering of external blackbody radiation from engineering module of target . "
" Wait , what ?
Lowering temp ? "
" Yes , commander . "
" Son of a bitch . "
Danforth was breathing hard , his eyes narrowed .
Strath was still screaming .
A repair bot approached Shela ; she began to kick at it .
" Danforth , what the fuck is going on ? "
" Oh , hell .
Oh , no . "
His face had gone white .
He craned his neck , looking hard at Strath , still screaming on the other side of Shela 's struggles .
" WHAT ? "
She was kicking at the bot , now .
It was bouncing away from her , but patiently returning with mechanical implacability .
" What is it ?
What are they doing ? "
" They 're saving their ship .
Christ , I did n't see it .
Battle damage - they lost coolant on the reactor , Shela .
The fucking coolant loop broke .
There 's no liquid stores anywhere on the ship .
There 's no power to pump coolant .
The reactor 's at standby , but it still needs to move coolant just that little bit , enough to keep the core low . "
" What the fuck does that have to do with us ? "
Danforth felt the bot unhook his left wrist .
He kicked at it ineffectually ; it was a larger model , hull maintenance , and did n't react .
" We 're the radiators , Shel .
Us .
It 's using blood for coolant .
Organic outgassing , fuck , I should have known . "
He was being carried to the cylinder , arms held firmly to his sides .
" I hope you can get to those damn guns , honey , or we 're screwed .
Strath 's already toast ; it 's not just heating his blood , it 's irradiating it , but it 's gonna lose it , too .
Monitor , mark and send message buoy recorder NOW .
Christ , outgassing , my ass .
This ship is fucking bleeding . "
There was a click as his left wrist locked against the cylinder .
He smiled dreamily , waiting for the reactor core to drink of him in its burning .
" Imagine that .
It 's bleeding . "
It 's the season for Graves Cracking : The 2006 Quest for Fear
“ The president reiterated his belief that we are open to ideas and eager to work with anyone who is willing to work with us regardless of party , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
“ He also made clear that bipartisanship should not be equated with an openness to lobbyists , loopholes and special interest carve outs and that he would be unwilling to negotiate on some key issues , and that he could not accept bad policy in pursuit of bipartisanship . ”
The legislation seeks to contain the risky practices that led to the financial collapse in 2008 and the worst recession since the Great Depression .
It would give the Federal Reserve oversight of the largest and most interconnected financial institutions , those with at least $ 50 billion in assets .
And it would let the Treasury secretary — with support from regulators and the approval of a panel of three bankruptcy judges — take over any company that posed systemic risk to financial stability , and essentially force the company out of business .
At a lengthy briefing at the White House , the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , said he was confident a bill would be approved .
“ This is going to be the most sweeping set of reforms we have contemplated , as a country , since those put in place after the Great Depression , ” he said .
“ We do not want to have the American taxpayer ever be in the position again where they ’re forced to choose between putting billions of dollars of taxpayers ’ money at risk or facing catastrophic collapse of the financial system . ”
Facing reporters outside the White House , Mr. McConnell repeated his assertion that the Senate bill would encourage bailouts by creating a $ 50 billion fund essentially to dismantle companies that are so big their failure would endanger the economy .
He demanded further negotiations .
“ My message to the president , quite simply , was , ‘ Let ’s get back to the table , ’ ” he said .
But Mr. McConnell also struggled to answer accusations that Republicans were doing the bidding of big banks .
Pressed by reporters to explain why major Wall Street companies were so strongly opposed to the legislation if it would guarantee future bailouts for them , Mr. McConnell did not answer directly but said that community banks in his home state of Kentucky also opposed the bill .
According to staff at a large Russian BitTorrent site , earlier this month their admin was lured to another country under false pretenses , held hostage by a criminal gang and beaten at gunpoint until he handed over the site 's domain name .
The plan was thwarted , but not before a ransom was paid by his family .
Attacks on torrent sites are a relatively common occurrence and hardly a week goes by without news of legal action of some kind or another .
One line of attack used by anti-piracy groups against The Pirate Bay , for example , has been to try to have its domain blocked by various ISPs .
In Italy , police recently went a step further by seizing the domain of a Pirate Bay proxy .
In Russia recently the whole process of taking a domain was streamlined , when the authorities simply took control of the Torrents .ru domain without any court rulings whatsoever .
Although some may label these type of actions against BitTorrent domains as “ evil ” , if news coming out of Russia today is to be believed , anti-torrent activities have just moved to a whole new level .
According to staff at Russian BitTorrent site LostFilm , on May 3rd their owner was lured to neighboring Ukraine under false pretenses .
There he had a 3 day ordeal at the hands of a criminal group who apparently had their eyes on some of his property .
The LostFilm.tv domain is close to breaking into the Top 100 sites in Russia and is one of the country ’s most popular sites for foreign movies .
It seems the criminal group wanted it pretty badly .
Reportedly kidnapped then beaten at gunpoint , the site ’s owner was ordered to transfer the domain to a third party .
The next day , May 4th , the domain transfer began and at the same time the kidnappers gained access to the site ’s servers .
But all did not go smoothly .
Instead of being able to take control of the domain in a single day as hoped , the transfer was delayed by its registrar – the process was going to take 5 to 10 days – so the kidnappers decided to move to plan B .
On May 5th , the gang contacted the admin ’s family in order to demand a ransom payment , on the understanding that the admin would go free and later transfer the domain to his kidnappers .
Later that day an amount was paid via electronic transfer .
The Lost Film owner was subsequently set free and staff at the site were able to block the kidnappers out of their servers .
Both are believed to be safe and well and the case has reportedly been handed over to the prosecutor ’s office in St. Petersburg .
There is little doubt that if true , this is a sensational story .
However , although the Russian press are n’t questioning it , there are those who believe it could be a PR stunt .
Lost
Film built up its reputation on the series Lost , and everyone knows what happened to that yesterday .
Just as the Awl Editorial Board has come around on Anthony Weiner ( D - New Yawk ) , and yes , we are pretty pro , after years of finding him unlovable , today perhaps the wingnut right has just now cemented our position : “ Law enforcement officials say a package with white powder was sent to Congressman Weiner ’s Queens office today .
A preliminary review shows the letter in part complained about the historic health care legislation passed by Congress this week , according to the source . ”
American terrorism !
I guess they had to go the extra mile because the letters calling him “ Shlomo ” were n’t enough , apparently .
( Hey , also , remember when the right wing talking point was always “ ALL MUSLIMS MUST LOUDLY RENOUNCE THE TERRORISM OF THE ( 40 or 50 TERRORIST ) MUSLIMS ? ” Anyone ?
Because … So …
You see …
Oh never mind . )
In early May , Morrison was promoting her book at the Borders on Michigan .
Dressed in a cream - colored suit , her light blond hair pulled back in a bun , she gave a 25 - minute lecture , then fielded questions and comments from the rapt capacity crowd .
" You say this is an international phenomenon , " said one woman with a heavy accent , " but to European people it is a very American problem .
I do not know any similar examples from my country , which is Belgium . "
I expected Morrison to offer the example of Marc Dutroux , the multiply murderous Belgian pedophile whose ongoing trial -- and the national political crisis it precipitated -- has been covered extensively by the Tribune , the New York Times , and CNN , among other news outlets .
Instead , Morrison answered , " Well , you 're kind of a tiny country .
But there has been somebody in the Netherlands -- which is close by -- who buried his victims , so it 's not unknown . "
It was little things like these that got me wondering whether Morrison really was , as the dust jacket of her book claims , " one of the country 's leading experts on serial killers . "
According to her curriculum vitae , Morrison , who 's 60 and lives in Chicago , is certified in general , child and adolescent , and forensic psychiatry and has a master 's degree in health law from Loyola University .
She maintains a private practice at the Evaluation Center , a clinic on Logan Boulevard that she founded in 1980 .
She 's appeared on numerous radio and television programs , commenting on such diverse topics as trends in the medical treatment of depression , the abduction of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart , and violent crime .
Since her memoir hit the shelves , she 's been even more visible :
On May 6 she kicked off an international publicity tour for the book with an appearance on the Today Show .
A week later she was interviewed at length on WTTW's Chicago Tonight .
Then she made the rounds of broadcast studios and bookstores in England , where one newspaper dubbed her the " real - life Clarice Starling . "
Her book , published by William Morrow / HarperCollins , is a featured selection of four book clubs , including the Book - of - the - Month Club .
Press coverage of the book launch has tended to focus on the disparity between Morrison 's poised femininity and her dark subject .
The media have also latched on to the admittedly arresting fact that she keeps John Wayne Gacy 's brain in a container of formaldehyde in the home she shares with her husband and two sons .
She acquired the brain in 1994 from the Will County coroner 's office , after presenting a letter from the Gacy family authorizing her to conduct independent research on the organ .
The tests she commissioned on it revealed nothing of note , but she says she 's holding on to it in the hope that advances in technology will oblige it to reveal something about the organic causes of serial murders .
" We 've been trying to get a live brain forever , " she told me , " but we 're not legally permitted to do that . "
( Her book is written in the first person and she works independently , though in interviews she uses what might be termed the " scientific we . " )
Nobody seems to have noticed that My Life Among the Serial Killers , coauthored by a hired gun named Harold Goldberg , is a really weird book : rambling , marred by misstatements of fact , confused , confusing , contradictory -- the sort of work one normally associates with self - publication .
The following paragraph from the first chapter reflects the caliber of the prose : " As a child living in a small town near Pittsburgh , I never knew my real parents .
It 's not that I did n't yearn to find out .
It just was n't part of the deal .
My parents were n't that kind .
Sure , six other children and I had a roof over our heads , and food , but when it came to the real security that love can provide , well , it simply was n't present .
It sometimes seemed that the reason six others and I were children to these people was due to factors not understood , even now .
Our lives as children were often unremittingly dark , and we were very alone in the world the parents defined . "
After rereading this a couple times I concluded that she was n't saying she was an orphan or a foster child , only that she was n't emotionally close to her parents .
The facts of Morrison 's childhood do n't seem crucial to understanding her work on serial homicide .
But this kind of sloppy writing is hard to engage with critically -- if you can't make out what 's being said you can't argue with it .
The problem is exacerbated by poor organization .
Morrison does n't go in for strong thesis statements or careful explication of terms .
I read her book several times , but did n't realize until I heard her say so on the Today Show that her definition of " serial killer " categorically excludes women ( other experts say women make up between 8 and 15 percent of the field ) .
On TV and in person Morrison is completely clear about this ; in print she makes the point only passively , by writing almost exclusively about men and not about women .
Another idiosyncratic distinction she left out of her book but emphasizes in person is that she uses " serial killer " only for killers with at least seven victims .
" The FBI says that you only have to kill three people to be considered a serial killer , " she told me .
" Ours is seven and above , because three people , if you 're in an urban area , can be almost any neighborhood .
But seven was a number that , in reviewing the history of serial killers across time , seemed to be a very low number . "
Morrison being so much clearer in person than in print , her public utterances are key to understanding her book .
The promotional materials put out by her publisher are likewise useful .
She writes that she 's devoted 25 years of careful research to the phenomenon of serial homicide and has profiled more than 80 serial killers worldwide .
In person she says she 's met 60 multiple murderers in the flesh and the other 20 - some are individuals she 's profiled from written sources .
All this experience , according to publicity for the book , has enabled her to dig " deeper into the psyches of killers than any profiler before her . "
Among her conclusions : all serial killers exhibit highly similar personality traits , have a genetic mutation that drives them to kill , share an interest in " experimentation , " are psychologically akin to babies , and are incapable of emotion .
" They do n't have rage , " she told Chicago Tonight 's Bob Sirott .
" They do n't have passion , they do n't have sadness , they do n't have happiness .
They 're hollow shells . "
Morrison is n't the first to say that only men can be serial killers .
Feminist antipornography crusaders have been making similar arguments since the early 80s .
But the feminists emphasize lust when describing the motives behind serial homicide .
Morrison speaks and writes as if serial murderers have no sex drives or instincts whatsoever .
One of the first killers she interviewed was Richard Macek , who raped and murdered four women in Illinois and Wisconsin in 1974 .
She notes that as a teenager he stole panties from neighborhood clotheslines and masturbated with them .
" Appearances notwithstanding , this was not a sexual act , " she writes .
" Rather , it had more to do with the still babylike Macek enjoying the touch , feel , and smell of the softer cotton fabric the crotch was made of , avoiding the coarser cotton in the rest of the panty .
. . .
You might well ask , well , why not touch or chew a T - shirt ?
A T - shirt just is n't as soft as panties . "
John Wayne Gacy , whom Morrison also interviewed , made identical use of his mother 's underpants as a young man , yet Morrison writes , " It was n't that the panties had sexual meaning to him .
He just liked the feeling of them in his hand and on his body . "
In custody Gacy told police that while working in a Las Vegas funeral home he once climbed into a coffin to hump its occupant .
" It 's important not to read too much into this act , " writes Morrison , " because Gacy was not a necrophiliac who commonly had sex with dead bodies .
What he did was a combination of experimentation with a body and something he saw as comfortable .
He wanted to lie down , and the coffin seemed to be the handiest thing available .
. . .
What Gacy did with the body had nothing to do with the power and control that is said to fuel the need for necrophilia .
And unlike necrophiles , who avoid relating to living people , Gacy had a full social life . "
Macek also had sex with corpses , but his necrophilia , she writes , " was not sexual , but . . . an effort to resolve his confusion about the line between life and death . "
Morrison goes to even greater lengths to acquit British murderer Frederick West of sexual aberration .
" Fred West , like John Gacy , may have exhibited signs of necrophilia , " she writes .
" But he was not a necrophiliac because , at its most basic , necrophilia refers to having sexual attraction to corpses , not having sex with them .
. . .
Nor was he purely a sexual sadist , because a sadist does n't always kill .
Did he hurt people ?
Yes .
Did he get sexual pleasure from hurting people , that same elation the average person gets from sex with a lover in the missionary position ?
No . "
Morrison disputes an unnamed psychiatrist 's claim that Missouri killer Robert Berdella got an erection while confessing his rape - murder crimes to police .
" If it happened , " she writes , " and I doubt it did , it was an excitement but not a sexual excitement . "
Describing the recently solved Green River killings , she notes that two of the victims had rocks inserted into their vaginas and wonders " whether this was done to weigh them down " in the water .
Pressed to clarify why an ostensibly sexual act is n't sexual when perpetrated by a serial killer , Morrison told me , " It 's a very concrete contact .
It 's a body contact , but it 's not a sexual contact .
A lot of people have tried to make these paraphilic offenders , and they 're not . "
But surely once genitals and penetration and emissions come into play , it 's sex .
" No , " she said .
" You 're talking about an act .
Whether somebody gets pleasure or whatever out of the act makes it more than just the act .
They look sexual to the average uninformed person , but to the serial killer it 's a way to be in contact .
Do you know what I mean ? "
I said I was n't 100 percent sure .
" I keep running up against this bias that it 's all sexually motivated , " she said , a bit forlornly .
One of the few female death - dealers mentioned in My Life Among the Serial Killers is Elizabeth Bathory , the 16th - century Hungarian countess who allegedly slaughtered 650 virgin peasant girls in order to bathe in their blood , a regimen she supposedly believed would preserve her youth .
Where academic historians tend to take the legend of the countess with several grains of salt , Morrison accepts it at face value .
" But Bathory was not a serial killer according to my definition , " she writes .
" I do n't believe her killings had anything to do with strange sexual preferences .
Nor were they combined with a deep aggression .
Her horrible actions were just something she believed she had to do to remain pretty .
Killing those virgins was the only way she felt she could make her belief a reality . "
Morrison 's reasoning here is hard to square with the rest of her work .
Given her blanket rejection of sex as a motive for serial murder , the assertion that the countess 's ritual slaughter of virgins did n't reflect " strange sexual preferences " logically favors her admittance to the club .
Bathory 's presumed lack of " deep aggression " likewise fits with Morrison 's characterization of the serial killer as a creature without emotion .
Moreover , if wanting to look attractive acquits Bathory of serial murder , the same standard should apply to Ed Gein , who , after all , hunted women only to sew their skins into a woman - suit in which to look pretty while dancing under the Wisconsin moon .
Where the feminist definition of serial homicide as a male sex crime serves a larger ideological critique of masculine sexuality , Morrison presents the nonexistence of female serial murderers as evidence that serial killers are born , not made .
If serial homicide were n't driven by genes , she explained on the Today Show , " you 'd have almost an even 50 - 50 or 60 - 40 mix of male - female " -- an argument that could also be used to prove the existence of a ham - radio gene or a skateboarding gene .
Her other reflections on genetics are equally baffling .
She writes , for example , that Macek and Gacy were in many ways alike : glib on the surface but angry underneath , " thick - bodied , with slumped postures and puffy faces like the Pillsbury Dough Boy . "
On the strength of these parallels she wonders " if they had some kind of genetic mutation that made them appear human . "
This is surely not the right way to look at the problem .
That Macek and Gacy were able to pass as human does n't really need to be accounted for , given that they had human parents .
What needs to be explained is why they did so much awful , violent stuff , and Morrison 's appeal to " mutation " and " crinkled genes " seems premature and inadequately supported .
The keystone of her genetic theory is the contention that all serial murderers have the same personality .
" It is as if someone took a cookie cutter from a kitchen drawer labeled ' serial murderer , ' " she writes .
" The baker stamps out the dough and puts them in the oven to bake .
When they 're done , they come out . . . ready to kill . "
But Morrison can never quite decide what shape the cookie cutter is , and the generalizations she throws out are of little help .
Some seem tautological : " Serial killers do n't make terrific husbands . "
Others come as a surprise : " No serial murderers are addicted to drugs , drink , or even smoking . "
Some are contradictory : in one place she writes that " serial murderers are always extremely well put together , whether they have a lot of money or not .
. . .
They 're highly presentable individuals who take care of themselves , " but elsewhere she states that " many of the serial murderers I have met are average men who are overweight and doughy . "
And after repeatedly emphasizing preternatural charm and guile as the hallmarks of the serial murderer , she presents one killer 's bungled escape attempt as proof " that serial murderers are not the scheming people they seem to be . "
One trait Morrison finds in every serial killer 's mental makeup is a passion for " experimentation . "
She writes that she acquired this insight when she asked Robert Berdella why he'd stuck his fingers in his victims ' eyes , injected them with Drano , and subjected them to electric shocks .
He told her these acts were " experiments , nothing more , nothing less . "
Her eyes opened to the concept , Morrison suddenly saw it everywhere : " Ed Gein experimented by wearing a suit made of skin , as did John Gacy by putting the heads of his victims under water to see if they 'd survive .
It was all coming together .
I could now say with assurance that at least some experimentation was part of every serial killer 's way of working . "
Morrison shies away from asking why the scientific investigations of serial killers consistently lead to the violation and death of other human beings rather than useful inventions like carbonation , digital photography , or 12 - tone music .
She does acknowledge that the experiments of serial murderers often lack the conceptual rigor of the best laboratory practice .
" Berdella was an experimenter , but unlike even the most amateur scientist , he conducted his experiments as rote actions only , " she writes .
" Berdella actually reminded me of another famous experimenter , H.H. Mudgett , who killed during the Chicago World 's Fair [ She doubtless means Herman W. Mudgett , who used the alias H.H. Holmes ] .
Both drew no thoughtful conclusions from what they did .
Certainly Berdella developed no theories based upon the confessed killing and mutilation and dismemberment of six men . "
Morrison complicates her genetic theory by stating that the mutation that drives the violence can't be transmitted from father to son .
I asked how she could know this , given that so little is known about the mutation .
She politely gave me to understand that we were speaking across the chasm that separates expert from layman .
" In the book I am not going to sit down and go through all of the scientific stuff to make it easier for somebody to understand , " she said .
" It 's not possible . "
When I pressed the point and assured her I was willing to apply myself , she said she would send me some of her scientific writings ( her resume lists numerous papers and articles , including some on violent crime ) .
I 've yet to receive them .
Another of Morrison 's core ideas is that serial murderers are all stuck at an infantile stage of emotional development .
She grounds this observation in the work of psychiatrist Melanie Klein , whose dark vision of infant psychology essentially likens the mentality of babies to that of paranoid psychotics .
The idea that serial killers never successfully negotiate " individuation " -- the process whereby an infant learns to recognize where his subjectivity ends and the rest of the world begins -- has some currency among forensic psychiatrists , but Morrison takes the analogy between butchers and babies in weirdly cheerful and innocent directions .
She compares Berdella 's prolonged sexual torture of his victims to " a curious baby boy playing with a toy " and " Charles Schulz 's Linus and his security blanket . "
She sees Michael Lee Lockhart 's habit of eviscerating young women in a similarly soft light : " Lockhart was compelled to feel and touch Jennifer 's warm blood and intestines .
. . .
He pulled at , touched , and examined what was inside of her , but not in any truly sexual way .
Also , when someone cuts open a human body , there 's a warmth that rushes up that has been described by some as appealing to serial murderers , who , as I 've said , have not progressed past infancy emotionally .
Lockhart wanted to see what was there , what it looked like , what it felt like , what it smelled like . "
The fact that Lockhart was " sleeping like a baby " in the backseat of a cab when police caught him also strikes Morrison as significant .
" When babies are colicky and wo n't settle down , " she notes , " the old remedy used to be to put them in a car and drive around until they calm . "
Given that Morrison is being promoted as an expert profiler of serial killers , her memoir is disappointingly light on examples of her ability to get " inside the mind " of a given villain prior to his capture .
The most detailed illustration of her forecasting skills is an account of her telephone conversation with " a high - level member " of the task force working to solve the Atlanta child murders of the early 80s , for which Wayne Williams was ultimately convicted .
" Dr. Morrison , " asks the investigator , " what did you make of the fact that this person down here has been throwing bodies into the river ? "
" We have seen that here in Chicago that John Wayne Gacy disposed of bodies in that way , " she answers .
" Would a killer stick to that pattern ? "
" Not necessarily .
He might very well vary it , and he could do that easily . "
" Interesting .
Because the pattern varies down here . "
That 's the end of the anecdote .
Scattered throughout Morrison 's book are complaints that she 's not taken seriously enough .
She writes that though she spent more than 400 hours interviewing Richard Macek , she " never received one acknowledgment " from the prosecutors and investigators working on the case .
In another instance a killer 's defense team declined to pay her for the time and effort she 'd invested in determining his " psychological state of mind during the murders . "
When she offered to help the leader of the task force assigned to catching the Green River killer , " the answer was as abrupt and brusque as it was startling : ' Not interested . ' "
Her testimony for the defense at the Gacy trial ( where she testified that Gacy would n't have been able to restrain himself from killing even " if the president of the United States was there with him at the time " ) was refuted by another psychiatrist , who , she writes , " rudely had said I did n't know what I was talking about . "
Approached by some Hollywood producers with " big ideas about a show about a profiler , " she cooperated on the understanding that she would be hired as a consultant .
" So I spoke with them for days , " she writes , " and they did the show , but I never heard from them again . "
Her ideas about implanting " deep brain electrodes " in imprisoned murderers so they can be continually monitored in the name of science fall flat when she proposes them to jurists and legislators : " Sometimes I 've received blank stares .
Sometimes I 've been laughed at . "
Candid as she is about herself , Morrison is even franker about other experts .
She condemns the testimony of Dr. James Cavanaugh at the Gacy trial as " highly inappropriate and outside his purview as a forensic clinician . "
Asked by prosecutor William Kunkle whether Gacy , if sent to a mental hospital , would stay there for the rest of his life , Cavanaugh answered , " Absolutely impossible . "
Morrison interprets this answer as reflecting an unrealistic belief that Gacy " could be somehow cured and readmitted to society . "
Cavanaugh - - director of the section on psychiatry and the law at Rush University Medical Center and the founder of Cavanaugh & Associates , a 20 - year - old consulting firm specializing in forensic psychiatry - - was unaware that Morrison had published a memoir , but found her take on his testimony at the Gacy trial mystifying .
" Kunkle was asking me whether it would be possible to put Gacy in a mental institution forever , " he told me .
" I was saying no , sooner or later he'd get out .
Helen is quite right in saying that we do n't know how to cure a personality as disordered as Gacy 's -- we have no therapy or medication for that whatsoever .
But in the absence of treatment a hospital would simply be warehousing him , and there 's no real legal basis for that .
Eventually he'd be released -- you just have to look at where the John Hinckley case is headed now .
There 's really no such thing as locking the door and throwing away the key . "
Asked about Morrison 's standing as an authority on serial homicide , Cavanaugh characterized her work as " simplistic " and " hyperbolic " and said , " It 's very hard to argue that all serial killers can be made to fit a single common category . "
He added , " I 've sort of lost touch with her .
Back in the 80s and early 90s she seemed pretty active , at least locally .
I think she got involved in some trials involving serial homicides , and she was definitely around doing things at conferences .
As for the last decade or so , I 'm really drawing a blank .
But the person you really should talk to is Robert Ressler .
He 's a real giant in the field .
He learned it from the ground up while establishing the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit out in Quantico , Virginia . "
Ressler , who retired from the FBI in 1990 , now heads a criminological consulting group called Forensic Behavioral Services and teaches at several universities in the U.S. and Europe .
A 20 - year veteran of the FBI , he started the bureau 's first research program on violent criminal offenders , which grew into the Behavioral Science Unit -- the group to which Clarice Starling is assigned in The Silence of the Lambs .
He and his colleagues at the BSU pioneered the practice of interviewing serial murderers to help capture those still on the loose .
Morrison takes a dim view of the BSU .
" Behavioral scientists do n't do the medical work that I do to discover what makes a serial killer commit murder after murder , " she writes .
" They 'll look at the external characteristics of the person , and sometimes they get into a false way of ' psychoanalyzing ' the serial murderer .
They come up with ideas like : he hates his mother and that 's why he murdered .
But the ideas have no basis in scientific research . "
Ressler reciprocated Morrison 's lack of enthusiasm .
" She 's inclined to make pretty expansive claims , " he told me .
" The problem is that the phenomena she 's talking about just do n't lend themselves to broad generalizations . "
He added that he was " astonished " by her claim to have interviewed 60 serial murderers .
" I 'd be very interested to see what sort of documentation she has to back it up .
I do n't keep a scorecard , but I 've been doing this work on a fully funded basis for 32 years , and I would estimate I 've spoken to perhaps 40 people who have killed multiply . "
Ressler also takes issue with Morrison 's definition of a serial killer as a man who 's killed at least seven people .
" The question of definitions is a major problem in this field , " he said .
" But the one I give in the Crime Classification Manual - - that 's a book sort of like the DSM of violent crime -- is pretty well accepted .
It 's a serial killing if there are more than three victims killed in more than three separate events taking place at more than three locations over a length of time .
And there has to be a cooling - off period involved .
It could be days or weeks or months , but the point is that the killer regains equilibrium in between killings .
Typically the perpetrator 's thinking processes are driven by fantasy , usually sexual .
The crimes are usually premeditated .
The killer likely does n't know who the next victim will be , but he has actions already rehearsed in his mind .
But none of these are absolutes .
It 's useless to impose too rigid a structure on crimes like these , because real life is always a lot messier than theory . "
Can women be serial killers ?
" If Helen 's saying that the men vastly outnumber the women she 's correct , " said Ressler .
" But by my definition female serial killers definitely exist .
Dorothea Puente in Sacramento , for example -- she killed at least 7 men and maybe 20 more so she could cash their pension checks . "
I read Ressler some of Morrison 's desexualized interpretations of seemingly sexual acts perpetrated by serial murderers and asked what he made of them .
" I could n't say what 's behind that , " he said .
" But the work I did at the BSU distinguishes between organized and unorganized serial killers , and the motivations of organized serial killers are basically sexual .
A lot of times even actions that are not overtly sexual -- the insertion of foreign objects into body cavities , for instance -- serve an underlying sexual purpose . "
Was it true , as Morrison writes , that " no serial murderers are addicted to drugs , drink , or even smoking ? "
" I just do n't understand why Helen feels the need to talk in absolutes like that , " said Ressler .
" If she means that drugs and alcohol do n't turn people into serial killers , she 's right , though I do n't know that anyone ever said they did .
But lots of them drink and use drugs .
Gacy 's drug of choice was weed , Henry Lee Lucas was a boozer , Jeffrey Dahmer had a serious drinking problem .
And I do n't know what tobacco has to do with anything , but I never saw Jeff Dahmer without a cigarette in his hand .
I told him once , ' Jeff , those things will give you cancer , ' and he said , ' Maybe that 'll be the end to my problems . ' "
Did Ed Gein keep his mother 's mummified body around the house ?
" What ?
No , you 're thinking of Psycho . "
In My Life Among the Serial Killers Morrison makes reference to personal encounters with just ten killers : John Wayne Gacy , Richard Macek , Ed Gein , Bobby Joe Long , Arthur Shawcross , Robert Berdella , Michael Lee Lockhart , Marcelo Costa de Andrade , Rosemary West , and Debra Brown .
Technically , according to Morrison 's rules , only four of these -- Gacy , Long , Shawcross , and de Andrade - - count as bona fide serial killers .
West and Brown do n't qualify because they were the female helpers of male murderers , and Gein , Lockhart , and Macek all fall short of the seven - victim mark .
Berdella , who was convicted of four murders but suspected of another three , could arguably be counted .
But even using the lower standards of the FBI to admit all 10 , that still leaves 50 killers unaccounted for .
Asked for a comprehensive list of the killers she 's met , Morrison demurred .
" I ca n't release it , " she said , " because I 've got some that are in current legal issues . "
She declined to be more specific .
( I asked Morrison 's editor , Mauro DiPreta , for help in verifying the claims made in her book , but he did n't reply to my questions . )
How many murder trials has she participated in ?
" Two , early on , " Morrison said .
" It was Gacy and Robert Joe Long in Florida .
And at that point I said , ' You know , this is turning into a conflict , ' and I was n't going to do it anymore .
The conflict is having to be both a researcher - scientist and someone who testifies . "
How about criminal investigations ?
" Officially ? " she said .
" None .
Unofficially ?
Many .
I make it a contingency of my working with law enforcement to be unofficial .
Otherwise it will interfere with what I 'm trying to do with these individuals .
I 'm not a prosecutor .
I 'm not an investigator .
I do n't put myself in any position of wanting to run around with a gun on my hip , which some forensic psychiatrists do . "
How many investigations has she unofficially been involved in and what form did her participation take ?
" About 15 or 20 , " she said .
" And that 's around the world .
I can go through a crime scene , walk the neighborhood , try to describe what I think the characteristics are .
It 's what I call a ' curbside consultation . ' "
What was the last case she was involved in ?
" It was down in Baton Rouge .
His name is Gillis -- he was arrested two weeks ago .
He killed at least eight , and there are others he 's suspected of .
I think he 's just been indicted , though I 'm not quite sure . "
Who 's the investigating officer involved in the arrest ?
" The detective ?
I do n't have the current person .
I do know a newspaper person down there who might be very helpful , Josh Noel of the Baton Rouge Advocate .
He and I have talked a couple of times in the past week .
I think there 's something in the paper today , as a matter of fact . "
It sounds like you 're working more closely with the press down there than the police , I said .
" As of right now I 'm talking to the press .
Two years ago I was talking to the investigating officer . "
How much of your paid practice consists of serial - homicide - related work ?
" None of it 's paid , " she said .
" I work with what are considered extremely difficult people - - opiate and cocaine addicts , housewives who might be addicted to Vicodin .
I work with severe to moderately retarded people who might be addicted to drugs or alcohol , or might have a dual diagnosis , meaning a psychiatric illness .
And I work with kids and adolescents .
So it 's a very varied kind of practice . "
But all of it is pretty distant from criminological matters .
" Gosh , yes , " she said , then laughed .
" I do n't think I 've testified in a criminal trial in maybe 15 years . "
According to Morrison , a lawman with " darkly animated " hands named Louis Tomaselli introduced her to the challenging work of profiling serial killers in 1977 .
In that year , according to her resume , she was three years out of medical school and completing a research fellowship in neurochemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison .
Tomaselli , she writes , approached her in a lecture hall , identified himself as a special agent with the FBI , and showed her gruesome photographs relating to an unsolved homicide .
" Tomaselli had come up against a seemingly insurmountable brick wall , " writes Morrison .
" He and the FBI could not find the perpetrator of the vile crime . "
The pictures were of a woman who'd been " brutally stabbed several times " and whose eyelids had been slit with a penknife .
Tomaselli asked Morrison if she 'd ever seen anything like it .
Morrison examined the slits .
" It almost looked like the kind of primitive , ritual cutting common to ancient cultures , " she writes .
" But it was clear this modern - day act had nothing to do with long - lost magical symbols .
. . .
I said no , I had n't ever seen anything like it .
No longer darkly exuberant , Tomaselli stopped talking and stood there , waiting for me to say more .
I looked him straight in the eye .
' But if you ever catch him , I 'd like to talk to him . ' "
Those words , she writes , were " exactly what he wanted to hear . "
When the perpetrator of the horrifying crime , Richard Macek , was finally caught , Tomaselli and his FBI colleagues came back to Morrison for help in getting " inside his mind . "
Specifically , she writes , " they wanted to use me as their agent to coax Macek into confessing to a crime in Illinois -- to the murder of a teenager named Sally Kandel . "
Toward this end , Morrison " picked up the phone and arranged for Dr. Roger McKinley , a reputable hypnotherapist , to put Macek into a trance . "
She writes that while he was hypnotized Macek was interrogated about an arson he committed , in the course of which he burned his hand .
While reliving his action in the trance , Macek screamed as if in pain , then developed blisters the size of dimes on his fingers .
Asked about this incident , Tomaselli , who 's retired and lives in Spring Green , Wisconsin , contradicted Morrison 's version of events on several key points , starting with his employment history .
" FBI ? " he said .
" Sure I 'm FBI -- full - blooded Italian .
Except my job was special agent for the Wisconsin Department of Justice .
I do n't know why people think the FBI has some special jurisdiction over serial murder .
I guess it 's from the movies and TV .
And the dead woman she 's talking about , Paula Cupit , was stabbed just once in the heart , not repeatedly , and she had a broken neck .
There was no mutilation of the eyes or ritual mumbo jumbo -- I can send you the crime - scene photos and the autopsy report to prove it . "
The documents he sent support his recollection .
" Helen Morrison is a fine lady - - do n't get me wrong , " Tomaselli continued , " but I do n't know where she 'd get the idea I approached her .
I 've got a pretty good memory , and the way I recall it is we wanted to hypnotize Richie Macek to see if that would get us a better recall of some crimes .
So we got Roger McKinley , who was the hypnotist we usually used - - a real good guy -- and he brought Helen along just as someone who was interested .
But there 's just no way she was officially involved in the investigation .
Besides ,
Helen 's got her timeline all screwed up .
She says she met me in 1977 , but Richie got locked up in 1975 , so no way could I have been showing her pictures of any unsolved homicide . "
Morrison writes that she ultimately succeeded in " breaking through Macek 's mind , " extracting from him a confession to the 1972 murder of Sally Kandel , for which another man , Richard Milone , was serving time .
When she reported the breakthrough to the authorities , she writes , " they acted as though it never happened , " a response she attributes to bureaucratic inertia and " pure ego , which pervaded everything from the prison system to the court system . "
Again , Tomaselli disputed Morrison 's version of events .
" If she got the confession for the Kandel slaying from Richie , it 's the first I heard of it , " he told me .
" As far as I know , I got that confession .
I developed a pretty good rapport with Richie .
He was a total con man , but he sort of respected me because I saw through his bull . "
What does Tomaselli make of Morrison 's claim to have spent more than 400 hours interviewing Macek ?
" If she continued to talk to Richie after we finished up - - once he'd pled guilty and had nothing left to offer -- that 'd be no surprise , " he said .
" Richie got bored easy and he had a flair for dramatics .
He had a life sentence plus 30 or 40 years , so he was never going to see daylight , and he probably knew he had her undivided attention .
He was real big on writing little notes to people -- I 've still got a bunch of them somewhere .
So he sends her a little note , and she comes hustling up to see him .
Why not ?
What else has he got to do ? "
Is Morrison regarded as an authority on serial murder in law - enforcement circles ?
" Not to my knowledge , " he said .
" I think in all my 37 years in homicide I would have heard something , but I never have . "
He added that he'd been involved in three serial murder cases .
" There was a guy named Ross Hemming up in Fond du Lac , another biter .
We only got him for one murder , but we knew he did some others .
I also interrogated Henry Lee Lucas . "
What about the incident Morrison describes in which Macek developed blisters while reliving a burn injury under hypnosis ?
" That did occur , " he said .
" I witnessed that . "
Graham 's article makes several observations about programming and programming languages .
Identify and state the two that you find most significant .
Explain ( in a couple of sentences ) why you find your chosen observations significant .
Identify three features of Lisp that Graham believes gave his company a competitive advantage .
At least two should be technical ( rather than social ) .
Describe the features and explain how they provided an advantage .
Paul Graham wrote the original software for setting up on - line stores that Yahoo ! currently uses .
He wrote it in Lisp , which is a close cousin to Scheme ( very similar syntax , constructs , and features ) .
Graham 's article , Beating the Averages , discusses why he believes Lisp gave his million - dollar startup a competitive advantage .
Read the article .
In another article , Graham provides a surface - level critique of Java .
Read the article .
In your own words , state three questions that Graham 's article teaches you to ask when approaching a new language .
Languages are everywhere once you get used to looking for them .
In general , a language is the repository of knowledge and goals that emerge from a domain of human activity .
Computer science is replete with such examples ( optimization problems led to OPL , database query optimization gave rise to SQL , scripting needs brought forth Awk and Perl , and so on ) .
But humans have done this for much longer than computers have been around .
Identify a non computer science ``language '' used for some activity by some subset of humans .
Explain the community of people and what they share .
Now , evaluate this language as you would a programming language by answering the following questions .
What are programs in this language ?
What are the data , the operations and the control ?
( make sure your chosen language has all of these characteristics --- if not , pick something else ! )
Briefly describe the language 's syntax ; use examples if you wish .
What " values " do programs in this language evaluate to ?
What is the corresponding notion of an interpreter for your language ?
Comment on whether or not this language might be amenable to computer processing ( you do not need to choose a language that can be machine - processed ) .
Example : Consider ( Western ) musical score .
The community is that of musicians , and the activity is capturing the music .
I wo n't bother elaborating on the data and control elements here ( but you should for the language you choose ) .
A sample ``interpreter '' is a pianist who ``runs '' the score on a piano ; the score 's ``value '' is the sound we hear .
Computer programs that read score and produce the music exist ( and can therefore be written ) .
Be creative .
You will either nail this or be lost .
It does n't take much to tell one from the other .
Do n't pick a human spoken language ( English , Esperanto , etc ) and do n't pick math or music -- the goal is for you to see language - like structures in the world around you .
Creativity counts .
In terms of write - up , a few paragraphs , at most a page , will suffice .
When asked about the new report on Monday , a propaganda official in Sichuan ’s capital , Chengdu , said “ it ’s ridiculous ” to suggest that the Chinese government might have played a role .
“ The Chinese government considers hacking a cancer to the whole society , ” said the official , Ye Lao .
Tensions have risen between China and the United States this year after a statement by Google in January that it and dozens of other companies had been the victims of computer intrusions coming from China .
The spy operation appears to be different from the Internet intruders identified by Google and from a surveillance ring known as Ghostnet , also believed to be operating from China , which the Canadian researchers identified in March of last year .
Ghostnet used computer servers based largely on the island of Hainan to steal documents from the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , and governments and corporations in more than 103 countries .
The Ghostnet investigation led the researchers to this second Internet spy operation , which is the subject of their new report , titled “ Shadows in the Cloud : An investigation Into Cyberespionage 2.0 . ”
The new report shows that the India - focused spy ring made extensive use of Internet services like Twitter , Google Groups , Blogspot , blog.com , Baidu Blogs and Yahoo !
Mail to automate the control of computers once they had been infected .
The Canadian researchers cooperated in their investigation with a volunteer group of security experts in the United States at the Shadowserver Foundation , which focuses on Internet criminal activity .
“ This would definitely rank in the sophisticated range , ” said Steven Adair , a security research with the group .
“ While we do n’t know exactly who ’s behind it , we know they selected their targets with great care . ”
By gaining access to the control servers used by the second cyber gang , the researchers observed the theft of a wide range of material , including classified documents from the Indian government and reports taken from Indian military analysts and corporations , as well as documents from agencies of the United Nations and other governments .
“ We snuck around behind the backs of the attackers and picked their pockets , ” said Ronald J. Deibert , a political scientist who is director of the Citizen Lab , a cybersecurity research group at the Munk School .
“ I ’ve not seen anything remotely close to the depth and the sensitivity of the documents that we ’ve recovered . ”
Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 : Fate Of Two Worlds
by Kevin [ Tuesday , 20th of April 2010 - 05:06 PM ]
Now , the battle between Wolverine and Ryu is more than enough to get my attention , especially considering the art aesthetic of the game .
What I find funny though is Chris Redfield attempting to stop the Incredible Hulk with a pistol .
Clearly , he 's not quite familiar with gamma - powered green - skinned behemoth .
EDIT : After investigating a little further with the images , I think we can deduce several other characters including : Dante from Devil may Cry , Frank from Dead Rising ( both on the right ) , Chun Li behind the Hulk , Doctor Doom and a Skrull on either side of Captain America in the upper left , and Felicia from Darkstalkers kneeling in front of them .

List of Dangerous Robberies :
Central Bank of Iraq ( 2003 ) Robbery
Saddam Hussain is reported to have robbed the Central Bank of Iraq taking US $ 1.00 billion in one day .
Just before the U.S. troops bombed Iraq in 2003 .
Moreover , this was also mostly recovered from the walls of his palace .
The banks General Manager also confirms another independent robbery by professionals .
Moreover , that amounted to US $ 250 million and 18 billion Iraqi dinars .
Saddam Husain is also said to have paid he son Qusay an amount of US$ 950 million through a handwritten note .
So , he transferred the money by trucks .
This amount was never recovered even after Qusay was killed by U.S. troops while fighting .
Therefore this is the biggest heist so far .
Kent Securities Depot ( 2006 ) Robbery
This robbery is also stated to be the largest cash hype in England .
First , that heist was well considered and planned .
Therefore , the depot manager was abducted when on the way home on 21st February .
Moreover , the robbers were disguised .
And shifted to a seeming police car .
He was also handcuffed and taken to an unknown farm .
Simultaneously , his eight - year - old son and his wife were made hostage in their house .
Therefore , the wife was tricked by a misstated accident and was shifted to the unknown farm also .
So , depot manager was now fully under pressure for his family security and was forced to cooperate .
Moreover , it was one of the most dangerous robberies .
And the whole family was taken to Securities Cash Management Ltd. Depot at Tonbridge , Kent , at 1.00 pm .
Moreover , they were allowed in .
And the thieves rounded up all the staff at gunpoint .
In addition to that , robbers took about an hour to complete the loot .
So , the alarm was raised later and the police unbound them all .
The heist totaled US$ 90 million , one of the most dangerous robberies , and nothing stands recovered yet .
The Boston Museum ( 1990 ) Robbery
The Boston Museum was deprived of some very unusual Art Treasures in 1990 .
The huge loss of the world - renowned , irreplaceable and valuable paintings was estimated over US $ 300 million .
Two unarmed robbers were dressed as policemen managed entry into the museum at 1.00 am .
On 18th March just after celebrations on St. Patrick ’s Day .
Security head could n’t explain this late hour entry .
The door guards were immediately over - powered , knocked down and handcuffed in the basement .
The robbers stayed for 1.5 hours collecting their booty of prized paintings .
Moreover , this included 3 Rembrandts and a Chinese Bronze Beaker .
They cut away the canvas cruelly from near the frames while hanging .
They stacked away “ Landscape with an Obelisk ” by Govaert Flinck and “ The Concert ” by Vermeer .
Besides these , they ripped 5 Degas sketches from the short gallery and a Manet Portrait from the Blue room .
They flew away from the Bronze Eagle that adorned the Napoleon flag mast .
If lives were involved then it would be also one of the most dangerous robberies because of their behavior .
These untidy robbers ransacked the museum wonders like Rembrandts only seascape “ Storm on the Galilee ” .
The painting was cut hastily leaving ragged edges of canvas that are intact in the empty hanging frames at the museum .
The small museum was not insured unfortunately and had to bear the loss .
The surveillance tape was also snatched away during the heist .
Nothing is known of any recovery made till date .
Knightsbridge Security Deposit ( 1987 ) Robbery
The security deposit is situated in Westminster in London .
Two prospective ‘ clients ’ entered the Knightsbridge Safe Deposit Center on 12th July to rent a safe deposit box .
As soon they entered the vault , they immediately subdued the manager at gunpoint along with the guards .
The shrewd thieves hung a sign outside the vault saying “ vault closed temporally ” and invited more of their accomplices .
They broke open the safe boxes and left with an estimated hoard of over US $ 70 million at the time .
They escaped quietly .
After some time one of the guards could free himself and raised the alarm .
The fingerprints led the investigators to an Italian Valerio Vicei .
The man who was arrested after surveillance along with his several accomplices on 12th August 1987 .
Banco Central in Brazil ( 2005 ) Burglary
The classical event had a big adventure element built - in .
Therefore , Banco Central has entrusted the control of the money supply .
They had accumulated a huge amount of used unsequel currency notes .
These were being segregated for recirculation and destruction .
The burglars planned it well .
They rented a house nearby and placed a sign of ‘ Landscaping Company selling Grass ” , to cover up their motives .
They dug a 250 feet tunnel to a place beneath the bank .
Van loads of mud were transported and nobody suspected anything because of their name displayed .
The 2.5 feet square tunnel was laid 13 feet deep and had its lighting system and was wood - lined .
Between 6 and 7 August weekend , the gang broke through ONE - meter thick steel / concrete wall to enter the bank vault .
This was a big messy affair as the total money weighed about 3.5 tons .
The total worth was reported at about US $ 70 million .
The police arrested 5 persons and recovered about $ 5.5 million .
These persons had helped dig the tunnel as well .
The mastermind was found shot dead on 22nd October .
So far only $ 7 million stands recovered while $ 63 million still remain at large .
Northern Bank ( 2004 ) Robbery
Belfast Headquarters was robbed off a huge amount in cash on 20th December .
The gang members went to the home of two bank officers disguised as policemen .
And held their families at gunpoint on Sunday evening .
The officials were instructed to report at the bank as usual .
And cooperate to save their families .
They did so and stayed busy after business hours admitting the gang members in .
So , it is also known as one of the most dangerous robberies because lives were involved .
The bank carried huge cash for ATMs and Christmas in store .
Soon the money was loaded in several vehicles including one ‘ Luton ’ van .
The gang left releasing the families also .
And the amount looted comprised of Ten million pounds of uncirculated bank notes along with some other currency notes .
Reportedly the Northern Ireland proficient group was suspected for the heist .
The British and Irish governments developed frictions over this one of the biggest cash robbery in British history .
Everything remained confused by politics and nothing was known of it .
Brinks Mat Warehouse ( 1983 ) Burglary
The burglary was a planned event and occurred at Heathrow Airport on 26 November 1983 .
Moreover , the gang entered the warehouse with the help of security guard Anthony Black .
He was related to the gangs ’ mastermind Brian Robinson .
The burglars were expecting booty of 3 million pounds .
But instead landed on Ten tonnes of gold bullion worth 26 million pounds .
They loaded the gold and fled away .
One of the gang had links with a genuine gold dealer in Bristol .
So , he melted the gold to recast it for sale .
Soon huge amounts of money passing through a Bristol bank were reported to the police .
Meanwhile , the Scotland Yard found the clue and Black confessed for having helped the raiders .
The main culprits were sentenced to 25 years jail and Black got 6 years .
In 1986 Nove was fined 700000 pounds with 14 years in jail , for conspiring and handling Brinks Mat gold .
Three tons of gold was never traced that had been sold .

And he was tracked down by Scotland Yard .
Dunbar Armored ( 1997 ) Robbery
The Dunbar Armored robbery in Los Angeles , California has rated the largest cash haul in the United States .
And it occurred on 13th September 1997 .
The amount involved was about US $ 19 million .
This proved to be an inside man ’s job .
Allen Pace who worked there as a safety inspector .
He planned and recruited 5 friends for the robbery .
He knew all the security measures .
And how he could avoid the cameras and so on .
That man and his accomplices entered on Friday night , using his keys .
He knew the vault would remain open due to huge money movements on Fridays .
All of them rushed to the vault .
And subdued the guards before they could raise the alarm .
The U - haul was waiting and in very little time the high denomination notes were loaded .
Pace knew the bags that contained the nonsequence notes .
He also snatched the security camera recording devices .
The police suspected staff involvement and also watched Pace .
The gang members were cautious in their spending .
However , one member gave a colleague a pack of bills in its original strap wrapping and was immediately tracked by police .
All the robbers were arrested and Pace was sentenced to 24 years jail .
Only about half of the total money was recovered .
Lufthansa ( 1978 ) Burglary
The Lufthansa burglary was a pre-planned one .
Moreover , the mastermind was Jimmy Burke .
And the idea was generated by Martin Krugman .
He had been tipped off by one Louis Werner , who owed Martin $ 20000 through gambling debt .
He told him that a huge amount of money is taken to West Germany for exchange .
And that it is stored at Kennedy Airport in cardboard vault .
Therefore a van was noticed parking near the vault by a guard on 11th December at 3 AM .
He was struck , disarmed and told to disarm the silent alarm , and handcuffed thereafter .
Another guard who heard noise was also overpowered and handcuffed .
They took hold of more employees at gunpoint and rounded up all the rest at the cafeteria to clear their operation .
The burglars then summoned Rudi Eirich by intercom on some emergency pretext .
He was the only one who knew the codes to open the double door vault .
At his first sight , they surrounded him with guns and let him see the bounded employees in the cafeteria .
They hurried him downstairs to open the vault .
Eirich was surprised to see the burglars knew the security systems and the precautions .
They did not let him open the vault second door until the outer door was closed to avoid the alarm .
As soon the vault was open they sorted the invoices to select the parcels that contained money .
During loading one burglar ’s mask slipped and showed his glimpse .
All the employees were warned that their families would be hurt if they told police anything .
The alarm was sounded at 4.30 AM .
The burglary was reported to be worth US $ 5 million in cash and $ 875000 in jewels .
The whole proceedings took one hour only .
No arrests were made .

Beyond the complete game drops that seem to be the result of a the game servers at Blizzard crashing , there still seems to be a high amount of in - game lag ( slow unit response / minor freezing / random drop screens / etc ) in Patch 13 .
I suspected this was the result of poorly implemented UDP networking code , so I wrote a program to test this theory .
By default , if SC2 detects you are able to send and receive UDP packets , it will default to the new UDP netcode in Patch 13 .
If your UDP is not usable , it reverts to TCP as in previous versions .
By blocking UDP , you can force Starcraft II to use the old TCP code .
After very early testing in a few 4v4s , this seems to have helped reduce the amount of in - game lag .
EDIT : Note that this wo n't magically fix all lag instantly , as other players in the game may still be using UDP .
See
Use at your own risk , etc. Requires Visual C++ 2008 runtimes .
Please post feedback whether this helps or not , it will be useful to know if this is actually the reason as I am not able to do enough testing by myself .

UPDATE ( May 26 ) : My Starcraft II no longer seems to be using UDP ( in very brief testing in FFA ) , so Blizzard may have disabled UDP use , rendering this program obsolete .

Because this does n't actually fix the problem .
It just forces the game to use the already existing TCP .
If Blizzard wanted to force TCP , they could have easily released a patch 13.1 to do that .
They do n't because they want to fix UDP .
To do that , they need people playing with UDP so they can see where the bugs are .
Shutting off UDP works against this .

Bnet sends the same information to everyone , just with different protocols .
If someone is using UDP it seems they have a higher risk of lagging , so the whole game will still stall when they lag for sync reasons .
So the benefit of using this in a 4 v4 is pretty low when there is still a chance 7 other players could lag , unless you 're on a team and have your allies using it too .

I 'm sure Blizzard has plenty of data to work with after four days of lagging games .
It 's not hard to spot the deficiencies in the protocol , releasing a patch and QA is what takes time , and a minor hotfix is still very costly since it requires bnet downtime and another gig of space on each players machine at the very minimum .
Although they can probably turn off UDP server side too thinking about it , that would be a pretty simple way to hotfix it .

In my February 8th post The Anti-Homosexuality Bill and the Silence of the Superstars I discussed the shocking ( but not so shocking ) silence of America ’s ‘ superstar ’ evangelists with regard the proposed Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill of 2009 .
In that post , I highlighted the amount of influence these tele - evangelists wield in Uganda :
Appeals from prominent Christian leaders all over the world to their Ugandan brethren to denounce the controversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill have largely fallen on deaf ears .
The problem might be that those Christian leaders , while they may be significant overseas , seem to carry very little weight in the minds of Ugandan Christians – especially among the Pentecostals ( whose influence extends right up to the First Lady of Uganda , whose own daughter is a pastor ) .
So forget Rick Warren .
Forget Archbishop Rowan Williams .
Forget the Pope . In Uganda the Superstar Men/ Women of ‘ God ’ are Joyce Meyer , Benny Hinn , Kenneth Copeland , Joel Osteen , T.D. Jakes , Creflo Dollar , Rod Parsely , Paul Crouch and other TBN ( Trinity Broadcasting Network ) regulars .
For over a decade these televangelists ’ programmes have been beaming straight into millions of Ugandan households on a daily basis through Lighthouse Television ( LTV ) , the local TBN affiliate .
Ugandans absolutely love these guys – especially Meyer and Hinn , whose Kampala crusades are always filled to capacity .
Joyce Meyer
There has been mounting pressure on Joyce Meyer and the other superstar televangelists over the last several months to speak out against this bill , and to use their influence and connections in Uganda to urge the Uganda ’s leaders , as well as their followers to show love and tolerance towards Uganda ’s gays and lesbians .
For a long time Joyce Meyer was reluctant to get involved in the fiasco but , finally , she has spoken out , thanks to an aggressive campaign initiated by Change.org , in which its members sent hundreds of e-mail petitions pressuring her to condemn the proposed legislation .
The petition read :
Dear Joyce and Dan Meyer ,
As you may know , Uganda is currently debating a bill known as The Anti-Homosexuality Act , which among other things , would create new laws in the country allowing the government to kill or imprison gays and lesbians , and imprison straight people who support gay rights .
I recognize that your ministry work rarely enters into political debates , but I also know that your work is heavily focused on humanitarian aid .
There can be perhaps no greater a humanitarian struggle than preventing the potential slaughter of thousands of innocent people .
In this regard , I urge you to use your voice — a voice which is very popular in Uganda , with millions of followers — and denounce Uganda ’s Anti-Homosexuality Bill .
Many other pastors , including Rev. Rick Warren , have denounced this bill .
Adding your voice to this list would only help protect and preserve human rights .
Please denounce this bill today .
Neutrality in the face of a potential genocide of people , regardless of their sexual orientation , ca n’t be tolerated .
Thank you for your time .
Joyce Meyer Ministries issued the following statement in response on Monday , April 12th , 2010 ( yesterday ) :
It is increasingly evident that the proposed " Anti-Homosexuality Bill " introduced in the Ugandan parliament is a profoundly offensive , dangerous and disturbing attack on the very foundation of individual liberties and human rights afforded not only to the good citizens of Uganda , but on the at - large global community .
If enacted , this hostile legislation will also further , and adversely , serve as a major setback in the global health efforts to combat Uganda ’s AIDS epidemic and reduce the record - high infection rates among the country ’s HIV population , an already at - risk community that could be further ostracized , threatened , and targeted as potential criminals .
Our missions and ministry message has always been to teach that the Word of God is about helping people – all people – learn that God loves them and has a purpose for their lives , not put guilt or condemnation on them .
As a global society , we do not have to agree , endorse or condone the lifestyle choices of others .
However , history has taught us that we equally cannot and should not excuse those who would hide behind religion or misuse God ’s word to justify bigotry and persecution .
With this statement , our motivation and intent is not to interfere with Uganda ’s political agenda or internal affairs .
As believers , however , we have a moral and ethical duty that compels us to speak out against injustice wherever it may be in the world .
Joyce Meyer Ministries
Bravo .
Will Benny
Hinn be next ?
Maybe not so soon , considering the troubles he ’s been encountering lately .
But hey , you never know .
Delaying mail and stealing mail are both federal offences in the US
Some 20,000 pieces of mail - many more than a decade old - have been recovered from a postman 's garage in the US city of Philadelphia .
Tubs of undelivered letters were discovered in April when the US Postal Service worker missed several days of work and managers visited his home .
The FBI said it took more than three postal vans to remove the mail , some of which dated back to 1997 .
Investigators are still trying to find the postman so they can question him .
Delaying mail and stealing mail are both federal offences in the US .
The missing mail is said to have included large numbers of cheques , bills and official letters .
Many have since been delivered to bewildered residents of Bustleton , a north - eastern suburb of Philadelphia .
" I got mail today from 2007 , " Kevin Carpenter told ABC News .
" Pay - cheques , things like that that I needed - stuff from the social security administration and the IRS . "
" I asked Dave [ the postman ] and Dave said he had n't seen it but as soon as he got it he'd call me , " Mr Carpenter added .
According to highly reliable Pitpass sources , F1's powers that be are seriously considering a switch to 1.5 litre powerplants in 2013 together with the return of turbochargers .
For many , the turbocharged era ( 1977 - 1988 ) was one of the greatest in the history of the sport , the ultra - fast machines , widely considered the most powerful open - wheel circuit racing cars in the history of motorsport , truly helping the sport to live up to its ' pinnacle of motorsport ' tag .
However , as the 1,100 bhp monsters looked set to raise lap speeds ever higher , assisted by the increasing influence of aerodynamics , the FIA first sought to limit the power before finally banning the turbochargers for 1989 .
Twenty - one years later , however , with an eye on environmental issues , the teams and engine manufacturers have been discussing the possibility of returning to the 1.5 litre formula complete with turbos , or " boosters " as some would have them known .
It 's believed that such a move would not only bring a number of ( currently hesitant ) sponsors on board , but could also lead to manufacturers entering the series , Audi being the first name that spring to mind .
When Virgin was linked with a buy - out of the Honda F1 team at the end of 2008 , it was the sport 's failure to genuinely deal with green issues , especially biofuels , that caused Richard Branson to get cold feet , though he subsequently bought into the Manor Grand Prix team .
Nonetheless , the Englishman has said that the sport must genuinely address environmental issues .
Our sources claim that one of the ideas currently on the table for 2013 is for 1.5 litre , straight - four , turbocharged engines , using half as much fuel as at present , but with as many KERS variables as possible .
Indeed , our source says that the current talk of the return of KERS in 2011 - initially rejected by the teams before a 180 degree turnaround - is " only half the story " .
However , while most are supporting of the idea , including manufacturers not currently in F1 , some , mainly Ferrari are not .
Contacted by Pitpass , one insider admitted : " A number of possible engine configurations are being looked at but all at a sensitive stage .
( There is a ) big push for current units to remain ( for cost reasons ) but the FIA is keen on a step change in technology . "
First introduced by Renault in 1977 , initially the systems were highly unreliable , the French manufacturer having to endure a year of failures before finally finishing a race .
In the years that followed , more and more teams tried the devices but it was in 1983 when , in the eyes of many , the turbo era truly began .
Trudy Boyle used to drive her son Jed before he passed his test A mother who drove her firefighter son to a fire station in Oxfordshire has been made an honorary crew member .
Trudy Boyle took her son Jed to the station for about a year and a half for call - outs , because he did not have a driving licence .
She has now been recognised for " outstanding nocturnal service to the community of Banbury " .
Mr Boyle , 20 , a retained part - time firefighter in Banbury , has now passed his driving test .
Ms Boyle , who lives a couple of miles away from the station , said : " Generally during the day he would go on his bike , but if I was home and at night time then I would do it .
" We used to get down there pretty quickly , but I would be in my dressing gown and pyjamas . "
Darran Gough , Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service Watch Manager in Banbury , said : " We would all like to thank Trudy very much for her help over the past years and wish her many undisturbed nights in the future , so long as Jed does n't slam the door as he responds ! "

After a lifetime ’s worth of literature from Philip K . Dick that explored the future , the farthest regions of space and the afterlife , a posthumous work will take readers to a different alien terrain : the inside of the author ’s mind .
Mr. Dick , who died in 1982 at 53 , was best known for existential science - fiction novels like “ The Man in the High Castle , ” “ The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ” and “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? ”
He also spent years wrestling with what he considered to be religious visions , which he began experiencing in the 1970s .
He recorded his reactions to and attempts at deciphering these spiritual visions in a work he called the “ Exegesis , ” reputed to be 8,000 pages — or longer .
Though few have read the work and fewer still have fully understood it , the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt plans to release “ The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick ” in two consolidated volumes edited by Jonathan Lethem and Pamela Jackson , a Philip K . Dick scholar , with the first to be released next year .
Mr. Lethem , the author of novels like “ Chronic City ” and “ The Fortress of Solitude , ” and who has written frequently on Mr. Dick , said Thursday in a telephone interview that he hesitated to describe the original , unedited “ Exegesis ” as a work .
An International Community to Build the New Future

Residents of NEOM will embody an international ethos and embrace a culture of exploration , risk - taking and diversity .
Its diverse population – from a mix of homelands , religions and backgrounds – will live and collaborate toward a common goal .
It will be home for people who dream big and want to be part of building a new model for sustainable living , working and prospering ..
Apple finally put out new MacBook Pros earlier this month , but the launch with Intel ’s latest processors has n’t come without a few problems .
PC Authority ’s hands on testing with the new 17 ” MacBook Pro found that the internal Core i7 topped out at around 100 degrees Celsius .
The computer review company found that when performing various benchmarks with the laptop , the processor generated so much heat that they had to stand the MacBook Pro on its side in order to complete their testing .
( as pictured above ) Testing in both Mac OS X and Windows cranked up the heat output to over 100 degrees .
The 2.66 GHz Core i7 620 M inside the laptop reached 84 degrees in the Dwarf Fortress graphics benchmark and 100 degrees in the Cinebench 3D rendering benchmark .
For comparison , they tested a Fujitsu Lifebook SH760 that used the same processor and found that it only reached a maximum of 80 degrees and kept cool to the touch thanks to its thicker plastic casing which allowed for greater airflow and a larger copper heat sink .
Engadget ’s own testing found that the new MacBook Pros were actually cooler than previous models in real world usage , so new owners should not worry too much .
They do recommend that Apple should consider sacrificing its low noise output when the CPU gets worked though , as it can get toasty at times .

" I remain convinced that in principle , video games can not be art .
Perhaps it is foolish of me to say ' never , ' because never , as Rick Wakeman informs us , is a long , long time .
Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form . "
- Roger Ebert
As someone who adamantly prefers to call themselves a " game critic " rather than a " game reviewer , " I 've been asked by several parties to make some counter - comment to film critic Roger Ebert 's recent post .
Presumably they were all hoping for some expletive - laden takedown of all Ebert 's arguments broken up by comparisons between the man and various historical dictators and farm animals .
But the thing is , I like Ebert .
I think he's an intelligent guy and well worth listening to , especially when he's got a particularly terrible film in his sights .
In my more egotistical moments , I might one day aspire to being his videogaming equivalent .
My immediate question is , is everyone really that bothered by his article ?
I do n't agree with Ebert 's position , but I respect it .
I would n't in a million years attempt to make him change his opinion , nor would I express any patronizing expectation to the effect of " oh , one day he 'll understand . "
I could say that his area of expertise is cinema and therefore his opinion on videogames is about as relevant as that of your grumpy aunt Hildy .
I mean , I do n't really watch or understand films much these days and thought
The Spirit was actually pretty fun , but people do n't come to me for film discussion , and you should n't go to a film critic for the last word on gaming .
If , say , John Carmack declared that games will never be art forever and always , maybe that 'd be worth getting stroppy about .
I could mention that Ebert 's entire position in his article seems to be based around watching footage of games on video , when the whole essence of games as an art form is the fact that they are an interactive medium .
He states that no game has yet reached the artistic level of the great filmmakers , painters , novelists , etc , and I would reply , no , they have n't , and good thing too .
Films and paintings and books are passive entertainments to be watched and read and looked at , while videogames are about making the audience the whole driving force of the experience .
What Ebert feels disqualifies games as art for me simply make them a whole new dimension of art .
I could concede that Ebert 's point that games are n't art because games are something you " win " would have held a lot more water in the old arcade days of Asteroids and Missile Command , but games nowadays are much more than just their gameplay mechanics .
The important part of Shadow Of The Colossus is not reaching the end credits , but the sheer myriad of experiences that lead up to it - the beauty of the environment , the bitter desperation of exploring it , the pains , the sorrows , the big hairy lads trying to shake you off their bald spots .
Perhaps " game " is the wrong word for what videogames have become .
I 've always felt the same thing about the term " moving picture ; " it seems rather quaint now that we 're not all diving under our seats in fear because we think a train is about to bust through the wall .
Related : Chemical that drags oil to ocean floor being mass produced in Sugarland , Texas
The chemicals BP is now relying on to break up the steady flow of leaking oil from deep below the Gulf of Mexico could create a new set of environmental problems .
Even if the materials , called dispersants , are effective , BP has already bought up more than a third of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s supply .
If the leak from 5,000 feet beneath the surface continues for weeks , or months , that stockpile could run out .
ADVERTISEMENT
On Thursday BP began using the chemical compounds to dissolve the crude oil , both on the surface and deep below , deploying an estimated 100,000 gallons .
Dispersing the oil is considered one of the best ways to protect birds and keep the slick from making landfall .
But the dispersants contain harmful toxins of their own and can concentrate leftover oil toxins in the water , where they can kill fish and migrate great distances .
The exact makeup of the dispersants is kept secret under competitive trade laws , but a worker safety sheet for one product , called Corexit , says it includes 2 - butoxyethanol , a compound associated with headaches , vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ There is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Richard Charter , a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for Marine Programs for Defenders of Wildlife and is chairman of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a trade off Ã¢â‚¬â€œ youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re damned if you do damned if you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t — of trying to minimize the damage coming to shore , but in so doing you may be more seriously damaging the ecosystem offshore .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
BP did not respond to requests for comment for this article .
Dispersants are mixtures of solvents , surfactants and other additives that break up the surface tension of an oil slick and make oil more soluble in water , according to a paper published by the National Academy of Sciences .
They are spread over or in the water in very low concentration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a single gallon may cover several acres .

Once they are dispersed , the tiny droplets of oil are more likely to sink or remain suspended in deep water rather than floating to the surface and collecting in a continuous slick .
Dispersed oil can spread quickly in three directions instead of two and is more easily dissipated by waves and turbulence that break it up further and help many of its most toxic hydrocarbons evaporate .
But the dispersed oil can also collect on the seabed , where it becomes food for microscopic organisms at the bottom of the food chain and eventually winds up in shellfish and other organisms .
The evaporation process can also concentrate the toxic compounds left behind , particularly oil - derived compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or PAHs .
According to a 2005 National Academy of Sciences report , the dispersants and the oil they leave behind can kill fish eggs .
A study of oil dispersal in Coos Bay , Ore. found that PAH accumulated in mussels , the AcademyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s paper noted .
Another study examining fish health after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 found that PAHs affected the developing hearts of Pacific herring and pink salmon embryos .
The research suggests the dispersal of the oil that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s leaking in the Gulf could affect the seafood industry there .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ One of the most difficult decisions that oil spill responders and natural resource managers face during a spill is evaluating the trade - offs associated with dispersant use , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said the Academy report , titled Oil Spill Dispersants , Efficacy and Effects .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ There is insufficient understanding of the fate of dispersed oil in aquatic ecosystems .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
A version of Corexit was widely used after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and , according to a literature review performed by the group the Alaska Community Action on Toxics , was later linked with health impacts in people including respiratory , nervous system , liver , kidney and blood disorders .
But the Academy report makes clear that the dispersants used today are less toxic than those used a decade ago .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ There is a certain amount of toxicity , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â said Robin Rorick , director of marine and security operations at the American Petroleum Institute .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We view dispersant use as a tool in a toolbox .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a function of conducting a net environmental benefit analysis and determining the best bang for your buck .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Charter , the marine expert , cautioned the dispersants should be carefully considered for the right reasons .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Right now there is a headlong rush to get this oil out of sight out of mind , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Charter said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ You can throw every resource we have at this spill .
You can call out the Marine Corps and the National Guard .
This is so big that it is unlikely that any amount of response is going to make much of a dent in the impacts .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going to be mostly watching it happen .

I ’ve yet to see another testing system for local web testing that I like as much as WebTest … which is perhaps personal bias for something I wrote , but then I do n’t have that same bias towards everything I ’ve written .
Many frameworks build in their own testing systems but I do n’t like the abstractions — they touch lots of internal things , or skip important steps of the request , or mock out things that do n’t need to be mocked out .
WSGI can make this testing easy .
There ’s also a hidden feature here : because WSGI is basically just describing HTTP , it can be a means of representing not just incoming HTTP requests , but also outgoing HTTP requests .
If you are running local tests against your application using WebTest , with just a little tweaking you can turn those tests into HTTP tests ( i.e. , actually connect to a socket ) .
But doing this is admittedly not obvious ; hence this post !
Here ’s what a basic WebTest test looks like :
from webtest import TestApp import json wsgi_app = acquire_wsgi_application_somehow ( ) app = TestApp( wsgi_app ) def test_login ( ) : resp = app.post ('/ login ' , dict ( username= ' guest ' , password= ' guest ' ) ) resp.mustcontain( ' login successful ') resp = resp.click ( ' home ' ) resp.mustcontain ( '< a href= " / profile " > guest</a >') #
Or with a little framework integration : assert resp.templatevars.get ( ' username ' ) == ' guest ' #
Or an API test : def test_user_query ( ) : resp = app.get ('/users.json ' ) assert ' guest ' in resp.json['userList '] user_info = dict( username='guest2 ' , password=' guest2 ' , name= ' Guest ' ) resp = app.post('/users.json ' , content_type='application/json ' , body=json.dumps(user_info ) assert resp.json == user_info
The app object is a wrapper around the WSGI application , and each of those methods runs a request and gets the response .
The response object is a WebOb response with several additional helpers for testing ( things like .click ( ) which finds a link in HTML and follows it , or . json which loads the body as JSON ) .
You do n’t have to be using a WSGI - centric framework like Pylons to use WebTest , it works fine with anything with a WSGI frontend , which is just about everything .
But the point of my post : you do n’t have to use it with a WSGI application at all .
Using WSGIProxy :
import os import urlparse if os.environ.get ( ' TEST_REMOTE ' ) : from wsgiproxy .exactproxy import proxy_exact_request wsgi_app = proxy_exact_request parsed = urlparse.urlsplit(os.environ [ ' TEST_REMOTE ' ] ) app = TestApp( proxy_exact_request , extra_environ={ ' wsgi.scheme ' : parsed.scheme , ' HTTP_HOST ' : parsed.netloc , ' SERVER_NAME ' : parsed.netloc} ) else : wsgi_app = acquire_wsgi_application_somehow ( ) app = TestApp( wsgi_app )
It ’s a little crude to control this with an environmental variable ( $ TEST_REMOTE ) , but it ’s an easy way to pass an option in when there ’s no better way ( and many test runners do n’t make options easy ) .
The extra_environ option puts in the host and scheme information into each request ( the default host WebTest puts in is http://localhost ) .
WSGIProxy lets you send a request to any host , kind of bypassing DNS , so SERVER_NAME is actually the server the request goes to , while HTTP_HOST is the value of the Host header .
Going over HTTP there are a couple features that wo n’t work .
For instance , you can pass information about your application back to the test code by putting values in environ [ ' paste.testing_variables ' ] ( which is how you ’d make resp.templatevars work in the first example ) .
It ’s also possible to use extra_environ to pass information into your application , for example to get your application to mock out user authentication ; this is fairly safe because in production no request can put those same special keys into the environment ( using custom HTTP headers means you must carefully filter requests in production ) .
But custom environ values wo n’t work over HTTP .
The thing that got me thinking about this is the work I ’m doing on Silver Lining , where I am taking apps and rearranging the code and modifying the database configuration ad setup to fit this deployment system .
It would be really nice having done that to be able to run some functional tests , and I really want to run them over HTTP .
If an application has tests using something like Selenium or Windmill that would also work great , but those tools can be a bit more challenging to work with and applications still need smaller tests anyway , so being able to reuse tests like these would be most useful .
Researchers from the University of Maryland have devised a new kind of random number generator that is cryptographically secure , inherently private and — most importantly — certified random by the laws of physics .
Randomness is important , particularly in the age of the Internet , because it guarantees security .
Valuable data and messages can be encrypted using long strings of random numbers to act as " keys " , which encode and decode the information .
Randomness implies unpredictability , so if the key is truly random , it 's next to impossible for an outsider to guess it ( see the Plus article Cracking codes for an example ) .
Physical contraptions like those used to draw lottery numbers can generate random number sequences , but they 're unsuitable in the electronic age , and of course they might be rigged .
Besides , there is a philosophical objection .
Since the macroscopic laws of physics are deterministic , someone with full knowledge of the initial set - up of the machine and the conditions in the room could in theory calculate the outcome of the draw .
It 's mostly a theoretical objection : the processes involved are what mathematicians call chaotic : even the smallest change in the initial set - up can dramatically change the outcome , making the calculation very difficult in practice .
But the objection nevertheless raises the question of how to generate true randomness .
Lottery machines are unsuitable for the electronic age .
For practical purposes , cryptographers typically employ mathematical algorithms called pseudo - random number generators ( PRNGs ) to approximate the ideal .
But the very fact that the number sequences are generated by an algorithm — a recipe — means that they are not truly random .
On a practical level , the sequences generated by PRNGs may look random , but there 's no guarantee that they are private .
You can never be entirely certain that there are n't underlying patterns that have escaped your attention , but can be guessed by an adversary .
What 's more , your PRNG may have been tampered with , so that it spits out sequences that pass all tests of randomness , but are known to your adversary .
Now , however , a team of experimentalists from the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland , in partnership with European quantum information scientists , has demonstrated a method of producing a certifiably random string of numbers with guaranteed privacy , based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .
They report their results in the 15 April 2010 issue of Nature .
" Classical physics simply does not permit genuine randomness in the strict sense , " says JQI Fellow Chris Monroe , who led the experimental team .
" That is , the outcome of any classical physical process can ultimately be determined with enough information about initial conditions .
Only quantum processes can be truly random — and even then , we must trust that the device is indeed quantum and has no remnant of classical physics in it . "
In quantum mechanics , the science of matter and energy on the smallest scales , specific properties of objects ( such as the position of an electron or the polarisation of a photon ) can be inherently uncertain .
Although the probability of any particular property can be calculated in advance , those properties take on particular values only when measured , and the values they do take on are intrinsically random .
So in theory , one could obtain a series of random numbers by performing a series of quantum measurements that are entirely independent of one another .
" Such a sequence would , of course , be intrinsically random , " says Dzmitry Matsukevich of JQI , a coauthor of the report in Nature .
" However , most people would probably prefer to buy an existing quantum device rather than build a quantum random number generator themselves .
Unfortunately in this case it is very difficult to ensure that the device produces a string of random numbers that is not known to anyone else .
For example , instead of a real quantum random number generator , someone might sell you a black box device that has a memory filled with random numbers loaded in advance .
This device would probably pass all existing tests of randomness .
But someone would still have a copy of all the numbers . "
There is , however , a procedure that guarantees the presence of truly random quantum measurements , generated only at — and completely unique to — a particular place and time , which might be termed private randomness .
It was invented by physicist John Bell in 1964 to test a central hypothesis of quantum mechanics : namely , that two objects such as photons or matter particles can enter an exotic condition called entanglement , in which their states become so utterly interdependent that if a measurement is performed to determine a property of one ( which will , of course , be a random value ) , the corresponding property of the other is instantly determined as well , even if the two objects are separated by distances so large that no information could possibly pass between them after the measurement is made on the first object .
The new random number generator .
See larger image .
Many scientists , notably including Albert Einstein , found that notion completely unacceptable , arguing instead that so - called " entangled " objects must actually possess some hidden variables which give the objects specific properties in advance of a measurement .
Otherwise , a purely local measurement of Object 1 would have an instantaneous effect on Object 2 , even if Object 2 was light - years away at the time of the measurement — a phenomenon Einstein dismissed as " spooky action at a distance . "
For 30 years , there was no convincing way of determining experimentally whether Einstein was right or wrong .
Then Bell came up with a revolutionary method that involved counting the correlations between measurements made on the two objects as the measuring devices were switched among numerous different orientations .
Bell showed mathematically that if the objects were not entangled , their correlations would have to be smaller than a certain value , a condition that is expressed by an inequality .
If they were entangled , however , the correlation rate could be higher , violating the inequality .
" Violation of a Bell inequality is possible only if the system obeys the laws of quantum mechanics , " Matsukevich says .
Therefore , if a system generates random numbers and at the same time allows you to verify a Bell inequality violation between isolated systems , you can be sure that real quantum processes are taking place , and that the randomness you generate is indeed private .
As the authors say in their paper in Nature , " The violation of a Bell inequality guarantees that the observed outputs are not predetermined and that they arise from entangled quantum systems that possess intrinsic randomness . "
The researchers performed more than 3,000 consecutive entanglement events in the course of about a month , confirming Bell inequality violation and in the process generating a string of private binary digits .
As a result , they write in Nature , " we can , for the first time , certify that new randomness is produced in an experiment without a detailed model of the device . "
That is , the process relies only on achieving entanglement and performing operations on the entangled objects , not on the specific details of how entanglement was achieved .
While various kinds of tests performed in recent decades on entangled systems have shown
Bell inequality violation , the JQI experiment was the first to do so with sufficient accuracy to give meaningful results for random number generation .
In their experiment the JQI group placed a single atom in each of two completely isolated enclosures spaced a metre apart .
They then proceeded to entangle the two atoms using a now - familiar method based on single photons travelling between the atoms .
Every time their apparatus signalled that entanglement had been achieved , the researchers rotated each atom on its axis according to a random schedule , and then took a measurement of each atom 's emitted light .
The value from each of the two atoms was then used to generate a binary number .
Using their observations to verify that Bell 's inequality had indeed been violated , the researchers were able to show that their output string could be transformed into 42 truly random and private numbers .
And while some randomness is required as input ( deciding on the rotation of each atom ) , this randomness comes relatively cheap : the method can produce far longer number sequences than the random seed that needs to be supplied .
At present , " the random bit generation rate is extremely slow , " said Monroe , " but we expect speedups by orders of magnitude in coming years as we more efficiently entangle the atoms , perhaps by using atom - like quantum systems embedded in a solid - state chip . "
Then by violating the Bell inequality over much larger distances , Monroe added that " such a system could be deployed for a more secure type of data encryption . "
From Burmese pythons to pygmy marmosets , there is a roaring illegal trade in animals online .
A recent convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species found one rare species – the Kaiser 's spotted newt ( an orange and black salamander in the highland streams of Iran ) – now numbers fewer than 1,000 adults in the wild because of internet trading .
So what can you find on the internet ?
In just one day , I discovered dealers who appear to be selling some of the rarest species on earth .
Within a few hours , I was staring at an advert for one of the world 's most endangered creatures .
It read , " Very superb , jumbo size and most of all very rare " .
Only 200 mature ploughshare tortoises survive in the bamboo scrublands of north Madagascar ; the rest , it seems , are online .
And what would this pair of 30 - year - old tortoises cost ?
£ 24,000 , and a trip to Kuala Lumpur : there 's no international shipping .
It is against the law to remove the critically endangered Burmese starred tortoise from the forests of Myanmar , but I easily found an apparent seller in Bangkok , Thailand .
The dealer 's picture features 35 turtles in a laundry basket lined with newspaper and wilted lettuce .
Ten years ago , a survey by the Wildlife Conservation Society found few specimens in the wild .
They did , however , find a tortoise trader in every village .
This seller was asking £ 320 in cash for each specimen .

One classified advert offered a " snake show " and " horse riding " along with Bosc 's monitor lizards ( £ 70 ) and ball pythons ( £ 75 ) .
International law requires that these African species come with permits from their country of origin – conservationists worry that few wild - caught Bosc 's survive to maturity in captivity and supplies are replenished from wild populations .
The ad does n't mention permits .

In 2008 , eBay banned the sale of ivory , finding it impossible to ensure trade was legal .
It 's still available online , however .
I called one dealer who seemed knowledgeable about the required permits ; the same can't be said of many online sellers .
Some nod to legality by claiming their ivory is antique ; others do n't bother .
On Craigslist I found an " Endangered Species Ivory Neclace " [ sic ] in California ( $ 120 ) .
The seller claims it's " circa 1980 " , but without a permit , there 's no way to tell .
Hawksbill turtle

In Japan , artisans began carving hawksbill shells – the only true source of tortoiseshell – in the 1700s , but banned import of the critically endangered sea turtle in 1993 .
I found what appeared to be a tortoiseshell item on eBay : a " Brand New Takayama Ex-Takahashi Chikudo Model Shamisen Bekko Bachi Plectrum " .
It 's a pic for a banjo - like Japanese instrument .
The seller in New York promised a " natural material " of premium grade .
Price $ 370 , will ship worldwide .

It takes the wool from five dead Tibetan antelope to make one shawl .
That means you could get about 30,000 luxury garments from the herd estimated to remain in north - western Tibet .
It 's illegal worldwide to sell the wool , but I found an online dealer in Kashmir claiming to sell shahtoosh shawls along with " fancy wicker baskets " .
Price unlisted .
In the wild , the radiated tortoise spends its days munching cactus in the bushlands of southern Madagascar .
" Sub zero " , a dealer in Prai , Malaysia , has two that are two - and - a - half years into a life that can last for 100 .
This pair could outlive the population as a whole : scientists have predicted it is headed for collapse in the next half century because of habitat loss and the wildlife trade .
Price £ 710 and £ 1,220 , although Sub zero is offering a " mega discount " .
Parrots and macaws
A Google search for pet birds turned up an eight - year old Tucuman Amazon ( £ 450 ) in Canada .
The seller claimed the bird is from the wild , which would make it illegal : after 20,000 Tucumans left Argentina in the 1980s to become pets , international trade in the species was banned in 1990 .
For the last few months I ’ve been beavering away on a fascinating project , that ’s now finally seen the light of day !
It ’s called CSSUtilities , and it ’s a specialized JavaScript library for querying CSS style sheets .
Perhaps the most unique thing about it is that can give you non-normalized properties information — in other words , you can get the colors and dimensions that apply to an element in the original unit they were specified with , rather than the normalized values you get from built - in query methods like getComputedStyle or even from the CSSStyleSheet interface .
There are scores of examples of this in all browsers , but to cite a few : Firefox normalizes most color values to RGB , when you might have originally defined them in hex or as color names ; Opera normalizes colors to 6 - digit hex ; Internet Explorer splits - up margin properties , so even though you may have defined a single shorthand , it will return separate values for each direction .
But when you ’re working with the CSSUtilities library , you get back exactly what was specified , and this makes it possible to work with dynamic styles in a way that was previously impossible — for example , when you ’re reading the width of an element you always get a value in px , but now you can get its width in em or % that you can then apply to a clone , giving it exactly the same scaling or resizing characteristics as the original .
Some of the other things it can do include : listing all the rules that apply to a specified element , telling you the properties it inherits , or the media they apply to , or the specificity of any selector .
It can tell you basically everything , about every rule in every style sheet .
I hope that many people will find it useful and that it spawns the development of some new and interesting applications and tools ; I ’ve made a few demos you can check - out at http://www.brothercake.com/scripts/cssutilities … perhaps they ’ll inspire you to try something !
And in fact you can already see CSSUtilities in the wild , because a pre-release version powers the CSS inspection interface in CodeBurner for Adobe AIR , Opera Widgets and Mac OS X Dashboard .
Their ability to extract and analyze style sheets , list their rules , and give you information about each one ’s properties and selectors — all of that functionality is powered by CSSUtilities , and it ’s the only thing that makes that possible —
There simply is n’t anything else available to unprivileged code that can do the same job .
The only reason Firebug can give you this information is because it can call on Firefox ’s dom-utilities class to tell it the rules that apply to the element you ’re inspecting , but of course that ’s only available in Firefox to privileged scripts like add - ons ( and it ’s still normalized data , not necessarily what the author originally specified ) .
One of the demos I made is a Live CSS Inspector , that lays - out rules in a similar format ; and it works in all browsers — even IE6 !

COLUMBUS , Ohio - One of Gov. Ted Strickland 's top cabinet officials lied under oath about a decision to scrub a criminal investigation at the governor 's mansion to save Strickland from political embarrassment , according to a state report released Thursday .
Just as damning for the Democratic governor , an honors work program for inmates that Strickland used at his home " veered off - course , " with prisoners smuggling tobacco and small weapons like razor blades and utility knives from the governor 's mansion into prison , according to the report from the Ohio Inspector General 's office .
Inspector General Tom Charles launched his probe in January after State Highway Patrol officials complained that Department of Public Safety Director Cathy Collins - Taylor had unnecessarily canceled a police sting at the governor 's residence .
The sting was planned after a prison official intercepted a letter from an inmate to his wife , asking her to drop off a " six pack " behind the mansion .
Patrol officials have said they thought they were investigating a drug deal , though they can not be sure .
The administration has said the " six pack " meant tobacco .
Collins - Taylor , a civilian who oversees the patrol , contended the sting jeopardized the governor 's safety .
But patrol officers accused her of obstructing a police investigation just to save her boss , Strickland , who is up for re-election this year and had appointed Collins - Taylor to her job months earlier .
" During sworn interviews with our office , Collins - Taylor did not tell the truth about her decision to shut down the operation , nor was she truthful about the timing of her decision , " the 48 - page report concludes .
The report also accuses patrol Lt. Joseph Mannion , Strickland 's top personal security officer , of lying under oath and says Patrol Superintendent Col .
David Dicken made unsubstantiated claims during the inspector general 's probe .
And , the report said , public safety officials " went to extraordinary lengths " to obstruct attempts by the inspector general to obtain records .
" Evidence . . . along with the interviews we conducted , showed that Collins - Taylor , Mannion , Dicken and others made unsupported accusations , " the report states .
The report , however , found no evidence that Strickland 's chief legal counsel Kent Markus and chief of staff John Haseley interfered .
The explosive report instantly became a political treasure trove for Republicans looking for dirt to unseat Strickland in November and a political nightmare for the governor 's campaign team , which spun into a tizzy on Thursday trying to contain the fallout .
Strickland issued a statement saying he stood by Collins - Taylor , Mannion and Dicken and added that he is still supportive of the inmate program , which has received some stepped - up security measures .
" I believe that the decisions in this case were made by people acting in good faith .
If decisions were made in order to protect me from some kind of embarrassment , that was unnecessary , " Strickland said .
Collins - Taylor was not available for comment .
She has hired well - known private Columbus attorney Charles " Rocky " Saxbe to represent her .
Saxbe was not available for comment , but The Plain Dealer obtained a letter dated April 9 that Saxbe wrote to assistant inspector general Craig Mayton .
In the seven - page letter , Saxbe explained why the planned Jan. 10 sting was sloppy police work , noting that patrol investigators still have no idea what they were investigating and cannot know about the possible safety risks to officers and the governor .
For those reasons , he concludes Collins - Taylor was right to cancel the sting .
" If the highway patrol formulates a plan that creates or involves unknown or unnecessary risks to high profile targets and individuals , the plan must be well conceived , " Saxbe wrote .
" If that does not occur , and it did not here , " Saxbe wrote , " it is the duty of its leadership to investigate , challenge and , if appropriate , modify the operation . "
Separately , Democrats have quietly questioned whether Inspector General Charles could have overseen a fair investigation on this matter .
Charles is a former highway patrol trooper .
His wife is a patrol captain and interviewed last fall for the superintendent job that ultimately went to Dicken .
And it's no secret that patrol leaders have had problems answering to Collins - Taylor and before her , Director Henry Guzman .
Several high - profile inspector general reports over the past year pitting the patrol against public safety have come down squarely on the side of the patrol .
Collins - Taylor in January responded to an earlier Charles investigation with a scathing letter questioning the integrity of that probe .
But earlier this month in an interview with The Plain Dealer , Strickland noted that he re-appointed Charles in 2007 , carrying him over from the previous Republican administration .
He said Charles could be impartial .
Meanwhile , Republicans on Thursday said the inspector general 's report validated their concerns .
In February , Ohio Senate President Bill Harris , an Ashland Republican , authorized Sen .
Tim Grendell , chair of the Senate 's judiciary committee , to use subpoena power to investigate the incident .
It was the first time since 1986 the senate had exercised such power .
" Despite the administration 's charge that the Senate has been political in asking legitimate questions surrounding this case , it appears that where we saw smoke , there was indeed a fire , " Harris said in a statement .
Grendell , a Chester Township Republican , said he will continue his hearings and is likely to soon subpoena Collins - Taylor , Dicken , Markus and others .
" What this report does is continue to confirm that politics is taking concern over public safety , " Grendell said .
The report , however , did not reach two key conclusions Republicans had hoped for : that drugs were at the center of that planned January sting and that Markus made the call to stop the investigation .
Grendell said both those items remain part of his focus .
Strickland is being challenged in November by former Republican Congressman John Kasich .
A Kasich spokesman on Thursday questioned why the governor , who prides himself on ethics , would publicly stand by Collins - Taylor who now is accused of lying under oath .
Plain Dealer Reporter Joe Guillen contributed to this report .
The inspector general found :
Political rather than safety concerns were behind Public Safety Director Cathy Collins - Taylor 's decision to cancel a Highway Patrol sting at the governor 's mansion designed to catch a woman trying to smuggle contraband to her husband , who was a prison inmate in a work program at the mansion .
After the canceled sting was made public , top public safety officials participated in a coverup in which they made false statements to the inspector general 's office and went to extraordinary lengths to block the agency 's access to records .
The honors work program for inmates veered out of control , with supervision so lax that inmates ran a tobacco - smuggling businesses from the mansion and freely walked outside its boundary to pick up contraband .
The inmates also had access to tools such as axes , chainsaws and knives with no accountability for them .

Android is fairly unique in the ways it allows multiple applications to run at the same time .
Developers coming from a different platform may find the way it operates surprising .
Understanding its behavior is important for designing applications that will work well and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the Android platform .
This article covers the reasons for Android 's multitasking design , its impact on how applications work , and how you can best take advantage of Android 's unique features .
Design considerations
Mobile devices have technical limitations and user experience requirements not present in desktop or web systems .
Here are the four key constraints we were working under as we designed Android 's multitasking :
We did not want to require that users close applications when " done " with them .
Such a usage pattern does not work well in a mobile environment , where usage tends to involve repeated brief contact with a wide variety of applications throughout the day .
Mobile devices do n't have the luxury of swap space , so have fairly hard limits on memory use .
Robert Love has a very good article covering the topic .
Application switching on a mobile device is extremely critical ; we target significantly less than 1 second to launch a new application .
This is especially important when the user is switching between a few applications , such as switching to look at a new SMS message while watching a video , and then returning to that video .
A noticeable wait in such situations will quickly make users hate you .
The available APIs must be sufficient for writing the built - in Google applications , as part of our " all applications are created equal " philosophy .
This means background music playback , data syncing , GPS navigation , and application downloading must be implemented with the same APIs that are available to third party developers .
The first two requirements highlight an interesting conflict .
We do n't want users to worry about closing their apps , but rather make it appear that all of the applications are always running .
At the same time , mobile devices have hard limits on memory use , so that a system will degrade or even start failing very quickly as it needs more RAM than is available ; a desktop computer , with swap , in contrast will simply start slowing down as it needs to page RAM to its swap space .
These competing constraints were a key motivation for Android 's design .
When does an application " stop " ?
A common misunderstanding about Android multitasking is the difference between a process and an application .
In Android these are not tightly coupled entities : applications may seem present to the user without an actual process currently running the app ; multiple applications may share processes , or one application may make use of multiple processes depending on its needs ; the process ( es ) of an application may be kept around by Android even when that application is not actively doing something .
The fact that you can see an application 's process " running " does not mean the application is running or doing anything .
It may simply be there because Android needed it at some point , and has decided that it would be best to keep it around in case it needs it again .
Likewise , you may leave an application for a little bit and return to it from where you left off , and during that time Android may have needed to get rid of the process for other things .
A key to how Android handles applications in this way is that processes do n't shut down cleanly .
When the user leaves an application , its process is kept around in the background , allowing it to continue working ( for example downloading web pages ) if needed , and come immediately to the foreground if the user returns to it .
If a device never runs out of memory , then Android will keep all of these processes around , truly leaving all applications " running " all of the time .
Of course , there is a limited amount of memory , and to accommodate this Android must decide when to get rid of processes that are not needed .
This leads to Android 's process lifecycle , the rules it uses to decide how important each process is and thus the next one that should be dropped .
These rules are based on both how important a process is for the user 's current experience , as well as how long it has been since the process was last needed by the user .
Once Android determines that it needs to remove a process , it does this brutally , simply force - killing it .
The kernel can then immediately reclaim all resources needed by the process , without relying on that application being well written and responsive to a polite request to exit .
Allowing the kernel to immediately reclaim application resources makes it a lot easier to avoid serious out of memory situations .
If a user later returns to an application that 's been killed , Android needs a way to re-launch it in the same state as it was last seen , to preserve the " all applications are running all of the time " experience .
This is done by keeping track of the parts of the application the user is aware of ( the Activities ) , and re-starting them with information about the last state they were seen in .
This last state is generated each time the user leaves that part of the application , not when it is killed , so that the kernel can later freely kill it without depending on the application to respond correctly at that point .
In some ways , Android 's process management can be seen as a form of swap space : application processes represent a certain amount of in - use memory ; when memory is low , some processes can be killed ( swapped out ) ; when those processes are needed again , they can be re-started from their last saved state ( swapped in ) .
Explicitly running in the background
So far , we have a way for applications to implicitly do work in the background , as long as the process does n't get killed by Android as part of its regular memory management .
This is fine for things like loading web pages in the background , but what about features with harder requirements ?
Background music playback , data synchronization , location tracking , alarm clocks , etc .
For these tasks , the application needs a way to tell Android " I would explicitly like to run at this point . "
There are two main facilities available to applications for this , represented by two kinds of components they can publish in their manifest : broadcast receivers and services .
Broadcast Receivers
A BroadcastReceiver allows an application to run , for a brief amount of time , in the background as a result of something else happening .
It can be used in many ways to build higher - level facilities : for example the AlarmManager allows an application to have a broadcast sent at a certain time in the future , and the Location Manager can send a broadcast when it detects interesting changes in location .
Because information about the receiver is part of an application 's manifest , Android can find and launch the application even if it is n't running ; of course if it already has its process available in the background , the broadcast can very efficiently be directly dispatched to it .
When handling a broadcast , the application is given a fixed set of time ( currently 10 seconds ) in which to do its work .
If it does n't complete in that time , the application is considered to be misbehaving , and its process immediately tossed into the background state to be killed for memory if needed .
Broadcast receivers are great for doing small pieces of work in response to an external stimulus , such as posting a notification to the user after being sent a new GPS location report .
They are very lightweight , since the application 's process only needs to be around while actively receiving the broadcast .
Because they are active for a deterministic amount of time , fairly strong guarantees can be made about not killing their process while running .
However they are not appropriate for anything of indeterminate length , such as networking .
Services
A Service allows an application to implement longer - running background operations .
There are actually a lot of other functions that services provide , but for the discussion here their fundamental purpose is for an application to say " hey I would like to continue running even while in the background , until I say I am done . "
An application controls when its service runs by explicitly starting and stopping the service .
While services do provide a rich client - server model , its use is optional .
Upon starting an application 's services , Android simply instantiates the component in the application 's process to provide its context .
How it is used after that is up to the application : it can put all of the needed code inside of the service itself without interacting with other parts of the application , make calls on other singleton objects shared with other parts of the app , directly retrieve the Service instance from elsewhere if needed , or run it in another process and do a full - blown RPC protocol if that is desired .
Process management for services is different than broadcast receivers , because an unbounded number of services can ask to be running for an unknown amount of time .
There may not be enough RAM to have all of the requesting services run , so as a result no strong guarantees are made about being able to keep them running .
If there is too little RAM , processes hosting services will be immediately killed like background processes are .
However , if appropriate , Android will remember that these services wish to remain running , and restart their process at a later time when more RAM is available .
For example , if the user goes to a web page that requires large amounts of RAM , Android may kill background service processes like sync until the browser 's memory needs go down .
Services can further negotiate this behavior by requesting they be considered " foreground . "
This places the service in a " please do n't kill " state , but requires that it include a notification to the user about it actively running .
This is useful for services such as background music playback or car navigation , which the user is actively aware of ; when you 're playing music and using the browser , you can always see the music - playing glyph in the status bar .
Android wo n't try to kill these services , but as a trade - off , ensures the user knows about them and is able to explicitly stop them when desired .
The value of generic components
Android 's generic broadcast receiver and service components allow developers to create a wide variety of efficient background operations , including things that were never originally considered .
In Android 1.0 they were used to implement nearly all of the background behavior that the built - in and proprietary Google apps provided :
Music playback runs in a service to allow it to continue operating after the user leaves the music application .
The alarm clock schedules a broadcast receiver with the alarm manager , to go off at the next set alarm time .
The calendar application likewise schedules an alarm to display or update its notification at the appropriate time for the next calendar event .
Background file download is implemented a service that runs when there are any downloads to process .
The e-mail application schedules an alarm to wake up a service at regular intervals that looks for and retrieves any new mail .
The Google applications maintain a service to receive push notifications from the network ; it in turn sends broadcasts to individual apps when it is told that they need to do things like synchronize contacts .
As the platform has evolved , these same basic components have been used to implement many of the major new developer features :

NOTE : On March 14th , I was the first blogger or journalist to report this story outside Israel .
Subsequently , an Israeli peace activist informed me that Anat Kamm ’s attorney and friends have asked others not to publicize her case .
In honor of that , I decided to take down this post as I did not wish to harm her defense .
I wrote to Kam ’s attorney , Avigdor Feldman , and asked him to confirm that he did not wish any public discussion of her case .
He has not replied .
For that reason , I have decided to repost this story with some amplifications and editing to reflect new information I ’ve learned .
* * *
We ’re going to be getting into deep territory tonight regarding Israeli military intelligence , the Shin Bet , and their ability to make a mockery of alleged Israeli democracy and freedom of the press .
An Israeli friend brought me word that Anat Kamm , an entertainment writer for the popular Israeli internet portal , Walla , was secretly arrested and imprisoned , after which she was placed under house arrest by Israeli authorities .
Needless to say , this is a highly unusual development .
In fact , I ca n’t remember the last time this happened to an Israel journalist .
I apologize that most of the material I ’ll be linking to is still in Hebrew and not yet translated .
If that situation changes I ’ll be adding English language links or sources .
Though Kam denies this , Israeli sources maintain she has been fingered by the Shin Bet as the source of a highly damaging 2008 Haaretz report that noted that a number of Palestinian militants who , the IDF claimed in separate media reports , were killed during firefights were actually assassinated in cold blood .
This of course would n’t be news since it has happened many times before .
What was news was that in 2006 the Supreme Court laid down specific and limited procedures under which targeted assassinations may be pursued .
Haaretz revealed that the IDF was ignoring the Supreme Court ’s ruling and essentially killing militants in cold - blood and covering up the fact .
It approved killings even if civilians were also likely to be killed .
It approved killing suspects who were not “ ticking - bombs , ” another contravention of the Supreme Court .
In fact , as recently as 2009 the IDF killed Palestinians under suspicious circumstances which Palestinians have labelled murder in cold blood , leading one to believe that targeted assassinations continue .
The Haaretz report , which presumably and inexplicably passed military censorship , displayed two IDF top - secret documents drawn up by the military senior command , which laid out the provisions for the killings and proved that they were ignoring the Supreme Court ruling .
A former intelligence agent , Jonathan Dahoah Halevi , working as a researcher for Dore Gold ’s Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs , examined the documents in detail attempting to trace the source .
While he did n’t specifically identify Kam , he did make clear that he believed the “ Deep Throat ” served in a position in military intelligence which allowed access to such documents .
Dahoah Halevi fed the story to ShalomLife , a Canadian Israeli news portal which published this rather sloppy right - wing slant on the Kam case .
Dahoah Halevi was the editor of Shalom Toronto , listed as a sponsor of ShalomLife .
The publisher of ShalomLife , Yossi Arbel , is also the publisher of Shalom Toronto .
Some speculate that it may be an attempt by the Jerusalem Center to smoke out an Israeli journalist who will break the gag order by reporting on a story previously reported outside Israel .
On a rather humorous personal note , the author of the ShalomLife article confuses this blog with an “ internet forum belonging to the Israeli left ” by misattributing a quotation from this post to such an entity :
Internet forums belonging to the Israeli left have expressed support for the leak by Anat Kam , and have called it “ a moral act ” and “ a civil duty ” .
One of the messages stated : “ We must fight for Israeli democracy even if Anat Kam cannot or will not do it herself , and even if the Israeli press cannot or does not want to do it itself . ”
There is one especially salient , disturbing passage in the ShalomLife story , which speculates on Kam ’s motives in leaking the documents :
It is safe to say that the leaker wished to advance a political agenda and arouse wider public criticism in Israel and the world towards the IDF ’s focused and deliberate policies against agents of terror .
First , it is convenient for an Israeli rightist to focus on Kamm ’s alleged political agenda and neglect that she undoubtedly had a moral and democratic agenda as well .
Second , since the author of the Jerusalem Affairs analysis was himself a former intelligence officer and because Gold is a Likud loyalist , we can safely assume that this reflects the Shin Bet ’s own views in the matter .
Which is all the more reason to fight this detention tooth and nail .
The far - right can natter all they wish about opposition to its policies being political , but the truth is that opposing targeted assassination and leaking material that documents violations of the law is a MORAL act and a the democratic duty of a citizen .
We must fight for Israeli democracy even if Anat Kamm cannot or will not do so herself .
And even if the Israeli press cannot or will not do so itself .
On that note , Haaretz , who used Kam ’s materials for its scoop , has so far written nothing about her predicament .
That seems to me an unfortunate editorial decision .
The Israeli sources who have written about this note that there is a military gag under preventing reporting not only about the alleged leak , but that Kamm was arrested at all .
I call this censorship of infinite regress .
Which may explain why Haaretz has been silent .
One hopes the Israeli press will find their voice and do their duty as journalists regardless of the strictures of the national security state .
Those who believe in Israeli democracy should explain how a citizen can disappear without a trace .
Is this China , where the government denies it even is detaining a troublesome dissident who has disappeared ?
Is this the face Israel wants the world to see ?
Does the security apparatus have the right to run roughshod over whatever civil liberties citizens retain ?
I should add that this is n’t quite as bad as China .
Some people now know what happened to Anat Kamm .
She is safe although under detention .
But other than that , there are a lot of what Don Rumsfeld was fond of calling , in that inimitable way he had with the English language , “ known unknowns . ”
Apparently , it took over a year , but they have finally closed in on Kamm as the culprit .
They have really put the fear of God into her .
As Israeli bloggers and activists have become aware of this incident and written about it publicly , associates of Kamm have approached them asking that they desist .
Each individual has to consult their conscience in situations like this .
But I personally can see no benefit to Israeli democracy or even Kamm herself by keeping silent .
Undoubtedly , intelligence agencies have threatened her with horrible punishments if she does n’t maintain absolute muteness .
As a 23 - year - old relatively unfamiliar with the school of hard knocks that is the Shin Bet or military intelligence ( where she presumably worked and which presumably investigated the leak ) , she ’s quaking in her boots .
Who could blame her ?
But I think that others need to have different priorities .
Even if Kamm does n’t want to , or ca n’t fight for herself we must do so ourselves .
And again , we do this for the sake of Israeli democracy .
We do this to attempt to draw red lines and prevent the intelligence services from crossing them .
For we know that the Israeli national security state puts little stock in the rights of its citizens –witness the trampling of the rights of those whose passports and identities were stolen by the Mossad in carrying out the Dubai assassination .
We must make common cause with those Israelis and human rights NGOs who fight against such outrages .
As such , a measure of thanks is due the Israel Democracy Institute and its ejournal , The Seventh Eye , which has featured fine reporting on this matter .
Sol Salbe has directed me to an excellent archive of linked online articles about Kam ’s situation .
Indymedia Israel also wrote up the story ( web page now taken down ) providing additional information .
Maariv published a highly allusive piece by Kam ’s apparent boss , which reminds me of samizdat of decades past , which satirized the political culture of authoritarian regimes through allegory , indirection and oblique allusion .
Here is the first sentence :
How can a journalist be detained for over a month and everyone stays silent ?
The journalists in Shoo - Shoo - land must be nonentities , otherwise it would be impossible to explain how in the past month not a single one of them wrote a single word on the journalist ’s detention .
Let ’s not forget that we ’re talking about the Only Democracy in the Middle East™ here .
And lest we forget how the Shin Bet has dealt in the past with similarly damaging incidents , we need only remind ourselves of the Kav 300 Affair .
I wonder why the spooks did not target Kamm sooner since she leaked the documents over a year ago .
Possibly , she was working on a current story they did n’t want to see the light of day and this prevented her from reporting it .
Or perhaps , the current political climate in which the far - right is running roughshod over the rights of peace and human rights activists with the approval of the government has emboldened the intelligence establishment to light out after practicing journalists .
It may also be possible that Kamm is part of a larger constellation and the investigation includes her , but goes beyond her as well .
We must fight back .
We must help Israeli democrats turn back this assault on freedom of the press , free speech , and democracy .
Shanghai , 16 - 18 April 2010
( This forecast will be regularly updated .
This entry : Sunday 18 April 2010 , 06:00hrs BST )
Quick Links :
----------------------------
SUMMARY : Practice 1 , 2 , 3 : Dry Qualifying : Dry Race : Rain expected
---------------------------
NOWCAST / FORECAST UPDATE : Sunday 06:00hrs BST : OK - here 's the final forecast and it's essentially edging back more definitively to the thrust of our forecasts leading - up to today : wet running .
It 's much as we'd expected from the Met Office 's Global Model , which held firm and was far more bullish on this , whilst some other models ( notably the GFS ) continued inter-run ' flipping ' right to the last and wanted to lessen the rain considerably .
As noted a couple of days ago , this one was always going to go to the wire , forecast - wise !
Rain is now falling quite extensively west of Shanghai and - albeit dry right now at the circuit - current trajectories should see wet weather affecting it within the next hour or so with moderate rainfall rates and the odd heavier burst possible .
It 's then all about the showery nature of things : will we see intermittently dry or drier spells during the event ?
As they 'll be doing on the pitwall - keep an eye on the local rainfall radar at https://www.nmc.gov.cn/publish/radar/shanghai.htm
Enjoy the race !
---------------------------
Compared to steamy , showery Sepang a fortnight ago , it 's a very different weather scenario forecast in Shanghai for the teams , drivers , spectators - and Eddie Jordan 's shirts , assuming he arrives there after flight delays courtesy of the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud .
Because one very noteworthy aspect - and a nod towards the conditions likely to prevail at various European races - will be the temperature .
After a decidely cool start on Friday morning , the race weekend will see these gradually rise by Sunday .
Nonetheless , with a range from possibly as low as 12 - 14C on Friday , peaking around 20 - 22C by Sunday , it 's a notably cooler prospect challenging the teams compared to Bahrain , Australia and Malaysia .
Indeed , it 's shaping - up to be a little below average for this time of year in Shanghai ( and worth noting the annual mean is 16C ) , but certainly presenting a much more comfortable working environment in the pitlane !
Whether it'll make tyre performance more comfortable for some teams is another matter altogether ... and it 's fascinating stuff .
It 's a car - v- car dynamic we 've yet to see , despite the rather cool but largely unrepresentative running experienced during winter testing .
During April , some 90 - 95 mm of rain typically falls across the district of Jiading , where the circuit is located to the NW of Shanghai centre .
The climate is classically sub-tropical maritime monsoon , but dry weather will prevail during most periods of track action .
Note I said ' most ' ...
.... because Race Day has a risk of some wet weather .
Broad model agreement , with very good continuity , offers dry weather across all the practice sessions and qualifying too ( McLaren and Ferrari radar - watchers will breath a collective sigh of relief ! ) .
Sunday , by contrast , has been subject to all manner of forecasting swings to - and - fro and will be a wholly different challenge .
It 's likely to be affected by some rain at times , although the finer hour - by - hour detail for the afternoon remains elusive .
The latest forecasts collectively emphasise a threat of showers at any stage of the race .
However , it 's by no means a ' done deal ' , if you are after a wet spectacle !
I expect the heaviest rain to arrive after the event finishes .
The GFS ( Global Forecast System ) model , produced by the USA 's NOAA , offers a snapshot of the inclement weather expected by Sunday early afternoon across eastern China .
The oranges and greens represent rainfall , with a front close to Shanghai ( arrowed , red ) clearing slowly east .
One model ( the USA 's GFS ) has tended to flip - flop the rainfall progression with sufficient variation to offer a very wet race on some previous runs , versus a more intermittently wet scenario on others .
It continues to do this with almost every run of the supercomputer , seemingly struggling to handle the position and phasing of rainfall .
The China Meteorological Administration 's medium - range mesoscale modelling ; UK Met Office 's Global Model ; Canada 's global model and forecast products from Taiwan and Korea all offer broad support for a threat of showers appearing during the day , but with varying degrees of forecast precipitation rate / accumulation and subtle differences in the areal spread and timing of wet weather .
Some bring it by the morning ; others only by late afternoon .
What a nuisance ...
The broad forecast theme is thus :
FRIDAY : I would n't be surprised if there 's some generally low visibility around beneath a weak inversion by daybreak .
Shanghai will lie beneath the ridge axis of an area of high pressure , drawing cool air off the Yellow Sea and some low - level moisture beneath dry , cold air aloft .
As the day develops , it will remain dry with hazy sunsine .
Comparatively cool ambient temperatures will be the most noteworthy feature however ( and feeling that way too , with low relative humidity ) ; perhaps up to around 16C given sufficient insolation by mid-afternoon ( and probably closer to 12C for Practice 1 ) .
Track temperature will clearly be rather low , too - perhaps 25 + C but certainly way , way below the values experienced at previous race weekends this season .
Breezy at times , in the E - SE flow .
SATURDAY :
The inversion is still fairly pronounced by dawn , so rather a murky , hazy start is likely again .
With the ridge axis just starting to topple eastwards and a more southerly component to the prevailing flow , this - combined with higher ( circa 14C ) Theta - W air - suggests not as chilly a morning .
Otherwise , it 's a continuation of the dry story this time around - so no repeat of Sepang 's memorable qualifying ' banana skins ' !
Pitwall radar screens should be redundant on Saturday afternoon .
Hazy sunshine should typify the scene at Shanghai ; some high and medium - level veils of cloud ( increasingly so later in the afternoon ) and warmer at around 20C air temperature .
Track temperature should readily recover to 25 + C or so in these conditions .
Wind predominantly SE and breezy at times .
SUNDAY : So here we go again then ... if the latest modelling becomes reality , it 's possible we 'll see brollies on the grid again but probably not , this time , as sunshades !
Showers will start to make eastward progress into parts of eastern China throughout the morning , turning to more persistent rain at times .
Model runs from various forecast organisations tend ( even at this rather late stage ) to disagree on the rainfall distribution , accumulation and timing of eastward clearance .
This rather poor continuity , both inter-run and between each model , has not been unusual .
Nonethless , the combined ensemble collectively affords only moderate precision for the precipitation aspect of Sunday 's forecast ( at best ) and I do stress this !
Crucially , for example , one model offers a dry window effectively throughout the race .
A real forecast headache , for sure .
It 'll go to the wire in terms of pinning this one down with higher confidence .
On balance though , the race does look likely to be rain affected at some stage , but just how wet ( or not ) might the prospects be ?
The teams will be very conscious of how much of the data assimilated through the dry practice and qualifying sessions could prove negated , come Sunday .
If the entire race runs dry ( which is not wholly impossible ) , they 'll be highly relieved .
All eyes to those radars again , come Sunday ...
A few brighter spells are possible but the largely overcast conditions will depress temperatures , with the circuit seeing 18 - 20C ambient .
Aided by higher dewpoint air , higher partial thickness aloft and a warmer southeasterly flow , it wo n't feel chilly - even with any leaden skies .
I doubt track temperatures will reach much above 25 - 28C beneath the fairly extensive cloud cover .
Rather breezy again ; winds from the south / SE .
More will follow !!

Throughout history they have been the eyes that are prized .
Frank Sinatra's were legendary , Paul Newman 's melted a million hearts while Cameron Diaz 's dazzle in modern Hollywood .
But how - and why - blue eyes arose has always been something of a genetic mystery .
Until now .
According to a team of researchers from Copenhagen University , a single mutation which arose as recently as 6-10,000 years ago was responsible for all the blue - eyed people alive on Earth today .
The team , whose research is published in the journal Human Genetics , identified a single mutation in a gene called OCA2 , which arose by chance somewhere around the northwest coasts of the Black Sea in one single individual , about 8,000 years ago .
The gene does not " make " blue in the iris ; rather , it turns off the mechanism which produces brown melanin pigment .
" Originally , we all had brown eyes , " says Dr Hans Eiberg , who led the team .
And most people still do .
The finding that a rare mutation , probably dispersed in the rapid wave of colonisation that followed the end of the last ice age , highlights one of the great mysteries of human evolution : the oddness of Europeans .
Those from Europe and the Near - East have many characteristics that set them apart from the rest of the human race .
Not only are Europeans far more likely to have blue eyes ( 95 per cent in some Scandinavian countries ) , they also have a far greater range of skin tones and hair colour than any other ethnic grouping .
Scroll down for more ...
It is only in Europe that you will find large numbers of blondes and redheads , brunettes , pale skins and olive skins , blueeyed and green - eyed people living together in the same communities .
Across the rest of the world people are almost uniformly darkhaired and dark - eyed .
Why this should be remains unknown , and in particular how such mutations can have arisen so quickly since Europe was colonised by Africans just a few tens of thousands of years ago .
One theory is that Europe 's cold weather and dark skies played a part .
Fair skin is better at making Vitamin D from the 8 per cent of the world 's population have blue eyes weak sunlight found in northern latitudes .

Another suggestion is that the strange skin , eye and hair colours seen in Europe are down to ancient interbreeding with the Neanderthals , who died out about 25,000 years ago .
Maybe the Neanderthals were blonde or red-haired and it is their genes which we have inherited .
The trouble with this theory is that there is no evidence , from the scraps of Neanderthal DNA that have been recovered from bones , that there was any substantial interbreeding between them and Homo sapiens at all .
Perhaps the most plausible theory is that blonde hair and blue eyes arose because of a mechanism called sex selection .
This is where males and females choose as their mates those who have one unusual physical characteristic , not necessarily associated with " fitness " per se but simply something unusual .
The gigantic ( and otherwise useless ) tail of the peacock is the best example .
Sex selection comes to the fore when there is a lot of competition for mates of one sex or the other .
The theory is that in Europe , where men had to spend weeks at a time out on the hunt , males were in very short supply .
In such societies , women who had flaxen locks stood a better chance of standing out and attracting the attention of the few men that would have been available for mating .
Even back then , the blue - eyed blonde was not only in demand , but also definitely would have had more fun .

Q. A friend of mine became upset when I used the phrase “ to call a spade a spade . ”
She says that it ’s a vicious racist term .
Is she right ?
Your friend is dead wrong , and it ’s a sign of our hypersensitive times that innocent words are often branded as offensive .
Quite bluntly , such a reaction is the product of ignorance .
If you go back to the earliest written version of the saying , you bump up against a Greek satirist named Lucian ( 2nd century A.D. ) .
To express the idea of speaking bluntly , of calling things what they are , he used the phrase ( in his language ) , “ to call a fig a fig and a boat a boat . ”
So where did the word spade come from ?
It ’s based on a mistranslation by the Dutch Renaissance scholar Desiderius Erasmus [ ca .
1466 - 1536 ] .
In Greek , is a shovel or spade , andis a boat , a skiff .
He chose the wrong word , and “ to call a spade a spade ” came into being .
In 1539 , John Tavener brought Erasmus ’ Latin version into English in his : “ Whiche call . . . a mattok nothing els but a mattok , and a spade a spade . ”
A mattock , by the way , is a digging tool with a flat blade set at right angles to the handle .
So Tavener was advancing the meaning of the proverb to show that even allied objects should be carefully distinguished .
After that , the saying was off and running , and it was used by dozens of writers , eventually dooming it to cliché status .
Spade , the offensive racist term referring to a black person , probably derived from the color of the ace of spades in a deck of cards , and it did n’t attain this meaning until 1928 .
So only someone who believes that Nostradamus was on top of his game would believe that a phrase in use for almost 2,000 years miraculously foretold an obnoxious slang term of the early 20th century .
The same is true of “ a coon ’s age . ”
It refers to the raccoon and the mistaken notion that it lives a very long time .
In fact , their maximum longevity is 7.2 years .
What does last is coonskin , as Davy Crockett and his cap will testify .
There is no racist origin in this phrase whatsoever .
Of course , stupid people have used animals as insults for ages , including dogs , but it ’s no reflection on this saying .
Finally , there ’s niggardly , a term that enraged vocabulary - deprived politicians in Washington a few years back .
It means “ in a parsimonious or frugal manner , ” and it comes from an Old Norse word meaning stingy .
The vile and ignominious N - word , rightly held in contempt by educated people , comes from a Latin word meaning black , and has absolutely nothing to do with the adjective niggard .
Twisted minds can take innocent words and images and turn them into an attack , but sometimes the fault is with the listener or reader who , through ignorance , interprets an innocent or unconnected word with verbal assault .
This is why I take Ludwig Wittgenstein ’s words to heart : “ The limits of my language are the limits of my world .
” May 17 , 2009
It has come to my attention that some British racist organizations have been using this article to justify their twisted practices .
They fool no one .
ANY word that is used as racist code can , and should be , considered offensive .
I remember white police officers in Chicago using the code wordto designate African - Americans , as in " the citizens are restless tonight . "
In any such case , intention vitiates an otherwise innocent word .

TAIPEI ( Taiwan News ) – The Cabinet on Thursday wrote the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women into domestic law .
All levels of government will have to take active measures in favor of gender equality and present regular reports about the abolition of discrimination .
The convention , which the United Nations passed in 1979 , emphasizes equal gender rights in the economic , social , cultural , civil and political fields .
Convention signatories have to draw up legislation and take concrete measures to end discrimination against women in employment , education , politics , law , economics and other domains .
The convention is not limited to member countries of the United Nations , making it possible for Taiwan to sign .
The procedure to adopt the document began during the administration of President Chen Shui-bian , reports said .
Each level of government will have to adhere to the convention ’s stipulations and make sure it works away all forms of discrimination .
Taiwan will also have to work with foreign and domestic non-governmental organizations , human rights groups and foreign governments to protect and advance gender rights .
The adoption of the convention also forces all levels of government to draw up budgets to implement the measures while leading to regular progress reports .
Existing regulations which clash with the convention have to be amended or removed within five years , reports said .
The refusal by China to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign and independent nation has prevented the country from joining the United Nations and other international bodies , but Taipei has adopted several U.N. documents related to human rights .
Android 2.1 + The Motorola Droid finally saw its official Android 2.1 update come this week .
And still you guys wish for more , especially when it comes to home screens , and how the Droid is still stuck with the same old three that we previously had .
Personally , this did not bother me , as I had previously loaded ROM ’s with five screens , and only ended up really using three of them at most .
Want to change that ?
Enter HelixLauncher , which we 'll show you how to use after the break .
After loading the update , I decided to cruise the forums and see what the pulse was like after the update , and see what kinds of problems people were running into to try and provide some assistance .
I came across the thread about HelixLauncher , and immediately was interested , so I hopped in the marketplace and downloaded it .
Once you hit the home button on your device , you will be prompted to select whether you wish to have HelixLauncher or Home ( default ) complete the operation .
If you wish to be prompted each time you can select one and leave the check mark unchecked , but in this case I wished to use HelixLauncher as the main so I selected the check mark to have it set as the default and then selected Helix from the options .
Now that it ’s set as your default home screen you can check out the options that it offers you to customize it to your liking .
Once on your home screen you will notice a couple immediate changes , for me on my Droid the first was the fact that it now had the Nexus One looking launcher , with the four squares on the bottom .
One of my favorite features is that on each side of this launcher , there are two slots for small icons , which show regardless of which screen is being used .
Another great feature is that the application allows you to have three , five , or even seven home screens , which is huge .
You may wonder what you can do with seven home screens , but trust me ; widgets will fill you right up !
An additional small touch they added was that when you press the launcher for the app drawer , it fills up the entire screen , instead of leaving the previously seen gap , which allows for viewing of another row of applications without having to scroll .
For anyone who feels that they have been slighted , or wished they were able to have more home screens , this free application from the marketplace is one that you would certainly be interested in checking out .
[ Market links : HelixLauncher | HelixLauncher2 ]
* Warning – HelixLauncher2 is intended for use with the Nexus One and while some users are reporting its ability to work with the Droid on 2.1 , others are having force close issues .
If you run into this , simply uninstall the application and then install HelixLauncher instead .

TUBAN , Indonesia ( Reuters Life ! ) -
In Indonesia , soil is not just a raw material for bricks and ceramics , it ’s also a snack that one family has been making for generations .
Tuban , in East Java Province , is the only village that produces “ ampo , ” a snack made from clean , gravel - free dark earth collected from nearby paddy fields .
Although there is no medical evidence , villagers believe the soil snacks are an effective pain - killer and pregnant women are encouraged to eat them as it is believed to refine the skin of the unborn baby .
There is no real recipe : makers of the snack use a wooden stick to pound the soil into a hard , solid mass .
Rolls of dirt are then scraped off the with a bamboo dagger , baked and smoked in large clay pot for half and hour and then they ’re ready to serve .
The better the quality of the soil , the better the taste of the snack , its creator , fifty - three year - old Rasima , says .
Rasima , who like many Indonesians only has one name , makes ampo everyday to sell at the local market , just like her ancestors .
She is the village ’s only ampo producer , and can earn up to $ 2 a day to supplement her family ’s income from farming .
“ The ampo-making has become a family tradition in the village and I do not know exactly when it started , ” she said .
“ All I know is that it was made by my great - grandmother and it was continued by my grandmother then my mother and now I continue to make it . ”
Rasima says her knack for finding good soil comes from her job as a field worker .
“ I work in the paddy fields of others , looking for banana and teak leaves , so my job is always in touch with nature , ” she says .
Fans say the soil snacks have a cool , creamy texture .
“ I think the taste is nice and I usually eat this .
It is nothing special , it feels cold in my stomach , ” said Siti Qomariyah , who has been eating the snacks since she was a child .
Mr Hwang defected after witnessing North Korea 's famine
South Korea says it has uncovered a plot to assassinate the most senior official ever to have defected from Communist North Korea .
Two North Koreans , said to have been posing as defectors themselves , have been arrested on suspicion of being on a mission to kill Hwang Jang - yop .
Mr Hwang , 87 , once a close confidant of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il , defected to the South in 1997 .
Pyongyang 's official government website had recently threatened him with death .
The alleged plot to kill Mr Hwang was uncovered when the two men , named by the Yonhap news agency as Kim and Tong , crossed into South Korea from Thailand earlier this year , posing as defectors themselves .
They were questioned by South Korean officials during the debriefing sessions that await all North Korean refugees who make it to Seoul .
A unnamed senior official at Seoul Central District Prosecutors '
Office told reporters they had said their orders were to " slit the betrayer 's throat " , the Associated Press news agency reports .
' Human scum '
Mr Hwang , who was once the secretary of the North Korean Workers '
Party , has said he left the country after witnessing the impact of disastrous economic policies which led to widespread famine in the 1990s .
He left close family members behind , many of whom are reported to have been sent to labour camps .
Mr Hwang lives under heavy police protection at an undisclosed location and has remained a harsh critic of Pyongyang .
He recently travelled to the United States to give a lecture , telling journalists that he has no regrets about his actions .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says it appears North Korea has never forgotten Mr Hwang 's betrayal .
Just two weeks ago its official government website threatened him with death and described him as a " traitor and human scum " .
But Mr Hwang was reported to have shrugged of the alleged threat when told of it on Wednesday .
" Why would you be alarmed by something like that ? " the Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying .
Where 's The Outrage Over The Gov't Brushing Mass Privacy Violations Under The Rug ?
from the what - a- joke dept
Indeed , by the time the House Judiciary Committee took up the question of reauthorization in early November , legislators of both parties were venting their frustration about the scant guidance they 'd gotten from the administration .
Behind closed doors , however , the administration was anything but silent .
Instead of openly opposing civil - liberties reforms that had been under consideration in the Senate , The New York Times reported in October , the Obama administration opted for a kind of political ventriloquist 's routine .
The Justice Department wrote a series of amendments diluting or stripping away the new protections , then laundered them through Republicans on the Judiciary Committee , who offered them up verbatim .
It 's worth taking a closer look at one such reform proposal -- again , predating the latest and most damning OIG report -- to get a sense of the disconnect between the administration 's public and private stances .
Some legislators had wanted to require the FBI to develop " minimization procedures " for NSLs , as they do when full - blown wiretaps are employed , to ensure that information about innocents is not circulated indiscriminately and that irrelevant records are ultimately discarded .
This would only bring NSLs in line with other Patriot provisions compelling production of business records , where minimization is already required , and in principle , the Justice Department is already on board with this plan :
As Inspector General Glenn Fine noted in his testimony before the Senate in September , the department 's NSL working group was already laboring to develop such procedures in response to the abuses documented in previous OIG reports -- but the working group had been dragging their heels for more than two years .
The task of blocking any legal requirement that the Justice Department pick up the pace fell to Rep. Dan Lungren , a Republican from California .
At a House markup session in November , Lungren offered up an amendment that would strip away the minimization mandate and even argued , bizarrely , that the very concept of " minimization " was inapplicable in the NSL context .
He was visibly confused when Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers , after making a point of praising Lungren 's " scrupulous study " of the issue , pointed out that the Justice Department itself had publicly accepted the need for such procedures .
" This is the first I had heard that the Justice Department was either considering it or had not raised any objections to this , " a visibly perplexed Lungren stammered , " because it was my understanding they felt this was an inappropriate transfer of a process that is used in the electronic surveillance arena . "
The talking points with which Lundgren had been supplied , it seems , had not been checked against the official assurances the department had been providing .

I have to admit that I 've been a bit in shock over Congress 's decision to simply renew the Patriot Act , recently , without asafeguard to protect against abuse .
That 's because just before all this happened , we wrote about how a report from the government found ( not for the first time ) that the FBI regularly abused its authority to get phone records it had no right to .
This went well beyond earlier reports of abusing National Security Letters .
In this case , the FBI did n't even bother with NSLs .
Instead , sometimes it would just use a post - it note .
On top of that , reports came out noting that just weeks before this report was released , the Obama administration issued a ruling with a blanket absolution for the FBI 's activities -- basically saying that if the President said it was okay , it was fine .
This is not how our government is supposed to work .
Julian Sanchez has a fantastic article that should be a must read , detailing how Obama went from being a candidate who insisted there would be " no more National Security Letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime " because " that is not who we are , and it is not what is necessary to defeat the terrorists , " to one who appears to have no problem regularly spying on citizens and covering it up .
President Bush was really bad with warrantless wiretapping and retroactive immunity for telcos -- and most people figured Obama would at least be marginally better on that issue .
But it 's really scary how the entirety of the federal government does n't seem to care much about these blatant privacy abuses -- and the public and the press has shrugged them off as well .
Given all the reports of abuses , and Obama 's campaign statements , you would think that at least the government would put in placekind of oversight and safeguards when the Patriot Act came up for renewal .
No such luck .
In fact , the administration appears to have worked with Republican Senators to make this possible .
I do n't think this is what people meant when they expected to see more " reaching across the aisle " from the President : Sanchez 's writeup goes into a lot more detail , but it 's a depressing look at today 's politics , media and the public as well .
Politicians from both parties first belatedly tried to " legalize " blatantly illegal spying on Americans , and then , when they had an immediate opportunity to put in place the most basic safeguards because " that is not who we are , " instead conspired with each other to renew the law and completely ignore the vast and blatant abuses of it .
When you wonder why so few people trust politicians , this is why .
Equally troubling is the fact that the story of the widespread spying basically disappeared after a week .
Sure , lots of people are focused on the buzz du jour ( healthcare , healthcare , healthcare ) , but how is it that everyone is just willing to forget that our own government has been spying on thousands of people in ways that flagrantly violate what the law clearly states ?

Washington , DC , April 12 , 2010
Last week the American Humanist Association ( AHA ) unveiled a new billboard in Moscow , Idaho , the latest of a series of billboards that have appeared in the in area since last year .
The new billboard features the familiar image of a U.S. quarter–but with one important revision : in place of the national motto , the coin reads “ In Good We Trust . ”
The AHA ’s website address also appears in bold letters to the right of the coin ’s image .
“ This billboard nicely sums up two of the main messages of the American Humanist Association , ” said Roy Speckhardt , executive director of the AHA .
“ First , that you do n’t have to believe in God to be good–in fact , humanists and other nontheists see being good as one of the most important of responsibilities in our one and only life .
Second , that church and state should remain separate for the benefit of us all . ”
Speckhardt argued that “ In Good We Trust ” is a more inclusive and appropriate sentiment than the “ In God We Trust ” motto , which runs afoul the First Amendment .
The display is the fifth such billboard that has gone up in the Moscow area , following billboards which have read , “ Do n’t Believe in God ?
You are Not Alone , ” “ Want a Better World ?
Prayer Not Required , ” “ Million are Good Without God ” and “ No God ? No Problem ! ”
All are part of an extensive advertising campaign to spread awareness about being good without God .
An image of the display can be found here : http://americanhumanist.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ingoodwetrust-sky.jpg .
“ Too many think that morality is the exclusive domain of the religious–we ’re here to prove that assumption wrong , ” said Speckhardt .
“ We also want to reach out to other nontheists to let them know there is a community out there for them . ”
The billboard will run on Highway 95 , just south of Moscow near the Sweet Avenue cross street , facing northbound traffic .
David Niose , president of the American Humanist Association , pointed out that the official national motto had an unsavory beginning .
“ The adoption of the ‘ In God We Trust ’ motto came at the height of the Cold War and McCarthyism in the 1950s , and it is unfortunate that we still cling to such religious rhetoric today .
E pluribus unum , the Latin phrase for ‘ out of many , one , ’ would be a much more appropriate motto .
It reflects the true character of American society and government . ”
The American Humanist Association billboard campaign is part of a larger effort to spread awareness about nontheism .
Other like - minded organizations such as the United Coalition of Reason have placed billboards in numerous cities across the country .
In addition , the AHA ran bus ads that read “ No God ? … No Problem ! ” in Washington , DC , New York , Chicago , Los Angeles and San Francisco during the 2009 winter holiday season .
The American Humanist Association ( www.americanhumanist.org) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists .
Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington , D.C. , its work is extended through more than 100 local chapters and affiliates across America .
Humanism is the idea that you can be good without a belief in God .
MOBILE ( Dow Jones Newswires ) , May 28 , 2010
BP will use a tube to try and siphon oil from the large leak a mile down in the Gulf of Mexico , and expects to have it in place within the next 24 hours , a company spokesman said .
If successful , the tube would contain one of the two remaining leaks spewing at least 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf since the burning and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig last month .
Engineers will attempt to thread the tube into piping coming out of the well and then bring the oil to the surface .
BP said that , for now , it does n't plan to deploy a so - called top hat containment device over the leak .
Earlier , Coast Guard Commandant Adm . Thad Allen , the U.S. government 's crisis commander , said at press briefing the top hat would be set in place Friday .
But the BP spokesman said there had been a miscommunication about the containment plan .
Friday 's work comes after an earlier attempt to contain the leak with a steel dome failed .
The spill resulted from the April 20 explosion and sinking , two days later , of Transocean Ltd. 's ( RIG ) Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which was finishing a well for BP .
Eleven members of the crew were killed by the blast , and the spill threatens the shore of several Gulf Coast states .
Allen said the next key step is to find a short - term means of stopping the leak as BP continues the longer process of drilling a relief well to permanently cap the flow .
Other options under consideration include a " junk shot , " whereby a variety of materials including tire pieces , knots of rope and other items would be sent down to plug the leak ; the installation of a valve to shut it ; or the installation of a new blowout preventer .
The original blowout device designed to shut the well had failed .
BP plans to be ready to attempt plugging up the well by the end of next week .
Allen said the nature of the spill threatening the Gulf shore has been changing , breaking up and becoming less centralized .
This makes the oil slick harder to contain , but means it 's coming to shore in smaller quantities or " subsets " of a larger spill , he said .
" It is separating into different patches of oil in which you have open water between , " he said .
" There is good and bad news in that . "
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , in conjunction with other federal agencies , is expected to decide on further use of chemical dispersants in deepwater later Friday , Allen said .
Around 476,000 gallons of dispersant have so far been deployed to break up the slick , and more than 217,000 gallons are available , the joint command in charge of spill recovery said Friday .
Earlier this week , EPA administrator Lisa Jackson said the environmental effects of using the dispersants were still under investigation , adding that the agency retained the right to halt use of the chemicals if the harm outweighs the environmental benefits .
Allen said dispersants have been tested as part of the spill response in deepwaters , something that has n't been done before .
The use of dispersants is a trade off between the toxicity of the chemicals offshore and the effects of the oil onshore , with federal officials needing a process in place to understand the environmental impact , Allen said .
" If we get approval to move ahead , we will consider continuous application of dispersants at the sub - sea level , " Allen said .

Situation and protests of urban workers and un­employed
During the restructuring of the 1980s and 1990s the urban proletariat of the state - owned factories - the gongren - was the focus of the restructuring and experienced massive layoffs after 1997 .
Before the reforms the differences between the gongren and the peasants and migrant workers were all too obvious .
A part of the gongren had a number of benefits , like a guaranteed work place and bet­ter health care , and were considered a strong pil­lar of the socialist regime .
But after the reforms , the urban proletariat became the losers :
The restructuring of the state combines led to de-quali­fication , wage cuts , precarity and the layoffs of millions of workers .
They staged a number of militant struggles , especially since 1997 , consid­ered by the party leaders and the government as the biggest threat to social stability .
They forced the regime to slow down the restructuring , but they were not able to stop it .
A big number of the new urban unemployed were forty years old and older , unable to step up the ladder in the new economic structures and simply ignored by the new / old class of Chinese and foreign world - market capitalist looking for young labor .
60 percent of factory workers laid - off in the 1980s and 1990s were women .
After being laid - off most of them had just precarious work .
The pauperization of these urban workers was the last strike against the " unhappy generation " .
During the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 - 1976 ) they had no school education or spent only a few years in school , they were harassed by the Red Guards ( or took part in the excesses themselves ) .
They were sent to the countryside , where they had to live in poverty and work hard .
After their return to the cities - sometimes after ten years and more - they were assigned to unskilled jobs in the com­bines since they had not learned anything before .
In the 1990s they were the first to be laid - off .
Now as old people they experience poverty and have to do precarious jobs .
Whereas there is a discussion inside and outside China about the migrant " peasant - workers " ( min­gong ) who to sell their labor power in factories , sweatshops , on construction sites , in restaurants or as domestic workers , the fate of the urban workers gets less attention .
A few years ago that was different .
Waves of worker unrest took place in certain areas - e.g. the " rust - belt " in the North - East - against layoffs , back wages , bad working conditions , corruption and the non-payment of compensations and social aid .
Miniature society
The majority of urban workers were employed by a danwei, 1 a work unit .
At the beginning of the re­forms , 42 percent of the industrial work force worked there .
They produced 75 percent of the in­dustrial output .
Other industrial workers were those in urban collectives , those with limited contracts in state - owned combines and those in rural industries ( Lee 2003 : 72 ) .
The danwei was not only an economic , but also a political and social organization .
After finishing school , the urban youth was assigned to a danwei , which secured a life - long workplace , social securi­ty and retirement ( the so called " Iron Rice - Bowl " ) .
After marriage , the danwei also organized apart­ments and dormitory accommodation for single men and women .
Because of the extensive regula­tion and control of workers ' lives the danwei were also called miniature society ( xiao shehui ) .
To the outside , the danwei functioned as an execu­tive organ of the state administration .
In the so­cialist planned economy the state decided central­ly about the production and the distribution of re­sources , and the danwei were not responsible for profits and losses , but just handed them over to the state which assigned necessary resources and labor power .
Internally the danwei made sure that everybody worked and thereby contributed to the socialist accumulation of capital .
Moreover , the danwei were units of state control over social processes .
Economic decisions were politically motivated , e.g. decisions about hiring and promoting workers or the training of cadres .
In co-operation with the danwei - level and regional institutions of the Communist Party , workers were trained , controlled and , if necessary , punished .
For the workers , the danwei was the structure of their social protection , but also the organ of control and regulation of their whole lives .
In comparison to other parts of the proletariat , especially the agricultural workers , the workers in the collectives and the urban precarious workers , the danwei - workers did well economically .
Their low wage was compensated by the social security .
But the danwei - workers , owners of an urban hukou , was not a homogeneous group .
Only a minority had the chance to get a full " Iron Rice - Bowl " , par­ticularly those in big danwei .
There was also a hier­archy of the workers inside the danwei , first of all between cadres and workers .
More differences were made between permanent , temporary and contract workers , between union members and non-union members , between men and women , between older workers with seniority and younger workers .
That way the number of those who could claim social benefits and a life - long job was limited , and these divisions were also the base of the wage hierarchy .
Crisis and new despotism
The crisis and following reforms since 1978 had different origins , and we can only get into it briefly .
The political and social transformations of the Cultural Revolution since the mid 1960s not only led to economic chaos , but also strength­ened the workers influence on company - level de­cisions .
The productivity of the danwei was low , because the workers refused to accept an intensifica­tion of work and generally harder working condi­tions .
After Mao's death in 1976 " pragmatists " and " technocrats " inside the Communist Party re­placed the previous leaders , who had come to power during the Cultural Revolution , and started to " modernize " the Chinese economy .
Their goal was to strengthen the position of the factory leaders and to weaken that of the workers in order to be able to increase productivity and to raise the general economic performance .
They wanted to make an economic and social leap forward and at the same time ensure and protect the dominance of the Communist Party .
But workers and peasants were also open for changes .
They wanted to get rid of poverty , end the social standstill and improve their living conditions .
2
The reforms started in the late 1970s in the coun­tryside and later moved to the cities .
They were initiated by peasants , too , who started distributing land from the People 's Commune to families .
The CP - regime saw a chance to undermine the rigidity of the working class in the countryside and in the cities .
Whereas everywhere in the countryside the private use of land by peasant families was intro­duced , in the cities different strategies were adopt­ed : development of a new private sector of special economic zones with foreign capital , restructuring and rationalizing of the old state industries , clos­ing or " privatization " of little and medium - size danwei , and preservation of big danwei in strategic sectors under state control .
The reforms were no shock - therapy and also did not follow a master plan , they were rather step - by - step and experimental measures , following the motto : " Crossing the river by feeling for stones " ( mozhe shitou guo he ) .
Economic , political and social principles were used depending on the circumstances .
A " two tracks " - system was adopt­ed to keep up the old structures while simultane­ously creating new ones that would later displace the old ones .
The crucial elements of the reforms were the strengthened authority of the local ad­ministration and companies , economic incentives to improve efficiency by leaving part of the profits to the companies , de-regulation of trade and strengthening of the market orientation , and above all the establishment of a new work regime , which no longer guaranteed life - long security ( social contracts , Iron Rice - Bowl ) and was built on contractual relationships between employees and employers , in other words : a commodification of labor power .
All measures were enforced step - by - step and in different paces .
Some were not started before China 's entry into WTO , and some of the reforms are not finished , yet .
From the workers ' standpoint , the reform of the urban industries was the establishment of a " new despotism " inside the plants ( Lee 2003 : 74 ) .
The strengthening of the factory directors and the un­dermining of the authority of party structures , unions and workers ' councils as well as the cut - down of the social guarantees opened the door for a " hire and fire " - capitalism with a new class of managers on top , recruited from the old cadre structures of the army , party and state administra­tion .
In the mid 1980s , there were already signs that the reforms could not be pushed through easily .
The process was rather stagnant , as resistance came not only from the workers but also from the danwei leaders who opposed the splitting , shrink­ing or fusion of their work units .
After 1997 , with the intensifying of industrial restructuring and re­dundancies , the number of conflicts increased de­spite the government propaganda machine that tried to make workers believe that the restructur­ing was in the best interest of all in the long run .
" Release " of the urban proletariat
Of course the reforms affected everyone , the urban prole­tariat inside and outside of the danwei as well as the newly independent peasants .
But here we are talking about the urban proletarians who worked in danwei .
Before the reforms they were consid­ered the elite of the working class and the back­bone of socialist China .
For the party , they were the " soldiers " of the state .
The reforms changed the perspective .
The former task of the regime , to provide for the urban proletariat , later became a " burden " .
The restructuring led to a " systematic erosion of labor interests , as it has been accompa­nied by severe measures against workers , includ­ing collective layoffs , deprivation of benefits , ruth­less labor rights abuses and brutal working condi­tions . "
( Chen : 237/8 ) .
Hassard reports , that in 1997 39 percent of all urban households had a loss of income .
This often meant misery , worries about health expenses , education costs and grocery bills ( Hassard : 157/8 ) .
Many urban proletarians experi­enced their layoffs as a social degradation to " newborn marginals " , felt " abandoned by society " and " excluded " .
( Solinger 2002 : 304 ; 2004 : 52 , 55 ) .
Contrary to the majority of the migrant workers , the urban workers were " downwardly mobile " ( Solinger 2004 : 58 ) .
Although the weakening and closure of danwei re­duced the state control over the lives of urban workers , that did not result in a bigger self - deter­mination of the people concerned .
Their lives were now ruled by the necessity to find at least a small income to survive .
Often they had to resort to different sources : state benefits , support of rela­tives , informal jobs ( again often through family members ) , flexible or " hidden " employment .
The only ray of hope was the apartment they got through the danwei where they could continue to live ( Lee 2007 : 130/1 ) .
3
The majority of laid - off workers were elderly , un-qualified and women .
Most of them found jobs in informal sectors like street - selling , as messen­gers , security guards , on construction sites and so on , without work contracts , benefits and regular working hours .
Often their bosses do not pay them their wages .
Some of these jobs were previ­ously only done by mingong , the rural migrants coming to the cities .
Often the urban workers can­not compete with the migrant workers who are younger , more mobile and used used to learn and use different skills .
They also have lower repro­duction costs , because their families still live in the countryside , so they can work for lower wages .
Moreover , many employers consider mi­grants as more assiduous and not spoiled .
Many laid - off workers from danwei had and have a hard time finding new ( dependable ) sources of income .
To avoid collective resistance , the government split the laid - off workers in different groups .
These were " official " categories , to which laid - off workers were assigned , one of which was the xia­gang4 ( literally : laid - off from the position , released from the position ) .
This xiagang - category had sev­eral sub- categories : the daigang ( literally : to wait for a position ) , people who rotated between em­ployment and non-employment ; the tingxin liuzhi , who kept their position but got no wage ; and the liangbuzhao who left their position with neither them nor the company trying to restore it .
There was also the group of xiagang who were registered at so - called reemployment centers but could not find a job :
They were finally registered as shiye , " unemployed " , and could get state unemployment benefits for two years .
Other groups of laid - off workers were the " inter­nal pensioners " ( neitui ) , workers who had only five to ten years until retirement .
They kept the connection to the danwei and got a part of their wage , depending on the financial situation of the danwei ; workers who got compensations ( mai duan gongling ) , the amount depending on the sector and the danwei , but had to organize their own pen­sion insurance and similar things afterwards ; and a group of female workers who resorted to an ex­tended maternity break , a method often used by women in the 1980s and the 1990s .
Just a few of the mentioned groups got state social benefits , others did not get anything .
Only the proper xia­gang were counted in official statistics and had a ( rather theoretical ) entitlement to get support finding a new employment and to social benefits , but this still depended on the financial situation of the danwei .
All in all , today the unemployment rate in the cities is estimated to be between ten to fifteen percent , but it is much higher in the cities of the rust - belt .
The state wanted to intercept the potential con­sequences of the layoffs , following the motto : " Make the channel before the water comes " ( Has­sard : 156 ) .
The " private " labor market was sup­posed to absorb many unemployed , and the reem­ployment programs were supposed to channel the xiagang into new jobs in the state and the private sector - neither did really happen .
Liquidation laws were not followed - due to corruption and embezzlement of company property by cadres and managers , and the laid - off workers could not find new jobs because of their lack of education , age and gender .
The funds provided were too small or simply embezzled , and there were not enough jobs available for the xiagang .
Sometimes the laid - off workers did not get the required documents ( xiagangzheng ) , so they could not claim their benefits .
At the end of the 1990s , the government intro­duced the " three guarantees " for making up for the omitted danwei- services and benefits : " subsis­tence payments " for the xiagang ( only until 2002 ) , " unemployment benefits " for all unemployed in­cluding those whose danwei declared bankruptcy or was taken over by another company , and a " minimal living cost guarantee " of the local ad­ministration for the urban poor .
Payments re­quired advance public controls of the personal in­come , something a lot of people did not want .
In the end , those forms were ineffective and only a few people got the benefits .
Only a small fraction of the laid - off workers got compensation pay­ments or benefits at all , and those benefits were small and only paid for a short period .
The regime 's long - term goal was to establish an insurance system with four columns : retirement , health care , work accidents and unemployment .
But the replacement of the danwei - based social se­curity system through one financed by public and private funds was getting of the ground very slowly , despite the implementation some kind of retirement and unemployment insurances in the mid-1980s .
The whole procedure reminds one rather of the motto : " Draining the water before the tunnel is ready " ( Cai 2002 : 329 ) .
Preparation and development of struggles
The loss of material resources and social security constitutes a break of the old " social contract " be­tween the urban working class and the Commu­nist Party and led to a crisis of the CP 's legitimacy .
Since the 1990s the regime was trying to find a new basis for legitimacy , which they found in the new ( old ) urban middle class and the capitalist cadres .
For many urban workers unrest seemed the only option .
Even before the reforms , urban workers were not as tame and silent , as one could as­sume considering the strict organization and so­cial control of the danwei ( see Sheehan ) .
In 1984 , when the reformers turned towards urban indus­try , workers had big expectations .
They wanted a clear improvement of their situation but were afraid of a return to the conditions before 1949 with precarious jobs and unemployment .
Most of the workers were not against the reforms , they considered them necessary in order to end the standstill and get rid of poverty .
But they turned against corruption which followed the reforms - as in the " democracy " movements 1978 until 1981 and then 1989 - , against injustice during the exe­cution of the reforms , against growing inequality and the new material hardships .
While the regime and the party saw the " Iron Rice - Bowl " as the ori­gin of the problems , for the workers it was the only achievement of socialism which was worth defending .
Although in the beginning the new labor con­tract law from 1985 / 6 did only affect few workers , some kind of " job security panic " broke out ( Shee­han : 207 ) .
The feeling of insecurity , the corruption , the new power of the factory directors , the loss of forms of worker participation - which did not work well before either - and the inflation were reasons for a lot of workers to support the " democracy " movement in 1989 .
A lot of them had participated in protests earlier , and in spring and summer 1989 some founded independent workers organizations , not only to represent their interests in the companies but also to become active on the political level later on .
The protests in the 1990s , especially after 1997 , were a continuation of these movements .
At the beginning , most workers were " quiescent , passive , and powerless " ( Chen : 238 ) .
Although the number of social struggles increased between 1992 and 1997 , in the years 1995 and 1996 , at the beginning of this new phase of industrial restructuring , not much happened because the workers hoped it would not affect them and the problems were tem­porary .
But the occasional suffering lead to con­stant pain .
Since 1997 the number of social con­flicts has increased continuously .
There were pri­marily three different kinds of resistance : 1 . Strug­gles against the non-payment of wages and pen­sions ; 2 . Community - struggles against bad accom­modation and disintegrating infrastructure ; 3 . Protests against bankruptcies and connected compensation payments , illegal sales or restructuring of state - owned companies and corruption of cadres .
Most of the time these protests followed the same pattern :
First , the workers went directly to the responsible danwei - leader or local authorities and made their demands .
Usually they were about money or other concrete conditions , rarely political demands like the dismissal of a corrupt official or cadre .
In case they did not get the reaction they expected , they went up the state hierarchy , most of the time by writing a petition , and demanded the abidance of the existing laws .
Government petitions ( and auditions ) have a long tradition in China and are being accepted as long as the petitioners follow the rules and do not create chaos .
When the authorities ignored the petition , the situation often escalated into street actions ( Lee 2007 : 112 ) .
So far the people involved usually avoid coordinated actions with other workers from other plants or regions or from different social groups because they know that the state would react with repression .
Divided actors
The regime 's calculation that the creation of differ­ent " categories " of gongren could prevent them form getting together and resist has worked out so far .
During the conflicts the gongren themselves made the distinction between retirees , laid - off workers ( xiagang ) , unemployed and workers , who all fought their own struggles .
The old danwei communities still function somehow , because many gongren bought their apartments in the 1990s , and these old quar­ters are the place where information circulates and where people discuss possible resistance .
But since the different groups each have their own conditions and demands ( about pensions , wages or social benefits , or keeping the jobs ) the strug­gles are mostly separated .
In this context , Lee uses the term " cellular activism " ( Lee 2007 : 5 ) .
Each group has its own form of struggle .
The xia­gang , or unemployed , can not go on strike , just like the retirees .
They are already out of the plant and their struggles against the measures that put them in a precarious position come " too late " .
We­ston sees this as the weak point of the struggles : " Because most of those who are participating in the protests are either laid - off ( xiagang ) or formal­ly employed workers , they have little ability to disrupt their factories ' production schedules . "
( Weston : 70 ) .
Often they were fighting months and years after lay - offs or shut - downs because they did not get financial support .
They had to use other forms of " disruptive power " , like rioting , camping outside of government buildings and blocking traffic junctions to force the authorities to act .
The danwei workers who were still in the plants fought against restructuring measures that threat­ened their interests .
Their struggles were often " spontaneous " because of sudden grievances , against restructuring programs or planned lay - offs .
" Spontaneous " does not mean that there was no preparation or cohesion , but indicates the ab­sence of formal organization or leadership ( Lee 2007 : 80 ) .
They fought the program and demand­ed participation or ownership .
Starting points for the struggles of the danwei workers were labor contracts , wages , bonuses , pensions and compen­sation payments , but above all planned lay - offs , bad working conditions , a despotic management , corruption and embezzlement .
In the early 1990s some workers were still forced to buy shares of their ailing plants .
A few years later the plants were closed and stripped by the managers , one reason for the tremendous rage against the factory directors and local cadres .
Here it is important to note that the danwei were officially still public property .
Even though work­ers only ever spoke cynically about their ownership as " masters of enterprises " , they are very much aware of their part in building up the factories .
They had job security , but often also low wages .
But then they faced losing their jobs and their pen­sion rights - and also their social networks which were organized within the danwei .
They saw their resistance against the restructuring as " rightful " ( Chen : 248 ) and wanted participation in the execu­tion of the reforms .
5
Workers , who were threat­ened to be laid off used slogans like " Give the Fac­tory Back to Me! ( huan wo gongchang ) " ( Chen : 248 ) .
Sometimes they occupied the factory to prevent the restructuring .
6
Strikes were no alternative , be­cause plants were not producing according to their capacity during the restructuring .
Sometimes the struggles had the form of " collective bargain­ing by riots " ( Chen : 251 ) , where the workers at­tacked administration buildings , city halls or those people responsible for their misery .
The disruptive power of the gongren
Many dissatisfied workers , still working or al­ready unemployed , were " using the proletarian rhetoric of the Maoist period to press for social justice in the new economic environment , phras­ing their demands in class terms that the authori­ties find uncomfortable to deal with . "
( Hassard : 138 ) The resistance of the danwei - workers against the lay - offs was often also motivated by a form of " moral economy " .
They referred to rights of the past , and compared the suffered injustice with the standards of socialism or even the Cultural Revo­lution .
They developed something like a collective action - frame , as they used the old " communist " rhetoric to fight illegitimate inequality and injus­tice .
Sometimes there was a kind of illusionary Maoism , distorting the past into a period where the workers were happy and content .
This was the case especially with older and already retired state workers .
Some referred to the position of the cul­tural - revolutionary " rebels " : " During the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 - 1976 ) , the idea of the CCP as a new , exploitative ruling class extracting surplus value from the working classes and passing on its privileges to its descendants became a common one among the more radical participants in the movement , and it was an idea that many of them carried over into the first stirrings of China 's democracy movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s . "
( Hassard : 161/2 )
An image of the Polish Solidarnosz - movement of the early 1980s that cir­culated among the state workers underlined the idea of exploitation through the a socialist bour­geoisie .
From the outside the struggles seemed to be " un­organized and leaderless " ( Chen : 251 ) .
In fact , col­lective protests and demonstrations against local authorities were ( and are ) often coordinated by ( former ) foremen and cadres , which played their " traditional " leading role and demanded their " le­gitimate " rights .
They functioned as workers mili­tants and decided how to intervene .
Sometimes they played the role of consultants because open or covered organization was too risky .
Only a few people dared to organize actions that involved more than one plant .
Even if protests and forms of self - organization of workers were only regional and short - lived , their impact and power was a result of their frequent appearance and because of the regime which was afraid of the potential spread of the movement and that it would turn against the state or the role of the Communist Party as the only dominant po­litical force .
These concerns are justified , since the number of conflicts between the state and the workers ' movements have increased for a long time .
" The working class is turning from a stabiliz­ing force into a potentially disruptive force in Chi­nese society " ( Cai 2006 : 185 ) .
There are a number of reasons :
Because of the lack of a functioning so­cial system , the poor put their demands for social securities and benefits to the government ; the lo­cal governments are directly involved in the re­forms and the plant shut - downs ; and the obvious corruption , embezzlement and theft of state prop­erty through CP - cadres , factory directors and gov­ernment officials provokes people to ask for state intervention - or they attack the responsible peo­ple and institutions on their own .
Most of the mobilizations stayed rather small , with a few prominent exceptions .
This is due to the fact that many big danwei were spared ( and not closed ) or had enough cash to pay of the workers .
But when peaceful and moderate methods did not help , the protests radicalized and lead to militant encounters .
The struggles in 1997 slowed down the lay - offs of 20 to 50 million surplus workers so the restructuring could not proceed as quickly as planned .
But if the lay - offs in some industries were delayed , the reforms were still carried out .
The carrot and the stick
Soon after 1997 , during the restructuring of the state owned industries and the lay - offs , the regime had to take measures against the struggles .
It used the decentralization of the political and economi­cal decision - making , which gave local authorities more influence and power .
The local authorities were the first target of farmers ' , migrant workers ' and urban proletarians ' attacks .
The central gov­ernment in Beijing intervened only when the re­gional conflicts got out of control or became explo­sive .
Even today , the central government or­ders the local authorities to deescalate " unex­pected events " ( tufa shijian ) .
In private companies the influence of the local government is usually small .
There they can only intervene through unions and the local labor bureaus .
But in state owned companies they play a big role and can put the management under pressure ( if they want to ) .
But nothing happens unless the workers take the initiative , stage open resistance and thereby raise the pressure .
So far the state used a " carrot and stick " strategy during the struggles .
On one hand it tries to calm the workers down through compensation and so­cial security payments to soften the effects of lay - offs and work releases .
7
In this context , Lee talks about " safety valves " , to enable the people in­volved in struggles to " let off steam " ( Lee 2003 : 83 ) .
After 1987 newly founded commissions for mediation have played a role in preventing an es­calation of conflicts .
The commissions are formed by labor bureau officials , union and employer rep­resentatives .
Whether there is a chance to quickly pacify the situation also depends on the financial resources of the local state and the danwei that can be used to soften the social effects of lay - offs or to pay back wages .
Local authorities and danwei in the prosperous coastal regions had enough finan­cial means , but not those at the " third front " , the provinces of the South West and North East .
And of course , only the big danwei were able to pay , the middle and small danwei had no money and the majority of the struggles happened there .
The strategy to pay out only those workers who staged militant struggles also created problems .
" Setting the precedent of only meeting the de­mands of those involved in the most severe out­breaks of unrest risks providing workers with the perfect excuse for disorder . "
( Hassard : 150 ) It is in­teresting to note that this is similar to what hap­pened in the 1950s , when workers went on strike against the danwei managements , because they knew the managers " bullied the good , but feared the bad . "
( Sheehan : 74 ) .
The " stick " was mainly used against the " orga­nizers " of the protests .
Insubordinate workers and reputed " ring - leaders " were arrested ( and still get arrested ) and sent to jail or labor camps for a long time as a threat to the other workers who participate in strikes and demonstrations - in other words : " Kill the chicken to scare the monkey " ( Weston : 78 ) .
The authorities ' repression is particularly hard against mobilizations across several plants or re­gions and against independent unions .
The state propaganda continues , asking workers to accept the hardships so that the reforms turn out successful :
They should sacrifice themselves for the collective , for the state , and they should put aside their own interests .
But the regime also reacted to the struggles :
It slowed down the re-structuring , extended the envisioned periods for lay - offs ( from 2000 to 2003 ) , and started new wel­fare programs .
In 2002 / 3 , the new government fi­nally put social stability center stage .
The re­form of the state unions and the ( formal ) establish­ment of a system of collective bargaining is sup­posed to help avoid an explosion of social strug­gles - similar to the Central European " Social Part­nership " .
The party slogan of the setup of a " Har­monious Society " has to be understood as a threat against all who dare to use " disharmonious " means to fight for their interests .
The state tries to avoid bigger confrontations and bloodletting .
But how long will this work ?
The re-structuring of the unprofitable danwei is not finished yet , and will continue to ignite social explosives .

The Protests in 2002
The North - East of China used to be the center of heavy industries and is known today as the Chi­nese " rust - belt " .
In 2002 the towns of Liaoyang ( province of Liaoning ) and Daqing ( Heilongjiang ) were shaken by a series of workers ' revolts , probably the biggest independent workers ' actions in the history of the People 's Republic of China .
Nearly the nation 's entire oil - and gas produc­tion is in the hands of the state - owned company PetroChina .
End of 2000 the oil fields of Daqing were re-structured .
The workers were told that the company is close to bankruptcy and that they have to face the threat of mass redundancies without being paid compensation .
After this announcement about 50,000 workers ( out of 260,000 ) agreed on taking the offered compensation and left the job .
Only a minority of them later found new jobs , and having taken the compensation they were subsequently excluded from the social security benefits provided by the oil administration .
At least the company continued to pay for heating the workers ' homes .
But the trigger of the 2002 protests was the announcement to stop paying for that , too .
In Heilongjiang the winters are long and cold .
The demonstrations started on the 1st of March , with only a few thousand people participating in the beginning .
Their number increased to 50,000 during the following days .
People demonstrated on every working - day , and sit - downs were orga­nized in front of the oil administration .
Supposed­ly some workers who had kept their jobs joined in because the administration had asked them to pay higher dues into the pension fund , while at the same time managers cashed in horrendously high compensation payments .
Production was not obstructed .
The protests were organized by the " Provisional Union Committee of Workers sacked by the Oil Administration " .
At the beginning they were mostly peaceful .
Then the administration changed tactics , because - amongst other reasons - they felt threatened by the possible spreading of the unrest .
On the 19th of March 19 several demonstrators were injured during clashes with the police .
On the 22nd of March a large armada of police and army occupied the protest 's meeting points ; dozens of activists were arrested .
Nevertheless the actions continued .
The demonstrators ceased to shout slogans , though , because everyone who started to do so ran the risk of getting arrested or disappearing .
The oil administration promised a wage increase to those workers who were still em­ployed .
On the 27th of May , thirteen weeks after the first protest , more than 10,000 people gathered again .
Lioyang is hit particularly hard by the reform of state - owned companies : up to 80 percent of the work - force are said to be " released from work " .
Alleged­ly there had been an informal underground orga­nization running for a long time before the protests started .
The core of this organization is formed by workers from the FerroAlloy plant .
They had organized bigger actions in 2000 and 2001 , targeting delayed wages and plant closures .
The reason for the first demonstration on the 11th of March was this :
The town mayor had an­nounced on television that there are no unem­ployed people living in his town .
Responding to his speech several thousand workers from several - partly from bankrupt - companies demonstrated and demanded his dismissal .
In the following days these demonstrations gained in size , and up to 30,000 people took part .
Again , the administra­tion reacted by applying the " carrot and stick " - strategy :
Some delayed wages were paid , some people were promised that their unemployment benefit would be paid soon , an inquiry following the corruption charges against managers of the metal plant was announced .
On th 17th of March Yao Fuxin , a worker of the metal plant , was arrested .
This incident further fueled the protests , which then had only one de­mand : " Free Yao Fuxin ! " .
Later on more arrests followed .
As in Daqing , two tactics of repression were used : Firstly , a strong visible presence of security forces in town in order to intimidate the workers , and secondly , the hunt for the " ring - leaders " , the activists of the underground organization .
The movements of Daqing and Lioyang inspired the miners in the coal areas of Fushun and Fuxin ( Liaoning ) .
In mid-March thousands of them blocked railway - lines in order to protest against announced conditions of mass lay - offs .
To hinder the arrest of activists - like in Daqing and Liao­yang - banners and signs were put up , an­noun­cing the time and place of the upcoming ac­tions .
On the demonstrations themselves there were neither signs nor slogans .
In 2002 the government implemented a new wel­fare program to boost domestic demand and soft­en the worst impacts of the xiagang - problem :
By fostering the establishment of state - controlled job centers ( these centers are supposed to pay out the wages of the employees who are " released from work " and to find new jobs for unemployed ) , by increasing the wages of employees in the state sec­tor , etc . .
In 2007 the wife of Yao Fuxin , who had been sen­tenced to seven years imprisonment , addressed a petition to the National People 's Congress , asking for the release of her husband .
His conditions in jail are extraordinary hard , his health has been de­stroyed .
The petition has been signed by more than 900 of his former workmates .

Struggles in ( former ) state owned companies
Source : www.umwaelzung.de - German website on social struggles in Asia
Textile factory : Since mid-September 2004 , thou­sands of textile workers ( most of them women ) went on a 7 - week - strike and blocked the factory in Xianyang .
Although the former state owned cot­ton factory was the property of the employees - the workers had to buy shares - it was sold to a company from Hong Kong .
This company de­manded that the workers sign a redundancy agreement with a small compensation payment , and wanted to treat them as newly hired after­wards , with a probation time , limited work con­tracts and lower wages .
The strikers did not ap­point any speakers in order to avoid state repression against " ring - leaders " .
Hence the authorities could not find anybody to negotiate with .
The strike ended when the management announced to skip the probation time and extend the limited con­tracts .
After months , 20 arrested strikers were re­leased without prosecution .
Steelworks :
In August and October 2005 , laid - off workers protested in Chongqing for a few weeks .
The plant had declared bankruptcy in July .
The workers held the management responsible for the crash and demanded a modest compensation pay­ment .
When the workers staged a sit -in in front of the city hall , some men attacked the cops - proba­bly agent provocateurs of the police .
During the following struggle two women died .
Military factory :
In January 2006 , workers of a military factory fought against the police for three days in Chengdu .
The factory was bankrupt and was supposed to be sold below value .
The work­ers did not get the announced compensation payment .
Hence they occupied the factory and took the director hostage .
When military police tried to free the manager , a struggle broke out and people got injured .
Public transportation : Since 2001 , the city administration of Qingyang had tried to privatize public transportation , but the workers council had denied it five times .
In September 2006 , the company was sold to a private enterprise after the workers council was forcefully closed by the city authorities .
The administration coerced 1448 workers to sign a cancellation agreement .
It was a payment of roughly 80 Euros per year of staff membership .
But some workers did not get it , because there was not enough money on the company 's bank - account to cover the pay - out .
Hereupon the workers went to the responsible board and demanded a solution within two days .
When they did not get an answer , the workers besieged the company 's administration building and took the management hostage , until the police stopped the action .
After January 2007 , there had been constant protests in front of the administration building , but in August 2007 they were stopped by the riot police .
Bank :
For years there were occasional protests by hundreds of former employees of the Industry and Trade Bank of China ( ICBC ) .
When the ICBC was privatized , 100,000 employees were laid off with a low compensation payment and without pension or health insurance .
The bank said they had voluntarily abstained from the job and therefore no legitimate entitlement to full legal compensation .
The demonstrations mostly took place in Beijing , especially in front of the bank headquarters and the central union office .
People from other cities involved in this conflict also came to Beijing , despite police attempts to prevent them from doing so .
Coal mine :
In August 2007 , workers of the Tan­jiashan coal mine went on strike against planned lay - offs and small compensation payments .
They had also discovered that the management had stolen money which had been provided by the government to pay compensations .
The management hired 200 private security agents to quell the strike .

1 Formally there were three different kinds of danwei : those in industrial sectors , those in service sectors and administrative in­stitutions .
2 The reforms had more reasons , economic , political and geo-po­litical :
At the end of the 1970s the Asian Tigers were already making big advances and showed that a " national " economic de­velopment under an authoritarian regime could be possible .
For China it was important that three out of four tigers were Chinese : Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore ( the forth was South Korea ) .
Especially the rise of Taiwan challenged the People 's Republic .
Whereas Japanese capital above all had invested in the Asian Tigers to use their cheap labor , at the end of the 1970s traders , bankers and enterprises of Chinese descent living in the tiger - states started pumping capital into the new industries of the Peo­ples Republic .
China 's adjustment to the world - market started during the internationalization of capital in the mid-70s , the be­ginning of the new phase of the so called " globalization " .
3 According to Lee one reason for relative social stability despite the dramatic results of the restructuring in the rust - belts was the fact that many gongren were able to buy their apartments or rent them cheaply ( Lee 2007 : 125 ) .
4 " Officially , a xiagang worker is one who meets all of these conditions : ( 1 ) s/he began working before the contract system was instituted in 1986 and had a formal , permanent job in the state sector ( plus those contract laborers whose contract term is not yet concluded ) ; ( 2 ) because of his / her firm 's problems in business and operations , has been let go , but has not yet cut off relations with the original firm ; and ( 3 ) has not yet found other work in society . "
( Solinger 2004 : 63 , footnote 16 )
5 A difference between the workers in the private companies , which have no entitlement to " property " .
6 Here , too , they could draw on historical parallels , namely the establishment of " workers guard teams " ( gongren jiuchadui ) against sabotage acts by the Guomindang shortly before the " lib­eration " in 1949 .
7 Compensation and retirement payments to danwei - workers have cost the state hundreds of millions of Euros , financed through the state - owned banks .

On April 2 , Steve Novella , Kimball Atwood , and I visited the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) to meet with its director , Dr. Josephine Briggs .
I ’m not going to rehash what was said because we agreed that Steve would handle that task , and he did so admirably last week .
I agree with Steve that it was encouraging that Dr. Briggs apparently reads this blog and shares many of our concerns about NCCAM , the poor science that it has funded , and its use by promoters of unscientific medicine to promote their quackery .
Most heartening of all was that she appeared to recognize how much CAM is infused with anti-vaccine beliefs and , worse , the promotion of these beliefs to the detriment of public health .
Those positive reactions to what was a friendly but frank exchange of views notwithstanding , as we were sitting in a conference room next to Dr. Briggs ’ office , I could n’t help but wonder what the reaction of CAM promoters would be when they found out about this meeting .
Now I know .
John Weeks over at The Integrator Blog is not happy :
Novella ’s posting reads like a Fox News interview : 95 % his team ’s point , then a brief NCCAM response .
That Briggs asked for the meeting likely grew out of an early March conference at Yale at which Novella and she both participated .
For this , she deserves the Barack Obama Big Tent award for her proven interest in sitting down with everyone , no matter which party affiliation or belief .
( Some have said this was proven in early 2008 when Briggs met with me . )
Arguably , Briggs takes her openness to dialogue further than the President .
While Obama has kept arms length from leaders who call for the demise of the United States , Briggs has now met with those who have been lobbing bombs at her professional home for years , calling steadily for NCCAM ’s destruction .
Because our previous calls for the closing of a relatively small government institute because we view it as a poor use of taxpayer money is just like calling for the downfall of the United States government .
Weeks clearly likes ridiculously overblown hyperbole .
Interestingly enough , what appeared to upset Mr. Weeks the most was our discussion of homeopathy with Dr. Briggs .
As Steve put it :
Dr. Briggs pointed out that it is not the job of the NCCAM to make final pronouncements about any treatment or medical claim .
This is fair enough — but depends on context .
The NCCAM is responsible for informing the public about so - called CAM modalities , and that should include a fair assessment of the science .
If the science says a treatment is worthless , the NCCAM should not be afraid to say so .
Further , the NCCAM does determine what studies the NCCAM funds .
The NCCAM accepts applications for research into homeopathy , but have not funded any in several years .
What does this mean ?
Will they consider funding homeopathy research , and if so they are basically saying that they do not close the door on any medical modality , no matter how implausible or damned by negative evidence .
If they will not consider funding homeopathy , then why are they accepting grant applications for homeopathy research ?
This could be construed as disingenuous — perhaps a way to not fund homeopathy research without having to say they will not fund homeopathy research .
Steve is correct .
The NIH can never totally close the door on any line of research .
It can , however , set priorities .
It could decide that , given the homeopathically diluted prior plausibility of homeopathy based solely on physics , chemistry , and biology , homeopathy is not a priority .
It can make sure that only reviewers with the relevant background in basic and clinical science — not “ homeopathic ” science — make up the study sections that review NCCAM grants .
Indeed , I was much heartened to learn from Dr. Briggs that she had already moved peer review of CAM grants out of NCCAM - sponsored study sections and into regular standing NIH study sections run by the Center for Scientific Review , which is where the vast majority of NIH grants are normally reviewed .
As a sort of counterpoint to our message , Mr. Weeks described in the same post a meeting that Dr. Briggs had with an “ international homeopathic team . ”
Besides the amusement I felt at the word choice ( is a homeopathic team a team so diluted that there is no one there ? ) , the content itself was at the same time both disturbing and full of hilarious howlers .
For instance , this passage concludes the section discussing our visit :
That said , what would have been especially interesting is if Briggs ’ scheduler crossed wires and the anti- NCCAM bloggers and homeopathic researchers had showed up for the same meeting time .
I ca n’t speak for Steve or Kimball , but I assure Mr. Weeks , that I probably would have enjoyed such an encounter thoroughly , although we would have been disappointed that we would n’t have been able to have the discussion that we had planned on .
But how did the meeting between Dr. Briggs and the homeopaths go ?
This is how Mr. Weeks describes it :
Gahles , in a report to the Integrator , assessed that the meeting went “ very well . ”
In her view , a presentation by Chaplin and Roy on chemistry and slides that “ showed activity of homeopathic remedies on basophils and IgG ” seemed to be particularly compelling to the NCCAM team in suggesting mechanism of action .
Gahles underscored that conventional bio-markers seemed to be key in stimulating interest from the NCCAM team .
On the other hand , a presentation on quantum physics and energy medicine seemed to be less useful in making in the case .
At one point , an NCCAM team member who said he found the presentation “ powerful ” asked what the community of top scientists would think .
Those in the meeting responded : “ We are the leading scientists in the field . ”
More like the leading pseudoscientists in the field .
The thought of a homeopath claiming to be a leading scientist , particularly when it comes to physics and energy brings to mind Dr. Charlene Werner ’s tortured attempt to explain homeopathy through physics or John Benneth ’s attempt to explain it as “ nanocrystalloids . ”
Maybe they ’re the “ leading scientists ” of the field of homeopathy .
Or perhaps Mr. Weeks means Dana Ullman .
Or maybe Jacques Benveniste .
In any case , it ’s disturbing that an NCCAM team member apparently found the presentation “ powerful . ”
Anyone who finds the clinical research on homeopathy “ powerful ” does not understand the true tenets of homeopathy and what pseudoscience they are .
Such attitudes will tend to stand in the way of attempts to bring more rigorous science to the study of CAM .
Still , Mr. Weeks has done us an unintentional favor — two , actually .
First , he has demonstrated clearly that the CAM community wants its pseudoscience , not rigorous science , to guide NCCAM ’s research efforts .
This has only reinforced my appreciation of Dr. Briggs ’ delicate situation .
Every move she makes towards bringing rigorous science to the study of CAM is certain to enrage supporters of the purely pseudoscientific CAM modalities such as homeopathy , reiki , and various “ energy healing ” modalities that are no better than faith healing under different belief systems than Christianity .
Second ,
Weeks actually points out the heart of the conflict at the heart of NCCAM .
Dr. Briggs is clearly trying to move NCCAM in a direction that we at SBM would approve of , namely towards a more drug discovery - oriented approach towards herbal and botanical remedies and various supplements , as well as the study of exercise and various relaxation techniques .
After all , these are the most plausible remedies that fall under the general rubric of CAM , and a pharmacognosy approach is the most likely to yield useful information and scientific advances .
But that is not what CAM proponents want .
Indeed , they resent this approach , as Weeks demonstrates :
One of the perverse pleasures that comes from the disposition of the NIH to hire NCCAM leaders who have no prior experience in alternative or integrative medicine is to think of the culture shock when they move from a zone of relative comfort — drug research on fractions of botanical — into the far reaches such as homeopathic theory and practice .
In truth , forms of energetic thinking and practice are infused throughout the “ CAM ” universe ; homeopathy ’s dance with Avogadro ’s number merely makes it , with distant prayer , the most challenging .
“ Challenging ” is putting it mildly .
But this is the kicker :
It is probably good that Briggs ’ extensive and admirable self - education process over the last 2 years preceded this meeting .
The culture shock may had this meeting been in her first months .
I rather suspect that Mr. Weeks is correct here , only not in the way he thinks .
I ’m willing to bet that it was a major culture shock for Dr. Briggs to find out just how much magical thinking , religion , and pseudoscience underlie so much of CAM .
What Weeks calls a “ comfort zone ” is in reality nothing more than staying within what can be studied and demonstrated scientifically , which is what scientists do .
If homeopaths could produce anything more than centuries - old magical thinking to support their quackery , if they could produce actual science in the form of physics , chemistry , and biology to support their mystical beliefs in the “ memory ” of water and that “ like cures like , ” then their discipline would enter the realm of science , rather than being relegated to the realm of pseudoscience .
The problem , of course , is that homeopathy and the “ energy healing ” modalities are so removed from science that this is about as unlikely to happen as there is likely to be a single molecule of active remedy left in a 30C dilution .
Therein lies the conflict at the heart of NCCAM , and , although I approve of Dr. Briggs ’ attempts to increase the scientific rigor of NCCAM and , given that NCCAM is n’t going anywhere , see that as the best path towards trying to make NCCAM a useful center in the NIH , I ’m afraid that her actions will only exacerbate the conflict .
It ’s the institution and the laws that created it that are the problem , and Dr. Briggs wo n’t be there forever .
Her successor might not be as dedicated to science as she is .
( In fact , if people like John Weeks get their way , you can count on it . )
No matter how much Dr. Briggs may change the culture of NCCAM under her stewardship , all it takes is a new director to change it right back .
Directors come and go , but institutions last for generations .

Two Italian supermarkets have announced that they plan to stop selling all Israeli products as they could not differentiate whether they came from West Bank settlements or inside the Green Line .
Open gallery view Coop Italia and Nordiconad have decided to boycott all Israeli goods .
Credit : www.accessitaly.com
Italian grocery chains Coop and Nordiconad will remove all Israeli products from their shelves by the end of the month , according to the Stop Camel - Agrexco Web site - an Italian based coalition dedicated to the boycott of one of Israel 's top agricultural exporters .
Grocery chain Coop Italia issued a statement saying that they had a problem with " traceability , namely that the consumer is unable to verify whether or not the product in question comes from the occupied territories . "
The Coalition Web site added that this was " an important success for the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement against Israeli apartheid . "
According to the Web site , the campaign to lobby Italian supermarkets was launched in January this year and has since been coordinated in both Italy and France .
The statement added that the coalition " has vowed to make sure that both chains follow through on their promises , and encourages everyone to participate in this struggle for respect for international law , and freedom and self - determination for the Palestinian people . "

Jacqui Smith has lost her seat in the House of Commons to Tory candidate Karen Lumley .
Ms Smith resigned as home secretary in 2009 after it emerged she had claimed expenses for pornographic films watched by her husband .
Later she was strongly criticised for designating her sister 's house in London as her " main home " .
The Conservatives seized the Redditch , Worcs , seat with a majority of 5,821 on a swing of 9.2 % .
Ms Smith had been MP for Redditch since Labour came to power in 1997 .
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards , John Lyon , held a six - month inquiry into whether she had wrongly designated the London house belonging to her sister , at which she paid rent , as her main home .
Doing so enabled her to claim second home allowances on her Redditch family home .
He also investigated the revelation that Ms Smith had claimed for pay - per- view films on her second homes allowance .
In the report Mr Lyon upheld both complaints and recommended Ms Smith apologise to the House of Commons for the home designation .

I had a startling experience a few weeks ago .
I travelled to Mexico City for talks at the National University , an enormous and very impressive institution with high standards of achievement and scholarship .
Entrance is selective , but the university is virtually free .
I then visited an even more remarkable institution , the college in Mexico City established by former mayor Lopez Obrador .
Again , the facilities and standards are quite impressive .
It is not only free , but has open admissions , though sometimes that requires some delay and sometimes assistance for students lacking adequate preparation .
Shortly after I went to San Francisco for talks , and learned more about the California institutions of higher education .
They have been at the very peak of the international higher education system .
By now tuitions are quite high , even for in - state students , and cutbacks are affecting teaching , research , and staff .
It would be no great surprise if the two major state universities , UC Berkeley and UC Los Angeles , will soon be privatized while the remainder of the state system is reduced considerably in scale and level .
Needless to say , Mexico is a poor country with a struggling economy , and California should be one of the richest places in the world , with incomparable advantages .
I mention these recent experiences only to emphasize that the recent cut - backs in higher education seen in much of the world cannot simply be traced to economic problems .
Rather , they reflect fundamental choices about the nature of the society in which we will live .
If it is to be designed for the wealthy and privileged , mostly engaged in management and finance while production is transferred abroad and most of the population is left to fend somehow for themselves at the fringes of decent and creative life , then these are good choices .
If we have different aspirations for the world of our children and grandchildren , the choices are shameful and ruinous .
Damn you fire throwing turtles , why do n’t you just let my Super Mario pass through the pipe drain so that he can rescue his princess ?????

MILLEDGEVILLE , Ga. --
Authorities in Georgia have finished their investigation into a 20 - year - old college student 's claim that Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sexually assaulted her at a nightclub , police said Wednesday .
Milledgeville police chief Woodrow Blue said in a statement that his department and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation handed the investigation report and witness statements to local district attorney Fred Bright on Tuesday evening .
Blue said his department would have no further comment on the case .
Bright 's office on Wednesday acknowledged receiving the report and said he would n't make any comment until he had reviewed it .
Authorities were investigating the claim that Roethlisberger sexually assaulted the woman early March 5 at a club in Milledgeville .
No charges have been filed , and Roethlisberger 's lawyer , Ed Garland , disputed the claim and hired his own team to investigate .
It was the second time in a year the two - time Super Bowl champion had been accused of sexual misconduct .
Roethlisberger also faces a lawsuit filed in July by a woman who says he raped her in 2008 at a Lake Tahoe hotel and casino , an allegation he denies .
Roethlisberger has not been criminally charged in either case and has claimed counterdamages in the lawsuit .
The Rochester Americans , the Florida Panthers affiliate in the American Hockey League , recorded history this week when they were eliminated in the first round of the AHL playoffs after getting out to a 3 - 1 series lead .
It was a devastating loss for a team that was built to make a run for the Calder Cup .
After a loss like that players will typically call it disappointing , but the players took it a step further calling the entire season wasted .
There was one player more than willing to share his thoughts the day after the playoffs ended last week and his feelings towards the Florida Panthers , the player was Jamie Johnson .
He was the Amerks leading scorer ( 27 goals + 44 assists ) , on a two way contract , played through his own injuries , gave a solid effort when half the team was called up and also played in all 80 games but never once got a call from the Panthers .
I asked him if he would come back next season and he said he does not want anything to do with Florida .
" They have n't made the playoffs in 10 years , " Jamie Johnson said .
" They had no interest in me all year , I do n't think I should give them the time of day for another season . "
The Panthers are yet again in the stages of trying to find ways to improve for the future .
If players are leaving unhappy , does that paint a bigger picture of problems within the organization ?
I talked to General Manager Randy Sexton about a number of things this morning and when this was brought up he simply said , " no comment . "
A question in return was asked if Johnson has ever played a game in the NHL and the answer is no .
At 5 ' 11 " he 's the type of player where size could be an issue , but he was never afraid to mix things up or throw a big hit when given the chance .
" I do n't know what they want up there , they can't score goals , they can't win games .
They do n't call up the people who can produce , not much justice to be honest , " Jamie Johnson had said .
" First I think it looks bad , you have guys that do well , do everything they 're told to do , pay their dues and there 's no reward . "
Interesting points by both of them .
Johnson has never played in an NHL game but he 's also never had the opportunity .
There are a lot of players who play in the American Hockey League who produce at a high level that never evolves into the necessary talent to play in the NHL .
When the big club is struggling though , players question what they really need to do to move up and help out .
A similar situation happened with Janis Sprukts during the 2008/2009 season .
Sprukts had been lured back to play in North America with the expectations he would be given an opportunity but only saw one game played with the big club .
He made it very clear during the season that he was unhappy and leaving once the season was over .
When the Panthers struggle to improve and seem to have some tools in the system that are not utilized you have to question what NHL free agents think when approached to play for the Panthers .
They 're constantly improving for next season and always seem to have a few what if scenarios where the season could have turned out differently .
What if David Booth had been healthy all season is just one example .
Not talking about Johnson specifically , I asked Randy Sexton to explain a little further about how they determine what players to call up from the Rochester Americans .
" You recall players becuase you have a need .
We look to fill a need that we have on the big team as a result of injury or suspension or to try and upgrade the play of our team in Florida , " Sexton said .
" At various times of the year we needed various types of players .
Just because someone is scoring does n't mean someone is automatically recalled .
You really have to look at the needs of the team and the fit of the team so you have the highest premonition of talent and chemistry to give your team the best chance to win . "
Johnson also said the day after the season ended , " It 's pretty disappointing when they do n't give you any respect . "
It may sound as if players like Johnson and Sprukts were whining and not NHL caliber players in the first place , but you have to wonder what players in the NHL really think but can't publicly say .
Bother Johnson and Sprukts felt as if they could have been an upgrade and been an asset to the Panthers .
Either the players are being given false hopes by the Panthers about playing with the big club or the players think they 're better than they really are .
Either way , the Panthers struggled this season and when a team has not made the playoffs in 10 years it 's a discussion worth bringing up about confusion players in the system seem to have .

Remember that ash cloud ?
It did n't exist , says new evidence
Britain 's airspace was closed under false pretences , with satellite images revealing there was no doomsday volcanic ash cloud over the entire country .
Skies fell quiet for six days , leaving as many as 500,000 Britons stranded overseas and costing airlines hundreds of millions of pounds .
Estimates put the number of Britons still stuck abroad at 35,000 .
Stranded : Hundreds of desperate Britons sleep on the basement floor at Bangkok 's International Airport , Thailand waiting to get flights home
However , new evidence shows there was no all - encompassing cloud and , where dust was present , it was often so thin that it posed no risk .
The satellite images demonstrate that the skies were largely clear , which will not surprise the millions who enjoyed the fine , hot weather during the flight ban .
Jim McKenna , the Civil Aviation Authority 's head of airworthiness , strategy and policy , admitted : ' It 's obvious that at the start of this crisis there was a lack of definitive data .
False alarm ?
Satellite images have revealed there may never have been a doomsday volcanic ash cloud over the UK ( file picture )
' It 's also true that for some of the time , the density of ash above the UK was close to undetectable . '
The satellite images will be used by airlines in their battle to win tens of millions of pounds in compensation from governments for their losses .
The National Air Traffic Control Service decision to ban flights was based on Met Office computer models which painted a picture of a cloud of ash being blown south from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano .
Eruption :
The Eyjafjallajokull volcano saw flights across Europe grind to a halt and passengers stranded
These models should have been tested by the Met Office 's main research plane , a BAE 146 jet , but it was in a hangar to be repainted and could not be sent up until last Tuesday - the last day of the ban .
Evidence has emerged that the maximum density of the ash was only about one 20th of the limit that scientists , the Government , and aircraft and engine manufacturers have now decided is safe .
British Airways chief Willie Walsh always insisted the total shutdown went too far .
' My personal belief is that we could have safely continued operating for a period , ' he said .
Mark Tanzer , chief executive of Britain 's ABTA , which represents British travel agents and tour operators , said about 100,000 stranded British travellers should have been returned home by Monday morning .
About 35,000 more will remain marooned until Friday , the group said .
' While most flights are back to normal , and most stranded British passengers will be back by the end of this weekend , there is still quite a high level of disruption in some destinations .
' In some areas of the world , there is a significant lack of air capacity to enable British people to be returned quickly , ' Tanzer said .
Many Icelandic airports are closed and though authorities say Eyjafjallajokull is now producing much less ash , they confirmed no signs of the eruption ending .

Columbia , Missouri Police Chief Ken Burton is apparently frustrated .
At another press conference yesterday , a reporter asked the chief what he has learned from the international attention generated by the YouTube video of his department ’s SWAT team conducting a drug raid last February .
His reply : “ I hate the Internet . ”
I ’ll bet he does .
For two - and - a - half months , Burton and his department were quiet about the raid .
That ’s likely because , as I wrote yesterday , the raid was really no different from the tens of thousands of similar raids conducted every year , and that are probably conducted by his own department a couple of times per week .
Within days of the video hitting the web , Burton was forced to hold several press conferences , and has now laid out several reforms to the way SWAT raids will be conducted in Columbia in the future .
I suppose it ’s possible those reforms were brewing all along , and the timing of him announcing them after the video went viral was mere coincidence .
It seems at least plausible , though , that the dread “ Internet ” sparked some actual policy changes , here .

CoroCoro scan
A scan from the June 2010 issue of the magazine CoroCoro has appeared online , revealing various information on the upcoming games Pokémon Black and White .
According to the scan , the first Generation V games will be set in the region known as 「 イッシュ 」
Isshu , which is quite a distance away from all previous regions .
The magazine scan implies that the region is a foreign place that must be traveled to by boat or airplane .
The city shown in multiple screenshots and a video on Pokémon Sunday is to be called 「 ヒウンシティ 」 Hiun City .
The new playable characters are also presented .
They are stated to be more grown - up than past protagonists , and both are wearing devices on their wrists that may be the successor of the Pokégear , PokéNav and Pokétch .
Finally , the scan also shows the starters of Pokémon Black and White ; as in previous generations , the starters are Grass- , Fire - , and Water - type .
The starters ' names are 「 ツタージャ 」 Tsutarja , 「 ポカブ 」 Pokabu , and 「 ミジュマル 」 Mijumaru .
Further information has also come in with updated information about Zoroark .
This Pokémon has a new and unique method of capture .
It appears that it will appear when one of the three shiny legendary beasts from the thirteenth movie giveaways is transferred to Black and White .
Additionally , its ability is known as , 「 イリュージョン 」 Illusion , and it has two new moves 「 イカサマ 」 Trickery and 「 つめとぎ 」 Claw Sharpen .
More leaked scans continue to emerge , including battle scenes featuring the five already - revealed Pokémon and art and screenshots of locations in the Isshu region .
The manhunt for two drug smugglers in the shooting of Pinal County sheriff 's Deputy Louis Paroll in an isolated area of south - central Arizona was called off Saturday night , but authorities said they would continue to monitor the area .
Since the shooting , 17 people found in the search area have been detained .
Sheriff 's spokesman Lt. Tami Villar said Border Patrol was holding 14 detainees suspected of being illegal immigrants .
She said the other three matched the description of the shooters given by Puroll and were questioned Saturday by sheriff 's investigators .
Authorities believe there were five shooters in all .
The Sheriff 's Office is also conducting an internal investigation into the shooting , standard policy whenever a shooting involving an officer takes place .
Villar added that evidence recovered from the scene is only now being processed , but would not comment on if weapons had been found .
Puroll , who had been shot with an AK - 47 - type weapon around 4 p.m. , according to the Sheriff 's Office , has declined requests to be interviewed .
The rugged desert area where the shooting took place , near the junction of Interstate 8 and Arizona 84 in south - central Arizona , is considered a high - traffic drug - and human - smuggling corridor .
A massive hunt of 100 square miles that included helicopters with night - vision equipment and more than 200 officers , including SWAT teams , from 13 agencies searched into the night Friday .
More than one helicopter came under fire during the evening as officers rescued Puroll , who had been shot with an AK - 47 - type weapon around 4 p.m. , according to the Sheriff 's Office .
Puroll suffered a flesh wound above his kidney that tore off a chunk of skin .
He was treated at Casa Grande Regional Medical Center and released Friday night .
" Here we see the tactics have changed and become more dangerous , " Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said .
" This has reached a critical mass for law enforcement . "
Babeu said he has " called out for help " from federal officials to no avail .
He said smugglers know " the police are after them and the fact they are firing upon us changes the game . "
Gov. Jan Brewer also weighed in , saying in a Twitter message sent out Friday evening : " Our thoughts & prayers go out to the Pinal County Deputy shot during a stop .
Contrary to what some leaders say , our borders are not secure . "
Brewer could not be reached to discuss it further .
The shooting occurred exactly one week after the governor signed the toughest anti-illegal - immigration law in the country , triggering a firestorm of state and national controversy .
The legislation has been hotly debated , and it has put Arizona in the spotlight over how border states deal with rampant illegal immigration .
The legislation has sparked protests and calls to boycott the Grand Canyon State from opponents , while supporters argue it should be emulated nationwide .
Babeu , a frequent critic of federal immigration policy , is a strong supporter of the law .
Babeu was joined by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , another supporter of the law , at a command - post news conference late Friday at an I - 8 truck stop .
Arpaio said that , in 90 days , when Arizona 's new law takes effect , he will be enforcing it " 100 percent , " and he worries that violence common with drug cartels in Mexico will come to the U.S .
" I think this is one incident that proves that it 's going to happen in the future , " Arpaio said .
" I predict it 's going to get worse because of the chaos at the U.S. - Mexico border . "
Villar said Friday 's incident " sends a very powerful and loud message that we have a problem . "
She added that the shooters are Hispanic men who " appear to be undocumented . "
Late Saturday , she released a description of the outstanding shooters :
One was described as a light - skinned Mexican man with a Sinaloan accent carrying a long gun .
He has a black handkerchief covering his face and wore a green and brown fatigue - type shirt , tan pants , black boots and a ball cap .
The second shooter was described as a darker - skinned Mexican man who was possibly carrying two handguns .
He wore a grey , long - sleeve hooded sweatshirt with the hood drawn tight around his face , green colored pants , and black and white tennis shoes .
Villar said Puroll , 53 , was attacked about 5 miles south of I - 8 .
She said the veteran deputy is assigned to patrol the area known for drug smuggling .
Babeu said Puroll was tracking the smugglers , who left behind large quantities of marijuana .
Babeu said up to 30 rounds were fired at the deputy , who returned fire with an AR - 15 semiautomatic rifle and a handgun .
Villar said the attackers were armed with long guns and at least one handgun .
She said gunfire aimed at the helicopters came about an hour after the initial incident .
An unknown amount of marijuana apparently handled by the shooters remained in the desert .
The Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office dispatched a helicopter and members of its SWAT team to Pinal County to assist in the case , said sheriff 's Lt. Brian Lee .
The Arizona Department of Public Safety also sent two helicopters and a SWAT team .
About 70 Maricopa County sheriff 's employees also responded to the scene .
Lee said most had been involved in a crime - suppression sweep in west Phoenix earlier in the day .
The Border Patrol also sent agents to help with the investigation , said Mario Escalante , a patrol spokesman .
The nearest Border Patrol station in the area is in Casa Grande .
Republic reporters Craig Harris , Allison Hurtado , JJ Hensley , Megan Boehnke and Daniel Gonzalez contributed to this article .
Sit down and take a deep breath , EV fans .
The Nissan Leaf electric car will cost $ 32,780 when it rolls into showrooms in December .
Add in the federal EV tax credit , and the bottom line is $ 25,280 , a price that makes the Leaf competitive with the Honda Civic and the Toyota Prius .
Nissan announced the price today and said it starts taking reservations for the Leaf electric car April 20 .
The five - passenger hatchback sports a 23 kilowatt - hour lithium - manganese battery that 's good for a claimed 100 miles and recharges in eight hours .
The Japanese automaker plans to crank out 50,000 Leafs in 2011 .
With some 85,000 " hand - raisers " expressing interest in getting one , some EV advocates believe Nissan 's priced the car so competitively it could have trouble meeting demand .
" I think it 's an excellent price , " said Paul Scott , a founder and board member of the EV advocacy group Plug - In America .
" I think Nissan is going to have a hard time keeping them on the showroom floor , especially in states that have additional tax credits .
In California , it 's going to be a hell of a bargain at $ 20,028 .
They 've really nailed it .
It 's very , very affordable . "
We must note that these prices are for the United States only , and Nissan is offering the Leaf for sale or lease only as a complete package .
It is not leasing the battery separately from the car here in the United States , though it might do so elsewhere .
Nissan CEO Carlos
Ghosn has been among the loudest EV evangelists and is determined to make Nissan a player in the field .
The company almost certainly is taking a loss on the Leaf , just as Toyota did with the Prius , in a bid to grab as big a chunk of the market as possible before cars like the Chevrolet Volt and Ford Focus EV appear , Scott said .
" They 're probably banking on battery costs coming down , " Scott said .
" And they will come down . "
MSRP is but one part of the equation .
Operating cost is the other variable , and on that score Honda and Toyota should be worried .
Nissan 's priced the Leaf cheaper than the Civic and Prius once you 've figured in energy costs .
" Lifecycle ownership costs of the Leaf over five years is $ 28,180 versus a Civic at $ 28,338 and the Prius at $ 29,358 , " said Trisha Jung , chief marketing manager for the Leaf .
" That 's the cost of the vehicle , the cost of the charging station and the cost of the electricity . "
A word on the math : Nissan figured electricity costs at 11.64 cents per kilowatt - hour and gasoline at $ 2.94 a gallon and assumes you drive 12,000 miles a year .
The purchase price come down further if you include the tax credits or rebates several states offer .
California and Georgia , for example , offer a $ 5,000 tax credit .
Nissan says the numbers work out in the Leaf 's favor if you lease one , too .
Although Nissan gets the federal EV tax credit because it actually owns the car , it will pass it along to consumers as an incentive .
Sign a 36 - month lease and put $ 1,999 down , and your monthly payment will be $ 349 .
" If you include the energy costs , it works out to $ 408 a month for the Leaf , $ 414 a month for the Civic and $ 389 a month for the Prius , " Jung said .
That 's for the base " SL " model , which includes , among other features , a navigation system that identifies local charging stations and smartphone connectivity that lets you activate and monitor charging and other functions remotely .
Another $ 940 gets you the " SL " model that adds , among other things , a backup camera and a solar panel on the rear spoiler that trickle - charges the battery running the radio and other accessories .
The 220 - volt charging station you 'll need to keep the car going will cost you about $ 2,200 , but that includes the installation .
A federal tax credit will cover half the cost , said Dave Mingle , Nissan 's senior director for customer management and business strategy .
Later this summer , customers who reserve a Leaf through the Leaf website can schedule an in - home assessment .
EV infrastructure company Aerovironment will send an electrician to your house to provide an estimate , line up the permits and install the charger .
" We expect the average cost to be $ 2,200 , " Mingle said .
" That 's all in – it includes the charging station and full installation . "
If you live along the Interstate 5 corridor in Oregon or in Seattle , San Diego , Phoenix - Tuscon or east - central Tennessee , you could get a free charger .
The Department of Energy has awarded Etec a grant to install as many as 1,200 charging stations in each of those five markets through a program called the EV Project .
Of course , you 'll have to share your charging data with the the feds to help plan a broader charging infrastructure .
Nissan starts taking reservations for the Leaf on April 20 .
Paying $ 99 ( refundable if you change your mind ) buys you a place in line when Nissan starts building the cars in September .
The first cars roll into showrooms in December and will be available in the five markets of the EV Project plus the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles .
Nissan plans to offer the car nationwide by the end of 2011 .
Still no word on what kind of warranty the car or the battery will have .
Nissan promises to announce that before April 20 .
CORRECTED : Nissan says that the Leaf will have a five - passenger capacity , not four , as this story stated earlier .

'' This is a great outcome , '' Mr Brumby said , adding that an opening night party might involve blocking off Wellington Street - which police were forced to close in January when 4000 music fans rallied against the pub 's closure .
That impromptu rally galvanised Melbourne music fans and led to the formulation of the Save Live Music lobby group , which led more than 10,000 people on a rally in February .
Seventh Tipple 's Jon Perring said the company had applied to have the Tote 's licence transferred to its name , after which it would apply to have the venue 's high - risk conditions waived so it could operate profitably .
He said he was also in discussions with the former licensee , Bruce Milne , to buy the Tote name , and had approached several of its former staff to return to the venue .
Last week performers including Ross Wilson , Mike Rudd , Kram and Clare Bowditch presented a petition with 22,000 signatures urging the government to remove the liquor licence provisions that now link live music and ' ' high - risk ' ' conditions .
While Mr Brumby yesterday ruled out changing legislation to remove the conditions from live music venues generally , he said the independent director of liquor licensing , Sue Maclellan , had made some '' broad commitments ' ' to go easier on the venues , which can now apply individually to have the conditions altered .
Mr Brumby said it had been difficult balancing the live music issue with the need to tackle the increase in drunken violence .
'' Hopefully we can get the best out of both worlds - we can still have a vibrant live music culture … and at the same time , through our other policies , get on top of alcohol - fuelled violence . ''
Mr Perring paid tribute to the landlord for supporting live music .
'' I 'm sure they could have sold it to developers , which would probably have been easier for them . ''
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott has confirmed that the Coalition is considering a scheme which could deny the dole to people under 30 .
Mr Abbott has told AM the Coalition wants to encourage people to take up jobs in areas where there are skills shortages , such as in the Western Australian mining sector .
The idea for the ban was first floated after Mr Abbott held discussions with industry leaders in Perth earlier this week .
" I had a very free - ranging discussion with people who were complaining bitterly about the difficulty of getting people to work , " he said .
" I'm all in favour of a fair system but I 'm also in favour of a system where people have a go , where people pull their weight , and we 'll be making announcements in due course .
" There has got to be a system that encourages people to take up work where that work is available .
" I did notice my friend Warren Mundine suggesting some time ago that in areas where unskilled labour is in demand that the dole should n't be paid and I think that 's the sort of measure that we should be debating in this country . "
Opposition employment spokesman Eric Abetz has told ABC Newsradio that a ban on dole for the under - 30s is one of a range of policy ideas being bounced around in the lead - up to the election and says reactions to the suggestion will be assessed by the Coalition .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the proposal is another example of the Coalition making policy " on the run " .
During the 1990s , immigration reached record highs and crime rates fell more precipitously than at any time in U.S. history .
And cities with the largest increases in immigration between 1990 and 2000 experienced the largest decreases in rates of homicide and robbery , a University of Colorado at Boulder researcher has found .
Tim Wadsworth , an assistant professor of sociology , has tested the hypothesis , famously advanced by Harvard sociologist Robert J. Sampson , that the rise in immigration could be related to the drop in crime rates .
Wadsworth noticed Sampson 's argument in a 2006 New York Times op - ed piece .
As Wadsworth recalled , " My reaction was that this is really interesting , and it's a very testable question . "
New research supports Sampson 's hypothesis , Wadsworth reports in the June edition of Social Science Quarterly .
" Cities that experienced greater growth in immigrant or new - immigrant populations between 1990 and 2000 tended to demonstrate sharper decreases in homicide and robbery , " Wadsworth writes .
" The suggestion that high levels of immigration may have been partially responsible for the drop in crime during the 1990s seems plausible . "
Drawing from the FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports and U.S. Census data , Wadsworth analyzed 459 cities with populations of at least 50,000 .
Wadsworth measured immigrant populations in two ways : those who are foreign - born and those who immigrated within the previous five years .
Wadsworth focused on medium and large cities because about 80 percent of violent crime takes place there .
Wadsworth said distinguishing legal and illegal immigration is difficult , as the U.S. Census does not track those numbers , but he notes that immigrant citizens and non-citizens often live together in the same communities .
He tracked crime statistics for homicide and robbery because they tend to be reported more consistently than other crimes .
Robberies are usually committed by strangers -- which increases the reporting rate -- and " homicides are difficult to hide , " he said .
Wadsworth 's findings contradict much of the public rhetoric about the relationship between immigration and crime .
As the Arizona Republic reported this month , violent crime in that state 's border towns has remained essentially flat during the past decade even as drug - trade violence on the other side of the border has burgeoned .
The presumed link between immigration and crime has a long history in the United States and overseas .
Wadsworth said such sentiments are often expressed on Internet blogs and elsewhere .
Wadsworth contends that looking at crime statistics at a single point in time can't explain the cause of crime rates .
Using such snapshots in time , Wadsworth finds that cities with larger foreign - born and new - immigrant populations do have higher rates of violent crime .
But many factors -- including economic conditions -- influence crime rates .
If higher rates of immigration were boosting crime rates , one would expect long - term studies to show crime rising and falling over time with the influx and exodus of immigrants .
Instead , Wadsworth found the opposite .
Using long - term analyses , Wadsworth noted , cities that experienced the largest growth in the proportion of foreign - born and newly arrived immigrant populations experienced larger decreases in violent crime between 1990 and 2000 .
That finding , Wadsworth wrote , " suggests that Sampson may be right -- that immigration may be partly responsible for the decrease in violent crime . "
Wadsworth 's research suggests that , controlling for a variety of other factors , growth in the new immigrant population was responsible , on average , for 9.3 percent of the decline in homicide rates , and that growth in total immigration was , on average , responsible for 22.2 percent of the decrease in robbery rates .
Exactly why growth in immigration is accompanying decreases in violent crime is hard to determine with city - level data .
Some have suggested that immigrant communities are often characterized by extended family networks , lower levels of divorce , and cultural and religious beliefs that facilitate community integration .
Wadsworth notes that " criminologists have long known that these factors provide buffers against crime . "
" From the late 1800s to the present , the association between immigration and crime has been a center point of anti-immigrant discourse and public policy , " Wadsworth writes .
" Although there has been scant empirical research to support such claims , they have persisted with little debate . "

Teen tennis star has breast reduction surgery in bid to boost her game
Having a large chest guarantees attention , but Romanian tennis hopeful Simona Halep could n't get rid of hers soon enough .
The 18 - year - old , who was a junior champion at the French Open in 2008 , had a growing male fan base thanks to her 34DD breasts .
But the extra weight on her chest was uncomfortable and caused severe back pain , which affected her performance on the court .
In a bid to boost her game , she spent last summer recovering from breast reduction surgery , which took her cup size down to a more modest 34C .
Before : Romanian tennis star Simona Halep in the Junior French Open in 2008 .
Last summer she had breast reduction surgery to improve her game
After : Halep , pictured on Monday , is yet to reap the rewards of her surgery after she was beaten at the French Open by Samantha Stosur
She revealed her new - look figure at this year 's French Open tournament in Paris .
Unfortunately Halep , who is ranked 114 in the world , was still beaten on Monday by former semi-finalist , Australian Samantha Stosur .
Explaining her decision to fans , who petitioned in an attempt to get her to reconsider , she said : ' It ’s the weight that troubles me .
My ability to react quickly , my breasts make me uncomfortable when I play .

Personal choice : Halep admits that she has never liked her breasts , and would have had surgery even if she had n't been a sportswoman
Olympics or bust : 400 m hurdler Jana Pittman - Rawlinson , before her breast implants were removed earlier this year
But she is not the first sportswomen to have been forced to undergo a breast reduction to improve her chances , and if the experiences of other athletes are anything to go by it may take her some time to get used to her new body .
Australian 400 m hurdler Jana Pittman - Rawlinson , 27 , who had breast implants after the birth of her son , had them removed earlier this year in an effort to improve her chances in the London 2012 Olympics .
' Every time I raced I panicked about whether I was letting my country down , all for my own vanity , ' she said .

TEHRAN , Iran --
A prominent hard - line Iranian cleric who said promiscuity and immodest dress cause earthquakes says God may be holding off on natural disasters in the West in order to let people sin more and consign themselves to hell .
Kazem Sedighi sparked widespread derision with his pronouncements in a prayer sermon last month linking earthquakes with women 's dress .
" Many women who do not dress modestly ... lead young men astray , corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society , which ( consequently ) increases earthquakes , " Sedighi said in mid April .
In a new sermon Friday , he has defended and elaborated on his claim .
Sedighi notes that some might ask why there are n't more earthquakes and storms striking Western nations that are " up to their necks " in immorality .
He says the answer is that God allows some of those who " provoke His wrath " to continue sinning " so that they ( eventually ) go to the bottom of Hell . "
In response to Sedighi 's earlier comments , blogger Jennifer McCreight of Indiana had called on women to show as much cleavage as possible through a Facebook page aptly named Boobquake .
Despite an earthquake that surprisingly did strike on April 26 , the appointed day of Boobquake , McCreight remains convinced that cleavage does n't cause quakes .
More On This ...
Meanwhile " saddened " by the frivolousness of Boobquake , a second Facebook group called for " Brainquake , " a day for women to “ show off their resumes , CVs , honors , prizes , and accomplishments . ”
Software has long since lost its glory - days status .
We ’re not the go - to field anymore .
Geeks are no longer revered as gods amongst humanity for our ability to manipulate computers .
We get crappy jobs just like everyone else .
So , what is it that still motivates you to work as a software developer ?
Is it your fat salary , great perks , and end - of - year bonuses ?
Unless you ’ve been working on Mars for the past two years , I think Computerworld would disagree with you .
We ’ve been getting kicked in the nads just as hard as everyone else .
Between budget cutbacks , layoffs and reductions in benefits or increases in hours , clearly our paychecks are not our primary source of satisfaction .
If money was our primary motive , right now we ’d be seeing a mass exodus from the tech sector .
So , if it ’s not the money , then what is it that we hang on to when we get up each day ?
Are we really working for those options ?
That salary bonus ?
Turns out , we ’re kidding ourselves if we think that ’s our real motive as developers .
The assumption : People perform better when given a tangible , and even substantial , reward for completing a task .
Think bonuses , stock options , and huge booze - driven parties .
The reality :
In a narrow band of actual cases , this is true .
( And by narrow , I mean anything that is n’t a cognitive task , simple or complex , according to the research I quote below ) .
By and large , the reward - based incentive actually creates poorer performance in any group of workers for cognitive tasks , regardless of economic background or complexity of the task involved .
( Sorry , outsourcers … dangling the reward under your workers noses does n’t help even when your home country is considerably poorer on average than Western economies .
Yet another surprising finding of their research . )
I ’m not making this up , nor am I just drawing on anecdotal experience .
Watch this 18 minute video from TED and I ’ll bet you ’re convinced too :
Daniel Pink gave this lecture at the 2009 TED .
It ’s mind - blowing if you ’re stuck in the carrot - and - stick mentality .
And I ’ll just bet , unless you work for Google , are self - employed , or extremely worldly , you probably are .
I ’m not saying that to be mean or controversial .
I ’m saying that because this mentality has pervasively spread to every business , industry and country on the planet over the past 100 years .
It ’s not just software development , but we ’re hardly immune from its effect .
While we ’re not immune to the impact , we do have a lot going for us that gives us an advantage in stepping outside this mentality :
Developers tend to be social oddballs and the normal conventions seem awkward to us .
Social oddballs tend to question things .
We do n’t like what everyone else likes because , well , we ’re nerds and we do n’t think like sales people .
Or accountants .
Or athletes .
We ’re willing to try things others find weird because we ’re weird too .
Social oddballs tend to question things .
We do n’t like what everyone else likes because , well , we ’re nerds and we do n’t think like sales people .
Or accountants .
Or athletes .
We ’re willing to try things others find weird because we ’re weird too .
Because we ’re odd , we tend to be forward thinking and revolutionary in our approaches to workplace advancements .
Think about the good aspects of the Dot Com era : pets in the workplace , recreation rooms with pool tables and ping pong , better chairs and desks for people , free lunches .
Those innovations did n’t come out of Pepsi , Toyota , or Price Waterhouse Coopers , they came out of tech companies .
Every one .
Think about the good aspects of the Dot Com era : pets in the workplace , recreation rooms with pool tables and ping pong , better chairs and desks for people , free lunches .
Those innovations did n’t come out of Pepsi , Toyota , or Price Waterhouse Coopers , they came out of tech companies .
Every one .
In doing so , our weird becomes the new normal .
Witness the output of the Dot Com era : Aside from the economic meltdown , how many companies now regularly practice some , if not all of those things we did back in the late 90s ?
( Albeit with more restraint , thankfully )
With that in mind , let ’s take Daniel ’s idea of the results - oriented work environment ( ROWE ) forward and create something new for the 21st century .
It focuses on three important ideas , which developers already love and embrace :
Autonomy Mastery Purpose
Autonomy :
What developer out there does n’t like to be given the freedom to do their own thing , on their terms , with their preferred hours , using their tools , environment , IDE , language , operating system and favorite t- shirt ?
Find me a single developer anywhere that does n’t crave this kind of freedom and I ’ll pay you $ 10 .
Seriously .
Drop me a contact above .
I ’m good for it .
Of course , you ’ll search for the rest of your life and wo n’t be able to do it .
Mastery : Every developer on the planet wants to get better at what they do .
We crave new knowledge like some people quaff coffee after a hangover .
Fortunately , the side effects of getting better at development are far more benign than caffeine binging .
Purpose : Nothing is more tedious , horrific , or uninspiring to developers to work on projects that lack any real meaning in the world .
Or lack any real direction .
Or lack any substantial need from the company .
In fact , you can probably point to the brightest points of your career all stemming from those projects that had the deepest meaning to you personally .
Maybe the darkest points are those soul - sucking projects that you waded through because you were glad to have a job but desperately waited for things to improve so you could find a better job elsewhere .
Preferably where soul - vacuums did n’t exist .
Google gets it :
They already advocate the 20 % time concept and ( near - ) complete workplace freedom .
Atlassian gets it :
They have the Fedex challenge where everyone in the company gets 24 hours to work on something they are interested in , with the caveat you have to deliver it at the end of 24 hours and you must present it to the company .
Think those do n’t create passion for the company ?
How about the Nine Things Developers Want More than Money ?
These points all touch on the same three basic concepts : autonomy , mastery , and purpose .
Does your company “ get it ” ?
If the answer is NO , what can you do right now to change your workplace to “ get it ” ?
And if that is too Sisyphean a task for you , how about starting your own company instead , that does “ get it ” ?
That ’s my challenge for you in 2010 .
“ Make software suck less in the 21st century ”
Good luck .
It 's the relationship that never was .
Kept to the shadows , it was shielded behind secret agreements and disinformation that dressed up military cooperation as mining deals .
But when the spotlight occasionally flickered over one of the most intimate and enduring alliances of the postwar years , Israel was quick to underplay its deep military ties with apartheid South Africa as nothing more than a necessity of survival without a flicker of ideological affinity .
But as is shown by Sasha Polakow - Suransky 's book , The Unspoken Alliance , that relationship went beyond mere convenience .
For years after its birth , Israel was publicly critical of apartheid and sought to build alliances with the newly independent African states through the 1960s .
But after the 1973 Yom Kippur war , African governments increasingly came to look on the Jewish state as another colonialist power .
The government in Jerusalem cast around for new allies and found one in Pretoria .
For a start , South Africa was already providing the yellowcake essential for building a nuclear weapon .
By 1976 , the relationship had changed so profoundly that South Africa 's prime minister , John Vorster , could not only make a visit to Jerusalem but accompany Israel 's two most important leaders , Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , to the city 's Holocaust memorial to mourn the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis .
Neither Israeli appears to have been disturbed by the fact that Vorster had been an open supporter of Hitler , a member of South Africa 's fascist and violently antisemitic Ossewabrandwag and that he was interned during the war as a Nazi sympathiser .
Rabin hailed Vorster as a force for freedom and at a banquet toasted " the ideals shared by Israel and South Africa : the hopes for justice and peaceful coexistence " .
A few months later , the South African government 's yearbook described the two countries having one thing in common above all else : " They are both situated in a predominantly hostile world inhabited by dark peoples . "
A year earlier , Israel had offered to sell South Africa nuclear warheads .
" South Africa 's leaders yearned for a nuclear deterrent – which they believed would force the west to intervene on their behalf if Pretoria were ever seriously threatened – and the Israeli proposition put that goal within reach , " Polakow - Suransky says in the book .
The deal did not go through but there was plenty of other cooperation in the development of military technology .
Alon Liel , a former Israeli ambassador to Pretoria who headed his foreign ministry 's South Africa desk in the 80s , once told the Guardian that gold - rich South Africa funded the joint military projects and Israel provided much of the technical knowledge .
" After 1976 , there was a love affair between the security establishments of the two countries and their armies , " he said .
" We were involved in Angola as consultants to the [ South African ] army .
You had Israeli officers there cooperating with the army .
The link was very intimate . "
By the late 1970s , South Africa was Israel 's single largest customer for weapons .
Polakow - Suransky establishes that the relationship was so intimate that in the mid-1970s , South Africa lifted the safeguards supposed to govern how the yellowcake was used to prevent nuclear proliferation .
In return , Israel sent South Africa 30 grams of tritium , which gives thermonuclear weapons the boost to their explosive power .
The delivery was enough to build several atomic bombs , which South Africa did in the coming years .
Peres was central to the relationship .
He was defence minister at the time of Vorster 's visit to Jerusalem and twice served as prime minister during the 1980s as the alliance with the apartheid government solidified .
Five years ago , I asked him about the morality of ties with the white regime .
" Every decision is not between two perfect situations .
Every choice is between two imperfect alternatives .
At that time the movement of black South Africa was with ( PLO leader Yasser ) Arafat against us .
Actually , we did n't have much of a choice .
But we never stopped denouncing apartheid .
We never agreed with it , " he said
And a man like Vorster ?
" I would n't put him on the list of the greatest leaders of our time , " said Peres .
Yet attempts by the man who is now Israel 's president to portray his country as forced in to a reluctant alliance with an ideological foe are undermined by his enthusiastic expressions of common ideals .
In 1974 , Peres wrote to the South African information minister , Eschel Rhoodie , speaking of the " unshakeable foundations of our common hatred of injustice and our refusal to submit to it " .
Peres was not alone .
Rafael Eitan , the former Israeli military chief of staff , was among those who spoke of his sympathy for the white regime 's position .
So did Ariel Sharon , the future prime minister .
In the late 80s , as international pressure on the apartheid government grew , Israel 's political leadership decided it was time to retreat .
But Liel said that the security establishment balked .
" When we came to the crossroads in 86 - 87 , in which the foreign ministry said we have to switch from white to black , the security establishment said , ' You 're crazy , it 's suicidal ' .
They were saying we would n't have military and aviation industries unless we had had South Africa as our main client from the mid-1970s ; they saved Israel .
By the way , it 's probably true , " he said .
Archie Comics is introducing its first gay character later this year , in Veronica # 202 , one Kevin Keller .
In a move that I have to say I thought must have happened some time over the last twenty years but apparantly not .
The first appearance of the character also plays up on the decades of rumours regarding Jughead , famously averse to the ladies .
Not only is Jughead the first person in Riverdale that Kevin tells that he 's gay , Jughead does n't bat an eyelid , he just sees mischief to be played with Veronica .
And Jughead and Kevin then spend most of the issue hanging out together .
Here 's the big reveal ;
A lack of gay characters in the Archie world in the past has certainly made a plethora of jokes over the age , mostly involving Betty and Veronica ditching Archie and going off with each other .
And a desolate Archie been consoled , and possibly rimmed , by Jughead .
And it was n't that long ago that Archie threatened to sue comic book writer Roberto Aguirre - Sacasa for putting on a play , Archie 's Weird Fantasy , thatexplored , amongst thoer things , Archie sexuality .
And it 's hard not to recall this dialogue from Chasing Amy ;
INT BAR - NIGHT Holden , Banky , Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table drinking , talking , and smoking .
BANKY Archie , alright !
Archie and the Riverdale gang were a pure and fun- lovin bunch .
You can't find dysfunction in those comics , because they were just flat out wholesome .
HOOPER Archie and Jughead were lovers .
( sips his drink ) BANKY
Shut the fuck up .
HOOPER
It 's true .
Archie was the bitch and Jughead was the butch - that 's why Jughead wears that crown - looking hat all the time : he the king , of queen Archie 's world .
BANKY
Man , I feel a hate - crime coming on HOLDEN He 's got a point .
Archie never did settle on Betty or Veronica .
BANKY
Because he wanted them both at the same time , you assholes !
He never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three - way ! ... Alyssa exits to the night .
Holden stares after her .
Two beats later , Hooper and Banky enter , holding an ' Everything 's Archie ' comic between them .
BANKY
You 're insane .
Archie is not fucking Mister Weatherbee !
HOOPER
Deny , deny , deny .
( to Holden ) Where 's Alyssa ?
HOLDEN Huh !
Oh .
She left .
She said she 'd call you later .
BANKY ( off comic )
He 's just offering to help Archie with his homework !
HOOPER Read between the lines .
... HOLDEN ( beat ) Mister Weatherbee was n't really trying to fuck Archie , was he !
They begin exiting .
HOOPER
Hell no .
Weatherbee was Reggie 's bitch .
Archie Comics states that this move is " is part of the commitment to keep Archie properties reflective of the current world of teens and teen media " .
But , I mean , no , that 's never going to happen .
In comparison to Archie , Glee is a raw and gritty look at the underbelly of adolescence .
Because it 's not just gaiety that the Archie world cottons onto with this issue , but also a turn of phrase that 's rather 2008 .
And the real challenge for Archie Comics will not be in introducing their first gay character – but their second .
After all , there 's not much point in inventing the telephone , if you have n't built two .
There now follows some hilarious Archie clips for bloggers to use as they see fit …

I 'm a big fan of The Boston Globe 's photojournalism series , The Big Picture .
So much so , in fact , that I decided to dedicate a few hours this week to building a program that would not just download the entire series , but add caption metadata to each photo , since many are informative and look very nice in Picasa , for example .
Now , I 'm happy that the application is stable enough to release to the world in the Code section of my website .
Since I do n't want people to be hammering The Boston Globe 's servers , I 've made the script wait a fraction of a second between each request , and since I do n't want people to be able to disable this functionality , unfortunately only binaries will be available for the time being .
Windows binaries are available already , OS X and Linux binaries to come in a few days .
Indeed , if those at The Boston Globe have a problem with how the program operates , they need simply contact me and we can come to an agreement , but I 've worked hard to make sure that the program contacts their servers as little as possible .
Bug reports will be automatically submitted through this website too , but if you have any unforeseen problems ( e.g. a crash or a hang ) , email me with as much information as possible ( text describing the " Traceback " printed before the crash , what album / photo the program was working on , etc ) .
What can you do once you 've got the entire 2GB collection of photos downloaded ?
Well , you can simply look through them at your own pace and comfort , or indeed choose to create a montage screensaver from them ( although be warned - a screensaver that fades from a beautiful Antarctic landscape to a bloody photo of a victim of the war in Afghanistan might not be exactly what you had in mind . )
But in any event , hopefully it 'll be of some use .
Enjoy !
London based Hkanhpa Sadan is secretary general of the Kachin Development Networking Group .
He 's regularly in contact with the anti-dam activists in Burma .
The locals , mostly farmers , were forcefully expelled by the army and put in makeshift camps where they can't farm or fish .
Not to mention that their lives have been completely destroyed .
They 're 13 kilometres away from home and two kilometres from an army base .
That way the soldiers can keep an eye on them .
Future camps for the displaced , near to Myitkyina , Kachin province capital , January 2010 .
The dam wo n't benefit the locals in any way .
It 's Chinese people who will come to work there , so no jobs will be created .
When you think that the electricity produced will only serve China !
And shipping Chinese workers into the region - who do n't speak Burmese - will prove a real shock to the two communities .
On top of that , the impact on the environment will be enormous .
The Irrawaddy is an important source for the whole region , and this dam will limit its biodiversity .
It also needs to be pointed out that the dam will sit on a fault line .
If there should be an earthquake , a massive part of the region would be flooded and the repercussions could reach as far as towns like Mandalay [ situated on the banks of the Irrawaddy , central Burma ] .
All of our cultural heritage is based on this confluence [ the meeting of the Mali River and the N'Mai River ] .
At weddings , elders tell the story of the rivers meeting and becoming one .
How will we explain such a thing to younger generations now ?
Finally , the construction of the Myitsone Dam concerns our fight for self - autonomy in the province of Kachin .
For 15 years now , the Independent Army of Kachin has respected a ceasefire negotiated with the Burmese army , but the conflict still exists .
This dam will become a pretext for the junta to reinforce their troops and take further hold of the region . "

STATE PROSECUTORS have told an incredulous high court in India ’s western Goa province that white ants devoured 24kg of hashish from a police storehouse , precluding it from being offered as evidence .
“ Twenty - four of 280 kg of seized hashish was in an unsealed condition and has been devoured by white ants , ” lawyers told the Goa court this week while opposing a bail application of suspended police officer Ashish Shirodkar .
Along with five colleagues Mr Shirodkar is being tried under the Narcotics
Act for alleged links to an Israeli drug dealer operating in India ’s idyllic holiday spot where drugs are freely available .
Drug enforcement officials suspect the policemen sold the hashish on the thriving black market and blamed its disappearance on the termites .
Goa ’s furious state home minister Ravi Naik said “ heads would roll ” once responsibility was fixed for the “ white ant attack ” on the bags of hashish in police custody .
“ Responsibility has to be fixed in this matter , ” the minister thundered .
Termites are not the only ones blamed by India ’s creative police for destroying or consuming crucial evidence .
Some years ago police in New Delhi claimed that rats regularly consumed gallons of moonshine seized by them , spawning a credibility problem when the force was unable to produce samples of the seized liquor in court .
“ If we tell the judge it has been consumed by rats he laughs at us and holds us in contempt , ” said one police officer .
He said there had been instances where the officer in charge of the evidence room had been suspended for consuming or selling the moonshine .
But in most cases he was the innocent victim of a “ frame up ” by drunken rats , he claimed .
Other police stations began storing the liquor in tin trunks but seizures invariably spilled on to the ground , much to the delight of the alcoholic rats .
Brewing illicit liquor is rampant in and around Delhi , especially along its borders with other provinces such as Haryana .
This moonshine is much cheaper and far stronger than regular alcohol sold in liquor stores and favoured by labourers and farm workers .

THE latest evaluation of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program , the oldest and most extensive system of vouchers and charter schools in America , came out last month , and most advocates of school choice were disheartened by the results .
The evaluation by the School Choice Demonstration Project , a national research group that matched more than 3,000 students from the choice program and from regular public schools , found that pupils in the choice program generally had “ achievement growth rates that are comparable ” to similar Milwaukee public - school students .
This is just one of several evaluations of school choice programs that have failed to show major improvements in test scores , but the size and age of the Milwaukee program , combined with the rigor of the study , make these results hard to explain away .
So let ’s not try to explain them away .
Why not instead finally acknowledge that standardized test scores are a terrible way to decide whether one school is better than another ?
This is true whether the reform in question is vouchers , charter schools , increased school accountability , smaller class sizes , better pay for all teachers , bonuses for good teachers , firing of bad teachers — measured by changes in test scores , each has failed to live up to its hype .
It should come as no surprise .
We ’ve known since the landmark Coleman Report of 1966 , which was based on a study of more than 570,000 American students , that the measurable differences in schools explain little about differences in test scores .
The reason for the perpetual disappointment is simple : Schools control only a small part of what goes into test scores .
A WOMAN suspected of recruiting more than 80 female suicide bombers has confessed to organising their rapes so she could later convince them that martyrdom was the only way to escape the shame .
Samira Jassam , 51 , was arrested by Iraqi police and confessed to recruiting the women and orchestrating dozens of attacks .
In a video confession , she explained how she had mentally prepared the women for martyrdom operations , passed them on to terrorists who provided explosives , and then took the bombers to their targets .
" We arrested Samira Jassim , known as ' Um al - Mumenin ' , the mother of the believers , who was responsible for recruiting 80 women ' ' , Major General Qassim Atta said .
" She confessed her responsibility for these actions , and she confirmed that 28 attempts had been made in one of the terrorists ' strongholds , '' he said .
Samira Jassim was arrested on January 21 .
She is allegedly linked to the Ansar al - Sunnah insurgent group .
Two of the attacks for which Samira Jassim admitted responsibility in the video confession took place in Diyala province , in central Iraq , which is considered one of the most dangerous areas of the country .
The Associated Press reports US military figures indicate at least 36 female suicide bombers attempted or carried out 32 attacks last year .
Women are often allowed through military checkpoints without being searched , making it easier for them to hide explosives under their traditional robes .

SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) -- Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph
Becker 's call for a more bicycle - friendly capital city has failed to produce immediate results .
Becker says his bike was stolen Friday outside city hall after he spoke at the Utah Bike Summit across the street .
The thief used bolt cutters to cut the lock and took off with the silver , 15 - gear FILA bike as the all - day summit took place in the main Salt Lake City Library .
Becker , who phoned in a report to the police department , says he 'll use light rail and walk until either the bike is recovered or he buys a replacement .
Becker told the summit that cycling is " integral to having a high - quality community . "
The summit was devoted to a variety of issues facing cyclists .

Formula One World Championship Limited and Formula One Administration Limited ( together , the F1 Commercial Rights Holder ) and Full Throttle Productions , LP , promoter of the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ , announce that a historic agreement has been reached for Austin , Texas to serve as the host city of the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ for years 2012 through 2021 .
" We are extremely honoured and proud to reach an agreement with the F1 Commercial Rights Holder .
We have been diligently working together for several years to bring this great event to Austin , the State of Texas and back to the United States .
All parties involved have a great amount of trust and confidence in each other and are committed to establishing the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ in Austin , Texas as a prestigious global event , " stated Tavo Hellmund , Managing Partner of Full Throttle Productions , LP .
Bernie Ecclestone , President and CEO of the Formula One Group stated : " For the first time in the history of Formula One in the United States , a world - class facility will be purpose - built to host the event .
It was thirty years ago that the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ was last held on a purpose - built permanent road course circuit in Watkins Glen , NY ( 1961 - 1980 ) , which enjoyed great success .
Since then , Formula One has been hosted by Long Beach , Las Vegas , Detroit , Dallas and Phoenix all on temporary street circuits .
Indianapolis joined the ranks of host cities in 2000 when they added a road course inside the famed oval .
Lewis Hamilton won the last Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ in 2007 , signalling the end to eight years at Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
This however , will be the first time a facility is constructed from the ground up specifically for Formula One in the US . "
Mr. Hellmund added : " This is a case of the right timing in the right place .
As many Americans know , Austin has earned a reputation as one of the ' it ' cities in the United States .
Austin features that rare combination of ideal geographic location and beauty .
Its fine dining , world - renowned hospitality and excellent transportation infrastructure make Austin ideally suited to host and manage an event of this magnitude .
Few cities if any in America could rival the connectivity of all the key elements needed for hosting a Formula 1 event as well as Austin .
Now , many people around the world will have the opportunity to experience a world - class event , facility and city . "
" We are pleased Texas has the opportunity to be involved with Formula 1 and that an event of this magnitude is coming to Austin , " said Susan Combs , Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts .
" It has been a pleasure working with Full Throttle Productions , LP and Mr. Hellmund on this project .
Their tradition of producing successful major events coupled with a thirty year relationship with Mr. Ecclestone has us looking forward to this worldwide event and the benefits it will bring , including local job creation , increased tourism and a significant economic impact added to our state economy .
The visibility and prestige of this event will spotlight our state on an international stage . "
Texas Governor Rick Perry conveyed his enthusiasm for the project , explaining " Texas ' relatively strong economy continues to draw both national and international attention and I commend Comptroller Combs for her work in bringing this exciting event to the Lone Star State . "
City of Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell continued the positive sentiments , adding " The City of Austin will be proud to host this magnificent event and I look forward to welcoming the participants and fans of Formula One to our City . "
Full Throttle Productions , LP acknowledges with great appreciation the efforts of all parties involved including Bernie Ecclestone , President and CEO of the Formula One Group , and the local and state officials of Texas .
" It has been a shared vision and monumental task to reach this agreement .
We realize that over the last 30 years there have been one or two missing pieces from the previous editions of the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ .
We have a tremendous opportunity at hand to do it right - to feature Austin as the backdrop and produce the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix™ as one of the great sporting events in the world , " stated Hellmund .
In addition to the State of Texas being the 11th strongest economy in the world , it has more Fortune 500 company headquarters than any other state .
Key features of Austin include :
- State capital nicknamed ' Silicon Hills ' for being one of the most important regions in the US for the Technology Industry ;
- USA 's 15th largest city and is located 145 miles from Houston ( 4th largest US city ) , 70 miles from San Antonio ( 7th largest US city ) , and 180 miles from Dallas ( 8th largest US city ) , population in this triangle is over 22 million ;
- perfectly located geographically for North , South and Central American visitors ;
- over 130 daily departing international flights within 180 miles ;
- over 250,000 hotel rooms within 180 miles ;
- desirable year - round climate , with an average annual temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit ( 20 Celsius ) ;

Economic growth in Asia is the key driver for the big upswing in steel prices around the world , along with capacity utilization exceeding 85 percent .
The rollercoaster - shaped chart below from Macquarie Research shows the steel price trend since 2007 in the U.S. China , Europe and the world overall .
Starting in late 2007 , there was a near - vertical climb to a peak in mid-2008 , followed by ( as the global financial crisis and deep recession took shape ) a near - vertical plummet through early 2009 .
The broadening economic recovery has been accompanied by a bounce - back in steel to price levels not seen in more than a year – up nearly $ 200 per metric ton in the U.S. since the bottom .
In the past month fabricated steel prices have been matching or even exceeding the prices for iron ore and nickel ( for stainless steel ) after lagging these raw materials for the past year .
Macquarie believes that steel prices will continue to increase at least through the second quarter of 2010 , with a strengthening of economic recovery in the world outside China being a driver , before growth slows in the second half of the year .
It has been widely reported that Elvis Presley died in 1977 from cardiac arrhythmia , an irregular heartbeat , possibly brought on by drug dependency , obesity and a weak heart .
But the music legend 's longtime friend and physician , Dr. George “ Nick ” Nichopoulos , has put pen to paper for the first time and revealed his belief that it was chronic constipation that actually killed the King of Rock and Roll .
“ After he died we were n’t sure ( of the exact cause of death ) so I continued to do some research and I had some doctors call me from different places and different med schools that were doing research on constipation and different problems you can get into with it .
I just want to get the story straight – it all made sense with the new research that was done , ” the now retired Memphis M.D told Pop Tarts .
" Dr. Nick " was by Presley 's side for the last twelve years of his life and tried to resuscitate him the day he died .
He recently released the book “ The King and Dr. Nick ” about his time with The King , and his theory on the death that shocked America .
“ We did n’t realize until the autopsy that his constipation was as bad – we knew it was bad because it was hard for us to treat , but we did n’t realize what it had done , " the doctor explains of Elvis ' condition .
" We just assumed that the constipation was secondary to the meds that he was taking for his arthritic pain and for his insomnia . ”
According to Dr. Nick , the autopsy revealed that Presley ’s colon was 5 to 6 inches in diameter ( whereas the normal width is 2 to 3 inches ) and instead of being the standard 4 to 5 feet long , his colon was 8 to 9 feet in length .
“ The constipation upset him quite a bit because Elvis thought that he could handle almost anything , he thought he was really a man ’s man and he was n’t going to let something like this … he thought that this was a sign of weakness and he was n’t going to be weak , ” Nichopoulos said .
“ And it ’s not the kind of thing you table talk .
Back in the ‘ 60s and ‘ 70s you did n’t ’ talk about constipation much , you did n’t ’ hear people complaining about it , or saying what they did or how much trouble they had with it . ”
In 1975 , the primary treatment for this kind of problem involved removing part of the colon , known as a colostomy , and at the time Dr. Nick was in talks with a surgeon at the University of Memphis to perform the procedure .
However Presley ’s “ ego ” got in the way .
“ He would get embarrassed , he ’d have accidents onstage .
He ’d have to change clothes and come back because of the way we were trying to treat his constipation , ” Nichopoulos said .
“ So if they had done the colostomy then , he ’d probably still be here .
But it was n’t acceptable treatment at that time .
Now the treatment is short . ”
Nichopoulos also believes that Presley ’s prominent weight gain in the years prior to his death , was not a result of overeating or eating the wrong foods , as they initially assumed .
The doctor reveals that Elvis ' bloated appearance was due to his severe constipation .
“ It was really a physiological problem .
During the last few years we were going back and comparing pictures , some of them were taken just two weeks a part but he looked like he ’d gained 20 pounds when the only difference was that he had a good healthy bowel movement and then lost a lot of weight from that , ” Dr. Nick explained .
“ Usually you pass it all in two or three days , but at the autopsy we found stool in his colon which had been there for four or five months because of the poor motility of the bowel . ”
So how would Presley feel about all the details of this “ debilitating ” disease being made public ?
“ I still think it ’d be embarrassing for him , but that may be because we could n’t explain it at that time the way we can now .
But bowel paralysis is hereditary and you can in fact pass it down to your children , ” he continued .
“ His condition was either something he was born with like Hershberger ’s disease , or some viruses cause the paralysis of the nerves in the colon .
The nerves were n’t functioning enough in places , or were n’t functioning at all because his colon would not push food out , it would just accumulate . ”
And even through all the trials and tribulations of their personal and professional relationship , Nichopoulos will first and foremost remember the captivating yet compassionate person that was our beloved American icon , Elvis Presley .
“ He was well - written , a very kind person , a very giving person .
He was just one of a kind .
You could n’t ask for a better friend , ” Dr. Nick added .
“ The main thing that he enjoyed in life was doing his shows .
He would change from one person to another as soon as he walked on the stage .
He would just go through a metamorphosis – all of a sudden he flipped a switch and looked like a toy soldier dancing up there . ”
The Dell Streak , a miniature tablet computer that runs a version of the Google Android smartphone operating system , launches in the UK early next month , followed by releases in the U.S. and the rest of the Europe later in the summer .
Apple broke the dam by launching the iPad , so now we 're seeing lots of competing tablets show up .
We 've known that a Dell tablet has been coming for some months now .
These devices should be easier to use on the go in your busy lifestyle than laptops with keyboards — in theory , anyway .
The Streak will run Android 2.2 later this year , and with that upgrade will come Adobe Flash 10.1 support .
Features and Specs
The device has a 5 - inch screen with 800 x 480 pixel resolution , and Dell has modified Android to take advantage of the additional screen space .
For example , the notifications tray displays types of notifications that do n't show up on most Android smartphones .
The Streak can be used to surf the web , run Android apps , play music and videos and make phone calls , though it 's quite a bit larger than most phones .
You do n't have to hold it up to your ear , though ; you can use a 3.5 mm jack or Bluetooth to connect a headset .
Other features include multi - touch ( pinch - to - zoom is supported ) , GPS , 3G , Wi-Fi , a 1 GHz Snapdragon processor , a 5 - megapixel camera and a VGA front - facing camera for video chat functionality " down the road . "
Up to 32 GB of storage is supported .
Demonstration Video
Here 's a video demonstration straight from Dell .
Unfortunately , it does n't radiate either hipness or accessibility .
Dell will have to roll out some better marketing in the future if it wants this device to find mainstream success .

Until this season few outside Argentina , Italy and Spain had taken much notice of Diego Milito .
Given the exploits of Lionel Messi , Sergio Agüero , Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuaín , there seemed be no limelight to spare for any additional Argentinian forwards .
That changed last night , as Milito scored both goals in the European Cup final to bring his season of seasons to a perfect climax .
He was one of the players José Mourinho bought with the € 46 m ( £ 40 m ) that accompanied Samuel Eto'o in exchange for Zlatan Ibrahimovic last summer .
The others were Wesley Sneijder , Thiago Motta and Lucio , and together they provided the team with a spine .
Milito 's goals last night were the ultimate dividend for surely the most successful spending spree in football history , given that it opened the way to an unprecedented Italian treble .
If this was a match for the connoisseur rather than the dilettante , there was a real beauty in each of Milito 's strikes .
The goal that broke the deadlock in the 35th minute came from a route one move as straightforward in its conception yet as ravishing in its graceful execution as could be imagined , Milito heading Júlio César 's goal - kick sideways to Sneijder and running for the perfectly angled return pass before delaying his chip over Hans - Jorg Butt with marvellous delicacy .
The second was even lovelier .
This time it was Eto'o who measured the ideal ball from Sneijder 's usual position in the centre , inviting Milito to run down the inside - left channel .
The Argentinian feinted as he twisted Daniel Van Buyten this way and that before turning back inside , opening his body and guiding a shot with his right instep past Butt 's left hand .
Vision , timing , flawless technique and sangfroid – these two goals had everything a great striker needs , plus a sense of lyricism in the fluency of his movement .
The 30 - year - old Milito is hardly a fancy striker , not a Messi taking your breath away with a trick or a Tevez galvanising the stadium with elemental force , but his economy has been just as devastating this season , and it will be interesting to see the sort of treatment he receives this summer in South Africa from another Diego , the utterly unpredictable Maradona .
In many ways , not least physically but also in their fox 's nose for the scent of prey , Milito is reminiscent of a sturdier Claudio López .
Both men started their top - flight careers in Buenos Aires with Racing Club de Avellaneda before making their presence felt in Spain and Italy .
Milito moved first to Genoa , where he scored 33 goals in 59 matches in the Italian second division .
When Genoa were relegated as a result of a match - fixing scandal , he was sold for €5 m to Real Zaragoza , where he joined his younger brother , Gabriel , a defender , and spent three seasons in which he scored 53 goals in 108 matches .
Relegation for Zaragoza saw him return to Genoa for € 13 m in 2008 , where 24 goals in 31 Serie A matches put him second to Ibrahimovic among the league 's leading scorers and earned him a € 25 m move to Inter .
He has been the club 's outstanding player in a season that saw Mourinho fulfilling every one of the desires of his president , Massimo Moratti .
In the league there have been 22 goals in 35 appearances , including the last of the season away to Siena , plus the only goal of the Coppa Italia final against Roma earlier this month , and last night he added the fifth and sixth goals of his Champions League campaign .
Against Chelsea at San Siro he set his side on its way to an authoritative victory in the first leg when he capitalised on Sneijder 's probing pass , he scored the only goal of the first leg of the quarter - final against CSKA Moscow , and his header sealed the tremendous 3 - 1 win over Barcelona ( and brother Gabriel ) in the first leg of the semi-final .
A mature and self - effacing player , he has been the essence of reliable efficiency – and , as we saw last night , a goalscorer to rival the best in the history of the greatest of club competitions .
He put a foot wrong only once last night , when misjudging a pass that , had it been better directed , would have put Eto'o through for a third goal in the first minute of stoppage time .
Eto'o would have deserved it .
There had been much talk about the return to the Bernabéu of Sneijder and Arjen Robben , but the man with the most to prove in this grandest of arenas was the one who joined Real Madrid in 1997 , at the age of 16 , but made only three appearances in three seasons before being sent out on a series of loans and finally discarded .
Showing a remarkable altruism in fulfilling Mourinho 's tactical demands to the letter , Eto'o has been another hero of this remarkable season for the Nerazzurri , unselfishly helping to establish the platform for Milito 's historic deeds .

The Met 's plan to counter terrorism by putting up posters in internet cafes has been put into action , with broad warnings against " inappropriate " web and email use .
Two notices labelled " internet code of conduct " and " internet policy " have been spotted by patrons in London cafes .
" Do not access , upload , download or view any inappropriate material that causes or is likely to cause offence to any members of the public , including images of literature of a sexual , violent or extremist nature , " the Met cautions .
One of the posters warns that police will also frown on inappropriate or offensive emails .
Cooperating cafe owners will immediately terminate the user 's internet session and report them to police , the Met adds in both posters .
Downloading " certain " - coyly unspecified - material could constitute a criminal offence .
The posters , announced in March , are part of the " Prevent " strand of the Home Office 's counter - terrorism strategy , CONTEST .
Prevent has been widely criticised for alienating Islamic communities from police , rather than fostering the trust necessary for proper intelligence - gathering .
The Third Estate blog has picture of the Met 's new posters here . ®
On Saturday morning at the Cow Palace , a 15,000 seat indoor arena located just south of San Francisco , the nacho concession was surprisingly deserted .
But it was early yet , and given the long line of people who were waiting to gain access to the Prop 215 Tent at the International Cannabis and Hemp Expo , business would eventually pick up .
After four years of wrangling with local officials , the Expo 's promoters had managed to obtain a permit that would allow on - site pot-smoking at the event , and the Prop 215 Tent , where attendees equipped with medical marijuana cards could light up , vaporize , consume medibles , or otherwise treat themselves , was the early favorite for most popular attraction .
Even for those without a card , the Expo was fairly mind - blowing .
There are hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in California now , and between them and all the illicit dealing that goes on , annual marijuana sales in the state are estimated at approximately $ 14 billion .
Given the state 's terminally ill budget , proposals to legalize cannabis for all adults is gaining momentum :
A marijuana tax wo n't cure a $ 20 billion shortfall , but at least it could offer some minor pain relief .
In November , residents will vote on Tax Cannabis 2010 , an initiative that would make it legal for anyone 21 or older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana while giving local governments the power to tax and regulate commercial production .
Meanwhile , California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is pushing a similar proposal in the state legislature that would legalize marijuana for adult usage and subject it to a $ 50 per ounce excise tax .
While either proposal could end up generating as much as $ 1.4 billion in revenue for the state , what the International Cannabis and Hemp Expo made clear is how much ancillary economic activity the trade is already generating .
With approximately 150 exhibitors showcasing their wares and pitching their services , the Expo is n't quite ready to fill up a Vegas - sized hall , but for a semi- permitted industry where severe legal repercussions are still a very tangible cost of doing business , the degree to which the marijuana trade has mainstreamed itself in the last few years , and the speed at which it continues to evolve , is pretty astounding .
Everywhere you looked , there were little bowls of candy , free branded pens , booth babes handing out sales brochures , and all the other hallmarks of traditional American enterprise in convention mode .
The air was thick with super - potent , freshly harvested business cards .
Gone are the days when triple - chambered bongs stood as the most advanced pot-related hardware for sale in commercial venues .
At the Expo , a company called GrowOp Technology was demo'ing the Little Bud , a hydroponic grow room encased in a 40 - foot truck trailer .
Equipped with a 400 plant cloning station , carbon air scrubbers , a remote surveillance system that you can monitor via your iPhone , and a bunch of other stuff that was making burly , tattooed dudes gasp like four - year - olds ogling bright red fire engines , it retails for $ 49,990 and offers maximum discretion , portability , and security straight off the lot .
A 53 - foot version , the Big Bud , goes for $ 59,990 and financing is available .
Grow Op co-founder Tom Del Sol told the Oakland Tribune the company has already taken 37 orders for the recently introduced units .
For those without the space to accommodate a Big Bud , there were at least two other vendors of smaller prefab grow units and also Good Green Builders , a construction company whose founders were billing it as the first licensed general contractor in the Bay Area to specialize in building custom indoor hydroponic grow rooms .
There was an insurance company offering " live plant coverage , " worker 's compensation policies , employment practices liability protection , and various other forms of coverage for medical cannabis cultivators , dispensaries , caregivers , edible manufacturers , and delivery services .
Representatives from Local Union 13 , a non-profit agricultural cooperative that wants to bring health care and retirement benefits to the workers who process crops after they 've been harvested , amongst other objectives , were trying to recruit new members .
Oaksterdam University , an institution in Oakland , California whose curriculum includes semester - long classes in horticulture , dispensary management , cooking with cannabis , procurement and allocation , and numerous other subjects , was advertising upcoming courses .
Staffers from Confidential Mediation Services were pitching their ability to resolve disputes that arise between parties who are n't exactly eager to expose the details of their business operations to the court system .
" This is still an industry that 's transitioning from the underground , " said company founder Daniel Bornstein , a San Francisco attorney who also operates a medical marijuana dispensary .
" There are n't many contracts involved . "
There is , on the other hand , quite a bit of advertising .
While the local alt - weeklies do a brisk trade in ads for dispensaries , collectives , doctors who specialize in writing recommendations for card - seeking patients , and home - delivery services like the Canny Bus , the industry has spawned a number of standalone publications like West Coast Leaf and West Coast Cannabis that are fat with ads too .
Rosebud , which bills itself as a " hydroponics growers ' lifestyle magazine , " is the newest , thickest , glossiest entrant in the bunch .
Its covers features Hollywood stars like Jeff Bridges , Viggo Mortensen , and Brad Pitt .
Its issues run to 170 pages or more and are filled with full - page color ads for seed suppliers , high - voltage lighting controllers , organic plant nutrients , LED lighting systems , stainless steel bud trimmers , and also PETA , Chevrolet , the American Red Cross , and Cadillac .
The last time a local magazine was this thick with ads it was the dot - com era , just a few months before the monumental collapse .
Then , the good times were mostly being fueled by venture capitalists puffing billions into enterprises with no real prospects of ever making a profit .
This time , the good times are being fueled by consumers willing to pay $ 300 or more per ounce for products like Grandaddy Purple and Hindu Kush Skunk .
How increased legalization — and the additional taxes and regulation that would come with it — might impact the dynamic entrepreneurism that currently informs the medical marijuana industry is hard to predict .
But at the Cow Palace on Saturday , at least , the industry 's future looked as bright as the interior of a mobile grow lab equipped with 1000 watt MH / HPS lights and highly reflective wall coverings .

( Wired ) --
For years , the U.S. Navy has been pursuing a workable ray gun that could provide a leap ahead in ship self - defenses .
Now , with a series of tests of a system called the Laser Weapon System , or LaWS ) , it may be one step closer to that goal .
Naval Sea Systems Command ( NAVSEA ) , the service 's technology development arm , announced today that LaWS had " successfully tracked , engaged , and destroyed " a drone in flight , during an over - the - water engagement at San Nicholas Island , California .
It 's certainly not the first time lasers have shot down an unmanned aerial vehicle -- last year , the Air Force zapped several drones with beam weapons in a series of tests at China Lake , California , -- but this test brings an additional bit of realism -- and an extra technical challenge .
Laser beams can lose strength as they move through the moist , salty sea atmosphere above the sea , so the Navy needs directed - energy weapons that can work effectively on ships .
The LaWS is essentially a laser upgrade to the MK 15 Close In Weapon System ( CIWS ) , a.k.a. the Phalanx gun , a radar - guided autocannon that is already installed on Navy surface combatants .
According to NAVSEA , the system tested ( shown here ) fired a laser through a beam director installed on a tracking mount , which in turn was controlled by a Mk 15 CIWS .
That 's the basically same system that controls the Phalanx .
It represents a possible next step for the Phalanx system , which is currently limited by the range of its 20 mm autocannon ( Raytheon , manufacturer of the Phalanx , is also marketing a missile system to replace the gun ) .
The Phalanx is a last line of defense against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles and hostile aircraft , but the laser would n't replace the gun completely .
Theoretically , directed energy weapons would increase the range of the system , but you would still have the gun as a backup if the laser fails to do the job .
LaWS might also have other applications : land - based Phalanx guns have been used to shoot down incoming rockets and mortars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and a laser Phalanx could -- theoretically -- avoid the problem of the " 20 mm shower " ( unexploded rounds falling back to earth ) .

More handsets sold in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2010 were running atop Google ’s Android ( s goog ) than Apple ’s ( s aapl ) iPhone operating system , according to the latest findings of The NPD Group .
Android smartphones accounted for 28 percent of sales ; the iPhone , just 21 percent ( both still lagged behind Research In Motion ’s BlackBerry ( s rimm ) platform , which was the market leader at 36 percent ) .
So what ’s propelling Android past the iPhone ?
[ digg=http://digg.com/tech_news/Why_U_S_Android_Handset_Sales_Are_Outpacing_the_iPhone]
There ’s the obvious explanation : Exclusivity on AT&T ’s network limits the potential sales for Apple .
As Verizon announced on its most recent quarterly earnings call , it has more than 92.8 million subscribers , none of which can buy an iPhone for use on the network — although a recent poll found that a majority of them want one .
Enter Google Android phones , whose user interfaces are similar to the iPhone and have access to a growing software store , now estimated at 50,000 applications .
Verizon is helping the Android cause , too — it devoted $ 100 million in advertising muscle to back the Android - powered Motorola ( s mot ) Droid .
An additional factor is the number of handset choices .
By providing its Android operating system to any hardware manufacturer that wants it , Google allows for a near limitless number of handset variances for consumers to choose from .
iPhone selection , on the other hand , is akin to choosing the paint color of the old Ford Model T’s that only came in black — you can have any iPhone model you like right now , so long as it ’s an iPhone 3G or 3GS .
Finally , the many permutations of Android devices offers another advantage — pricing flexibility based on the hardware used and the features offered .
The NPD Group cites an average smartphone price of $ 151 in the first quarter of 2010 , roughly half of the $ 299 price tag for a top - shelf iPhone .
Apple offers subsidized models at $ 99 and $ 199 , but most subsidized Android phone prices top out at $ 199 and go down from there .
The Samsung Behold 2 running Android is currently free with a service plan at T - Mobile , for example .
With so many choices , consumers can find Android units for well under $ 99 these days and can shop around in a greater range of price points .

Ho-ly shit .
I was in the middle of doing my show on stocktwits TV when it happened ( you can watch the video here ) .
The ES dropped from 1125 to 1066 in a matter of a few minutes .
I spent the entire show looking at ways to sell vol and fade the move as well as expected targets .
I have n't watched a bit of news after the close , and only perused a few blogs after -- but most of the commentary is simply hindsight analysis and not looking at the factors behind it .
There are many unpopular things to be said about this move , I might as well get them out -- so here are some unpopular beliefs that I hold about this move :
1 . You could not have made money intraday
At least , the odds of it happening were low .
This move was due to a lack of liquidity .
The bids simply fell out of the market .
I know many are thinking " if I only had shorted BIDU " or " if I only had got long AAPL at 200 " -- that does not show the complexities of order flow .
I know many who put buy orders in at a price and the stocks dropped below their limit , but they did n't get filled .
The structural integrity of execution platforms were put to the limit-- IBKR locked up , Schwab locked up , AMT locked up .
There were also stop loss orders that some traders had , and the market blew past their order .
If it 's a stop market order , usually it hits the market at the bid-- but because there was no liquidity , there were instances in which the stock blew through their stop and reversed back above their stop price before they could get a decent fill .
It was the same thing in the options market .
Anyone who says they successfully scalped options in that 30 min period is a liar .
The market makers saw liquidity dried up , so they blew out the bid / ask spread in options because they do n't want to take the other side of the trade .
The only place I think provided enough liquidity were the futures markets .
But even trying to get a market order hit was very , very difficult .
2 . This move is not like 2008
Too many comparisons are being drawn with the crash of 2008 .
I do n't think this is an apt comparison .
Rather , I think the 1987 crash is much more indicitave of the price action we saw .
In 1987 the markets became very illiquid and program trading got a little out of hand .
So if you think we 're going to test the lows , look at the price action post - 1987 .
3 . The Move was not based on fundamentals
There is a bit of a debt crisis going on in the EU right now as the PIIGS ( Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece , Spain ) are seeing extreme weakness .
There 's also weakness in commodities , the carry trade , etc .
Let me make this very clear : this move had nothing to do with Greece , oil spills , dollar strength , or corporate earnings .
You have to go deeper .
4 . The Move was not based on technicals
You thought I was heading to technicals ?
Nope .
Basic technical analysis seeks to identify supply and demand as seen from a time series analysis of price .
We had some topping patterns and major moving averages that put the expected move of this pullback to around 113 .
Basic technical analysis , however , assumes a market .
When we do n't get proper order flow , six - sigma events can occur .
5 . The Move was based on market structure .
You have to dig below what most people call " technical analysis " and actually look at how the market is structured and who is participating in it .
Large , institutional players seek to allocate capital through various assets to try and optimize their portfolio .
Hedge funds look to speculate ( or actually hedge ) on future market movement .
Quant firms seek mean reversion and rebates by providing liquidity .
The robustness of the system is illusory , however , when someone modifies the market structure .
Generally , a bid will form based on mean reversion or as volatility arbs come in line .
That did n't happen today and it showed how fragile the structure can be -- the sheer magnitude of this range is comparable only 3 other times in the history of modern markets .
6. High Frequency
Trading broke , then saved the market
This will probably be the most controversial thing I 'll say .
Quant firms have been keeping the market in a fairly low volatility state as they seek mean reversion and arbitrage strategies .
By doing this they provide liquidity in the market for institutional players and funds .
Their risk models are based on statistical distributions , behavioral finance , and other voodoo .
When these models go out of wack , they can exacerbate the situation -- that did occur in 2008 when liquidity dropped out of the system .
However , I feel that program trading ( eventually ) provided the liquidity for the snapback of this rally .
If it were n't for quants betting on extreme mean reversion , we would have held a much deeper selloff comparable to 1987 .
What evidence do I have of this ?
The sheer snapback of the price in such a short amount of time .
It certainly was n't fundamental traders who all of a sudden found " value " in the market with a trailing P/E .
The only sort of quick analysis that provides that kind of price action are done by non-humans at quantitative firms , and they saved the market from something much , much worse .
7 . Vol still remains a sale
Before this event , we 'd seen very , very low volatility readings across the board .
Implied SPX volatility came in around 15 , and realized ( actual ) volatility was in the single digits .
Because of this event , we will have disaster imprinting stuck in the mind of discretionary traders and investors ; also , we will see risk models adjusted to a higher assumed volatility .
That means premiums will stay elevated across the board in domestic equities .
A constant bidup in premiums means the environment will be ripe for vol selling , regardless of direction .
Strategies that did n't work so well in the first half of the year will improve going into the second .

Baking soda is one of those household items that can be used for just about any task .
It has the power to ease the distress of indigestion , it can get stains out of your clothes , and it can even tenderize beef .
Baking soda has been praised on it ’s ability to clean and whiten teeth .
Many toothpastes on the market include baking soda in their ingredients .
But is it safe to brush your teeth with baking soda ?
Baking soda has been used as a tooth cleaning agent since the turn of the 18th century .
People would combine hydrogen peroxide with baking soda to turn it into a “ paste ” , which was very effective as a tooth cleaner .
Baking soda has abrasive properties which can scrub stains from the tooth enamel .
Tobacco , tea , and coffee products can all leave to dark stains on teeth .
When baking soda is used , these stains are scraped away by the abrasiveness of the baking soda .
One way to use baking soda to brush your teeth is to use it all by itself .
Put about one fourth of a teaspoon of baking soda into a bowl .
That amount is plenty , you can even use less if you want .
Run your tooth brush under the water to get the bristles wet .
Dampening the bristles will make it easier for the baking soda to stick to your tooth brush .
Once the bristles are wet , put the tooth brush into the bowl of baking soda .
Get as much of it onto the brush as you can .
Brush your teeth the way you normally do .
It will feel a little gritty , and may taste bad , but it will leave your teeth feeling fresh and clean afterward .
Be sure to rinse your mouth out thoroughly with water .
Another way to use baking soda as a toothpaste , is to sprinkle a tiny amount of it onto your normal toothpaste .
By itself , baking soda has an undesirable taste .
By adding it to regular toothpaste , you can get the abrasive action of the baking soda , and still get the minty flavor of regular toothpaste .
Since baking soda is an abrasive , it ’s best to brush very lightly on your teeth , especially around the gum line .
There are conflicting answers to the question “ Is it safe to brush your teeth with baking soda ? ” .
Everyone ’s teeth are different .
Some teeth have weak enamel , and others have very strong enamel .
There was one instance where an older couple used baking soda as a toothpaste every day and had no problems .
When they passed away , well into their 90’s , they both still had all of their teeth , and their tooth enamel was strong and intact .
On the other hand , there have been instances of people having very sensitive reactions to the baking soda .
Even when the baking soda is mixed in with regular toothpaste , their teeth were still sensitive .
In the end , it ’s up to the individual person to determine the answer to the “ Is it safe to brush your teeth with baking soda ? ” question .
The best way to determine whether it ’s right or not for you , is to give it a try .
If you feel any pain or discomfort using baking soda as a toothpaste , then stop immediately , and switch back to your normal toothpaste .
If you feel no pain , then use it as often as you ’d like .
Because baking soda is an abrasive , you might not want to use it every day .
However , if you want to get tough tea or coffee stains off of your teeth , then baking soda is a good option .
Just remember to brush gently , especially along the gum line .

What ?!
Does something about this article seem odd , not as you remember , or too good to be true ?

One of the most popular Macintosh programs of all time will be resurrected this weekend when Apple ships the iPad.
Eudora , the venerable email client created by Steve Dorner while at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign in 1988 , purchased by Qualcomm in 1992 , and maintained through its eventual demise in 2006 , will return to life as a free iPad - only app .
An undergraduate interning at Qualcomm named Paul O’Walty , while engaged on some cleanup of the Eudora group ’s revision control system , discovered the Eudora source code and decided to port it to the iPhone OS , with the specific intent of seeing if he could get it to run acceptably on the iPad .
Although Qualcomm has reportedly signed off on the release of Eudora for iPad , due to O’Walty ’s reliance on the open - source aspects of the Eudora code base and use of the Mail framework on the iPad , he did admit to some trepidation about whether or not Apple would approve Eudora for iPad , since it replicates the functionality of the iPad ’s Mail app .
Eudora will be available only for the iPad ; it was n’t practical to convert it to the small screens of the iPhone and iPod touch .
From what I ’ve seen of the beta O’Walty sent me , Eudora on the iPad will look and work as much like the classic version of Eudora as possible given the iPad ’s multitouch interface .
Standard Eudora features like a message preview pane with content concentrator ( for showing threaded messages without displaying quoted content ) convert well to the iPad ’s 1024 by 768 pixel screen , which , if you think about it , is significantly larger than the screens commonly available when Eudora was first developed in 1988 .
Also , the Mailbox and Transfer menus work much as they did in the Mac version , providing quick , hierarchical access to mailboxes without wasting screen real estate on unwieldy panes like other Mac email clients .
Fortunately , one of my favorite Eudora tricks – Option - clicking on a piece of metadata in mailbox windows to select messages with similar metadata – is available when the iPad is outfitted with a keyboard via either the iPad Keyboard Dock or a Bluetooth keyboard .
O’Walty admitted that he had to cut some corners when porting some of the last - century Eudora code to run on the iPad .
Although Eudora for iPad looks and works much like the classic program , some of Eudora ’s traditional – and much - vaunted – flexibility is missing .
Most notably , although the essential option “ Waste cycles drawing trendy 3D junk ” remains ( and checking it does reduce Eudora ’s performance on the iPad ) , the vast majority of Eudora ’s 1,031 x-eudora - settings options have n’t yet been brought over from the original code base .
Nevertheless , for die - hard Eudora users , the release of Eudora for the iPad will recreate a familiar and highly productive environment on the new computing device .
Apache Hadoop , the open - source version of Google 's MapReduce architecture named after a kid 's stuffed elephant , is still working to tame the 1.0 beast .
Only a year ago , Hadoop hit its first stable release , a release that - in true open - source fashion - could n't be called version 1.0 but contained two decimal points : version 0.20.0 .
Despite that , Hadoop is running search on some of the internet 's largest sites .
Lovers on eHarmony , job seekers on LinkedIn and social networkers on Fox Interactive Media - Rupert Murdoch 's media arm running MySpace , Photobucket , and Rotten Tomatoes - are getting their queries answered thanks to Hadoop .
During a recent interview with The Reg , Hadoop co-founder Doug Cutting confessed his surprise at Hadoop 's level of uptake and success .
" I started Nutch [ Hadoop 's precursor ] trying to think about web search ... I was trying to be provocative , " he said .
" I did n't see us outside the production environment of building these big web indexes . "
And yet , a year since that first stable version and months after Cutting discussed Hadoop 1.0 at ApacheCon last year , version 1.0 - promised for 2010 - is proving elusive .
The project is working towards a goal that 's a must for any piece of technology that wants to be taken seriously in business : the ability to upgrade without injecting breaking changes , changes that force users to re-install their software or cause data loss .
In Hadoop 's case , the goal is to let users upgrade parts of a data center cluster without uprooting the whole thing .
Different priorities
Cutting says that his former employer , Yahoo ! , a huge sponsor and early fan whose support made Hadoop possible for others , is n't helping .
Yahoo !
remains Hadoop 's single largest contributor , and that 's a challenge , Cutting says , because Yahoo ! has a slightly different focus than the rest of the project .
The web 's second largest search property , he says , has been working on security updates so people can share large clusters in private , without others knowing what they 're doing .
While security is a goal of Hadoop .
1.0 , Cutting says that Yahoo !'s focus comes at the expense of work on a broader front .
" That 's taken some of the steam of the 1.0 efforts , " Cutting said .
" Hadoop 1.0 has not made as much progress as we'd have hoped . "
It 's an interesting twist .
Yahoo !'s intervention in Hadoop proved decisive in the early days , helping boost the project to success .
With Google thrashing the company in the 2000s , Yahoo !
clearly saw something in Hadoop that few others had noticed .
Yahoo !
saw it not just as web search indexing project , but as an architecture that could handle distributed number crunching for all sorts of services .
That architecture is based on Google 's own distributed file system ( GFS ) and MapReduce .
Before GFS and MapReduce , Cutting had built a full - scale web search engine called Nutch , something that started in 2002 .
However , things hit a wall .
" We had something that kind of worked and was in theory scalable to the entire web , but was very painful to use on anything more than 100 million web pages , " Cutting said .
The TTC is piloting solar - powered next - vehicle - arrival signs at Broadview and Dundas West stations , at a retrofit cost of about $ 15,000 for the two .
Here ’s how they ’ll work :
• Flexible solar panels are placed on the shelter roof ( photo 1 ) .
They ’re not quite as efficient as flat panels , but conform to the TTC ’s shelter design and are vandal - resistant .
• The power is fed into two batteries stashed under each bench inside the shelter .
The batteries have a five - year lifespan , cost about $ 100 each and hold power up to five days , so the signs still work at night .
• The signs ( photo 2 ) tell riders when they can expect the next streetcar , with information transmitted via cellular technology .
Most transit shelters around the world contain a solar component , say TTC officials .
So experts here will be looking at other places the technology can be applied .
One possibility is TTC shelters on Spadina Ave .
The TTC does n't have the authority to install solar power in most bus and streetcar shelters , however , because they 're governed by the city ’s street furniture contract with Astral Outdoor .
But LED signs will be going into shelters on all but the 502 and 503 Downtowner cars this year .
Those streetcars , which run along Kingston Rd. , are experiencing some data issues the TTC is still working out , said transit spokesperson Brad Ross .
Some 52 shelters , nine streetcar bays at subway stations , and five subway stations are being outfitted with screens that let riders know in real - time when they can expect the next two cars .
LCD screens are used inside subway stations , LED versions in the shelters .
By July , the streetcar system will also have text messaging at all 800 stops , so riders can receive that information on their cellphones .
That convenience wo n’t be available for buses until next year , because they have n’t been retrofitted with the necessary GPS equipment yet .
LED displays will also be going into 298 city bus stops when the GPS upgrade is complete .
Hall plays a vigilante murder scene analyst
Dexter star Michael C. Hall has recovered fully from cancer and has returned to work , his wife Jennifer Carpenter has said .
Hall , 39 , announced in January he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer that attacks the lymph nodes .
Carpenter said Hall had been " incredibly brave " to make his condition public .
In his award - winning role , Hall plays Dexter Morgan , a Miami police analyst who moonlights as a serial killer .
Hall went into remission and continued treatment at a health centre near Los Angeles .
Dexter has been a big hit with viewers on both sides of the Atlantic and Hall has won much praise for his performance .
Earlier this year , the actor won a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Golden Globe Award .
In the show Dexter is a serial killer who targets other murderers .
Carpenter also stars as Dexter 's seemingly unknowing sister .
Beck novel depicts America sliding into civil war
Fox News commentator Glenn Beck has indicated that his novel , due out in June , will portray America in the throes of civil war .
In a recent appearance before about 8,000 supporters in Orlando , Fla. , Beck described the book as " a story of America at a time much like today where the people are confused and they 're being lied to , " according to Will Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News , who attended Beck ’s American Revival event .
Bunch reported that Beck told the gathering the story depicts the rise of a citizen ’s organization called the Founders Keepers , “ a group of people that just wo n’t give up . ”
What follows , Beck said , is “ a battle and a civil war , and life is upside - down planetwide . "
On its Amazon page , the book is titled “ The Overton Window . ”
Beck offered insight into his inspiration for the title on a Fox appearance during which he mentioned the book by a slightly different name : “ We Are Americans : The Overton Window . ”
The term Overton Window refers to a theory developed by Joe Overton , a former vice president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy , in which political ideas move in and out of a window of public acceptability .
The storyline of the novel has prompted some in the blogosphere to worry that Beck is inciting civil insurrection .
As he told the crowd in Orlando , " If we do n't face the truth right now , we 'll be dead in five years -- this country can't survive . "
He also advised his listeners to stockpile food , saying : " I am incredibly prepared . "
Here is news of the Third World War .
The United States has invaded Africa .
US troops have entered Somalia , extending their war front from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Yemen and now the Horn of Africa .
In preparation for an attack on Iran , " bunker - buster " bombs are said to be arriving at the US base on the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean .
In Gaza , the sick and abandoned population , mostly children , is being entombed behind underground American - supplied walls to reinforce a criminal siege .
In Latin America , the Obama administration has secured seven bases in Colombia from which to wage a war of attrition against the popular democracies in Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador and Paraguay .
Meanwhile , the secretary of " defence " , Robert Gates , complains that " the general [ European ] public and the political class " are so opposed to war , they are an " impediment " to peace .
Remember , this is the month of the March Hare .
According to an American general , the invasion of Afghanistan is not so much a real war as a " war of perception " .
Thus , the recent " liberation of the city of Marjah " from the Taliban 's " command - and - control structure " was pure Hollywood .
Marjah is not a city ; there was no Taliban command and control .
The heroic liberators killed the usual civilians , the poorest of the poor .
Otherwise , it was fake .
A war of perception is meant to provide fake news for the folks back home , to make a failed colonial adventure seem worthwhile and patriotic , as if The Hurt Locker were real and the parades of flag - wrapped coffins through Wootton Bassett were not a cynical propaganda exercise .
Silent witness
“ War is fun " , the helmets in Vietnam used to say with bleakest irony , meaning that if a war is shown to have no purpose other than to justify voracious power in the cause of lucrative fanaticisms such as the weapons industry , the danger of truth beckons .
This danger can be illustrated by comparing the liberal perception of Tony Blair in 1997 as one " who wants to create a world [ where ] ideology has surrendered entirely to ' values ' " ( Hugo Young , the Guardian ) to the public reckoning today of a liar and war criminal .
Western war - states such as the US and Britain are threatened not by the Taliban or any other introverted tribesmen in faraway places , but by the anti-war instincts of their own citizens .
Consider the draconian sentences handed down in London to scores of young people who protested against Israel 's assault on Gaza in January last year .
Following demonstrations in which paramilitary police " kettled " thousands , first offenders have received two and a half years in prison for minor offences that would not normally carry a custodial sentence .
On both sides of the Atlantic , serious dissent exposing illegal war has become a serious crime .
Silence in other high places allows this moral travesty .
Across the arts , literature , journalism and the law , liberal elites , having hurried away from the debris of Blair and now Obama , continue to fudge their indifference to the barbarism and aims of western state crimes by promoting retrospectively the evils of their convenient demons , such as Saddam Hussein .
With Harold Pinter gone , try compiling a list of well - known writers , artists and advocates whose principles are not consumed by the " market " or neutered by their celebrity .
Who among them has spoken out about the holocaust in Iraq during almost 20 years of lethal blockade and assault ?
And all of it has been deliberate .
On 22 January 1991 , the US Defence Intelligence Agency predicted in impressive detail how a blockade would systematically destroy Iraq 's clean water system and lead to " increased incidences , if not epidemics , of disease " .
So the US set about eliminating clean water for the Iraqi population : one of the causes , Unicef noted , of the deaths of half a million Iraqi infants under the age of five .
But this extremism apparently has no name .
Partners in crime
Norman Mailer once said he believed the US , in its endless pursuit of war and domination , had entered a " pre-fascist era " .
Mailer seemed tentative , as if trying to warn about something even he could not quite define .
" Fascism " is not right , for it invokes lazy historical precedents , conjuring yet again the iconography of German and Italian repression .
On the other hand , American authoritarianism , as the American cultural critic Henry Giroux pointed out recently , is " more nuance , less theatrical , more cunning , less concerned with repressive modes of control than with manipulative modes of consent " .
This is Americanism , the only predatory ideology to deny that it is an ideology .
The rise of tentacular corporations that are dictatorships in their own right and of a military that is now a state within the state , set behind the façade of the best democracy 35,000 Washington lobbyists can buy , and a popular culture programmed to divert and stultify , is without precedent .
More nuanced , perhaps , but the results are unambiguous .
Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck , the senior UN officials in Iraq during the US - and British - led blockade , are in no doubt they witnessed genocide .
They saw no gas chambers .
Insidious , undeclared , even presented wittily as enlightenment on the march , the Third World War and its genocide proceeded , human being by human being .
In the coming election campaign in Britain , the candidates will refer to this war only to laud " our boys " .
The candidates are almost identical political mummies , shrouded in the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes .
As Blair demonstrated a mite too eagerly , the British elite love America because America allows them to barrack and bomb the natives and call themselves " partners " .
We should interrupt their fun .
Greenpeace Argentina publicó hoy un aviso en el diario " The Washington Post " en el que critica a la presidenta Cristina Fernández de Kirchner por el proyecto de construcción de una usina a carbón en la Patagonia .
El aviso , titulado " Don´t cry for me , Patagonia " ( No llores por mí , Patagonia ) , se opone a la decisión del Gobierno nacional de avanzar con la construcción de una planta de energía en base a carbón en la localidad de Río Turbio , Santa Cruz .
La publicación coincide con la visita oficial que realiza la presidenta Cristina Fernández de Kirchner en estos momentos a los Estados Unidos .
El texto publicado en la edición de este lunes del Washington Post sostiene que " una mujer con visión de largo plazo no pondría en riesgo los glaciares y las reservas de agua de la Argentina " .
Greenpeace le señala a la Presidenta , además , que " invirtiendo en empleos verdes y promoviendo la energía eólica en la Patagonia , su administración tiene la oportunidad de generar un suministro eléctrico limpio , eficiente , moderno y descentralizado " .
" Comenzar a utilizar carbón como fuente de energía a gran escala es una total irracionalidad ambiental y económica que debemos evitar .
Argentina tiene muchas y mejores opciones para desarrollar en materia energética " , sostuvo Juan Carlos Villalonga , director de Campañas de Greenpeace .
La organización ambientalista había denunciado que el Gobierno nacional realizó pagos por 142 millones de dólares a la empresa española Isolux Corsán - constructora de la central de Río Turbio - un año antes de la presentación del estudio de impacto ambiental de la obra .
" Seguimos esperando las explicaciones del Gobierno Nacional y de Isolux .
También nos gustaría ver a los funcionarios provinciales , que estos días se han enojado mucho con Greenpeace , poner la misma energía en exigir a Isolux una explicación sobre los pagarés y el estudio de impacto ambiental " , concluyó Villalonga .
A team from NASA and Boeing completed the first phase of flight testing of its blended wing body design that could represent the airliner of the future .
The airplane is based on a design where the fuselage provides a significant part of the lift .
Such designs , as shown above , could carry hundreds of airline passengers in the large center section while burning much less fuel than today ’s airliners of similar capacity .
Well , except that the airplane pictured above is only about one foot tall .
The test aircraft is only a 8.5 percent scale model with a 21 foot wingspan , but engineers at NASA ’s Dryden Flight Research Center were able to demonstrate the tailless aircraft can be safely flown , and more importantly safely landed in a variety of conditions .
The X - 48B program is part of NASA ’s new Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project aimed at developing more fuel efficient and quieter aircraft for the future .
ERA Project manager Fay Collier says the completion of the final test flight last month demonstrated the feasibility of a blended wing body design , “ the team has proven the ability to fly tailless aircraft to the edge of the low - speed envelope safely . ”
We spoke with an X - 48B test pilot back in October , and learned that despite its size , the blended wing body aircraft provides the same challenges as any aircraft in flight testing .
One of the big challenges the X - 48B team has been working on during the past several months is the aircraft ’s handling characteristics at the lower speeds , particularly during the landing .
In the final test flights , the pilots were able to purposely exceed the normal limits of the aircraft in terms of variables such as angle of attack and side slip angle .
During the tests , the onboard computer was able to safely control the aircraft allowing the pilot to return to normal flight conditions .
After a new flight computer is installed later this year , the X - 48B will continue a new phase of flights tests .
The team is also preparing a second hybrid wing body aircraft , the X - 48C for future flight tests .
The - C model is designed to have a lower noise profile to keep people around airports as happy as the airline bean counters paying the fuel bills .

Recently reunited German electro - punk spazzes Atari Teenage Riot are still causing controversy .
ATR 's iPhone app has been delayed by the German iTunes store due to a dispute over its content .
The free app is set to feature every ATR album , song , and video , as well as photos , news updates , and more .
But it also included something called " Riotsounds Produce Riots " , an audio player that features sounds that ATR used at a May Day protest in 1999 , at which the band members were arrested .
According to a press release , those sounds include " very low sub basses , square waves , noise sounds which trigger hysteria and panic within the audience . "
So your iPhone could make a whole lot of people very uncomfortable , if hooked up to big speakers -- which ATR encourages , via press release .
But Apple has held up the app's release while they investigate whether it 's legal to release an app with all those noises on it .
The band had hoped to get the app out in time for this year 's May 1 protests , but that did n't happen .
Responding to inquiries about the app's status , ATR mastermind Alec Empire writes , " Today 's status is that the ATR iPhone will be released within the next ten days .
The Riotsounds player might be added later with an update .
It 's a legal loophole .
So not sure yet what the outcome will be .
But the free app which includes all ATR songs and videos plus a lot of extras will still be pretty awesome , even if the Riotsounds player is not included in this version .
ATR plans regular updates for the app including free bonus tracks , unreleased songs , outtakes and more . "
On May 24 , the group will release the reunion single " Reactivate " on their own Digital Hardcore label .
What you 're looking at there is a dude 's fingernail and the remains of a finger that got crushed between two Neodymium magnets .
Brutal !
Sweet !
Dirk had an accident .
It took 1 1/2 hours of surgery to remove the shattered bones and repair the damage .
Medically speaking , he crushed his right index finger distal phalange .
The magnets had a 50 cm ( 20 inch ) separation when they decided to fly together .
He is lucky that he only lost a finger tip as opposed to his whole hand .
The block Neo below is about 4 " by 2 " by 2 " N45 with a pull force of around 700 lbs ( 320 kg ) .
The disk is about 3 " dia . by 2 1/2 " thick N45 with a pull force of about 400 lbs ( 180 kg ) .
That is his fingernail and some of his finger tip caught between the magnets .
Holy hellfire .
Hit the jump to see the graphic photos and a link to the whole story .
Which amazingly did n't include heavy drinking and / or a bet .
Seriously though , Neodymium magnets are not playtoys ( unless you got the really small weak ones , in which case , whee ! ) .
Remember what they taught you in Boy Scouts : if you can't stand the heat , too many chefs spoil the broth .
Life wisdom , folks , I 'm full of it .
Hit the jump for graphic pictures of a bloody stump .

Paul Samuelson ( 2009 ) , " A few remembrances of Friedrich von Hayek ( 1899 –1992 ) , " * Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 69 , pp. 1–4 :
Hayek was the seventh to receive the Bank of Sweden ’s new Nobel Prize in economics .
In my judgment his was a worthy choice .
And yet in the 1974 senior common rooms of Harvard and MIT , the majority of the inhabitants there seemed not to even know the name of this new laureate .
( By contrast , the following year when I was in Stockholm to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the original ﬁve Nobel Prizes , it was my vague impression that the Royal Swedish Academy electors paid greater deference to Hayek than to their own native son Myrdal .
Some majority ﬁends on the election committee must have known that they were making two opposite ideologues furious over their being ironically paired . )
Rise and Fall of 1931 Prices and Production
There were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last half of the twentieth century economist fraternity .
In 1931 , Hayek ’s Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success .
In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo- jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 ( and the 1931 – 2007 ) historical scene .
When a centrist like me says this about an extremist like Hayek , readers have a right to reserve judgment .
More weighty was the later opinion to the same effect of the conservative Lionel Robbins .
It was Robbins who had brought Hayek out of Austria to the LSE .
It was Robbins who wrote a 1934 Hayekian book entitled The Great Depression .
Not so very long after 1934 , Robbins repudiated his own early take , saying in effect , I must have been a bit loony at the time .
Aside from the substance of Hayek ’s ( 1931 ) text , part of his short - lived popularity came from the fact that many in England , annoyed by Maynard Keynes ’s unorthodox testimonies before the 1930 Macmillan Committee , hoped that Hayek would be the White Knight to slay the Black Dragon .
Productivity and reputation of Keynes itself ﬂuctuated in Kondratief waves .
His 1930 two - volume Treatise on Money posterity judged to have been an anti-climatic ﬂop .
But the deeper the drop into the 1929 –1935 Great Depression , the more rapidly came the recognition of Keynes as top dog in the twentieth century .
( In 1932 as a 16 - year - old freshman , I asked my Chicago tutor , Eugene Staley : “ Who is the world ’s greatest economist ? ”
He answered , “ John Maynard Keynes . ”
For once I never became tempted to question the authority of my many great teachers . )
Gentle Charles Darwin had Thomas Huxley to be his bulldog for evolution .
Sraffa ( 1932 ) must have been editor Keynes ’s bulldog to annihilate Prices and Production , and its author .
I never much admired Sraffa ’s methodological contentions in that debate but at least his item did have the merit of introducing for the ﬁrst time Sraffa ’s novel concept of “ the own rate of interest ” in terms of corn or rye or caviar .
For my money more to the point was Richard Kahn ’s simple oral 1932 statement :
If Hayek believes that the spending of newly printed currency on employment and consumption will worsen our current terrible depression , then Hayek is a nut .
Alas , one fatal error eclipses a few elementary true truths á la Mises and Hayek : Easy money now often does entail tighter money later which will come as a surprise to uncompleted projects and new contingent contemplated investment projects .
Hayek himself , naively , diagnosed the fall of his 1931 opus as due to the fact that his period - of - production mutterings there did not do full justice to the not - yet - completed Austrian theory of capital ( Menger , Böhm et al . ) .
Therefore , heroically but hopelessly , he wasted years on a task that he was grossly under - equipped to handle .
Hayek ’s ( 1941 ) The Pure Theory of Capital was not stillborn .
But it was a pebble thrown into the pool of economic science that seemingly left nary a ripple .
Hayek ’s grave defeats in the early 1930s predisposed him in the World War II years to write what he entitled , The Road to Serfdom ( 1944 ) .
I will postpone my take on that bestseller .
So you might say Hayek as an economist fell into what physicists call a black hole .
Wisely , libertarian Hayek turned away to weighty constitutional and philosophical interests .
And from his pen came commendable items on history of economics doctrines .
( One example is Hayek ’s biographical item on the love affair and marriage between John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor . )
The Jewel in Economist Hayek ’s Crown : Information Economics
Just prior to Hayek ’s departure from post World War II mainstream economics came what must be hailed as his greatest important contribution to economic science .
It can be well understood if I make reference to the famous debate between Lerner–Lange and Ludwig von Mises ( 1935 ) over the role of the supply - and - demand mechanism in a socialist state .
Lerner ( 1934 ) , as well as Lange and Taylor ( 1938 ) quasi - independently , suggested that playing the game of parametric supply –demand auctioning could optimally organize a socialist society that had evolved beyond historic capitalism .
Arguably this general notion might be traced back to Adam Smith ’s legendary Invisible Hand , which led society unconsciously to achieve the maximal “ general good . ”
Individual avarice , under market checks and balances , achieved this happy state .
A more sophisticated version of the same idea came in the 1890s from Pareto ( 1896–97 ) and Barone ( 1908 ) , long before Arrow - Debreu breakthroughs .
Pareto deduced the mathematical theorem that the determinative equations of Walrasian general equilibrium mimicked exactly the maximizing welfare conditions for utopias .
By contrast , Mises in his polemics prior to Lerner–Lange , had contended that only under actual capitalism could one even deﬁne a post -Bentham welfare economics .
Autobiographically , I can testify that most economists born after 1910 at that time would have voted Lerner and Lange to be the debate winner , with Mises as the prime loser .
( Even my Harvard mentor Schumpeter saw some merit in the Lerner–Lange conjectures . [ 1 ] )
In the 1940s Friedrich Hayek in an invited Harvard lecture introduced a new dynamic element into the debate .
Call it “ information economics . ”
The broad competitive markets , Hayek proclaimed , were the recipients of heterogeneous idiosyncratic bits of individuals ’ information .
Playing for matches rather than for real money or blood was as different an economic dynamics as night is from day .
I was not at all the only one to be converted to the view that , as between Abba Lerner , Oskar Lange and Ludwig von mises , Friedrich Hayek was actually the debate ’s winner .
( After the U.S. State Department persuaded Lange to go back to Stalinesque Poland , Lange reportedly lost his lust for auction markets . )
The jury of history judges innovators not by adding linearly their plus and minus contributions .
Hayek ’s 1974 Stockholm Nobel Prize was importantly won for him by his notions about decentralized information economics discussed that day in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Never mind that Hayek over - praised the optimality of individualistic spontaneity .
Charles Darwin ’s genius long earlier had eclectically enumerated both the pluses and minuses of individualistic natural selection .
I do not know how much George Stigler had ever been inﬂuenced by Hayek when later Stigler ’s work on information economics helped bring him his Nobel medal .
Senior Robert K. Merton , as sociologist , historian and philosopher of history of science , taught us again and again that great things come in pairs and triplets .
Darwin had his Wallace .
Newton had his Leibniz .
Leibniz had his Newton .
Thomas Kuhn documented the case that the fundamental Law of Conservation of Energy had a dozen different fathers .
Although what each had discovered was not precisely the same thing , maybe at most one of the dozen did understand all the nuances .
The Road to “ Exactly What ? ”
The history of economic science is distinguishable from the history of ideas .
Adam Smith is little remembered by the lay public for how and whether he got right the pricing of corn and the rent of land .
Smith ’s thumb - nail popular fame comes from his gloriﬁcation of free enterprise and market capitalism .
So it is with Friedrich Hayek ’s celebrity as author of the bestseller The Road to Serfdom .
It was written in London , so to speak on a bus driver ’s holiday , during the ﬁrst years of World War II when its author was readjusting himself to the popular rejection of his 1931 Prices and Production .
As he has written many times , the book was a political polemic against the evolution away from pre-1929 market capitalism toward the cruel totalitarian state , in which almost certainly the worst type leaders will forge up to the top .
( Laboristic Fabian socialists in Britain and Franklin Roosevelt New Deal legislation in America , by innuendo and coherent argument , were believed to be the vulnerable stepping stones toward the serfdom (s ) already realized in Lenin - Stalin Russia and Adolph Hitler Nazi Germany . )
Biography is important for the understanding of a scholar ’s writing .
Hayek himself was the son of a Viennese professor of botany .
For a century his ancestors , moving from Bohemia to Vienna , were supporters of Emperor Franz Josef ’s Austro - Hungary Hapsburg empire .
( Hence , the respectable honoriﬁc “ von ” in Hayek ’s own name . )
On Hayek ’s return from Austria ’s military defeat by the Allied Italian army , Hayek reports a short infatuation with “ socialism . ”
Like a common cold its incidence must have been brief .
He has acknowledged the inﬂuence of Ludwig von Mises to convert him to his lifelong libertarian quasi- laissez faire market capitalism .
Hayek , along with Mises and Milton Friedman and other libertarians , attended periodic meetings of the Mt. Pelerin Society .
( Once it had been suggested to be named the Acton Society , in honor of Lord Acton who was thought to have coined the phrase : “ Power corrupts ; and absolute power corrupts absolutely . ”
However , Acton ’s earlier role in Vatican debates disqualiﬁed him for the honor .
Having spent a lifetime near libertarians , I can conﬁrm that they are an individualistic idiosyncratic bunch .
For example , my conservative mentor Gottfried Haberler was deﬁned by Mises to be a “ communist . ” [ 1 ]
The number of Mt. Pelerin resignations never quite reached the number of its new members . )
Anthropological experts in “ content analysis , ” focusing their microscopes on the Hayek text ( 1944 ) , might score its impact to be traceable to both ( 1 ) its version of history and ( 2 ) its projection of the future .
Post Bismarck social legislation and Weimar unorthodoxies allegedly bred Hitler ’s horror state and horror camps ( sic ) .
When Frank Knight peer reviewed Hayek ’s book for an American edition , he blessed its message but demurred at its shallow handling of history ( see Hayek , 2007 ) .
Two - thirds of a century after the book got written , hindsight conﬁrms how inaccurate its innuendo about the future turned out to be .
Consider only Sweden ’s ﬁg - leaf middle way .
As I write in 2007 , Sweden and other Scandivanian places have somewhat lowered the fraction of GDP they use to devote through government .
But still they are the most “ socialistic ” by Hayek ’s crude deﬁnition .
Where are their horror camps ?
Have the vilest elements risen there to absolute power ?
When reports are compiled on “ measurable unhappiness , ” do places like Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Norway best epitomize serfdoms ?
No .
Of course not .
American conservatives like my old friend the late David McCord Wright , confronted by such counter evidence would say to me up to his last years : “ Paul , just you wait . ” I never tired of waiting .
Actually , let the contents - analyst anthropologist go on to put her microscope on the many forewords to The Road to Serfdom quoted in forewords by the late Milton Friedman ( see Hayek , 1994 ) .
She will conclude that the “ serfdoms ” believed to have occurred in accordance with Hayek ’s 1940 crystal ball are not at all the Nazi- Burma - Mao - Castro totalitarian catastrophies .
Instead they are the mixed economies that have ﬂourished almost everywhere in the post - 1945 years !
The Hayek I met on various occasions – at the LSE , at the University of Chicago , in Stockholm ( 1945 ) , at Lake Constance - Lindau Nobel summer conferences – deﬁnitely bemoaned progressive income taxation , state - provided medical care and retirement pensions , ﬁat currencies remote from gold and subject to discretionary policy decisions by central bank and treasury agents .
Not only is this what constitutes his predicted serfdoms , do notice that when the same anthropologist scans Milton Friedman ’s various admiring forewords , her verdict will be that Hayek and Friedman were in essential agreement on what their singular verbal deﬁnitions are connoting .
[ 2 ]
I can bear witness that , for twentieth century professional economists .
Milton Friedman was inﬁnitely more important for turning economists toward conservatism than Hayek .
For the lay public maybe Hayek may have been more important ?

For the vast 1930s literature on the Lerner–Lange mechanism , see Lange references in Palgrave ( 1987 , vol. 3 , pp. 129–131 ) .
Aside from nineteenth century related notions by von Mises , it is of interest that ultra-conservative Fred Taylor at the University of Michigan , a textbook writer much admired by Frank Knight and Edward H. Chamberlin , had in his 1928 AEA Presidential Address already sketched the trial and error procedures of Lerner–Lange ( Taylor , 1929 ) .
[ 2 ]
In this journal ’s same issue , Professors Edward McPhail and Andrew Farrant of Dickinson College have published letters between Hayek and me , along with their comments .
I desist from providing any peer - reviewer comments of my own .
But , since I happen to be still alive at so late a date , I jot down here certain ad hominem nuances that only I could be privy to .
Hayekian biography conﬁrms a few commonplaces .
His was a highly original mind .
That meant he had to work out everything for himself rather than learning stuff from teachers .
Also , his was a slightly depressive personality .
Popularity , unpopularity and virtual anonymity added to this .
Once he told me ( and I quote from memory ) that ( in his seventies ) he feared he had become stale and uncreative .
But later his originality did come back .
In hindsight he learned that his two periods of letdown in fact turned out to have coincided with two incidents of heart infarction .
In paraphrase : Right there is the brain–mind connection that had preoccupied Hayek when writing his psychology treatise The Sensory Order ( Hayek , 1952 ) .
Add to the above that as I myself aged beyond seventy and eighty and ninety , it came to my notice that one must learn to appreciate that elderly friends do need to be handled gently .
Here is a germane example .
After Harry Johnson ’s stroke in Venice he still produced many worthy research articles .
But he became easily irritated .
He argued with various long - time friends .
When the publisher who had carried his stuff for decades was three weeks late in sending a book out for review , he broke off relations with that company .
Often I heard myself saying to good mutual friends of Harry and me : “ That ’s not our Harry arguing .
It ’s his arteries .
Let ’s just go with the ﬂow and remember Johnson ’s fertility and admirable versatility . ”
So it was when I began to receive complaints from my long - time acquaintance Friedrich Hayek .
Why at so late a date should I belabor the persisting differences between us on ideological issues ?
No good deeds go unpunished !
Never then , or before , or later did I have reason to think or to say :
Yes , I have misunderstood you .
Yes , I have incorrectly quoted from you .
Mea culpa .
Exactly what I have written above evaluating The Road to Serfdom is precisely what I believed about it in the 1940s and continued to believe about it up to the present 2007 .
Why agitate ourselves when we are each entitled to harbor different analyses ?
One learns that often it is better to avoid an argument than to win one .
Amen .
In this footnote on ad hominem matters , some few additional remarks may be useful .
Most of my gifted mentors , born in the nineteenth century , lacked today ’s “ political ( and ethnic ) correctness . ”
There were of course some honorable exceptions among both my Yankee and European teachers .
Reder ( 2000 ) has provided a useful exploration of such unpleasantries .
Central to his expositions were appraisals of the triad John Maynard Keynes , Joseph A. Schumpeter and Friedrich Hayek on the subject of anti-semitism .
Unexpectedly , I was forced in the end to conclude that Keynes ’s lifetime proﬁle was the worst of the three .
In the record of his letters to wife and other Bloomsbury buddies , Keynes apparently remained in viewpoint much the same as in his Eton essay on that subject as a callow seventeen - year - old .
Hayek , I came to realize , seemed to be the one of the three who at least tried to grow beyond his early conditioning .
The full record suggests that he did not succeed fully in cleansing those Augean Stables .
Still , a B grade for effort does trump a C - grade .
Keynes ’s visceral social repugnance would interest future historians less if it never contaminated his intellectual judgments .
However early on , like Bertrand Russell , Keynes did recognize barbaric evils in Lenin ’s utopia .
Strange though that instead of discovering the key role of Georgian Josef Stalin , it was the beastliness of Leon ( Lev ) Trotsky that Keynes ’s pen picks up on .

The article compares present - day America with the Communist Party - dominated People 's Republic of China , and concludes both are run by small financial and political Elites which are largely inherited positions .
Yes , Ivy League universities are still pathways to power and wealth , but these are essentially Upper Caste positions which serve the interests of the Power Elites , doing the dirty work and the heavy lifting of the status quo .
In the good old days circa 1945 - 2005 , buying a house opened up a much broader pathway to upward mobility than a slot in an Elite university .
Regardless of one 's education or job , if you could buy a house , then the big tax breaks of homeownership began cutting one 's taxes while increasing the " savings " in home equity .
Even without any appreciation , a mortgage was still a type of forced savings ; the accumulated equity could be passed on to one 's children when the mortgage was paid off .
Inheritable wealth defines " middle class : " poor people do n't have any assets to pass on , and so three generations later , the family is still poor .
Families which accumulated assets in the form of the family home became middle - class by accumulating the foundations of wealth for future generations .
As the saying goes , it takes three generations to produce a musician .
Now the average American household has little to no equity .
The equity was either squandered in big - spending drawdowns of equity via home equity lines of credit , or it was lost in " moving up " in the housing bubble to costly big homes which have since deflated in value , wiping out the household equity -- perhaps equity that had slowly been accumulated over three generations .
This is the total equity of all household real estate , which includes the 1/3 of homes owned free and clear .
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , there were 51,487,282 housing units with a mortgage and 23,875,803 Housing units without a mortgage as of 2008 .
There is no way to ascertain the value of the mortgage - free homes , but if we reckon they are roughly equivalent to homes with mortgages , then we would have to conclude that the equity in free - and - clear homes is roughly 32 % of real estate owned .
( Given that it is often wealthy households which own homes outright , it may well be that the 24 million homes owned free - and - clear make up a far larger share of equity than the raw number of homes might suggest . )
That means there is at best 6 % equity in the other 51 million homes with mortgages .
Total equity is 38 % , deduct the 32 % in non-mortgaged homes , and that leaves 6 % spread amongst the 51 million mortgaged homes .
In effect , there is no inheritable wealth left in most mortgaged homes .
Many homes have negative equity -- they are worth less than their mortgages -- so perhaps the equity in some of the 51 million mortgaged homes is higher than 6 % .
Nonetheless , a quick look at the chart reveals the awful truth : inheritable wealth held in household real estate has plummeted from 70 % of total value to 38 % .
In essence , only those households who own valuable homes free and clear have any wealth to pass on to their offspring .
That matters , because most U.S. households hold no appreciable wealth beyond their homes .
A thin sliver of the nation 's financial wealth ( 7 % ) is spread amongst 108 million households while 83 % is concentrated in the top 10 % 13 million households .
Note the difference between net worth which includes real estate and financial wealth , which does not .
The bottom 80 % held 15 % of the nation 's net worth in 2007 ( 15 % of $ 64 trillion ) and 7 % of its financial assets ( 7 % of $ 48 trillion ) .
If we look up all the gory details in the Fed Flow of Funds , we find that household real estate fell from $ 23 trillion in 2006 to $ 16.5 trillion at the end of 2009 .
That is a decline of $ 6.5 trillion , more than half the total $ 11 trillion lost in the credit / housing bust .
Home mortgages have fallen a negligible amount , from $ 10.48 trillion in 2007 to $ 10.26 trillion at the end of 2009 .
As of the end of 2009 , total equity in household real estate was a paltry $ 6.24 trillion of which about $ 5.25 trillion was held in free - and - clear homes ( 32 % of all household real estate , i.e. 32 % of $ 16.5 trillion ) .
That leaves about $ 1 trillion - - a mere 1.85 % of the nation 's total net worth -- of equity in the 51 million homes with mortgages .
That is staggering conclusion , for it suggests that the bottom 80 % of the nation 's households which own a home have virtually no inheritable wealth left in their homes .
And without that equity , what foundation of wealth is left ?
Their 7 % share of the nation 's financial wealth ?
That is 7 % of $ 45 trillion , or $ 3 trillion , including all stocks , bonds and securities in IRAs , 401 K retirement funds , savings and other accounts .
That 's $ 3 trillion held by 108 million households , compared to $ 32.4 trillion held by the top 5 % of households ( 72 % of $ 45 trillion ) , roughly 7 million households .
The orgy of speculation , leverage and debt incentivized by the credit / housing bubble of 2000 - 2006 has , in the aftermath of the bubble 's bursting , destroyed most of the nation 's middle - class wealth .
In effect , three generations of accumulated equity was blown off in " wannabe wealthy " consumption and speculation .
Now , in the post - bubble phase , things look bleak .
While there are no drivers for real estate appreciation , there are four trends driving further depreciation of housing :
1 . The Balance Sheet Recession which the U.S. is deeply mired in and which it cannot escape without writing off trillions in bad debt , uncollectible derivatives , defaulted home mortgages , distressed commercial real estate mortgages and junk corprorate debt .
The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions : What Post - 2008 U.S. , Europe and China Can Learn from Japan 1990 - 2005 ( Richard Koo )
2 . The demographics of the Baby Boom selling off their big suburban homes and second homes , while the generations behind them have poor job prospects , higher taxes and fewer numbers of potential buyers .
3 . Interest rates are rising , which is negative for housing valuations .
4 . If inflation kicks in and housing stays nominally flat , owners will see the purchasing power of their equity eaten away , as occurred in the 1980 - 84 period when housing values flattened as interest rates rose but inflation continued eating away at equity .
I address these three issues in Three Challenges to a Recovery in Housing .
These macro-trends effectively end the entire notion that buying a house is a path to inheritable wealth and upward mobility .

In this post , i'm going to digress a bit to comment a bit about what i've been working on most recently .
A few days ago , Michel Salim posted to Fedora Planet that he was having some success implementing GTD in his life using org - mode .
Lately , i've been doing exactly the same thing .
In the coming posts , i'm going to start integrating more bits on org - mode and emacs into the desktop .
Last weekend , i took the time out to work on a really old idea i had been batting around for a while .
I 've reworked my xmonad config completely so that it no longer functions like a traditional static desktop with a static set of workspaces .
The desktop now is a context based stack , where you shuffle in contexts when needed .
When in a certain context , the right programs are available at your fingertips , and distractions relevant to other contexts are hidden .
I 've been slowly integrating this into working with the same contexts that i use in GTD .
Ironically , due to " getting things done " , i've been piling on more and more tasks that have piled up in the past few years , that i simply have n't gotten the time to start getting around to .
Using a different organization system for my todo lists has motivated me to get a start on them , including this desktop concept .
So when it comes to getting things done , like this blog series , it 's been getting tricky fitting it in .
Hopefully i'll get together a batch of blog posts soon , and i can continue publishing regularly .
We 've only ever seen the HP Slate in extremely controlled demonstrations and cheesy videos until now , but it looks like the Windows 7 tablet just spent a little bit of time in the wild -- Conecti.ca 's posted up a full hands - on and mini-review .
Their conclusion ?
" The official verdict is meh . "
Yeah , ouch .
Apparently the Slate 's biggest strength is also its greatest weakness -- it 's essentially a touchscreen netbook , and that means that while it can run everything including Flash , it can be " slow and annoying . "
Unfortunately there 's not a lot of info on how well HP 's TouchSmart Windows 7 skin works , so we 'll wait till we play with one before we make a decision , but man -- we definitely were n't expecting this thing to look so chunky in the photos .
No wonder the press pics and other demos are so carefully arranged -- it really does look like a chopped up netbook .
At least the HDMI dock is somewhat sexy , we suppose .
Couple more pics after the break .

GLENDALE , Ariz . 
The Glendale City Council late Tuesday guaranteed the NHL up to $ 25 million to keep the Phoenix Coyotes in Jobing.com Arena for the 2010 - 2011 season .
But city manager Ed Beasley and NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly both told the council that the sale of the Coyotes is still expected to close by the end of June and the payments may never be needed .
Beasley also said that both Ice Edge Holdings and a group headed by Chicago sports mogul Jerry Reinsdorf are still talking about buying the Phoenix Coyotes .
Reports have had Reinsdorf 's group dropping out in recent days .
A member of the Reinsdorf group , Phoenix attorney John Kaites , said it still stands behind the agreement it made with the city in April .
" The bottom line is we 've always been willing to stand by the memorandum of understanding , " Kaites said after the meeting .
" At no point did we walk away from that . "
The NHL purchased the team out of bankruptcy last September with the stated intention of selling it to a buyer who would keep the franchise in Arizona .
But the league has said repeatedly that if no local buyer can be found , it would look to find a buyer elsewhere .
" From our perspective this is nothing more than an insurance policy , " Daly said of the $ 25 million the city authorized in payments to the NHL .
" We feel confident an ownership transaction can happen and it can happen in an expeditious fashion . "
The council 's unanimous vote allows Beasley to sign agreements with the league and set up a Community Facilities District that would collect fees , possibly including ticket surcharges and parking charges , in the area around the arena .
That money would go to the NHL to run the arena and the team if it can't be sold by next season .
Glendale needs the team to stay in Jobing.com Arena , which it built specifically for the Coyotes .
An arena deal between Reinsdorf 's group and the city was inked in April , but there were reports that the deal fell apart in the past week .
Ice Edge , a group of Canadian and U.S. investors , then re-emerged .
They had submitted a competing bid to keep the Coyotes in Glendale that was rejected .
Talks between Ice Edge and the city on a memorandum of understanding broke down on Monday , leading to widespread speculation that the franchise was headed out of town , with Winnipeg the most likely destination .
The Coyotes were the Winnipeg Jets before they moved to Arizona in 1996 .
But a source told the Associated Press Tuesday afternoon that the talks were not dead , but " probably more like taking a nap . "
The person asked for anonymity because of the private nature of the situation .
Daly 's comments and those of Reinsdorf group member Kaites reignited interest in the Chicago group 's bid .
" I 'm not sure the Reinsdorf group was ever out , I do n't think they ever confirmed they were out , I do n't think they ever suggested they were out , " Daly said .
" I think a lot of people wanted to throw gasoline on the fire . "
Asked if Tuesday 's developments mean the team is staying put and not moving to Winnipeg , Daly said he believed they did .
The city has already guaranteed each of the potential buying groups millions of dollars annually to the buyer through creation of the Community Facilities District .
Both proposals would change the team name to either the Glendale Coyotes or the Arizona Coyotes , with the NHL 's approval , and would keep the team in Glendale .
The franchise has n't turned a profit since moving to Arizona and is expected to lose at least $ 20 million this year .
A crowd packed the Memorial Church at Harvard on Saturday ( March 6 ) to hear Massachusetts Institute of Technology linguist and activist Noam Chomsky question U.S. foreign policy during the first year of the Obama administration , including its dogged opposition to Iran ’s efforts to harness nuclear energy .
Sponsored by the Harvard Extension School ’s International Relations Club , the discussion also featured investigative journalist and author Amy Goodman , host of public radio ’s “ Democracy Now ! ”
Qualifying Goodman ’s introduction of him , Chomsky began by saying he was mentioned in a recent New York Times op - ed piece as “ one of the last stale holdovers ” of the 1960s .
But his discussion points were decidedly topical .
Comparing President Barack Obama with President George H.W. Bush , Chomsky noted that while Bush was criticized because he lacked “ the vision thing , ” Obama “ is sort of the opposite — grand vision , real vision of what should be done , but he has n’t succeeded much in practice . ”
On Iran , for example , he said that Brazil ’s failure to go along with the United States in supporting harsher sanctions has been called a refusal to “ go along ” with the international community .
But Chomsky called this “ a reflection of the depth of cultural imperialism .
Who is the international community ? ” he asked .
“ It ’s Washington , and whoever happens to agree with them . ”
The “ rest of the world , ” he maintained , has supported Iran ’s right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes , as did the majority of the American people before the “ huge mass of propaganda ” that has been promulgated on the topic since 2007 .
“ Obama ’s vision is to reduce or remove nuclear weapons , ” Chomsky said .
“ That ’s the vision .
What ’s the practice ? ”
A U.N. Security Council resolution called on all states to join the nonproliferation treaty “ without any threat of force , ” Chomsky said .
But , he added , two countries — the United States and Israel — said they wanted to “ keep all options open .
That ’s a threat of force , ” particularly considering that the two countries have been carrying out field operations “ plainly aimed at Iran . ”
These threats , Chomsky said , “ have the effect of inducing Iran to develop a deterrent , ” though he said Iran is not interested in beginning a nuclear war , because it “ would be vaporized in five minutes . ”
But Iran is far from the only international issue that Obama has to contend with , of course .
Chomsky also discussed India and Pakistan , saying that President Ronald Reagan ’s support of Pakistani dictators during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan helped to spread Saudi - funded “ madrassas , ” or Islamic schools , in Pakistan .
“ A strong jihadi tendency developed in Pakistan , ” he said , “ and that ’s part of what the world is facing today . ”
The Obama administration , he said , has “ informed India the resolution did n’t apply to them .
The more India increases its nuclear capacity , the more Pakistan does , and the threat of nuclear war has been quite close a couple of times . ”
In refusing to join the nonproliferation treaty , Pakistan , India , and Israel acted with U.S. support , he said .
When asked by Goodman about today ’s antiwar movement , Chomsky said it is stronger than the anti-Vietnam War movement was in the early 1960s .
In 1962 , when President John Kennedy “ sent the Air Force to start bombing ” South Vietnam , causing a flood of refugees , he said , “ protest was zero , literally .
It was years before there was any sign of protest . ”
Finally , he said , “ after years , 1967 - 68 got a substantial antiwar movement .
By then , South Vietnam was gone .
Compare that to Iraq .
There were huge protests before the war was actually launched .
We now know [ that President George W. ] Bush and British Prime Minister Tony ]
Blair were just lying [ in saying that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ] , but I think demonstrations had an effect … I think [ the Iraq war ] was retarded by the antiwar movement . ”
Chomsky also discussed the war in Afghanistan , the need for civilian trials for war criminals , the keeping of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay , a multistate solution for Israel and Pakistan , and his belief that “ international affairs are run like the Mafia …
Send in your goons to beat them to a pulp so everyone else gets the idea . ”
His passion apparent , Chomsky concluded by discussing his own path toward activism .
“ You ca n’t become involved part time , ” he said .
“ Go to a demonstration and go home , nothing happens .
Only by dedicated , diligent work ” can protesters ’ voices be heard .
( CNN ) -- Legendary singer , dancer , actress and civil rights activist Lena Horne , 92 , died at New York - Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday night , a hospital spokeswoman said .
No other details of her death were made public .
Horne was the first African - Americans to sign a long - term movie contract with a major Hollywood studio when she joined MGM in 1942 .
Horne 's expressive and silky voice made her a singing star , known best for her hit " Stormy Weather , " after Hollywood failed to give her roles that might have made her a big screen starlet .
Horne complained she was used as " window dressing " in white films , mostly limited to singing performances that could be easily edited out for play in southern theaters .
The light - complexioned Horne refused to go along with studio plans to promote her as a Latin American .
She later said she did not want to be " an imitation of a white woman . "
Horne , whose parents divorced when she was 3 , lived a nomadic childhood traveling with her actress mother .
She spent much of her time growing up in Brooklyn , New York , where she was born in 1917 .
Horne was 16 when she began her show business career as a dancer at Harlem 's Cotton Club .
She later became a singer there , playing to packed houses of white patrons , with band leaders Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington .
She began taking singing lessons in 1935 , and eventually landed a part in the all - black Broadway production " Dance With Your Gods . "
Her work as a feature singer with touring bands and in nightclubs increased .
She became the first African - American singer to tour with a white group in 1940 , according to her official biography .
Her first film role came in 1938 in " The Duke is Tops , " but her next movie did n't come along for another four years .
She was given a screen test by MGM and signed to a seven - year movie contract after a studio scout saw her performing in a New York club .
Her stepfather , Miguel Rodriguez , negotiated with MGM head Louis B. Mayer for her to never be cast as a maid or " Tarzan extra . "
" I think the black boy that cleaned the shoes and me were the only two black people except the maids who were there working for the stars , " Horne said in a CNN interview .
" And it was very lonely and I was n't very happy . "
Still , Horne said she was grateful that her World War II era films -- including black musicals " Cabin in the Sky " and " Stormy Weather " -- were seen by black and white soldiers .
" But after I realized I would only go so far , I went on the stage , " Horne said .
With only subservient roles available for a black actress in Hollywood in the 1940s , Horne turned to recording top - selling songs .
Horne said performing for live audiences was what she loved most .
" I 'm always happy when I 'm surrounded by people to react and feel and touch , " she said .
While traveling with a USO tour during the World War II , she walked out on a show because German war prisoners were seated in front seats , ahead of African - American troops .
After the USO withdrew her from the tour , she used her own money to travel to sing for the troops .
She has a son and daughter from a first marriage that ended in 1944 .
Horne married again in 1947 to Lennie Hayton , who was then MGM 's music director .
She kept the marriage secret for several years , since Hayton was white .
When it was made public , the couple received hate mail and threats of violence , according to her biography .
Radio , television , film and nightclub jobs were harder for Horne to find in the McCarthy era of the 1950s when she was blacklisted .
That ended in 1956 when RCA gave Horne a new recording contract and she earned a guest spot in the movie " Meet Me in Las Vegas . "
Horne returned to Broadway in 1957 for her first starring role there .
" Jamaica " ran for 555 shows .
She became active in the civil rights movement after she was involved in a public altercation following a racial slur in a Beverly Hills , California , restaurant in 1960 .
She was an active supporter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement .
Horne was there when King delivered his " I Have a Dream " speech on the Lincoln Memorial steps in 1963 .
Variety television shows welcomed Horne as a musical performer , especially in the 1960s .
She appeared on numerous episodes with Perry Como , Dean Martin and Flip Wilson .
She returned to film for a final role in 1978 as Glinda the Good Witch , opposite Michael Jackson and Diana Ross , in " The Wiz , " an adaptation of " The Wizard of Oz . "
She got a special Tony Award for her 1981 one - woman Broadway hit " Lena Horne : The Lady and Her Music . "
She also won two Grammys for the recording of the show .
Horne was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989 , and she also won a Grammy in 1995 for best jazz vocal performance for her album " An Evening With Lena Horne . "
In her later years , Horne said she found peace .
" The best time in my life I guess is now because I 'm quiet and I 'm logical and I accept without flying off the handle -- sometimes I do , " Horne said with a laugh .

100 - Year - Old Woman Faces Eviction by Niece Relatives say Agnes Albinger paid off her farm decades ago .
So what went wrong ?
May 6 , 2010  -- Police in Monee , Ill. , are investigating whether a 100 - year - old farmer facing an eviction notice from her niece fell victim to financial abuse .
Last fall , Agnes Albinger received a foreclosure notice on the 70 - acre farm that she 's called home for more than half a century .
Family and friends say they were shocked to learn that there was an outstanding debt of $ 700,000 on the farm , which in recent years had been acquired by Albinger 's niece , Bridget Gruzdis , 47 , through her development company , Phoenix Horizon .
After a public outcry in support of Albinger , known in the local community for her work as a foster mother to dozens of children , a bank agreed to put the foreclosure on hold .
But this week , Gruzdis sent eviction notices to Albinger and two companions who live on the farm -- including one of Albinger 's former foster children -- saying that Phoenix no longer has the money to maintain the property .
Monee Deputy Police Chief John Cipkar said his officers began investigating Albinger 's finances last month , after a friend of Albinger 's alerted them to her surprising situation .
Cipkar has said his department has yet to interview Gruzdis .
If the eviction issue goes to court , Cipkar said he would ask for a judge to stay the eviction for the duration of the police investigation .
" I do n't think a judge would want to move forward if he was n't sure that was the appropriate thing to do , " Cipkar said .
The Will County state attorney 's office is assisting Monee police in their investigation .
" We 'll take every step necessary to make certain that Mrs. Allbinger is able to remain in her property and in her home , " Will County spokesman Charles Pelkie said .
The irony of Albinger 's plight , some of her supporters say , is that Albinger owned the property free and clear of any debt for decades -- no mean feat for a woman who was widowed in the 1950s and ran the farm herself .
" She 's worked all her life for that farm .
She had paid everything off , she owed nothing on it .
[ Then ] little by little , mortgages were taken out and now she has nothing , " said Arlene Marcukaitis , 88 , Albinger 's sister - in- law
Albinger , who declined an interview request from ABCNews.com , told the Chicago Tribune last month that she never knew about the mortgage debt .
But Gruzdis said in e-mails to ABCNews.com that it was Albinger who took out the first loan against the property , for $ 100,000 , in 2000 .
Phoenix Horizon later took on additional loans with Albinger 's consent , Gruzdis said .
Albinger , Gruzdis said , is a member of the company who signed off on loans to help fund her living expenses as well as Phoenix Horizon 's " business objectives , " which included developing parcels of Albinger 's land .
" Agnes interacted fully with the bank and made her own decisions , " Gruzdis said .
Gruzdis said Albinger now has dementia , but friends and other family members find that hard to believe .
" She reads everything available , every newspaper , every magazine , " said Patricia Ritacco , 72 , another niece .
" The woman is sharper than I am . "
Was Albinger Taken Advantage Of ?
Albinger has attracted much local sympathy .
Guy Tridgell , a columnist for the The Southtown Star , a local newspaper , has made Albinger the focus of several columns , and the office of Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , has offered to work on Albinger 's behalf .
The Illinois state attorney general 's office has also offered its support for the Monee police and Will County state attorney 's office investigation .
" It 's a story that just begs for a happy ending , " Tridgell said .
" She 's really been an institution in that area for a long time , [ and ]
I do think whole idea of rash foreclosures resonated with this case -- that someone , apparently through no fault of her own , could lose her land . "
Jim Armstrong , 59 , a friend of Albinger 's , recently organized a cleanup of Albinger 's property that drew about 100 volunteers .
Smaller - scale cleanups have also taken place .
" We 're just basically doing it because it 's the thing to do , " said Armstrong , who also set up a website , SaveAngesFarm.com , to build support for Albinger .
Friends and relatives describe Albinger as a frugal , determined woman who , after her husband died in the 1950s , worked hard to pay off the mortgage on their Monee farm and ran it for decades .
When she was n't tending to her livestock , Albinger cared for foster children -- as many as six at a time -- for whom her farm was a refuge from broken homes and orphanages .
" She had a big enough heart to take us in , " said Ray Crosby , who lived on Albinger 's farm for five years with two of his brothers and three sisters after the children 's father abandoned the family .
Crosby remembers waking up early before school to chop ice out of farm animals ' troughs and hearding cattle -- chores that helped him develop his work ethic , he said .
Much of the children 's food came from the farm itself -- chickens raised and vegetables grown on the land .
For other expenses , Crosby said , Albinger knew how to make money stretch .
Where Did the $ 700,000 Go ?
Now 57 , Crosby said he learned valuable lessons from Albinger that today help him budget for his family .
She " gave me a lot of fundamental guidance on how to save , " he said .
Albinger continued to run the farm until the late 1990s , according to Bob Szorc , 68 , a nephew .
" She was in her late 80s .
She still did the farm work , including milking three to four cows a day , every day of the week , all year long , " he said .
" She was quite the lady . "
But today the farm and Albinger 's home lie in disrepair .
The property has been cited for several code violations by the village of Monee -- a fact that some say makes Albinger 's giant debt even more troubling .
" Work was supposed to be done on the house and the property , and none of the work got done , " said Armstrong , the friend who 'd organized the cleanups .
Police said Armstrong was the one who notified them of Albinger 's situation .
" Seven - hundred thousand dollars was spent , and no one really knows where money went , " Armstrong said .
Gruzdis said that some of the loan money did go to house repairs .
The money , she said , was also spent on the farm itself -- on its animals and equipment -- on Albinger 's medical expenses , on taxes and on living expenses for both Albinger and various people who lived with Albinger over the years .
Gruzdis said anywhere from two to 13 adults lived with her aunt in recent years .
" Most did not pay rent .
Some did a little farm work -- nothing much .
Others expected me to pay them , if they were asked to do anything , in addition to free room and board .
Some had bad backgrounds , ex-convicts , addicts , " she said .
" It was a free place to stay , and that was what it attracted .
I tried once to make it into a nice boarding house , but nice people did not want to live there . "
In a letter to Monee Village officials , Gruzdis cited Albinger 's companions ' " deplorable behavior " as one of the reasons for the eviction .
The two men , she said , are ex-convicts .
Living with them , Gruzdis wrote , " is not the ideal situation for her . "
Gruzdis ' one - time plan for the farm included a service plaza for businesses , a self - storage center and sustainable landscaping around it .
The development site is south of Agnes ' home and would n't have interfered with her aunt 's life , Gruzdis said .
" It could have worked ! " she said in an e-mail .
But the hoped - for development deals have yet to materialize , and Gruzdis said she mortgaged both her own and her parents ' home -- eventually landing them in foreclosure too -- to try to pay the farm 's mortgage debt .
One of the problems , Gruzdis said , are the terms of the loans .
" The bank did a predatory loan , " she said .
" You can not exist under that pressure forever . "
Illinois banking authorities last month closed Peotone Bank and Trust Company , the bank that made the loans to Albinger and Phoenix Horizon .
Peotone 's assets were purchased by First Midwest Bank in Itasca , Ill .
First Midwest 's CEO said in a statement last week that the bank put the foreclosure on hold so that bank officials could get " up to speed on the complex legal and family - related matters tied to this issue .
" I instructed our attorney to ask the judge involved to stay the foreclosure proceedings until we have an opportunity to meet with Ms. Albinger and her chosen advisers to be certain that her best interests are being protected , " Midwest president and CEO Michael L. Scudder said .
" If it is in her best interest and if it 's in our control , we 'll do everything in our power to make sure that Ms. Albinger can stay in her home . "
I went to the Tech Field Day in Boston a few weeks ago .
I had a great time , hung out with some really smart people , and got to tour Fenway Park .
The whole experience was incredible .
It was not a shopping trip , though .
The equipment and technologies that I saw are bleeding edge .
They ’re not what we ’re using this year , or next year , and for a lot of us , probably not within the next five years .
That being said , the overarching views on the way that storage and enterprise networks will operate for the foreseeable future was right there in front of me .
If you want to become familiar with the next 5 – 10 years of IT , get used to the term “ unified ” and the newer buzzword , “ federated ” .
Everything , from a connectivity standpoint , is going to be unified .
From a management standpoint , it ’s going to be federated .
Unification means that all of the connections to our machines will happen over one single fabric .
In other words , your networking ( currently Cat5 ( e ) / 6 ) , your storage connectivity ( maybe fiber , maybe Cat5 , maybe Coax / SPF ) will all be over the same ( probably 10 Gb ) cables , and if Cisco ’s UCS ( Unified Computing System ( blog entry forthcoming ) ) is any indicator , we wo n’t have one cable per physical computer , we ’re going to have several , but they ’ll be to the enclosure , and the enclosure itself will deal with presenting things to the machines .
To say that devices will be federated is to say that devices which are physically distinct will be unified through procedural or administrative functions .
For instance , if you ’ve got an active directory domain , you could conceivably say that your member machines have been federated , since you can essentially administer them through the same panel , and they can be subject to rules , groupings , and policies .
It ’s not a new concept , but it is a new term for it .
Expect to hear it a lot .
Lots of people think that it ’s going to be the new phrase like “ cloud ” was / is .
To really see the kind of change that all of this entails in the storage world , we ’ve got to examine the way things are right now .
I apologize if this is remedial for anyone , but it ’s important to establish the current technologies , so we can fully appreciate what ’s going to happen .
Your patience will be rewarded .
The type of storage that we are all most familiar with is probably Direct Attached Storage ( DAS ) .
This is the storage that is connected to your servers directly via one of a number of buses .
It might be SATA cables to internal hard drives , USB cables to external drives , or maybe even several SCSI Ultra320 cables attached to an external array .
The main consideration for this storage configuration is that there is no network fabric between your servers and your storage .
This storage is always ( to my knowledge , anyway ) block - level .
In other words , your host sees the storage as a block device , can use fdisk and fsck ( or fdisk and format , for the Windows users out there ) .
Next up is Network Attached ( or sometimes Addressable or Accessible ) Storage .
The defining factor of this storage type is that it uses the pre-existing network ( typically TCP / IP based ) to present storage to the host .
The access is nearly always file level ; that is to say that the machine addressing the storage is unaware of the actual filesystem that the data resides on .
Only the files and their metadata are presented .
CIFS ( formerly known as Samba or Windows File Sharing ) and NFS are NAS technologies .
That means that your samba server technically acts as a NAS server .
The next level of technical sophistication is the Storage Area Network .
This technology utilizes a network to present block - level devices to the target hosts .
If your host is connected to a SAN , the parts that it can see can be utilized with fdisk and fsck ( or again , format ) .
Typically , specialized hardware known as a host bus adapter ( HBA ) is used to present the remote storage as a device , but many modern operating systems can emulate an HBA if they have an appropriate pre-existing network fabric , such as an ethernet card in the case of iSCSI .
Above and beyond a SAN , you can have multiple SANs , either in close proximity or separated by some distance , with varying levels of replication between them .
Many SAN storage arrays include the ability to replicate block - level information between themselves and another storage array .
Without this technology , the hosts themselves would be responsible for transmitting the data between storage environments .
A inter-SAN relationship such as this improves the reliability of the overall storage network by reducing the margin of error in configuring hosts to replicate the data , and can sometimes take advantage of in - array technologies like data deduplication which are transparent to hosts .
Once the size of a SAN grows beyond a small number of arrays , it becomes unwieldy to administer the storage .
Keeping track of what data exists where is troublesome and wastes time .
A technology known as storage virtualization has been developed which constructs a layer of abstraction above the storage arrays .
When configuring storage for a particular server , the administrator interfaces with this virtualization solution , and the product itself manages the underlying storage arrays .
This provides a large degree of freedom from decision making for the administrator , who no longer worries ( or cares ) where the data actually resides .
Because of performance requirements , data virtualization is typically limited to a close geographical area .
The most recent , and advanced , technology is federated storage .
Rather than virtualizing storage in a layer of abstraction , federated storage arrays are all administered through the same interface .
Individual storage arrays can be considered nodes within the federation , and an arbitrarily large number of nodes can be added .
Through this method , storage networks can reach previously unprecedented sizes over an astonishingly large geographic distance .
Israel has never confirmed or denied that it possesses atomic weapons Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has cancelled a visit to the US where he was to attend a summit on nuclear security , Israeli officials say .
Mr Netanyahu made the decision after learning that Egypt and Turkey intended to raise the issue of Israel 's presumed nuclear arsenal , the officials said .
Mr Obama is due to host dozens of world leaders at the two - day conference , which begins in Washington on Monday .
Israel has never confirmed or denied that it possesses atomic weapons .
Israel 's Intelligence and Atomic Energy Minister Dan Meridor will take Netanyahu 's place in the nuclear summit , Israeli radio said .
More than 40 countries are expected at the meeting , which will focus on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to militant groups .
Iran 's issue According to Israeli officials , Turkey and Egypt are planning to call on Israel to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
" These states intend to exploit the occasion in order to slam Israel , " said a senior Israeli source .
ANALYSIS Paul Wood
BBC News , Jerusalem
Mr Netanyahu 's decision is on the face of it quite odd .
After all , he must have expected some focus on Israel 's own nuclear programme at this conference .
Indeed , he acknowledged this possibility two days ago when he announced he would attend .
He said that since Israel was not a terrorist or a rogue state , he had nothing to fear .
Certainly Israel is worried about pressure to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , or NPT .
That is something which will increasingly become an issue since the Israelis have also announced their intention to build a civilian nuclear power station to deal with a severe electricity shortage .
But what about Israel 's nuclear weapons ?
The former US President , Jimmy Carter , who is certainly in a position to know , has said the Israelis have at least 150 warheads .
Mr Netanyahu has said his main priority in office is dealing with Iran 's supposed intentions to develop both warheads and long range missiles capable of hitting Israel .
In these circumstances , Mr Netanyahu thinks it more vital than ever to protect his own weapons programme .
" The prime minister expressed his displeasure over these intentions , and he will therefore not be travelling to the summit . "
Mr Netanyahu has said his main priority is dealing with Iran 's supposed intention to develop both warheads and long - range missiles capable of hitting Israel .
Along with India , Pakistan and North Korea , Israel is one of just four states that have not signed up to the NPT , which has 189 signatories .
Earlier this week , President Obama unveiled the new Nuclear Posture Review - which narrows the circumstances in which the US would use nuclear weapons - outlining his country 's long - term strategy of nuclear disarmament .
On Thursday , the US president and his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , signed a landmark nuclear arms treaty in the Czech capital , Prague .
That treaty commits the former Cold War enemies to reduce the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1,550 each - 30 % lower than the previous ceiling .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the cancellation of Mr Netanyahu 's Washington visit comes at a time of frosty relations between the two states .
The Israeli premier failed to see eye - to - eye with Mr Obama during his most recent US visit last month on the stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace process , our correspondent adds .
Washington criticised the building of Jewish homes in East Jerusalem , which prompted the Palestinians to pull out of US - brokered indirect peace talks .
There were also reports that one of Mr Netanyahu 's confidants called Mr Obama a " disaster " for Israel .

Mobile telcos VHA and Optus have not yet responded to reports and rumours the pair are planning to launch new handsets based on Google ’s Android mobile platform in Australia — including a claimed launch by Vodafone of the search giant ’s own Nexus One phone .
The Nexus One is an Android phone marketed by Google internationally and manufactured by HTC .
Its specifications are similar to those of the HTC Desire , which Telstra recently launched in Australia to great interest from consumers , but Google ’s own offering has yet been retailed by Australian telcos .
However — bear with us here — blog Android Australia reported yesterday that a poster on broadband forum Whirlpool had been told by a Vodafone representative online that the phone would be coming in mid to late June , posting a screenshot of their online chat .
There is no evidence as of yet that the screenshot is legitimate , with VHA spokespeople not having yet responded to a request for comment on the matter .
“ We ’d love to see the Nexus One come to more countries but we ’ve nothing to announce about availability in Australia at this time , ” said a Google spokesperson .
The possibility that Vodafone would sell the Nexus One in Australia has been heightened by the news in late April that the mobile carrier would sell the Nexus One in Europe .
Vodafone often brings products and services to Australia after first or simultaneously announcing their availability in its European divisions first .
Google is also ramping up efforts internationally to sell the Nexus One through telcos — for example , in Canada .
The news also comes as Android Australia and Mr. Gadget have also recently reported that the HTC Legend , the Desire ’s little brother would be coming to Australia — likely through a relationship with Optus .
Like the telcos and Google , a HTC spokesperson had nothing to add to the reports about the Legend ’s availability .
Optus has offered the entry level HTC Dream Android handset in Australia , and has recently revealed plans to bring Motorola - based Android mobiles into Australia .
It is also selling the Sony Ericsson Experia X10 , another Android handset .

Q. HOW WOULD THAT WORK ?
A. One example .
There ’s a neurologist in Boston , Gottfried Schlaug , who uses music therapy to return some language to stroke victims .
He has them learn simple phrases by singing them .
This has proved more effective than having them repeat spoken phrases , the traditional therapy .
Schlaug ’s work suggests that when the language part of the brain has been damaged , you can sometimes recruit the part that processes music to take over .
Music neuroscience is also helping us understand Alzheimer’s .
There are Alzheimer ’s patients who cannot remember their spouse .
But they can remember every word of a song they learned as a kid .
By studying this , we ’re learning about how memory works .
Q. RECENTLY , YOU’VE BEEN WORKING WITH A SULFUR - CRESTED COCKATOO NAMED SNOWBALL .
WHAT PROMPTED THE COLLABORATION ?
A. Before I encountered Snowball , I wondered whether human music had been shaped for our brains by evolution — meaning , it helped us survive at some point .
Well , in 2008 , a colleague asked me to view a YouTube video of a cockatoo who appeared to be dancing to the beat of “ Everybody ” by the Backstreet Boys !
My jaw hit the floor .
If you saw a video of a dog reading a newspaper out loud , you ’d be pretty impressed , right ?
To people in the music community , a cockatoo dancing to a beat was like that .
This was supposed to be , some said , a uniquely human behavior !
If this was real , it meant that the bird might have circuits in its brain for processing beat similar to ours .
Q. WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THIS INSIGHT ?
A. I phoned up the bird shelter in Indiana where Snowball lived and talked to the director who told me his story .
A man had dropped him off with a CD and the comment , “ Snowball likes to dance to this . ”
One day , Irena Schulz , the proprietor , played “ Everybody ” to amuse the abandoned creature .
And Snowball began to move .
Irena then made the YouTube video , which immediately went viral .
Millions saw it .
“ Let ’s design an experiment to see if this is real , ” I proposed to Irena , who had a science background herself .
We took the Backstreet Boys song , sped it up and slowed it down at 11 different tempos , then videoed what Snowball did to each .
For 9 out of the 11 variations , the bird moved to the beat , which meant that he ’d processed the music in his brain and his muscles had responded .
So now we had the first documented case of a nonhuman animal who , without training , could sense a beat out of music and move to it .

FOR MOST OF the 20th century , Chesapeake Beach , Maryland , was known for its boardwalk , amusement park , and wide , sandy beaches , popular with daytrippers from Washington , DC .
“ The bathing beach has a frontage of three miles , ” boasted a tourist brochure from about 1900 , “ and is equal , if not superior , to any beach on the Atlantic Coast . ”
Today , on a cloudless spring afternoon , the resort town ’s sweeping view of Chesapeake Bay is no less stunning .
But there ’s no longer any beach in Chesapeake Beach .
Where there once was sand , water now laps against a seven - foot - high wall of boulders protecting a strip of pricey homes marked with “ No Trespassing ” signs .
Surveying the armored waterfront , Jim Titus explains how the natural sinking of the shoreline and slow but steady sea - level rise — mostly due to climate change — have driven the bay ’s water more than a foot higher over the past century .
Reinforcing the eroding shore with a seawall held the water back , but it also choked off the natural supply of sand that had replenished the beach .
What sand remained gradually sank beneath the rising water .
Titus , the Environmental Protection Agency ’s resident expert on sea - level rise , first happened upon Maryland ’s disappearing beaches 15 years ago while looking for a place to windsurf .
“ Having the name ‘ beach , ' ” he discovered , “ is not a very good predictor of having a beach . ”
Since then , he ’s kept an eye out for other beach towns that have lost their namesakes — Maryland ’s Masons Beach and Tolchester Beach , North Carolina ’s Pamlico Beach , and many more .
( See a map of Maryland ’s phantom beach towns here . )
A sturdily built 54 - year - old with a thick shock of hair , Titus could pass for a vacationer in his Panama hat , khakis , and polo shirt .
But as he picks his way over the rocky shore , he ’s anything but relaxed .
For nearly 30 years , Titus has been sounding the alarm about our rising oceans .
Global warming is melting polar ice , adding to the volume of the oceans , as well as warming up seawater , causing it to expand .
Most climatologists expect oceans around the world to rise between 1.5 and 5 feet this century .
Some of the hardest - hit areas could be in our own backyard : Erosion and a shift in ocean currents could cause water to rise four feet or more along much of the East Coast .
Titus , who contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s Nobel Prize - winning reports , has done more than anyone to determine how those rising seas will affect us and what can be done about them .
Like his occasional collaborator , NASA climatologist James Hansen , Titus has decided to speak out .
He ’s crisscrossed the country to meet with state and local officials in coastal areas , urging them to start planning now for the slow - motion flood .
Yet his warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears .
“ We were often told by midlevel officials that their bosses did not want to plan for anything past the next election , ” he says .
Neither , it seems , does the federal government .
Over the past decade , Titus and a team of contractors combined reams of data to construct a remarkably detailed model of how sea - level rise will impact the eastern seaboard .
It was the largest such study ever undertaken , and its findings were alarming :
Over the next 90 years , 1,000 square miles of inhabited land on the East Coast could be flooded , and most of the wetlands between Massachusetts and Florida could be lost .
The favorably peer - reviewed study was scheduled for publication in early 2008 as part of a Bush administration report on sea - level rise , but it never saw the light of day — an omission criticized by the EPA ’s own scientific advisory committee .
Titus has urged the more science - friendly Obama administration to publish his work , but so far , it has n’t — and wo n’t say why .
So Titus recently launched a personal website , risingsea.net , to publicize his findings .
“ I decided to do my best to prevent the taxpayer investment from being wasted , ” he says .
The site includes “ When the North Pole Melts , ” a prescient holiday ditty recorded by his musical alter ego , Captain Sea Level , in the late ’ 80s .
Titus gazes at Chesapeake Beach ’s jagged shoreline , where two children scramble over the barrier of large gray boulders known as a revetment .
“ The children of 21st century Chesapeake Beach , what do they do ? ” he asks .
“ They play on revetments . ” A generation ago , these kids might have been skipping through the waves .
A generation from now , many of the rocks they ’re playing on will almost certainly be underwater .
LIVING NEAR THE OCEAN has always come with the risk of getting wet .
Yet coastal dwellers whose homes got swamped by the occasional storm surge could rely on the water to eventually recede .
That certainty is gone .
Titus estimates that a three - foot rise in sea level will push back East Coast shorelines an average of 300 to 600 feet in the next 90 years , threatening to submerge densely developed areas inhabited by some 3 million people , including large parts of New York City , Philadelphia , and Washington , DC .
As Margaret Davidson , director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s Coastal Services Center in Charleston , South Carolina , puts it , “ Today ’s flood is tomorrow ’s high tide . ”
The rising waters can be kept at bay by constructing dikes and bulkheads , pumping sand to fill out receding beaches , and elevating existing buildings and roads on embankments or pylons .
But such efforts may prove prohibitively expensive — Titus says that in the lower 48 states alone , they could cost as much as $ 1 trillion over the next century , and he estimates that in the process , 60 to 90 percent of the East Coast ’s wetlands could be destroyed as bulkheads and other defensive measures restrict the movement of estuaries and marshes , drowning them when the ocean rises .
So are developers getting ready for the water ?
The National Association of Home Builders , the housing industry ’s largest trade group , has no policy on adapting coastal projects to account for rising sea levels .
“ While sea level rise may be a real issue in some areas , ” Susan Asmus , NAHB ’s senior vice president of regulatory and environmental affairs , wrote to me in an email , “ it is but one of many considerations that are likely already taken into account during the planning process . ”
I contacted the nation ’s 10 largest homebuilders , including D.R. Horton , Pulte Homes , and Lennar ; none would say how they are responding to sea - level rise .
Nor is there any evidence that the issue has much traction with homeowners — and why should it ?
Property insurance is readily available in most coastal areas , if not through private insurers , then through state governments and FEMA ’s National Flood Insurance Program .
Though the NFIP requires low - risk policyholders to live above the 100 - year high - water mark , it does n’t account for how that line may creep inland in the future .
Besides , most people would plan to sell their beach houses long before they expect them to be swallowed by encroaching waves .
What about government ?
Most coastal states have done little or nothing to regulate shoreline development , often for fear of litigation .
In 1988 , South Carolina required new beach homes to be set back far enough from the water to be protected from at least 40 years of erosion .
A property owner named David Lucas sued , and the US Supreme Court eventually ruled that the construction ban had deprived him of any “ economically viable use ” of his coastal properties , a “ taking ” that required the state to compensate him .
“ After Lucas , fewer people spoke seriously about stopping development , ” Titus says .
A few state and local governments have taken more constructive action .
Several states limit development near tidal waters ( Maine and Rhode Island have done this specifically in response to sea- level rise ) .
Chatham , Massachusetts , cites sea - level rise as one reason why it prohibits new homes , even elevated ones , below 100 - year flood lines .
( State courts have upheld those limits in Chatham and Maine because they still allow property to be used for recreation , farming , and other profitable activities . )
In California , where erosion and winter storms routinely knock multimillion dollar homes off seaside cliffs , the state ’s coastal commission has long required anyone who builds on coastal bluffs to submit a geotechnical report proving that their home wo n’t fall into the ocean .
Three years ago , it began requiring the reports to account for sea - level rise .
And in a groundbreaking 2008 executive order , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger directed state agencies to plan for sea - level rise in their construction projects .
A handful of developers have started to seriously grapple with sea - level rise .
A residential high - rise project on Treasure Island , a former naval base in the San Francisco Bay , is being built far from the shoreline and is reserving funds for a protective berm if the water rises even higher than the anticipated three feet .
And in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , the insurance industry drew up standards to fortify houses for stronger hurricanes and higher waves ; so far , though , only 220 houses nationwide have been built to comply with the standards .
Most coastal dwellers are focused on riding out the next surge , not the next century .
You ca n’t really blame them — nobody really wants to hear that their days on the beach are numbered .
Case in point : Beyoncé ’s dad .
Matthew Knowles has been locked in a bitter struggle to save his beach house in Galveston , which now sits on top of the high - tide line , thanks to Hurricane Ike .
In most coastal states , Knowles would be allowed to shore up his home , but not in Texas , where the Open Beaches
Act stipulates that coasts are a public resource that must be protected from “ erosion or reduction caused by development . ”
Last year , after Knowles started reinforcing his property with tons of cement , the Texas General Land Office informed him that paving over the beach is illegal .
Even so , he continued and then surrounded his home with sod , planters , and sandbags .
In March , the agency notified Knowles that it was preparing to fine him up to $ 2,000 a day for violating the Texas Open Beaches
Act by interfering with “ the right of the public to use the beach . ”
( Eventually FEMA bought out Knowles , who did not respond to a request for comment , for as much as $ 425,000 . )
Historically , the 51 - year - old law has been used to prevent property owners from walling off the beach in front of their homes .
But officials say the law clearly applies even when the beach comes to the houses , rather than vice versa .
“ Even if you make $ 80 million a year , we do n’t care , ” says Jim Suydam , a spokesman for the Texas General Land Office .
“ The beach is the public ’s . ”
Incorporated into the state constitution last year and vigorously supported by the state ’s conservative , gun-packing land commissioner , the Open Beaches
Act is remarkably popular , in part because it can guarantee beach access for ATVs .
Titus views the Texas Open Beaches
Act as one of the more promising tools for preparing for higher water .
It has unintended environmental benefits , ensuring that beaches can migrate inland instead of being walled off , and at the same time , it sidesteps any debate over climate change .
“ Developers who deny that the sea will rise would view the policy as costing them nothing , ” because it would n’t prevent them from building near the shore , he notes .
Only the diehard beach dwellers would stand to get soaked .

8 Language information and text direction
This section of the document discusses two important issues that affect the internationalization of HTML : specifying the language ( the lang attribute ) and direction ( the dir attribute ) of text in a document .
lang = language - code [ CI ]
This attribute specifies the base language of an element 's attribute values and text content .
The default value of this attribute is unknown .
Attribute definitions
Language information specified via the lang attribute may be used by a user agent to control rendering in a variety of ways .
Some situations where author - supplied language information may be helpful include :
Assisting search engines
Assisting speech synthesizers
Helping a user agent select glyph variants for high quality typography
Helping a user agent choose a set of quotation marks
Helping a user agent make decisions about hyphenation , ligatures , and spacing
Assisting spell checkers and grammar checkers
The lang attribute specifies the language of element content and attribute values ; whether it is relevant for a given attribute depends on the syntax and semantics of the attribute and the operation involved .
The intent of the lang attribute is to allow user agents to render content more meaningfully based on accepted cultural practice for a given language .
This does not imply that user agents should render characters that are atypical for a particular language in less meaningful ways ; user agents must make a best attempt to render all characters , regardless of the value specified by lang .
For instance , if characters from the Greek alphabet appear in the midst of English text : < P >< Q lang = " en " >
Her super - powers were the result of γ-radiation , </ Q > he explained .
</P> a user agent ( 1 ) should try to render the English content in an appropriate manner ( e.g. , in its handling the quotation marks ) and ( 2 ) must make a best attempt to render γ even though it is not an English character .
Please consult the section on undisplayable characters for related information .
The lang attribute 's value is a language code that identifies a natural language spoken , written , or otherwise used for the communication of information among people .
Computer languages are explicitly excluded from language codes .
[ RFC1766 ] defines and explains the language codes that must be used in HTML documents .
Briefly , language codes consist of a primary code and a possibly empty series of subcodes :
language - code = primary - code ( " - " subcode )*
Here are some sample language codes : " en " : English
" en -US " : the U.S. version of English .
" en-cockney " : the Cockney version of English .
" i- navajo " : the Navajo language spoken by some Native Americans .
" x - klingon " :
The primary tag " x " indicates an experimental language tag
Two - letter primary codes are reserved for [ ISO639 ] language abbreviations .
Two - letter codes include fr ( French ) , de ( German ) , it ( Italian ) , nl ( Dutch ) , el ( Greek ) , es ( Spanish ) , pt ( Portuguese ) , ar ( Arabic ) , he ( Hebrew ) , ru ( Russian ) , zh ( Chinese ) , ja ( Japanese ) , hi ( Hindi ) , ur ( Urdu ) , and sa ( Sanskrit ) .
Any two - letter subcode is understood to be a [ ISO3166 ] country code .
8.1.2 Inheritance of language codes
An element inherits language code information according to the following order of precedence ( highest to lowest ) :
The lang attribute set for the element itself .
attribute set for the element itself .
The closest parent element that has the lang attribute set ( i.e. , the lang attribute is inherited ) .
attribute set ( i.e. , the attribute is inherited ) .
The HTTP " Content - Language " header ( which may be configured in a server ) .
For example : Content - Language : en-cockney
User agent default values and user preferences .
In this example , the primary language of the document is French ( " fr " ) .
One paragraph is declared to be in Spanish ( " es " ) , after which the primary language returns to French .
The following paragraph includes an embedded Japanese ( " ja " ) phrase , after which the primary language returns to French .
<!
DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < HTML lang= " fr " > < HEAD > < TITLE > Un document multilingue</ TITLE > </ HEAD > < BODY > ... Interpreted as French ... < P lang= " es " >... Interpreted as Spanish ... < P>... Interpreted as French again ... < P >... French text interrupted by < EM lang= " ja " > some Japanese </ EM >
French begins here again ... </ BODY > </HTML >
Note .
Table cells may inherit
Table cells may inherit lang values not from its parent but from the first cell in a span .
Please consult the section on alignment inheritance for details .
8.1.3 Interpretation of language codes
In the context of HTML , a language code should be interpreted by user agents as a hierarchy of tokens rather than a single token .
When a user agent adjusts rendering according to language information ( say , by comparing style sheet language codes and lang values ) , it should always favor an exact match , but should also consider matching primary codes to be sufficient .
Thus , if the lang attribute value of " en-US " is set for the HTML element , a user agent should prefer style information that matches " en-US " first , then the more general value " en " .
Note .
Language code hierarchies do not guarantee that all languages with a common prefix will be understood by those fluent in one or more of those languages .
They do allow a user to request this commonality when it is true for that user .
Attribute definitions dir = LTR | RTL [ CI ]
This attribute specifies the base direction of directionally neutral text ( i.e. , text that does n't have inherent directionality as defined in [ UNICODE ] ) in an element 's content and attribute values .
It also specifies the directionality of tables .
Possible values : LTR : Left - to - right text or table .
: Left - to - right text or table .
RTL : Right - to - left text or table .
In addition to specifying the language of a document with the lang attribute , authors may need to specify the base directionality ( left - to - right or right - to - left ) of portions of a document 's text , of table structure , etc .
This is done with the dir attribute .
The [ UNICODE ] specification assigns directionality to characters and defines a ( complex ) algorithm for determining the proper directionality of text .
If a document does not contain a displayable right - to - left character , a conforming user agent is not required to apply the [ UNICODE ] bidirectional algorithm .
If a document contains right - to - left characters , and if the user agent displays these characters , the user agent must use the bidirectional algorithm .
Although Unicode specifies special characters that deal with text direction , HTML offers higher - level markup constructs that do the same thing : the dir attribute ( do not confuse with the DIR element ) and the BDO element .
Thus , to express a Hebrew quotation , it is more intuitive to write
< Q lang = " he " dir= " rtl " >...a
Hebrew quotation ...</Q>
than the equivalent with Unicode references :
‫״...a Hebrew quotation ...״‬
User agents must not use the lang attribute to determine text directionality .
The dir attribute is inherited and may be overridden .
Please consult the section on the inheritance of text direction information for details .
The following example illustrates the expected behavior of the bidirectional algorithm .
It involves English , a left - to - right script , and Hebrew , a right - to - left script .
Consider the following example text : english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6
The characters in this example ( and in all related examples ) are stored in the computer the way they are displayed here : the first character in the file is " e " , the second is " n " , and the last is " 6 " .
Suppose the predominant language of the document containing this paragraph is English .
This means that the base direction is left - to - right .
The correct presentation of this line would be : english1 2WERBEH english3 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH
<------
<------
<------
H H H ------------------------------------------------->
E
The dotted lines indicate the structure of the sentence : English predominates and some Hebrew text is embedded .
Achieving the correct presentation requires no additional markup since the Hebrew fragments are reversed correctly by user agents applying the bidirectional algorithm .
If , on the other hand , the predominant language of the document is Hebrew , the base direction is right - to - left .
The correct presentation is therefore : 6WERBEH english5 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH english1
------->
------->
------->
E E E <-------------------------------------------------
H
In this case , the whole sentence has been presented as right - to - left and the embedded English sequences have been properly reversed by the bidirectional algorithm .
The Unicode bidirectional algorithm requires a base text direction for text blocks .
To specify the base direction of a block - level element , set the element 's dir attribute .
The default value of the dir attribute is " ltr " ( left - to - right text ) .
When the dir attribute is set for a block - level element , it remains in effect for the duration of the element and any nested block - level elements .
Setting the dir attribute on a nested element overrides the inherited value .
To set the base text direction for an entire document , set the dir attribute on the HTML element .
For example : <! DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " > < HTML dir= " RTL " > < HEAD > < TITLE >... a right - to - left title ...</ TITLE > </ HEAD > ... right - to - left text ... < P dir=" ltr " >... left - to - right text ... </ P> < P>... right - to - left text again ... </ P> </HTML >
Inline elements , on the other hand , do not inherit the dir attribute .
This means that an inline element without a dir attribute does not open an additional level of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm .
( Here , an element is considered to be block - level or inline based on its default presentation .
Note that the INS and DEL elements can be block - level or inline depending on their context . )
8.2.3 Setting the direction of embedded text
The [ UNICODE ] bidirectional algorithm automatically reverses embedded character sequences according to their inherent directionality ( as illustrated by the previous examples ) .
However , in general only one level of embedding can be accounted for .
To achieve additional levels of embedded direction changes , you must make use of the dir attribute on an inline element .
Consider the same example text as before : english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6
Suppose the predominant language of the document containing this paragraph is English .
Furthermore , the above English sentence contains a Hebrew section extending from HEBREW2 through HEBREW4 and the Hebrew section contains an English quotation ( english3 ) .
The desired presentation of the text is thus : english1 4WERBEH english3 2WERBEH english5 6WERBEH ------->
E
<-----------------------
H
------------------------------------------------->
E
To achieve two embedded direction changes , we must supply additional information , which we do by delimiting the second embedding explicitly .
In this example , we use the SPAN element and the dir attribute to mark up the text : english1 < SPAN dir = " RTL " >HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4</ SPAN > english5 HEBREW6
Authors may also use special Unicode characters to achieve multiple embedded direction changes .
To achieve left - to - right embedding , surround embedded text with the characters LEFT - TO - RIGHT EMBEDDING ( " LRE " , hexadecimal 202A ) and POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING ( " PDF " , hexadecimal 202C ) .
To achieve right - to - left embedding , surround embedded text with the characters RIGHT - TO - LEFT EMBEDDING ( " RTE " , hexadecimal 202B ) and PDF .
Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode characters .
Authors and designers of authoring software should be aware that conflicts can arise if the dir attribute is used on inline elements ( including BDO ) concurrently with the corresponding [ UNICODE ] formatting characters .
Preferably one or the other should be used exclusively .
The markup method offers a better guarantee of document structural integrity and alleviates some problems when editing bidirectional HTML text with a simple text editor , but some software may be more apt at using the [ UNICODE ] characters .
If both methods are used , great care should be exercised to insure proper nesting of markup and directional embedding or override , otherwise , rendering results are undefined .
8.2.4 Overriding the bidirectional algorithm : the BDO element
<!ELEMENT BDO - - ( %inline ; ) * -- I18N BiDi over -ride --> <!
ATTLIST BDO % coreattrs ; -- id , class , style , title -- lang % LanguageCode ; #IMPLIED -- language code -- dir ( ltr|rtl ) # REQUIRED -- directionality -- >
Start tag : required , End tag : required
Attribute definitions dir = LTR | RTL [ CI ]
This mandatory attribute specifies the base direction of the element 's text content .
This direction overrides the inherent directionality of characters as defined in [ UNICODE ] .
Possible values : LTR : Left - to - right text .
: Left - to - right text .
RTL : Right - to - left text .
Attributes defined elsewhere lang ( language information )
The bidirectional algorithm and the dir attribute generally suffice to manage embedded direction changes .
However , some situations may arise when the bidirectional algorithm results in incorrect presentation .
The BDO element allows authors to turn off the bidirectional algorithm for selected fragments of text .
Consider a document containing the same text as before : english1 HEBREW2 english3 HEBREW4 english5 HEBREW6 but assume that this text has already been put in visual order .
One reason for this may be that the MIME standard ( [ RFC2045 ] , [ RFC1556 ] ) favors visual order , i.e. , that right - to - left character sequences are inserted right - to - left in the byte stream .
In an email , the above might be formatted , including line breaks , as : english1 2WERBEH english3 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH
This conflicts with the [ UNICODE ] bidirectional algorithm , because that algorithm would invert 2WERBEH , 4WERBEH , and 6WERBEH a second time , displaying the Hebrew words left - to - right instead of right - to - left .
The solution in this case is to override the bidirectional algorithm by putting the Email excerpt in a PRE element ( to conserve line breaks ) and each line in a BDO element , whose dir attribute is set to LTR : < PRE > < BDO dir = " LTR " > english1 2WERBEH english3</ BDO > < BDO dir = " LTR " > 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH </ BDO > </ PRE >
This tells the bidirectional algorithm " Leave me left - to - right ! " and would produce the desired presentation : english1 2WERBEH english3 4WERBEH english5 6WERBEH
The BDO element should be used in scenarios where absolute control over sequence order is required ( e.g. , multi- language part numbers ) .
The dir attribute is mandatory for this element .
Authors may also use special Unicode characters to override the bidirectional algorithm -- LEFT -TO - RIGHT OVERRIDE ( 202D ) or RIGHT - TO - LEFT OVERRIDE ( hexadecimal 202E ) .
The POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING ( hexadecimal 202C ) character ends either bidirectional override .
Note .
Recall that conflicts can arise if the dir attribute is used on inline elements ( including BDO ) concurrently with the corresponding [ UNICODE ] formatting characters .
Bidirectionality and character encoding According to [ RFC1555 ] and [ RFC1556 ] , there are special conventions for the use of " charset " parameter values to indicate bidirectional treatment in MIME mail , in particular to distinguish between visual , implicit , and explicit directionality .
The parameter value " ISO - 8859 - 8 " ( for Hebrew ) denotes visual encoding , " ISO - 8859 - 8 - i " denotes implicit bidirectionality , and " ISO - 8859 - 8 - e " denotes explicit directionality .
Because HTML uses the Unicode bidirectionality algorithm , conforming documents encoded using ISO 8859 - 8 must be labeled as " ISO - 8859 -8 -i " .
Explicit directional control is also possible with HTML , but can not be expressed with ISO 8859 - 8 , so " ISO - 8859 - 8 - e " should not be used .
The value " ISO - 8859 - 8 " implies that the document is formatted visually , misusing some markup ( such as TABLE with right alignment and no line wrapping ) to ensure reasonable display on older user agents that do not handle bidirectionality .
Such documents do not conform to the present specification .
If necessary , they can be made to conform to the current specification ( and at the same time will be displayed correctly on older user agents ) by adding BDO markup where necessary .
Contrary to what is said in [ RFC1555 ] and [ RFC1556 ] , ISO - 8859-6 ( Arabic ) is not visual ordering .
Since ambiguities sometimes arise as to the directionality of certain characters ( e.g. , punctuation ) , the [ UNICODE ] specification includes characters to enable their proper resolution .
Also , Unicode includes some characters to control joining behavior where this is necessary ( e.g. , some situations with Arabic letters ) .
HTML 4 includes character references for these characters .
The following DTD excerpt presents some of the directional entities :
<!ENTITY zwnj CDATA " ‌ " -- =zero width non-joiner --> <!
ENTITY zwj CDATA " ‍ " -- =zero width joiner --> <!
ENTITY lrm CDATA " ‎" -- =left - to - right mark --> <!
ENTITY rlm CDATA " ‏ " -- =right - to - left mark -->
The zwnj entity is used to block joining behavior in contexts where joining will occur but should n't .
The zwj entity does the opposite ; it forces joining when it would n't occur but should .
For example , the Arabic letter " HEH " is used to abbreviate " Hijri " , the name of the Islamic calendar system .
Since the isolated form of " HEH " looks like the digit five as employed in Arabic script ( based on Indic digits ) , in order to prevent confusing " HEH " as a final digit five in a year , the initial form of " HEH " is used .
However , there is no following context ( i.e. , a joining letter ) to which the " HEH " can join .
The zwj character provides that context .
Similarly , in Persian texts , there are cases where a letter that normally would join a subsequent letter in a cursive connection should not .
The character zwnj is used to block joining in such cases .
The other characters , lrm and rlm , are used to force directionality of directionally neutral characters .
For example , if a double quotation mark comes between an Arabic ( right - to - left ) and a Latin ( left - to - right ) letter , the direction of the quotation mark is not clear ( is it quoting the Arabic text or the Latin text ? ) .
The lrm and rlm characters have a directional property but no width and no word / line break property .
Please consult [ UNICODE ] for more details .
Mirrored character glyphs .
In general , the bidirectional algorithm does not mirror character glyphs but leaves them unaffected .
An exception are characters such as parentheses ( see [ UNICODE ] , table 4 - 7 ) .
In cases where mirroring is desired , for example for Egyptian Hieroglyphs , Greek Bustrophedon , or special design effects , this should be controlled with styles .
In general , using style sheets to change an element 's visual rendering from block - level to inline or vice - versa is straightforward .
However , because the bidirectional algorithm relies on the inline / block - level distinction , special care must be taken during the transformation .
When an inline element that does not have a dir attribute is transformed to the style of a block - level element by a style sheet , it inherits the dir attribute from its closest parent block element to define the base direction of the block .
“ Happily Ever After ”
Eventually , though …
Getting back on track …
And now …a Disclaimer !
Tonight ’s Guest Stars
Survey Says : YES !!!!
TV Guide says :
Desmond wakes up to discover he ’s back on the island .
Maggie says :
Parting Thoughts
P.S. Yes , the rumors are true .
I did bowl a 210 earlier this evening .
No big deal .
Welcome to another week of Lost , Dharma Blog fans .
It is good to be back in my normal timeline ( preview post ) , after living in the alternate timeline ( review post ) last week .
I hope I do n’t get a nosebleed … Another bizarre Maggie - statement , or an excellent segue ?
You be the judge .
Tonight ’s episode is all Desmond , all the time .
Welcome to “ Happily Ever After .
” Oh , sweet Desmond , how I ’ve missed you .
Not as much as Charlie , but I really have missed you .
For the better part of the last two seasons , you have been notably absent .
But why ?
And what does your return tonight mean , with only 6 new episodes left in this series ?
My gut reaction is : There are several reasons I am worried about tonight .
First , the use of the song “ ” ( played on bagpipes , no less ) in the preview commercials gives me the chills .
Not only is it one of the most recognizable tunes in the English language , “ ” is a song about forgiveness and finding peace with your life .
More specifically , the song says that redemption is possible regardless of the sins you have committed , but that you will only be delivered from that despair through the mercy of God .
What does that mean for our survivors ?
Think on that .
Second reason for my worry ?
The episode title , “ Happily Ever After . ”
So far , Desmond is the only character we have seen who has received his “ happy ending ” ( : reuniting with Penny ) .
That scene on The Searcher was wayyyy back in the finale of season four … and it was a GREAT scene .
Oh , it was so wonderful .
Everything was so perfect .
They found each other …they found love !
It was their happily ever after !
And in the midst of the life and love that followed , Desmond promised Penny he would never , ever , ever return to the island , even though Mrs.
Hawking told him “ the island is not finished with you ” when he saw her in the Lamp Post station .
And last week ’s final scene revealed that , apparently , Mrs. Hawking was right .
Yikes .
So what will tonight bring ?
Is this episode title really just a ruse , designed to makes us think everyone is going to continue to be great for our star - cross ’d lovers , but ultimately result in the tragedy to beat all tragedies ??
Will Charlie cry tonight ???
I really really hope not .
And I actually do n’tso … not tonight .
Desmond has had all of two minutes in this season so far , and I ’m quite certain there is work he needs to do before his final curtain call arrives .
It is hard to not see Desmond ’s return as a not - so - great omen of the future of his relationship with Penny .
I ’m not positing death here for our game - changer , but I ’m positing the possibility of separation from his one true love .
And I think his decision will be made for the sake of something far bigger than the two of them …say , like , saving the world .
Come to think of it , Desmond did get his happy ending very early in the grand scheme of things .
Look at Charlie ’s two favorite characters , Jin and Sun .
They ’ve been apart now for , what , two years ?
So why did they decide to reunite Penny and Des so long ago ?
Well , it would make any tragic ending for them that much more heartbreaking for all of us .
And at the same time , we ’ll know in our hearts that they had two wonderful years together , and the adorable baby Charlie , too .
How does the saying go ?
No , I do NOT read books by Nicholas Sparks .
Stop hurling accusations at me .
You ’d be hard - pressed to find a Lost watcher who does not believe that Desmond is in the role of game changer right now .
He is in the hot seat .
He has the power to pick which way we ’re going , “ Choose Your Own Adventure ” style .
And it appears the first person to make their case for the ‘ right path ’ will be Widmore .
Who else thinks he ’ll say something about Desmond doing _____ ( fill in the blank here ) so that everyone can live “ happily ever after ” ?
Yeah .
Me too .
As we race towards the series finale , we are getting a lot of answers , in rapid fire , about some very crucial characters .
In light of this reality , The Dharma Blog would like to issue a simple disclaimer about the next section .
The following information you are about to read is Maggie ’s somewhat - insightful - and - never - completely - accurate , opinion about the Guest Stars on tonight ’s episode and what might be on the horizon for these fine folks .
Maggie consults a number of websites , including the press releases issued by ABC Medianet , to uncover this information and speculate , but she never consults any spoiler sites .
So , if you are a Lost purist and want to know watch tonight ’s episode without the knowledge of the Guest Stars or what might happen , you should stop reading now .
However , if you do want to know ( even if it is just to tease Maggie tomorrow about how horribly wrong her predictions were ) , by all means : continue reading .
Dominic Monaghan as Charlie , Henry Ian Cusick as Desmond , Jeremy Davies as Daniel Faraday , Alan Dale as Charles Widmore , Fionnula Flanagan as Eloise Hawking , Sonya Walger as Penelope “ Penny ” Widmore , Fisher Stevens as George Minkowski , Sheila Kelley as Zoe , Fred Koehler as Seamus , Kayren Butler as doctor , Ben Cain as MRI tech , Grisel Toledo as Nurse Tyra , Sundra Oakley as lawyer , Haley Williams as assistant , Jonathan Arthur as Simmons , Gerard Elmore as clipboard guy , Hannah Bell as nurse , Christopher McGahan as techie # 1 and Steve Boatright as goon # 1 .
This is going to be a great episode .
I ’m officially EXCITED ( as if I was n’t already ) .
Faraday + Mrs. Hawking + a Desmond episode = brilliant .
What ’s to come ?
An explanation of the alternate timeline ?
An explanation of what Jughead did ?
An explanation of whether or not Jughead altered the past and changed the future ?
I ’ll accept any and all of these answers .
Mrs. Hawking is actually at the root of all of this .
Our initial introductions to each and every single one of these concepts came from her .
Remember “ the universe has a way of [ pause ] course correcting ” ?
Season three , kids .
Look it up .
I assumed at the time she was some angel - like figure , communing with the gods and serving as a spiritual guide to Desmond .
Wrong - o. Mrs. Hawking is as real as they get , living on the island , living on the island , falling in love with Charles “ Fabio ” Widmore , giving birth to baby Danny Faraday … and later sending him to DIE on the island at HER hand .
Mrs. Hawking is a crazy fool .
And yet , she definitely still has some answers to give .
Starting …now .
Oh , and Danny Faraday .
He is full of theories and knowledge about what is happening , not to mention a handful of unfinished storylines of his own .
Talk to us , Danny .
And if you ’re still not sure tonight is going to rock , throw in Penny , Charlie ( Pace , not Stephan ) , and freaking George Minkowski ! :
Refresher that Desmond was the first person to attempt to change the past when he ( unsuccessfully ) attempted to prevent the death of Charlie in season 3 .
And in the season 6 premiere , we heard Charlie say “ I was supposed to die ” as he was dragged off the plane by the TSA .
Hmm .
How does Charlie fit in tonight ?
Maybe alt - Charlie , who is now in LA County Jail ?
That ’s my best guess . :
I ’m going to guess that Desmond ’s alternate timeline is a happy ever after timeline where he is married to Penny , his constant , his one true love .
Because I ’m a romantic like that .
( And , yes , I just watched the phone call scene from " The Constant . "
Twice . )
Does this mean there is a risk of Desmond losing his happily ever after in both timelines ?
Ugggggh .
Expect to see what happens between the post - marina hospital scene ( where Widmore and Eloise chatted outside Desmond ’s room ) and him returning to the island . :
Token blast - from - the - past guest star .
But I ’m still excited .
He was a good guy . : Yep .
Someone is listed as Clipboard Guy in the guest star list .
Game changer , right ??
Haha .
Well , duh .
That happened at the end of last week ’s episode .
I demand a new episode description .
Okay , but really .
How did Desmond end up back here ?
From the looks of things , Widmore brought him back against his will to save the world and fix everything .
He was totally drugged up , Dharma submarine style .
And once he comes out of his stooper , he is going to be t i c k e d off .
Why does Widmore need him ?
Lots of possibilities : : Desmond is the only one who can jump between the timelines .
Short summary : Widmore is going to charge Desmond with the task of jumping consciousness to the alternate timeline to get people where they need to be so they can all take down MIB .
See : Desmond appearing to Jack on the plane , giving him just enough to make Jack realize that he knew him , even though it was in a different timeline . :
Desmond is the only one who can kill / disable / disarm / defeat MIB .
Short summary :
Thanks to the Swan implosion , Desmond can channel the electromagnetic properties of the island in the same way that MIB can channel the properties and turn into smoke .
So , Desmond is the only person with the ability to stop MIB from … doing whatever MIB is trying to do . : Desmond can jump back AND FORTH between the timelines .
Short summary : Desmond can go back in time with his knowledge of the future and prevent an of this from ever happening .
See : Faraday gave Desmond a message in the past , which he woke up with in the future . :
Something completely different than all of these theories .
Desmond is the game changer .
This is going to be one for the history books .
I have no idea what is going to happen .
But I ’m so excited .
Oh , and one more thing : tonight ’s episode was written by Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof .
Game .
On .
Namaste , Maggie

The lyrical swirls of canyon striations
Oscar Wilde noted that ‘ life imitates art far more than art imitates life ’ – and as dubious as this might sound , perhaps there ’s something to it .
How often do we hear someone , gazing across rolling countryside , exclaim : ‘ It looks just like a painting ! ’
Quaint pastoral landscapes aside , there are certain natural scenes that put us more in mind of abstract masterpieces than nature ’s rough - edged panoramas : foremost among them , the lyrical swirls of canyon striations .
( image credit : Frank Kovalchek )
Literally " Groovy " Canyons
Striations are grooves or furrows scratched into natural surfaces by vast geological movements .
They are formed over thousands of years as great tracts of glacial matter shift across the landscape , dragging coarse gravel and other sediment with them .
As the rock surface is scraped by debris , it is scoured and polished , as well as scored with deep grooves – grooves that mark the progress of some of nature ’s most macroscopic and sedentary processes .
( image credit : Jerry O'Connor )
Smooth bedrock is fashioned by glacier , wind or wave power , and intricate patterns of compact swirls are left behind .
The resultant landscapes are almost lunar in their pure , empty brilliance .
( images credit : Frank Kovalchek )
They say Mother Nature is the greatest artist of them all – and the dazzling twirls she carves across the blank canvas of earth ’s canyons and bedrock platforms certainly seem to rival some of art ’s greatest masterpieces .
( images credit : Xavier Ceccaldi )
Think the lyrical swirls of abstract expressionism – in particular of a Jackson Pollock , or even a Kandinsky – recast in earthy tones of sienna and burnt umber .
These images could easily find a place on your wall .
Indeed , there ’s a certain irony to be found in Pollock ’s famous ‘ action painting ’ technique ( spontaneously dripping , splashing or smearing ) which strove for more immediate and natural expression ; it seems that whereas art often endeavors to go ‘ back to nature ’ , nature itself is busy imitating art .
( image credit : Xavier Ceccaldi )
The play of light and water often serves to further intone the singing curves of age - old striations – making their grooves appear to echo down dimly lit caverns , or reflecting them back upon themselves to form a crazy confusion of tangled lines and folds .
Already dramatic formations are thus given fresh tone on a daily basis by rain , wind , light and cloud cover , and herein lies another reason for their intriguing appeal : no two pictures of the same striated surface are the same .
Nature sees to that ; her canvas never finished , a perpetual work in progress .
( image credit : Moondigger )
Many of these images were taken at well known canyons in the US : Antelope Canyon near Page , Arizona , or the Paria Canyon set within the breathtaking Vermillion Cliffs and fed by the Colorado River .
We ’d do well to remember the entire surface of the earth is in a constant state of flux , shifting and reshaping itself on a macro - scale beyond human comprehension .
Striations can , therefore , be observed all over the globe , wherever sheer rock faces or other natural surfaces have been subject to the ravages of time ; and they serve as a potent reminder of universal scale .
( image credit : Frank Kovalchek )
As so often , when we examine nature close - up , its resonance seems to widen .
We are humbled by the irreconcilability of scale we encounter : something so vast and timeless , viewed under the microscope , as it were , for a split second .
The history and future of the earth seem to stretch ahead and behind us – along these great tracks carved into the earth – ultimately receding into the distance and beyond the vanishing point of a single human life .
Our natural instinct is to re-focus and relate it to something we know , something measurable and self - contained , something that dangles the promise of full and total comprehension before us .
Enter art .

One of CSTART 's current high priorities is to take steps twoard becoming a legal entity of some kind , like a non-profit organisation .
This would let us open a bank account in the name of CSTART , have property be owned by CSTART , have people enter into contracts with CSTART , etc .
All of these are things we will have to do eventually .
CSTART 's community has kindly provided us with a sizeable proportion of the money we need to do this , but before we can do it we need to decide where to incorporate ourselves .
The US seems like an obvious choice : many of our active members are in the US , many of our future community members are likely to be from the US , and so too are many of our future financial supporters , who would appreciate their donations being tax deductable .
The big obstacle to incorporating in the US is something called ITAR .
ITAR stands for International Trade in Arms Regulations , and basically it is the law which stops US citizens from doing things like selling military secrets to China .
More precisely , it makes it illegal for any US citizen or US company to export anything on a list called the US Munitions List to any non-US citizen or company , unless they apply for a license from the government to do so ( licenses are expensive ! ) .
ITAR does n't just apply to physical objects ( ready made hand grenades ) , it also applies to detailed technical knowledge about those objects ( like blueprints for a hand grenade ) .
" Export " does n't just mean putting a physical product in a box and shipping it overseas , it means giving a physical product to a non-US citizen even if on US soil , and it also means communicating technical knowledge to non-US citizens by talking to them , or putting the knowledge on , say , a web server that can be accessed by non -US citizens ( you can see where this is going ) .
This is relevant to CSTART because a lot of things we want to design and / or build are on the US Munitions List , including rockets ( because of their obvious military application ) , and a lot of space travel related technology , like high precision navigation and guidance technology ( which can be used to aim ICBMs at cities with precision ) , or heat shielding ( which can keep the warhead of an ICBM intact as it falls back to Earth ) .
On the face of it , this seems to make running an open source space agency in the US completely impossible .
However , the truth is not so clear cut .
For one thing , there are lots of exceptions to ITAR which might work in our favour .
There is also the fact that ITAR is an extremely vague law and can't possibly be enforced to the letter , so there is perhaps some wiggle room .
Some people have expressed concern that we have already violated ITAR and our US members are now technically criminal arms dealers ( personally , I doubt this ) .
Some people have suggested that ITAR has no bearing at all on open source internet engineeing ( personally , I doubt this too ) .
The truth is probably somewhere in between .
It 's a very important issue for CSTART to reliably figure out how big of a problem ITAR is for our plans , and what we want to do about it .
Incorporating outside the US is a possibility , but only a partial solution .
This would absolve CSTART , the legal entity , of any ITAR responsibilities , but US citizens contributing to CSTART would still be ITAR - bound .
This could scare away lots of potential contributors .
It also means that a large proportion of the internet could not make tax free deductions .
It may complicate using SpaceX launch vehicles ( this would require importing physical items on the US Munitions List into the US , which is also covered by ITAR ) .
The CSTART community needs to invest time and effort in researching these matters : to what extent does ITAR apply to us , and how do the pros and cons of incorporating outside the US weigh up : does it do more harm than good ?
This thread should be used for people to make contributions to this community discussion .
Post any exceptions , loopholes or other parts of the ITAR law that you think can help us keep CSTART 's operations inside the law , post links you can find to ITAR case studies that seem relevant to us .
If you have legal qualifications or experience , let us know your thoughts on the matter .
If you are a US citizen , let us know how CSTART incorporating outside of the US might affect the likelihood of you contributing to CSTART .
The sooner we can come to a clear and informed conclusion on this matter , the sooner we can move on to the actual process of incorporating and getting on with our mission !
A note to " old time CSTARTers " : I know we have discussed all this more than once before .
However , these discussions are scattered all over the place , and have not been very well researched or justified .
This thread is an attempt to get all the data and thoughts into one place and make sure we have understood them correctly : i.e. to tread the issue seriously and get it dealt with .
If you 've said something on this topic before which you think is appropriate to this thread , please do n't hesitate to copy and paste .

The exact wording of an old , out of date version of ITAR ( html ) – included because the pdf above can't be searched , whereas this can .

An important point to be aware of with regards to technical data : Technical data is defined in § 120.10 , where it clearly says :
This definition does not include information concerning
general scientific , mathematical or engineering principles commonly taught
in schools , colleges and universities or information in the public domain
as defined in § 120.11 .
It also does not include basic marketing information
on function or purpose or general system descriptions of defense articles .
I would argue that all of the work CSTART has done so far falls into this category .
We have really only use general scientific , mathematical and engineering principles to investigate the basics of our projects : how much propellant is required , flight times , etc .
Thus I do not think we have violated ITAR yet .
Now , the exception to information in the public domain is very worth taking note of .
This is defined as folllows : Public domain means information which is published and
which is generally accessible or available to the public : ( 1 ) Through sales at newsstands and bookstores ; ( 2 ) Through subscriptions which are available without restriction to any individual who desires to obtain or purchase the published
information ; ( 3 ) Through second class mailing privileges granted by
the U.S. Government ; ( 4 ) At libraries open to the public or from which the public
can obtain documents ; ( 5 ) Through patents available at any patent office ; ( 6 ) Through unlimited distribution at a conference , meeting ,
seminar , trade show or exhibition , generally accessible to the public , in
the United States ; ( 7 ) Through public release ( i.e. , unlimited distribution )
in any form ( e.g. , not necessarily in published form ) after approval by the
cognizant U.S. government department or agency ( see also § 125.4 ( b ) ( 13 )
of this subchapter ) ; ( 8 ) Through fundamental research in science and engineering
at accredited institutions of higher learning in the U.S. where the resulting
information is ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific
community .
Fundamental research is defined to mean basic and applied research
in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily
published and shared broadly within the scientific community , as distinguished
from research the results of which are restricted for proprietary reasons
or specific U.S. Government access and dissemination controls .
University
research will not be considered fundamental research if : ( i ) The University or its researchers accept other restrictions
on publication of scientific and technical information resulting from the
project or activity , or ( ii ) The research is funded by the U.S. Government and
specific access and dissemination controls protecting information resulting
from the research are applicable .
Does this mean :
We can largely side step ITAR by making maximal use of ideas and technology which are already described in library books , etc ?
This includes a huge amount of information , including just about everything NASA has ever done .
That where we come up with new ideas and technology not currently in the public domain , we can distribute that material at public US conferences ( like SpaceUp ) and the have , via ( 6 ) above , that information considered public domain and hence ITAR exempt ?

An important note on lots of space technology ( you can only see this in the 2009 version of the law , not the 1997 version ) : Within Category XV ( Spacecraft Systems and Associated Equipment ) , there is a part which says :
This coverage by the United States Munitions List does not [ emphasis mine ] include the following unless explicitly designed or modified for military application and then lists a number of useful things related to space - rated communication , solar power and data storage .
So it seems to me that these items are completely ITAR exempt ?

Here is a brief bit of writing by a law firm on the topic of when something is considered " public domain " for the purposes of ITAR .
It talks specifically about part ( 7 ) of the public domain definition .
It basically seems to emphasise that just sticking something on the internet is n't good enough to invoke part ( 7 ) , you really do need " approval by the cognizant U.S. government department or agency " ( I have not been able to figure out how to know that the cognizant department or agency is for any given subject ) .
Note that there is no reference to approval by the government in part ( 6 ) .
I think it is important to figure out what " published " means in this context .
For all parts except part ( 7 ) ( which says " not necessarily in published form " ) , technical data must be published ( by virtue of " Public domain means information which is published and " ) .
This could be a stumbling block on us invoking part ( 6 ) .

brmj Rochester , New York , United States Member posts 402 5 0 I detect a chicken - and - the - egg problem with the public domain defense , because something is necessarily not in the public domain when you first do something to put it in the public domain , and without such a defence , disseminating the sort of information that might involve could very well be a breach of ITAR .
Do I have some fundamental misunderstanding of how it works , or is this analysis basically correct ?
Also , thank you so much for doing this .

This does seem like a logically valid analysis to me , but we are , of course , dealing with the law and not logic .
If the law respected your common sense approach to this , why would those public domain stipulations be in there ?
Maybe there is a reason , I dunno .
It 's something we need to look into .

On the applicability of ITAR to the OHKLA project : Item ( a ) in category IV of the US Munitions List is " Rockets " , so it definitely seems like ITAR has the scope to affect the OHKLA project , which is all about a rocket .
However , the term " rocket " is incredibly vague .
Surely nobody really thinks ITAR applies to the lowest class of model rockets made for hobbyists .
What does " rocket " mean , exactly ?
§ 121.2 of ITAR is titled " Interpretations of the U.S. Munitions List and the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex " and " explain and amplify the terms used in § 121.1 " , which is exactly what we want to figure out exactly what " rocket " means , for ITAR purposes .
The only stuff in the interpretations section which refers to rockets is § 121.16 , " Missile Technology Control Regime Annex " .
The definition of " rocket " given here is restricted only to those devices " capable of delivering at least a 500 kg payload to a range of at least 300 km " .
If this is what " rocket " means in ITAR , then OHKLA is 100 % unaffected by ITAR , because it has capacities far , far below that benchmark .
This would be great news .
However , I am hesitant to jump to this conclusion .
§ 121.16 is not worded the same way other interpretation sections are .
Other sections are very clear .
E.g : Vessels of war means vessels , waterborne or submersible , designed , modified , or equipped for military purposes , including vessels described as developmental , " demilitarized " or decommissioned .
Vessels of war in Category VI , whether developmental , " demilitarized " and / or decommissioned or not , include , but are not limited to , the following : ( a ) Combatant vessels .
( 1 ) Warships ( including nuclear - powered versions ) : ( i ) Aircraft carriers .
( ii ) Battleships .
( iii ) Cruisers . ( iv ) Destroyers . ( v ) Frigates .
( vi ) Submarines .
( the list continues , btw , if you 're interested ) .
This is very clear : " X means Y .
Here are some examples : A , B , C " .
The section that includes the defintion of rocket involving payload mass and ranges is not worded in this nice clear way at all .
It begins with : Some of the items on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex are controlled by both the Department of Commerce on the Commodity Control List and by the Department of State on the United States Munitions List .
To the extent an article is on the United States Munitions List , a reference appears in parentheses listing the U.S. Munitions List category in which it appears .
The following items constitute all items on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex which are covered by the U.S. Munitions List : I am not sure if it is trying to say that the definition of " rocket " for ITAR purposes is the same as the definition of " rocket " for the purposes of this other law , the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex , ( in which case , OHKLA is 100 % okay and we can celebrate ) , or if it just trying to draw attention to the fact that some of things covered by ITAR are also covered by MTCRA ( i.e. the " interpretations " section of the document is over at this point and this is just something tacked on the end ) .
I am particularly uneasy about the part " The following items constitute all items on the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex which are covered by the U.S. Munitions List " .
This suggests that there may be items which are on the USML ( and hence covered by ITAR ) but not on the MTCRA , and these items might include rockets which do n't meet MTCRA 's definition .
Basically , it is very confusing and unclear to me what " rocket " means for the purposes of ITAR , but it looks like it is possible it means rockets which can carry 500 kg or stuff 300 km , and if that is what it means , then the OHKLA project has nothing to fear .
Let 's hope we can confirm that this is what it means .
EDIT : Very relevant , Item ( a ) in category IV of the USML is , in full , " Rockets ( including but not limited to meteorological
and other sounding rockets ) " .
I do n't think many meteorological rockets can carry 500 kg 300 km .
So this biases me to think that that definition is not the only kind of rocket ITAR applies to .
But if this is the case … hobby rockets are covered by ITAR ?
That 's absurd .
Are they excluded from ITAR by virtue of the Public Domain exceptions ?
Or the general science exceptions ?

It 's worth noting that all of this has recently gone under an in depth review , with plans to announce reform by April .
This means that all of this will very likely change in the next few days .
The reform is intended to promote trade and eliminate unnecessary obstacles , so hopefully this will solve all of the ITAR issues .
If anyone can find out exactly when this will be announced , please let us know .
EDIT : See Obama 's speech on this topic from March 11th : Text and video .

This is great news , and we should definitely wait until these reforms are described in more detail before making a hard and fast decision on anything related to ITAR .
I will try not to get too excited , though , as the SpaceNews.com article makes it sound like the main reform on the space front will be related to satellites .
This is great news for the CubeSat project , but it may not make a difference to ITAR 's impact on OHKLA and CLLARE .
Hopefully it will , though .
That would be excellent .

Short of doing that I think that our current understanding is sufficient to make some decisions .
Correct me if I am wrong , but if we incorporate outside of the US then CSTART itself wo n't be subject to ITAR , but members inside the US will still be under the law and their participation will be punishable ( if so prosecuted ) .
Since a large majority of the members and the funding will come from the US I think that it probably makes sense to incorporate in the US .
If all of our design work is done from public domain sources then we should be good to go .
Any original research work would have to be undertaken by groups offline and then published in online summaries that lack technical details .
I think that the tax benefit to our donors is worth incorporating in the US .

I am inclined to agree with pretty much everything in here .
Incorporating outside the US is a fairly poor solution to the ITAR problem because individual US contributors to CSTART are actually worse off , and we lose tax benefits for our largest expected source of donors .

heawill Toronto , ON Member posts 7 12 0 I 'm not sure that operating outside of the US does protect you from ITAR .
When I googled it initially after reading this thread there were a number of news articles about the US not giving the UK an exemption from ITAR or something along those lines , and Canada being subjected to some of the rules of ITAR , as well .
Specifically the article I found imposed ITAR rules about employee hiring that 's illegal in Canada , I think .
Anyway , I 'm just about to head out so I can't find it for you , but I 'll post some of the links later .

brmj Rochester , New York , United States Member posts 402 13 0 My understanding is that Canada has its own ITAR - like law (s ) .
What incorperating in a nation without something like ITAR does is , in my understanding , prevent CSTART from being held liable for ITAR breaches because ITAR would n't apply to the organization .
Individual members in the US and Canada would still be able to be charged for ITAR breaches , however .

This is my understanding .
Heawill , with regards to exemptions , I think the idea there is to relax the laws so that US citizens and US companies ( these , afterall , are the only entities ITAR can apply to – the US government has no authority over anybody else ) can export ITAR - controlled stuff to and import ITAR - controlled stuff from citizens and companies of other countries .
So making the UK ITAR exempt would mean someone in the US could email technical documents of a rocket to someone in the UK without breaking the law .
A lot of countries who cooperate with the US on military projects have pushed for these kind of exemptions , to drastically cut down on the bureaucratic overhead involved , but as far as I know the US has never agreed to it .

So , would I be correct in thinking that most people remain in favour of a US incorporation , based on our analysis of ITAR above ?
Another link to add to the pile : this page has ( under the section " Export Regulations " ) a short list of people who have violated ITAR , claimed in court that ITAR was a restriction of their First Amendment right to free speech , and been successful in doing so .
Both cases are related to crypotgraphy , not rocketry or space technology , so perhaps the relevance to us is slim , but it shows that ITAR can in principle be contested .
Also , the wording of the ruling in these cases seems to be very clear in suggesting that any source code , regardless of subject matter , cannot be controlled under ITAR : the computer source code is an
expressive means for the exchange of information and ideas about
computer programming . . . it is protected by the First
Amendment .
That 's pretty black and white .
It should apply equally well to , e.g. , source code for navigation systems .

A genetic study has found that Indians are the ancestors of the Chinese and other East Asian populations .
The study , a joint project of 10 Asian countries , found that India received a wave of migration from Africa 60,000 - 70,000 years ago and these early humans subsequently moved to East and Southeast Asia .
The earlier belief was that humans from Africa reached India and East and Southeast Asia separately .
The study has important implications , especially in the understanding of human migratory patterns and in the investigation of genetics and disease .
The findings of the five - year study — conducted by a group of 90 scientists , including those from India , in a consortium of 40 Asian laboratories under the Human Genome Organisation — have been published in the journal Science .
The study analysed genetic data of 1,900 individuals representing 73 population groups .
The findings showed that Asian genetic ancestry correlated highly with ethnic and linguistic groups and “ considerable gene flow was observed among sub-populations of the clusters ” that were studied ; the clusters included “ groups believed to practice endogamy ( marriage within a group ) based on linguistics , cultural and ethic information ” .
“ This large study establishes that Indians are ancestors of the Japanese , Chinese and all other East Asians .
All these populations have a common genetic origin and it shows that India represents a microcosm of Asia ’s genetic diversity , ” said Samir Brahmachari , director - general , Council for Scientific and Industrial Research — a participant in the study .
OTTAWA ( Reuters Life ! ) -
A group of British explorers just back from a 60 - day trip to the North Pole said Monday they had encountered unusual conditions , including ice sheets that drifted far faster than they had expected .
The three - member team walked across the frozen Arctic Ocean to study the impact of increased carbon dioxide absorption by the sea , which could make the water more acidic and put crucial food chains under pressure .
Expedition leader Ann Daniels said the ice drifted so much that they eventually covered 500 nautical miles ( 576 miles ) rather than the 268 nautical miles initially envisaged .
One possible reason for the rapid drift was a lack of ice , she suggested .
Satellite imagery reveals rapidly melting ice sheets in the Arctic , a region which is heating up three times more quickly than the rest of the Earth .
The first day the team was dropped off the ice moved so quickly to the south that it took the trio 10 days to make it back to their starting point .
“ None of us had ever experienced that amount of southerly drift on our previous expeditions , and it continued for such a long period of time .
We kept expecting it to stop , we began to pray it would stop , ” Daniels said .
“ At the end of the expedition we were losing three nautical miles a night ... it was quite a major factor , ” she told a news conference in Ottawa .
Many scientists link the higher Arctic temperatures to the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming .
Martin Hartley , a member of the team , said the condition of the ice was unpleasantly bad .
“ We spent a couple of days walking on ice that was three or four inches thick with no other thicker ice around , which was a big surprise to us , ” he told the news conference .
“ On more than one occasion we came across enormous areas of very thin ice , which is quite stressful to travel on .
We came across open water which we had to swim across . ”
At one point an ice floe the team ’s tent was moored on broke apart , although no one was injured .
Last month explorers at the team ’s ice base some 680 miles further south reported a three - minute rain shower , which they described as a freak event .
The team is due to release preliminary results this September .
The C$3 million ( $ 2.9 million ) expedition is sponsored by British insurer Catlin .
( $ 1= $ 1.04 Canadian )

Warum müssen deutsche Soldaten in Afghanistan sterben ?
Überzeugende Antworten bietet die Regierung nicht .
Stattdessen gibt sie sich selbstgerecht .
Das haben die Soldaten nicht verdient .
Ein Kommentar von Hans Peter Schütz
Angela Merkel hat im Bundestag den Deutschen den Krieg erklärt .
Wieder einmal ist die Kanzlerin jedoch bei dem Versuch gescheitert , überzeugend darzulegen , weshalb in Afghanistan deutsche Soldaten sterben und weshalb deutsche Soldaten dort Zivilisten töten .
Die Trauer über die Gefallenen im Parlament war dabei zwar parteiübergreifend spürbar echt .
Die Argumente , mit denen die Regierungsparteien - und teilweise auch die SPD - den
Tod deutscher Soldaten argumentativ als sinnvoll einzukleiden versuchten , dokumentierten jedoch lediglich einmal mehr die schon bekannte Hilflosigkeit der deutschen Politik , dem Thema Afghanistan gerecht zu werden .
Die Trauer um die Soldaten hätte eine Chance geboten für selbstkritische Überlegungen der politisch Verantwortlichen .
Sie blieb ungenutzt .
Am weitesten trieb diese Haltung die Kanzlerin .
" Dieses Mandat ist über jeden vernünftigen völkerrechtlichen oder verfassungsrechtlichen Zweifel erhaben " , sagte Angela Merkel in ihrer Regierungserklärung im Bundestagsplenum .
Selbstgerecht wurde auch einmal mehr jener wohlklingende Satz des ehemaligen SPD - Verteidigungsministers Peter Struck bemüht , wonach unsere Freiheit auch am Hindukusch verteidigt werde .
Als ob sich mit dieser Floskel der Krieg - wenigstens dieses
Wort wird jetzt schnörkellos benutzt - in Afghanistan rechtfertigen ließe .
Man ihn über moralische , verfassungsrechtliche und völkerrechtliche Zweifel hinausheben könnte .
Nur ein Beispiel : Wenn in Afghanistan eine Brutstätte des internationalen Terrorismus bekämpft wird , weshalb plädiert die Bundesregierung dann nicht auch für den Einsatz deutscher Soldaten im Jemen oder in Somalia , wo ebenfalls Terroristen trainiert werden ?
Weshalb zwingt man dann nicht Pakistan , notfalls militärisch , endlich die Ausbildungslager der Taliban auf seinem Staatsgebiet zu schließen ?
Und wenn jetzt schon die Diskussion emotional mit dem Hinweis aufgeheizt wird , bald drohten uns schließlich echte oder schmutzige Atomwaffen in den Händen dieses internationalen Terrorismus , dann müsste auch der Einmarsch in den Iran gepredigt werden .
Doch nicht einmal die simple Frage wird gestellt , weshalb nicht endlich die Mitfinanzierung dieses Terrors durch trübe saudiarabische Quellen verhindert wird .
Vielen Fragen unbeantwortet
All diesen Perspektiven wird das Totschlagargument entgegen gehalten : Wer den Rückzug aus Afghanistan fordert , handelt unverantwortlich .
Da Merkel so argumentiert , muss sie sich fragen lassen , weshalb dann bereits heute ein Ende des Engagements auf der Londoner Konferenz fixiert worden ist , wenngleich ohne klares Datum .
Schon nächstes
Jahr soll die Übergabe der rechtsstaatlichen Verantwortung an die afghanische Regierung beginnen .
Unbeantwortet blieb dabei auch die Frage , ob eine Regierung , die demokratischen Maßstäben nur halbwegs genügt , dort erreichbar ist .
Jeder weiß doch , dass das amtierende Regime in Afghanistan bereits heute mit Taliban - nahen Gebietsfürsten kooperiert .
Für die Zeit , wenn die Deutschen weg sind .
Der Einsatz deutscher Soldaten in diesem Land steht auf dem dünnen Papier staatspolitischer Erklärungen - des Bundestags wie der Vereinten Nationen .
Die deutsche Politik will sich , nur ein Beispiel , partout nicht mehr daran erinnern , dass es einst die USA waren , die die Taliban im Kampf gegen die Sowjetunion unterstützt haben .
Das war gewiss kein Beitrag zum Ziel des Weltfriedens , wie es heute beschworen wird .
Ebenso argumentativ absurd ist es , wenn Politiker der Union und der FDP noch immer intensive Wortgefechte über die Frage führen , ob in Afghanistan Krieg geführt wird oder nicht .
Die einen wollen Kampfpanzer hinschicken , andere wollen mit mehr Haubitzen Sprengfallen verhindern .
Nur " Krieg " soll das noch immer irgendwie nicht sein .
Offenes Desinteresse
Die Bilanz von fast zehn Jahren Afghanistan - Engagement ist doch deprimierend .
Der Aufbau eines funktionierenden Systems der inneren Sicherheit kommt nicht voran .
Was mehr floriert denn je ist der Heroinexport .
Die Grundrechte einer demokratischen Gesellschaft sind allenfalls rudimentär realisiert .
Hierfür sollen deutsche Soldaten ihren Kopf hinhalten ?
Diese zentrale Frage wird weiterhin nicht beantwortet .
Weil die Ziele des Krieges in Afghanistan noch immer nicht endlich kritisch überprüft werden .
Letztlich nie offen hinterfragt worden sind .
Das wurde jetzt einmal mehr im Bundestag personell dokumentiert : Noch vor Halbzeit der Debatte hatten sich Außenminister Westerwelle und Entwicklungshilfeminister Niebel aus dem Bundestag verdrückt .
Dieses Desinteresse am argumentativen Austausch im Rahmen einer Regierungserklärung belegt auch ein Desinteresse am Schicksal jener deutschen Soldaten , die noch nach Afghanistan geschickt werden sollen .

IT IS the best of times and the worst of times for lunar scientists .
“ We ’ve got a revolution going on in our understanding of the lunar surface , ” says Rick Elphic of NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View , California .
Three recent missions have found an unexpectedly large supply of water on the moon that could both quench the thirst of future lunar dwellers and produce fuel for missions to other places in the solar system .
Yet the prospect of astronauts getting there any time soon is receding fast .
In February , President Barack Obama announced his intention to cancel NASA ’s Constellation programme , which included plans to get astronauts back to the moon by the early 2020s .
His decision leaves the US without a reliable means of transport to low Earth orbit , let alone the moon .
Even so , the 2010s are shaping up to be a boom time for lunar science .
The Obama administration ’s plans give strong financial support to robotic exploration of the solar system , including the moon .
NASA already has four robotic missions in the works , designed to explore the moon ’s atmosphere , gravity and seismology .
And one of the three finalists to be NASA ’s next medium - sized mission is a robot called MoonRise , which would land in the vast South Pole - Aitken basin , dig up soil samples and return them to Earth .
China and India , too , are planning follow - ups to their successful Chang ’e and Chandrayaan orbiters , and Russia and Germany have missions in development .
What has reinvigorated lunar science most of all are the discoveries of water made last year by NASA ’s …

There 's almost a direct correlation these days between the Obama Administration 's complaints about " special interests " and its own fealty to such interests .
Consider its latest decree that federal contractors must be union shops .
The federal rule , which went live yesterday , implements an executive order President Obama signed within weeks of taking office .
It encourages federal agencies to require " project labor agreements " for all construction projects larger than $ 25 million .
This means that only contractors that agree to ...
THE controversial secular ethics trial starting today in NSW schools is a policy of the previous premier and does not have full support from the Keneally government , says the NSW head of Catholic scripture teachers .
'' We got the great feeling that this was one of Nathan Rees 's personal babies , '' said Robert Haddad , the director of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine for the Archdiocese of Sydney .
During a meeting with representatives from the office of the Education Minister , Verity Firth , last month , Mr Haddad '' really got the feeling that these guys were lamenting that they had to carry the can for someone else 's policy ' ' , he said .
Ms Firth confirmed the trial would begin today , denying it had been delayed .
She insisted the trial , which has been attacked by religious lobby groups , was '' very important to me as minister ' ' .
The Catholic Bishop of Wollongong , Peter Ingham , speaking on behalf of the Catholic bishops of NSW , said the decision to conduct the probationary program was made by Mr Rees just before he was replaced as premier .
Mr Haddad said Baulkham Hills North , where all parents were told about the ethics classes , not just those whose children had opted out of scripture , was ''an example of the abuse that will inevitably follow .
There was a 47 per cent uptake [ of the ethics class ] and that eroded into the number of students who are going to SRE , so our case is borne out , '' he said .
Children would always choose what was '' new and exciting ' ' , sometimes to their detriment .
'' Medicine is not always going to taste sweet , '' he said .
On March 17 religious educators including Mr Haddad , Bishop Ingham and the head of the Inter - Church Commission on Religious Education in Schools , Ann -Maree Whenman , spoke to ministerial staffers , seeking an assurance that religious educators would be part of the trial 's evaluation .
( Natural News ) The British National Health Service ( NHS ) has begun bribing teenage girls between the ages of 16 and 18 to get Gardasil vaccines .
Officials are giving shopping vouchers worth the equivalent of roughly $ 70 to girls who agree to get jabbed with the vaccine , which has been implicated in numerous cases of severe harm and death .
Officials from NHS Birmingham East and North have initiated the pilot program which is costing taxpayers the equivalent of about $ 35,000 .
No parental consent is required in order for young girls to participate in the program .
Many governments around the world have been pushing Gardasil through national campaigns designed to scare and entice women into getting the vaccine .
The U.K. is no exception , as it continues to push for all girls between 12 and 18 years old to receive the shots , despite outcry from concerned citizens over the dangers of the vaccine .
The latest pilot program scam , however , essentially bribes young girls to get the vaccine with public funds .
" [ The project is ] a serious misuse of taxpayers ' money , " said Norman Wells , Director of Family and Youth Concern , a national educational trust in the U.K. that researchers the causes and consequences of family breakdown .
To make matters worse , Gardasil is not even effective at preventing the HPV virus for which it is being marketed .
According to Dr. Diane Harper , lead researcher for the development of both Gardasil and Cervarix , said in an interview that the vaccines do little to reduce cervical cancer rates .
According to her , seventy percent of all HPV infections subside on their own within a year , and 90 percent subside within two years without any treatment .
Only half of the remaining ten percent will even develop into cervical cancer .
Harper also admitted that current preventive measures are already effectively reducing the number of cases of cervical cancer and that , even if most girls received the vaccine , Gardasil would not even be able to match what traditional care is already doing .
Add to this the mounting number of girls who have been seriously injured , paralyzed , or have died from the vaccine , it is hard to believe that any government agency gets away with promoting , or even mandating , the toxic snake oil .
Merck , the manufacturer of Gardasil , has been working very hard to get the vaccine mandated for all young girls and has even begun to target young boys .
At a cost of roughly $ 500 a pop , it becomes disturbingly clear why many politicians and government agencies are cooperating with Merck to market the dangerous and ineffective vaccine .

I started watching this debate hoping that Nick Clegg would wipe the floor with the other guys .
This is not solely because Pavlovianly , I salivate at any mention of the words “ Liberal Democrat ” ; in the past ( from a safe distance to be sure ) I ’ve always preferred Labour , even when poor old threadbare Michael Foot was in charge .
But if Clegg and the Lib Dems do well enough on May 6th to deny either of the two parties a parliamentary majority , then the United Kingdom will get some kind of proportional or semi-proportional electoral reform .
And , because the British constitution is the prototype from which our own is derived , that might at last spark some interest in that sort of thing on this side of the Atlantic .
( As regular readers of this blog know , electoral reform is my Holy Grail cum White Whale .
If you want details , look to this blog ’s Electoral Reform category . )
Post - debate , I have to say that the floor remains unwiped .
Clegg did well , but not as well as I ’d hoped ; David Cameron , the Tory leader , did equally well or maybe a little better .
Sad , weary Prime Minister Gordon Brown more or less held his own , but this is a change election and he appeared resigned to the inevitable .
Mainly , though , I was struck by how superior this event was to its typical American counterpart , in a number of ways :
The crispness and clarity of the debaters .
The businesslike , non-preening moderator , David Dimbleby — the Brits , it seems , still have a Cronkite .
The audience , which listened attentively and respected what I assume was a request to refrain from applauding or hooting or otherwise behaving like a mob or a claque .
The fact that neither Cameron nor Clegg went medieval on Brown for his ridiculous “ bigot ” gaffe — not that doing so would have benefitted them , given British manners .
The near - total lack of obviously rehearsed zingers .
( Emphasis on obviously . )
The fact that none of the candidates appeared to be a sociopath , a delusionary , a demagogue , or a serious neurotic .
They all seem to be relatively decent people .
The topic was the economy , and some of the themes and patterns faintly echoed our own .
The Conservative wants to cut both social spending and taxes on business .
The Labourite wants to keep public spending up as long as economic recovery is uncertain — a classic Keynesian argument .
Cameron , by contrast , drew the hoary , faulty old analogy between family budgets and national ones .
The Lib Dem wants some sort of post- election domestic summit to get real on the budget : tripartisanship , I suppose , which goes Obama one better .
And immigration is an issue that makes all three of them visibly uncomfortable .
But the differences make an American a little envious .
Cameron wants to cut inheritance taxes on the well - off , but not , apparently , on the superrich .
( And the inheritance tax is called by its proper name .
Unlike American conservatives , the Tories have n’t got around to dubbing it the “ death tax . ” )
Even though Cameron mentioned in his closing statement that “ I love this country , ” there was no boastful “ patriotism , ” no chest - pounding about The Greatest Nation On Earth .
And no one mentioned the menace of “ socialized medicine . ”
I have qualms about the Americanization — the Presidentialization — of British politics .
These debates change the focus from the parties and their policies ( which are outlined in manifestos that are taken seriously , even by those who draw them up ) to the leaders and their personalities .
I ’m not sure that what Western democracies need is greater fealty to the Führerprinzip .
There is a middle way , and , unsurprisingly , it ’s Swedish .
The best TV debate I ever saw was in Sweden , in 1976 .
The leaders of the four main parties at the time sat behind a semicircular desk .
Because the Social Democrats were twice the size of any of the others , they got an extra seat , occupied by their economic spokesman , and a little extra time .
The best feature of the debate was this : behind each politician was a chair occupied by an aide .
Throughout the two hours , the pols would confer in whispers with their aides , who frequently passed them notes .
This , I remember thinking at the time , rendered the event unlike the sort of high school debate cum memorization contest we are accustomed to in the United States and made it into something more closely resembling the actual work of government .
I would recommend this practice to the British , before it ’s too late .
The dominant belief on this site seems to be in the " psychological unity of mankind " .
In other words , all of humanity shares the same underlying psychological machinery .
Furthermore , that machinery has not had the time to significantly change in the 50,000 or so years that have passed after we started moving out of our ancestral environment .
In The 10,000 Year Explosion , Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending dispute part of this claim .
While they freely admit that we have probably not had enough time to develop new complex adaptations , they emphasize the speed at which minor adaptations can spread throughout populations and have powerful effects .
Their basic thesis is that the notion of a psychological unity is most likely false .
Different human populations are likely for biological reasons to have slightly different minds , shaped by selection pressures in the specific regions the populations happened to live in .
They build support for their claim by :
Discussing known cases where selection has led to rapid physiological and psychological changes among animals
Discussing known cases where selection has led to physiological changes among humans in the last few thousand years , as well as presenting some less certain hypotheses of this .
Postulating selection pressures that would have led to some cognitive abilities to be favored among humans .
In what follows , I will present their case by briefly summarizing the contents of the book .
Do note that I 've picked the points that I found the most interesting , leaving a lot out .
They first chapter begins by discussing a number of interesting examples :
Dogs were domesticated from wolves around 15,000 years ago : by now , there exists a huge variety of different dog breeds .
Dogs are good at reading human voice and gestures , while wolves can't understand us at all .
Male wolves pair - bond with females and put a lot of effort into helping raise their pups , but male dogs generally do not .
Most of the dog breeds we know today are no more than a couple of centuries old .
There is considerable psychological variance between dog breeds : in 1982 - 2006 , there were 1,110 dog attacks in the US that were attributable to pit bull terriers , but only one attributable to Border collies .
Border collies , on average , learn a new command after 5 repetitions and respond correctly 95 percent of the time , while a basset hound needs 80 - 100 repetitions for a 25 percent accuracy rate .
A Russian scientist needed only forty years to successfully breed a domesticated fox .
His foxes were friendly and enjoyed human contact , very unlike wild foxes .
Their coat color also lightened , their skulls became rounder , and some of them were born with floppy ears .
While 50,000 years may not be enough for new complex adaptations to develop , it is enough time for them to disappear .
A useless but costly adaptation will vanish in a quick period : fish in lightless caves lose their sight over a few thousand years at most .
An often - repeated claim is that there 's much more within - group human genetic variation than between - group ( 85 and 15 percent , to be exact ) .
While this is true , the frequently drawn conclusion , that phenotype differences between individuals would be larger than the average difference between groups , does not follow .
Most ( 70 percent ) of dog genetic variation is also within - breed .
One important point is that the direction of the genetic differences tends to be correlated : a particular Great Dane may have a low - growth version of a certain gene while a particular Chihuahua has a high - growth version , but on the whole the Great Dane will still have more high - growth versions .
Also , not all mutations have the same impact : some have practically no effect , while others have a huge one .
Since the common ancestry of humans ( or dogs ) is so short , observable differences between populations must have evolved rapidly , which is only possible if the mutations had a strong selective advantage .
There are gene variants causing observable differences in appearance between human populations , such as the ones causing light skin color or blue eyes .
For such systematic differences to appear , there must have been big effects on fitness , anything up from a 2 or 3 percent increase .
From the rate at which new alleles have spread , this must be the case at least for genes that determine skin color , eye color , lactose tolerance , and dry earwax .
Molecular genetics has found hundreds of cases of mutations that indicate recent selection .
Many of them are very recent .
A significant number of Europeans and Chinese bear mutations that originated at about 5,500 years ago .
The rate at which new mutations have been popping up and spreading over the past few thousand years is on the order of 100 times greater than the long - term rate over the past few million years .
The second chapter of the book is devoted to a discussion about the " big bang " in cultural evolution that occured about 30,000 to 40,000 years ago .
During that time , people began coming up with technological and social innovations at an unprecedented rate .
Cave paintings , sculpture and jewelry starting showing up .
Tools made during this period were manufactured using materials hundreds of miles away , when previously they had been manufactured with local materials - implying that some sort of trade or exchange developed .
Humans are claimed to have been maybe 100 times as inventive than in earlier times .
The authors argue that this was caused by a biological change : that genetic changes allowed for a cultural development in 40,000 BC that had n't been possible in 100,000 BC .
More specifically , they suggest that this could have been caused by interbreeding between " modern " humans and Neanderthals .
Even though Neanderthals are viewed as cognitively less developed than modern humans , archeological evidence suggests that at least up to 100,000 years ago , they were n't seriously behind the modern humans of the time .
Neanderthals also had a different way of life , being high - risk , highly cooperative hunters while the anatomically modern humans probably had a mixed diet and were more like modern hunter - gatherers .
It is known that ongoing natural selection in two populations can allow for simultaenous exploration of divergent development paths .
It would have been entirely possible that the anatomically modern humans interbred with Neanderthals to some degree , the Neanderthals being a source of additional genetic variance that the modern humans could have benefited from .
How would this have happened ?
In effect , the modern humans would have had their own highly beneficial alleles , in addition to which they'd have picked up the best alleles the Neanderthals had .
Out of some 20,000 Neanderthal genes , it 's highly likely that at least some of them were worth having .
There was n't much interbreeding , so Neanderthal genes with a neutral or negative effect would have disappeared from the modern human population pretty quickly .
On the other hand , a beneficial gene 's chance of spreading in the population is two times its fitness advantage .
If beneficial genes are every now and then injected to the modern human population , chances are that eventually they will end up spreading to fixation .
And indeed , both skeletal and genetic evidence shows signs of Neanderthal genes .
There are at least two genes , one regulating brain size that appeared about 37,000 years ago and one playing role in speech that appeared about 42,000 years ago , that could plausibly have contributed to the cultural explosion and which may have come from the Neanderthals .
The third chapter discusses the effect of agriculture , which first appeared 10,000 or so years ago .
60,000 years ago , there were something like a quarter of a million modern humans .
3,000 years ago , thanks to the higher food yields allowed by agriculture , there were 60 million humans .
A larger population means there 's more genetic variance : mutations that had previously occurred every 10,000 years or so were now showing up every 400 years .
The changed living conditions also began to select for different genes .
A " gene sweep " is a process where beneficial alleles increase in frequency , " sweeping through " the population until everyone has them .
Hundreds of these are still ongoing today .
For European and Chinese samples , the sweeps ' rate of origination peaked at about 5,000 years ago and at 8,500 years ago for one African sample .
While the full functions of these alleles are still not known , it is known that most involve changes in metabolism and digestion , defenses against infectious disease , reproduction , DNA repair , or in the central nervous system .
The development of agriculture led , among other things , to a different mix of foods , frequently less healthy than the one enjoyed by hunter - gatherers .
For instance , vitamin D was poorly available in the new diet .
However , it is also created by ultraviolet radiation from the sun interacting with our skin .
After the development of agriculture , several new mutations showed up that led to people in the areas more distant from the equator having lighter skins .
There is also evidence of genes that reduce the negative effects associated with e.g. carbohydrates and alcohol .
Today , people descending from populations that have n't farmed as long , like Australian Aborigines and many Amerindians , have a distinctive track record of health problems when exposed to Western diets .
DNA retrieved from skeletons indicates that 7,000 to 8,000 years ago , no - one in central and northern Europe had the gene for lactose tolerance .
3,000 years , about 25 percent of people in central Europe had it .
Today , about 80 percent of the central and northern European population carries the gene .
The fourth chapter continues to discuss mutations that have spread during the last 10,000 or so years .
People in certain areas have more mutations giving them a resistance to malaria than people in others .
The human skeleton has become more lightly built , more so in some populations .
Skull volume has decreased apparently in all populations : in Europeans it is down 10 percent from the hight point about 20,000 years ago .
For some reason , Europeans also have a lot of variety in eye and hair color , whereas most of the rest of the world has dark eyes and dark hair , implying some Europe - specific selective pressure that happened to also affect those .
As for cognitive changes : there are new versions of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters .
Several of the alleles have effects on serotonin .
There are new , mostly regional , versions of genes that affect brain development : axon growth , synapse formation , formation of the layers of the cerebral cortex , and overall brain growth .
Evidence from genes affecting both brain development and muscular strength , as well as our knowledge of the fact that humans in 100,000 BC had stronger muscles than we do have today , suggests that we may have traded off muscle strength for higher intelligence .
There are also new versions of genes affecting the inner ear , implying that our hearing may still be adapting to the development of language - or that specific human populations might even be adapting to characteristics of their local languages or language families .
Ruling elites have been known to have far more offspring than those of the lower classes , implying selective pressures may also have been work there .
8 percent of Ireland 's male population carries an Y chromosome descending from Niall of the Nine Hostages , a high king of Ireland around AD 400. 16 million men in central Asia are direct descendants of Genghis Khan .
Most interestingly , people descended from farmers and the lower classes may be less aggressive and more submissive than others .
People in agricultural societies , frequently encountering lots of people , are likely to suffer a lot more from being overly aggressive than people in hunter - gatherer societies .
Rulers have also always been quick to eliminate those breaking laws or otherwise opposing the current rule , selecting for submissiveness .
The fifth chapter discusses various ways ( trade , warfare , etc. ) by which different genes have spread through the human population throughout time .
The sixth chapter discusses various historical encounters between humans of different groups .
Amerindians were decimated by the diseases Europeans brought with them , but the Europeans were not likewise decimated by American diseases .
Many Amerindians have a very low diversity of genes regulating their immune system , while even small populations of Old Worlders have highly diverse versions of these genes .
On the other hand , Europeans had for a long time difficulty penetrating into Africa , where the local inhabitants had highly evolved genetic resistances to the local diseases .
Also , Indo -European languages might have spread so widely in part because an ancestor protolanguge was spoken by lactose tolerant herders .
The ability to keep cattle for their milk and not just their flesh allowed the herders to support larger amounts of population per acre , therefore displacing people without lactose tolerance .
The seventh chapter discusses Ashkenazi Jews , whose average IQ is around 112 - 115 and who are vastly overrepresented among successful scientists , among other things .
However , no single statement of Jews being unusually intelligent is found anywhere in preserved classical literature .
In contrast , everyone thought that classical Greeks were unusually clever .
The rise in Ashkenazi intelligence seems to be a combination of interbreeding and a history of being primarily in cognitively challenging occupations .
The majority of Ashkenazi jews were moneylenders by 1100 , and the pattern continued for several centuries .
Other Jewish populations , like the ones the living in the Islamic countries , were engaged in a variety of occupations and do not seem to have an above - average intelligence .
Throughout human history man have always had a very tight bond with plants of all sorts , weaving them into all sorts of spells , performances , and ceremonies .
This behavior is known from different cultures from all over the world , from the cannabis smoking holy men of India to the peyote - eating shamans of South and Central America .
Some herbs are used for religious purposes .
Others are used for personal gain .
Examples of this are that some herbs are used to attract love while others are believed to give you good financial fortune .
A binary options trader might use ginger root to try to attract good luck .
Someone who is desperately in love might use lavender to try to attract their desired partner .
The common trait of many of these sacred plants is their ability to alter the consciousness of the consumer of any such plant .
In these altered states the shamans , priests or whoever is conducting the ritual , claims to be able to do a wide range of spiritual tasks .
These tasks include practices like astral projection , divination , healing the sick , calling for blessing , communicating with gods and deities and peering into the future .
It can seem almost unfathomable how our ancestors discovered these plants given there is an almost infinite variety of plants on this earth .
Something deep inside must have led those first shamans and priests to scour nature for help in their spiritual quest .
As you start to look into the world of sacred plants and their ceremonial uses you can start to truly appreciate how deep the bond to nature runs in both the ancient and contemporary human spirit .
One of the things that become obvious is that man has always found spiritual guidance in nature and have used nature ’s different ethnogenic plants to live up to their spiritual potential .
Admiration is in place for these first movers and internal explorers , because not only did they charge courageously into an uncharted headspace , they also kept track of the plants they were using .
The richness of the wilderness is great , but sometimes the differences are subtle and minute .
The art and science of telling plants from each other is one that is hard to learn and require time and discipline , even in this day of age .
What the ancient healers , priests and likeminded folks did can be seen as the start of pharmacology and botany .
By collecting , inspecting and describing the appearances of different plants they started traditions which later would develop into modern medicine , morphological biology , and herbology .
To write these articles I have scoured the web for information on the topic , and it quickly became clear that the contemporary community around ethnogenic plants is soaring to new heights .
It seemed I was not the only one looking into the old ways , to find inspiration for a new future .
As we move further and further away from the nature that binds us all together , some truths become less and less apparent , and that is where the sacred plants enter the floor .
These plants and the ceremonies and rituals that often comes with them , possess old knowledge and wisdom , knowledge and wisdom which have proved itself important enough to be kept alive for decades .
As you will discover the geographical spread of these plants can only be described as worldwide .
Some plants require specific conditions to flourish , but all parts of the world have their own sacred plants which live in their specific environment .
But there are plants that transcend their native habitats and have spread far and wide , Cannabis being a good example of that .
The following small articles are about some of the most important plants from around the world .
The list includes :
All of these have immense significance in their respective cultures and communities and by understanding them better you will gain insight into the people who use them and maybe ultimately yourself .
More videos will come in the future , but I wanted to get this one up right quick .
My rock climbing crew LCO went out to Las Vegas to climb back in March 2010 .
This video is from day 2 when we climbed Johnny Vegas .
We had planned on climbing Solar Slab after Johnny Vegas which is 8 more pitches , but we got a late start ( I dunno how because we were out the door at 5 am ) and there was some slow moving traffic ( climbers ) up ahead of us on the wall .
It was probably a good decision because we probably would n’t have finished the climb before dark .
If that happened it would have been really dangerous to walk out of there .
So we made the hard decision of bailing on the route .
It was the right thing to do though .
So besides Johnny Vegas we has some really great days in Ice Box Canyon , and toolin ’ around the second and third pullouts .
Below are some photos taken by my good buddies Tina ( vraiphoto.com ) and Liesl ( liesldieselphoto.com ) :
European campaigns to ban burqas , the Swiss vote to bar new construction of minarets and attempted terrorist acts in the United States have renewed questions and concerns about the compatibility of Islam with Western society .
Swiss - born scholar and philosopher of Islam Tariq Ramadan has written and spoken on the subject , generating widespread debate and reaction .
The U.S. State Department recently overturned his six - year ban from the country , allowing him to visit and speak in the U.S.
How have his experiences influenced his views on the reform of radical Islam and the bridging of cultural differences ?
What can Western Muslims do to balance faith and modernity ?
And what lies ahead for the future of Islam in Europe , the U.S. and the rest of the world ?
Ramadan addressed these questions and related topics at a press luncheon hosted by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
Ramadan is a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Oxford ’s St Antony ’s College .
He is also the president of a Brussels - based think tank , European Muslim Network , and the author of more than 20 books , including What I Believe , published in November 2009 .
Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers of 2009 .

LUIS LUGO : Good afternoon and thank you all for coming .
I ’m Luis Lugo , director of the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
We are a project of the Pew Research Center , which is a nonpartisan organization that does not take positions on issues or policy debates .
This event is part of our Pew Forum luncheon series , which brings together journalists and important public figures to discuss timely topics at the intersection of religion and public affairs .
The Pew Forum ’s partners in this series are Michael Cromartie of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and E.J. Dionne of the Brookings Institution and The Washington Post .
Our format at these events , as you know , is very , very simple .
We have our guest speaker speak for 10 , 15 minutes or so , just to get things started .
Then we get you folks into the conversation .
That ’s really what this is about .
I should mention that this meeting is on the record and is being recorded .
Before I introduce Professor Ramadan , I should mention and acknowledge Peter Mandaville from George Mason University , who was very instrumental in helping us arrange this event .
Peter is a professor in the Department of Public and International Affairs and is the co-director of the Center for Global Studies at George Mason University .
He has been working with us for the last year or so as a visiting fellow , working with a team of scholars who are going to produce a detailed study of the most influential Muslim movements and networks in Europe .
We plan to release that some time in mid-to - late June .
Is that right , Alan Cooperman ?
Correct .
Now it is my pleasure to introduce our special guest who really needs no introduction , not to this audience .
Tariq Ramadan teaches Islamic studies at Oxford University and holds a senior research fellow position at Doshisha .
Okay , I always pronounce Japanese names with my Cuban accent .
I can never get away with it .
Anyway , it ’s in Kyoto , Japan .
He is also president of the European Muslim Network , a think tank based in Brussels .
Professor Ramadan serves as an adviser on religious issues for the European Union , and he was also invited to join a U.K. government task force on countering extremism in the wake of the 2005 London bombings .
Time and Foreign Policy magazines have named him to their respective lists of the world ’s leading thinkers .
He has authored or co-authored numerous articles and books , including the 2009 bestseller , What I Believe .
Thank you for joining us today , Professor Ramadan .
We look forward to hearing from you and engaging you in conversation .
Welcome .
TARIQ RAMADAN : Thank you .
Thank you , Pew Forum , for this invitation here today .
Also , yes , I want to thank Peter Mandaville for his support , not only for coordinating with the Pew Forum , but also when I was banned from the country six years ago , he was one of the scholars and professors who were supportive from the very beginning .
This is why in my last book , you have a series of names and he is one of the people I thank for what they did in supporting me in the face of something which was a silly decision by the Bush administration , preventing me from entering the country for ideological reasons much more than anything else .
I do n’t want to talk too much at the beginning .
It ’s just a very short introduction about my work and really why I am trying to work today , not only in the West but also in Muslim - majority countries .
Because if you look at what I have been trying to do , my work over the last 25 years is really on two different levels and also in two different areas .
The first , two different levels within academia , is really to produce books and thoughts and try to challenge some of the traditional , classical Islamic understandings from within , which is also something which is quite important .
So books on Islamic issues within the Islamic classical tradition , but also , of course , on Islamic issues in the West .
This is at the academic level but also , at the grassroots level , to be in touch with Muslim - majority societies to deal with some of the issues in Muslim communities in the West .
So it ’s really two areas and two levels .
If you look at the books , there is a series on issues in Muslim - majority countries .
For example , the title for today ’s discussion , “ Islam , the West and the Challenges of Modernity , ” is in fact the title of a book , where I ’m trying to deal with Islamic issues and principles and objectives in Muslim - majority countries .
I have a series of books on this , so it ’s really about what is going on in the Middle East , in Asia , about the contemporary challenges for Muslim - majority countries .
The other series of books is really about Western Muslims .
I started by writing a book at the beginning of the ’90s about Muslims in secular societies and then , To be a European Muslim and then , Western Muslims and the Future of Islam .
Radical Reform : Islamic Ethics and Liberation is a book from within the Islamic tradition .
It ’s to go from what I think are the limits of dealing with fiqh issues , which is Islamic law and jurisprudence , to the fundamentals .
And this is across the board .
It ’s for Muslims living in Muslim - majority countries , as well as Muslims living in the West .
These are common challenges , and what I am trying to propose here is a radical reform in the way we deal with the scriptures – rethinking the classical way of reading the scriptural sources and also addressing the contemporary challenges of promoting and applying Islamic ethics for our time .
We need to go from adaptational reform to transformational reform , which is not to adapt ourselves to the way things are , but to propose applied ethics to change them for the better .
So it ’s with the contribution of Muslim scholars in Muslim - majority countries as well as with the contributions of scholars in the West that we can come to a better understanding of the very meaning of reform , and this is something which is important .
Having said that , what is also important is to promote a shift in the center of gravity of authority in Islam .
And this is what I am trying to advocate in the book , that we can not rely on scholars of the text .
We need to bring on board scholars of the context if we want to be serious about contemporary challenges .
This is something which is quite important .
But it has to do with a shift in the center of gravity of authority .
Why ?
Because what we are used to is the Islamic answer only coming from scholars of the text .
When it comes to social sciences , when it comes to medical sciences , for example – I am using this as an example in the book because I am treating seven practical areas in the second half of the book , case studies , where I am saying , Muslims are doing good in medicine , but they are not doing so good in anything which has to do with social sciences , with education , with women , with economy , with philosophy and politics .
I ’m trying to come up with a new framework for Islamic applied ethics .
This is a book where I ’m talking really about our contemporary challenges .
It ’s really about , not only the West – because I think that we should be careful not to confuse Western issues with Muslim - majority countries ’ issues , but we should also be careful not to disconnect everything by saying , oh , this is not the same .
I am saying from within that there is only one Islam , but there are many interpretations and many Islamic cultures , and what we are dealing with today in the West will have and already has had tremendous impact in what is going on in Muslim - majority countries .
So there is a dialogue .
With my position now at Oxford , what I ’m really trying to do now is to establish a double network of scholars in the West and in Muslim - majority countries talking to each other at different levels to promote this applied ethics .
It ’s a kind of practical translation of the main statements of that book .
The last book , What I Believe – this is something which was , in fact , a request from a publisher , an Italian publisher , telling me , all your academic books are too thick , too big , to be read by people .
They are not reading .
So we want something which is a simple book for people in a hurry to be able to understand what your position is about Western Muslims .
What I Believe is really a summary of what my positions are on Western Muslims .
“ Western Muslims ” means in Canada , in the United States of America , in European countries , as well as in Australia .
I visited all these countries , and while I was banned from the country , I kept on being involved in discussions with Muslims living in the States .
This is something that I am following because I really think that we need this kind of dialogue about the Western experience .
Because even though people are saying , oh , it ’s quite different between Europe and the West – and that ’s true ; between Europe and the States , it ’s quite different – still there are common challenges , and we are dealing with things that we have to understand in a comprehensive way .
So that ’s it .
This is what I ’m trying to do , and now , my main concern is really to go for something which is this Islamic applied ethics for contemporary challenges and connecting the Muslim - majority countries with the West , knowing that what we are coming with as responses to our challenges is read and listened to in Muslim - majority countries .
This is what I am experiencing when I go to Morocco , to Jordan – in the countries where I can go that are Muslim - majority countries .
Then in Asia – for example , I was in Indonesia – it ’s really clear that our contribution coming from the West is listened to , is heard – even in Malaysia , for example ; recently I was there .
The Singaporeans ’ experience when they speak about the Singaporean Muslim identity is exactly what we are saying about us being European and Muslims at the same time or American and Muslims at the same time .
So this is connected and I think that these are the challenges ahead and we have to face this .
This is what I ’m trying to do and what I ’m trying to promote from within .
There is this critical discussion from within with Muslim scholars , Muslim intellectuals and this critical dialogue , an open dialogue with the surrounding society in the West , but also in Muslim - majority countries .
Thank you .
LUGO : Thank you .
Okay , it ’s your turn to get into the conversation .
Let ’s begin .
JULIA DUIN , THE WASHINGTON TIMES : Mr. Ramadan , you spoke of providing ethics to make things better .
Does that mean some form of sharia law in the West ?
RAMADAN : No .
This is why it ’s quite important to read what I am trying to say because I ’m quite critical in the way we are translating sharia law .
Let me be clear about what is going on in the West .
For me , the sharia is translated in the book I wrote , Western Muslims and the Future of Islam , as the way towards faithfulness , as in which way we are respectful towards some of our objectives and purposes and aims .
For example , when I am in the United States of America or European countries , where I have the laws saying that we are equal before law , this is my sharia .
I do n’t need anything else .
It ’s not two closed systems .
I think that this is the wrong way to put it .
This is the wrong way to understand it .
This is why I am challenging some of the Islamic trends from within by saying this closed or narrow understanding of what is sharia is something which is wrong .
You can get the sense of what I was trying to say in the discussion we had in the U.K. , for example , when the Archbishop of Canterbury was asking for sharia to be accepted or at least to allow the Muslims to come to this .
First , what he was saying is that within the latitude given by the common law in Britain , this is something which is already done , that Muslims can find their way within the law .
This is what the Christians are doing , the Jews are doing , the Muslims are doing .
I tried to explain that he was not well - understood and not rightly understood .
But my answer to this was , the Muslims do n’t need a parallel system .
They just abide by the common law , and within the latitude of this law and the flexibility of the Islamic legal tradition , we can find our way .
And my answer to this is just look at the great majority of the Western Muslims in the States , in Canada , in Australia or in European countries that just abide by the law and do n’t have a problem .
They are not asking for specific laws .
I would say that as to the objectives , we are closer to some of the Islamic ideal in Western countries than in the great majority of the Muslim - majority countries .
And I would go for that much more than for the opposite .
KIM LAWTON , RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY :
You spoke , Professor Ramadan , about dealing with the sometimes tensions between Western issues and Muslim - majority countries .
One practical way where this has played out has been at the international level on the lines between free speech and defamation of religion .
I ’m just wondering for you where those lines are between freedom of speech and when it ’s inappropriate , insulting or defaming someone else ’s religion .
And are those lines universal or do they vary from region to region ?
RAMADAN : I think that we have to be fair to our history and to understand from where all these stories are coming .
When it comes to the legal framework , I am saying to the Muslims , we do n’t need new laws against blasphemy or things like this .
I think that what we have now , it ’s enough .
We do n’t want to limit freedom of expression .
When we got this cartoon issue , I was in Denmark at this very moment .
Then what you have even here now is this new story about the cartoons .
Just take an intellectual critical distance with this .
This is legal .
To ridicule religions is something that is part of the Western culture .
It has to do with the history .
So we do n’t want to go for something which is , oh , we need laws to prevent people from doing this .
I think that the Muslims should understand where they live , and I would like this also to be understood in Muslim - majority countries , that we do n’t have to go against this .
Now , we are dealing with laws , and I think that we just have to stick to the laws and say , this is legal .
We also know that there are things that are illegal because they are connected to racism and statements that are not acceptable .
There is no absolute freedom anywhere .
So we just go for this .
It ’s just when it comes to insulting people , racist statements , we need laws to prevent this from happening .
But we all agree on this .
So this is , I think , universal and I think that this is where we have to go .
Now , there is something which is much more psychological .
We have to take this into account – we are not coming from nowhere .
Our culture and the way we read law has to do also with our memory .
And when we had , for example , Muslim groups in Europe saying the way to show that there is no equality in the way religions are treated and no freedom of speech is to insult the Jews , to show to people that we Muslims are not equally treated , I told them this is the wrong way forward .
Why ?
Because you have to deal with sensitivity and you have to deal with collective psychology .
Yes , it ’s legal to insult the Jews and to laugh at their suffering .
But it ’s wrong .
Ethically and because of the collective psychology .
So this is not the answer .
The answer is not to touch the sensitivity because it ’s within the legality .
This is why I am saying to Muslims , take a critical distance but let the people understand around you that even if it ’s legal , you do n’t like it .
That ’s it .
React by saying , I do n’t like this .
It ’s not part of me .
I am not laughing at religion by definition .
It ’s not part of me .
It ’s cultural .
Even Buddhists are not going to like it because they are not used to this .
So I would say this is why we should understand we need to deal with psychological issues in a psychological way and to understand that there are collective sensitivities that we have to talk about .
It ’s coming from mutual knowledge .
But the answer is not to come with law to prevent people .
And this is what I ’m saying to the French today on another issue , exactly the same .
I say , you are responding to the burqa and the niqab with law restricting freedom , and I think that ’s not going to work .
It ’s not the way forward .
So do n’t go that direction .
Speak more about education , psychology .
Changing mentality takes time .
I would prefer them to understand that from within we can do the job as Muslims by saying , the niqab or the burqa are not Islamic prescriptions .
This is what I believe the mainstream believes as well , even though we have tiny groups saying this .
So I would say we have to be very cautious not to translate every sensitive issue into a legal issue .
We are wrong by doing this .
LUGO : Ross ?
Speaking of “ South Park . ”
ROSS DOUTHAT , THE NEW YORK TIMES : Speaking of “ South Park , ” Professor Ramadan , just sort of as a follow - up to Julia ’s question , I wonder if you could talk a bit more about what you do think Islam has to offer to the West , maybe particularly to Europe , but speaking also to the American context as well .
I think it ’s a very interesting and subtle idea , the idea that reform is something that moves in both directions .
But I wonder if you could elaborate on the direction of Islam reforming the West .
RAMADAN : Something which is really important for me is that if we are people of conviction – religious people or humanists today – look at the way I ’m putting things .
I ’m not speaking about the Islamic economy .
I ’m not speaking about Islamic finance .
I ’m not speaking about Islamic medicine .
I ’m speaking about Islamic ethics in medicine , Islamic ethics in finance .
Meaning what ?
That we have a common ground , a common area , where the Christian ethics , the Jewish ethics , the Muslim ethics , the humanist ethics could provide something in that field to reform this for the better .
This is where we have to come together .
It ’s for me to break this perception that we have our sciences – Islamic sciences , Islamic finance – and we have an alternative – which is wrong .
It ’s not true .
We do n’t have an alternative .
We have some principles and some objectives .
But when I deal with Christians , when I deal with some humanists on the ground , I can see that they have the same objectives .
This is where a Muslim presence with a deeper understanding of what Islamic ethics are is to question the ends and to think of the means .
So this is , for example , to be able to say , you have to be involved in education in the West , not by creating Islamic schools , which are mainly schools for Muslims .
It ’s to come to the principles .
What are we talking about ?
About knowledge .
So it ’s for us when we understand Islam the right way to ask ourselves what our Islamic tradition is giving us to think about spirituality in a consumerist society , for example .
It ’s always to think about the ends .
Why are we doing this ?
In economy , for example , just to say we have an alternative Islamic economy by thinking with no riba , no interest , no usury – this is a dream ; it ’s not working .
In fact , we are changing the words , but we are doing exactly the same .
In fact , we are seeing the same results with other names .
And I think that this is hypocritical .
I would say that we have to go deeper here .
This is why I am talking about a new “ we . ”
My presence as a Western Muslim is coming with ethics , with questioning the ends , with a philosophy of life .
I find people having exactly the same questions as mine when it comes to the ends , when it comes to the meaning of all this , when it comes to the way we fast or the way we deal with products or the way we deal with the global economy .
The way we deal with justice , the way we deal with no discrimination in the job market , the way we deal in your country with some people who are saying there is a second - class citizenship in this country when you are black American or you are Latino – there is something that you have to question here .
And I think that this has to do with our ethics , applied ethics .
I ’m not going with something which is specifically Islamic , but something that Islam could be involved in when it comes to a discussion of the ends .
And 99 percent of my lectures to the white American or European or Western audiences are always about , oh , you as a problem .
I want to change that .
It ’s me as a contribution .
DOUTHAT : Can I follow up quickly ?
I guess I just want to press you on the division that you seem to make a little bit between the idea of an Islamic ethics , which can be universalized and can be compatible with the Christian ethics , the humanist ethics and so on , but then there ’s the question of theology and spirituality specifically .
I think one of the conversations that people have about Europe is the idea that there is a particular spiritual crisis in Europe related to the decline of Christianity and that some people – perhaps yourself , perhaps not – feel that an expanding Islam could be part of the answer to that crisis .
How do you feel about that frame ?
Do you think there is a religious or spiritual crisis in Europe that Islam could be part of the answer to ?
RAMADAN : No , I think that we are all facing a crisis from within .
I have been dealing for 25 years with the Muslim communities in the West and even in the States .
I can tell you something : we are facing a crisis from within .
There are two crises , in fact .
In the West and in the States even , we have a religious crisis , but not even a religious crisis – an identity crisis :
Who are we , what do we want , how are we going to have a blossoming personality and to be coherent with all our universes of reference ?
This is something which is common to all of us .
So the people who are now saying , Islam is the solution ; it ’s coming and we have a spiritual – I think that this is wrong .
It ’s not because the number is increasing at an exponential rate .
I ’m not at all happy with the quality that we are having from within .
So I would say that this is where the Muslims should be self - critical .
I have been doing this .
If you read the book , What I Believe , I ’m self - critical from within because when it comes to education , when it comes to being less formalistic and comes to the deep essence of spirituality , this is where the Muslims are facing exactly the same crisis .
This is where we need to reform our understanding of Islam : our educational processes and our educational methodology that we have within the Islamic communities or the Muslim communities in the West .
I ’m not at all happy with this idea , first .
And second , I really think that we have to go through tremendous change in mentality with the Muslims now in the West .
I think that the mainstream is understanding this and we are improving .
I would say that over the last 30 years in the United States of America , in Europe , in Canada , in Australia , you can see the changes .
You can see that something is moving .
To say , oh , Europe , it ’s a secular continent , there is a spiritual crisis there so the Muslims are taking over – this is rhetoric .
This is something which is nurtured on the basis of fears .
I would say the populists are using this in a way which is quite worrying today throughout Europe .
But I think that it ’s not true ; it ’s not the way things are happening .
I would say that they are much more integrated on three areas , and I ’m always advocating the three L’s :
They abide by the law of the country , they speak the languages of the respective European countries , and they are loyal to the country .
Now , as to the religious identity , deep crisis – really deep .
And it ’s not an easy way forward , I would say .
So to idealize this in saying , oh , there is no problem , they are just expanding , is wrong .
DAVID KIRKPATRICK , THE NEW YORK TIMES :
If you were in a different context – in a Muslim - majority , more traditional context – could you find a basis in the Koran and in the Islamic tradition for the kinds of things that you appear to be arguing for – a kind of pluralism , what we call separation of church and state , the individual freedom of expression ?
That ’s easy in this context to sell those ideas , but how would you sell that on the other side ?
RAMADAN : “ The other side . ”
KIRKPATRICK :
You set up two sides ; your conversation said that was –
RAMADAN : No , no , that ’s okay .
I was joking .
Partly joking .
( Laughter . )
Look , if you look at all my books – and many people , they do n’t understand what I am trying to do – if you want to be listened to by Muslims , you should be rooted in the tradition .
So when I went back to Egypt , for example , I went with the all - intensive , classical tradition – what we call , in Arabic , bi haqq al - riwaya – the right to teach .
I did this in seven specific disciplines .
Why ?
Because I knew that , first , I needed it , and then , that you are heard when you speak from within .
Every single book that I have been writing on these specific issues is rooted in the tradition .
For example , Radical Reform :
The first three chapters are rooted in history , in usûl al - fiqh fundamentals .
I ’m doing this .
Now the book is in Arabic ; I ’m trying also to be involved in this .
The book I wrote on the Prophet and his life is all on classical tradition , so no one can come and say , no , it ’s not true .
And I ’m saying for example , today , in the time of the Prophet , men and women were together in the mosque .
If anyone is telling me no – look , this is the reference .
So you ca n’t say anything .
When I was calling for a moratorium , it was misunderstood in the West as saying , we have to condemn .
Condemning is not the way forward .
You cannot condemn sitting in a cabinet in France .
No , you have to understand the very logic from within .
So in the name of Islam , relying on text , I was saying , if you are serious about the text , if you are serious about the conditions , if you are serious about the society , you cannot implement this .
I ’m pushing for an intra-community discussion because changing mentalities takes time .
The point is that I ’m rooting all these thoughts into the tradition .
This new applied ethics , for example , is rooted in the classical tradition .
The great scholars of Islam saying , this is it .
Am I right ?
If it ’s wrong , tell me .
If it ’s right , go ahead ; let us talk about it .
When I went to Morocco – Tétouan – Tétouan is very traditional – 35 scholars disagreed with the moratorium , said it ’s wrong .
They disagreed on some of my issues about applied ethics .
And then we had a discussion .
I can tell you that it ’s moving , I ’m moving , we are in connection .
The mufti of Egypt , Ali Goma ’a , said that the call for the moratorium was something which was interesting .
He supported the substance of it while he told me a call for a moratorium was wrong ; you have to deal with the scholars .
My response is , I have been talking to the scholars seven years .
In private meetings , we agree .
Publicly , we do n’t .
It ’s a public call now that I want , so I ’m challenging this .
If you listen to the connection that I have with the Muslim - majority countries , in many of these countries – for example , in Indonesia , in India , in the Middle East , in Jordan , even in Egypt , where I ’m talking – I cannot enter there , but I am talking with scholars .
This is something which is quite important .
I can tell you that anyone who is serious about this , check if this is heard or not .
It could be rejected by many scholars .
For example , I was in Qatar .
Recently , I was in petrol monarchies when I gave lectures .
The rooms were full of young Muslims , men and women saying , this is it ; this is exactly what is challenging for us .
So this communication is getting on .
It ’s what I am trying to do .
But once again , there is something which is quite important : having exactly the same discourse as to the substance but different references as to the way you limit this debate to the Islamic sources .
It ’s quite important .
When you speak to Muslims , you have to come with Islamic references .
Otherwise it ’s not going to work .
It ’s even perceived as a betrayal because we also need to understand that by talking that way , very often the people are saying , oh , are you playing the game of “ the other ” ?
Are you playing the game of the other side , so to speak ?
This is why you have to be very , very , very clear on saying , no , I ’m not talking – you know the moratorium and other things that I have been saying , for example – from the very classical tradition we are distinguishing different authorities in Islam .
So do n’t tell me it ’s coming from the West .
Our historical experience of secularism is all about dictatorships because this is the way it was implemented in Egypt , in Syria and other countries , so the historical experience does n’t tell you something about the essence of separating authority .
But if you come to the classical tradition , you find that this is there ; this is something that had to be studied in a deeper way .
So I ’m challenging this by coming from within .
And this is very important for me to be understood by my fellow Western citizens .
If they do n’t understand what I ’m trying to do , that if we need this to be moving and we need this intra-community dialogue – you need to understand the universe of reference of “ the other . ”
If not , it ’s just waiting for us to be arrogant .
I ’m sorry , some of our fellow citizens , our intellectuals , our scholars , the way they talk to the Muslim world is just perceived as arrogance in a state of power – in a situation in a power struggle .
And I would say that this is not helping us to move forward .
JEFFREY BROWN , NEWSHOUR : I just want to follow up on that .
You say that many of the scholars agree in private but publicly , no .
You were just at the end there starting to talk about the barriers to having a more public dialogue about these kinds of issues .
Expand on that .
What are they ?
What keeps them from speaking about these things and agreeing on them and talking more about pluralism and other issues in public ?
RAMADAN : Yes , that ’s a good question .
There is a double problem here .
The first one is the situation in Muslim - majority countries and especially in Arab countries .
There is no freedom of speech ; it ’s very difficult .
For example , the leadership of Al - Azhar [ religious institution ] today is chosen by the Egyptian government .
This is the way there is a disconnect between the people who are representing Islam and the community sometimes .
The second thing which is important is that now because there is no critical discussion , it is very much about emotions and details .
If you take a decision on the headscarf , for example , you can lose the community .
If you take a decision on something which is perceived by Muslims – perceived , which has to do with perception and psychology – you can lose the community .
So they are scared .
Many of them after the discussion in Tétouan , they came to me and said , we agree with you , but we are not going to say it ; we ’re not going to say it .
And you understand the psychology .
This is where you understand that the intrinsic political and religious logic within the country is making it very difficult because they are trying to be connected to the community and not to be perceived as threatening the authority .
So they are in - between , and you are coming here telling them , you have to speak .
The point for me is really that we as Muslim scholars living in the West , we should be instrumental .
We should be instrumental by asking the question and coming with some of the responses and answers , and to push on that .
For example , I have been saying for 15 years that female mutilation is wrong .
I had scholars , even from Al - Azhar , saying , no , no , no , no , we have some prophetic tradition ; it ’s not so , so haraam .
It could be understood as a prescription to push and to push with our questions and our responses by saying , it ’s not Islamic .
Then two years ago to get 15 Muslim scholars from Muslim - majority countries to say , it ’s not Islamic ; we have to stop that .
This is where there is a dialogue which is quite important .
We need to understand the logic in Muslim - majority countries :
Some scholars cannot speak , so who is going to do the job ?
But just waiting for them to speak – and you have to understand this – some of the secular authorities do n’t care about new challenges .
They want to show their people that they are very strong in Islam .
So on very specific symbolic issues , they can be very tough , just to tell people : we are Muslim and we protect Islam .
On the serious issue of democratization , they are not ready to do the job .
But on very specific religious detail – for example , the chance to condemn 20 homosexuals in Egypt , to be able to say : look , we are Islamic .
And it works on emotions .
But it does n’t work on changing the mentality from within .
As from here , very often we are playing the game , accepting this .
I think that this is where we should be consistent in understanding that some of the most secular countries and secular governments in Muslim - majority countries , they can use a very traditional position on Islam just to protect themselves from being perceived as betrayers .
More than that :
On the cartoon issue , on the ban on minarets , what can you see ?
You see that they do n’t want their population or the people to demonstrate , but they are ready to use this just to show their people , we are attacking the West because the West is against Islam .
The cartoon issue did n’t start in Denmark .
The Danish Muslims were very wise and very calm .
It came from the prime minister refusing to meet with the ambassadors .
They perceived this as disrespectful .
They went back to Egypt , they went back to Syria , and it started from there .
It ’s a political instrumentalization of something which happened in Europe but was perceived there .
It ’s very easy to say to the people , it ’s against the West , than to say , more freedom in our country .
So it ’s a political game ; it ’s quite complex .
And I think that you need to understand where the scholars are in the whole process and not expect from them things that they cannot deliver – not as a first step .
It ’s a long process .
Still , yes , I agree with you :
We need more courageous scholars .
That ’s for sure .
AMY SULLIVAN , TIME :
You mentioned earlier the identity crisis that many Muslims in the West have been going through , and I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the different experiences of Muslims in America and Muslims in many European countries because it seems like there are two different experiences there .
For many Muslim Americans , it ’s more a question of figuring out how to balance or incorporate their identities as Muslim , as American , as man or woman or whatever the multiple identities are .
In many European societies , however , there ’s just not the same experience or tradition of having a dual identity or a multiple identity , and it seems like that would pose different challenges in terms of integrating .
RAMADAN : Yes , there are different challenges and there are common challenges .
The first one , the big picture , is just to say that the immigrants who came to Europe were from economic exile , modest backgrounds , not very knowledgeable about Islam .
They came just for jobs , and very often they confused Islam and their culture of origin .
They were poor , modest and living in the suburbs in a very difficult situation .
Then you have also a society which welcomed them , but more secular societies than the United States of America , and religion was a problem .
For example , you cannot understand what is happening in France if you do n’t have in mind two things : first , the very specific relationship between the state and religion in France .
Before Islam , it was church and state , and the relationship with the Christian church is important .
The second thing , the relationship between France and Algeria – the old , previous colonized country – this is something which has to do with the psychology in the whole discussion .
Add to this that today in Europe with this new presence , there is this perception that we are forgetting about the socioeconomic problems , the class segregation , and we Islamize all the problems .
It ’s as if Islam is at the center of all the social problems in the suburbs when it comes to the job market or housing .
I think that this is quite specific to Europe .
Now , it ’s more complex than that because in the United States of America , the immigrants , when they came , they were much more knowledgeable and they were equipped to be able to see a difference between the religious principles and the cultures of origin .
The very specificities of the American environment had them do this .
They said , okay , I can have half an identity : American and Muslim .
The fact is that they were not facing socioeconomic problems the way they were in Europe .
So this is something which has different challenges .
It ’s much more about identity and being involved in the United States and the American dream .
Now , there are still common challenges , and we have to deal with this when it comes to what is happening today in the States with the African - American Muslim community , where they are in the inner cities and facing something which is quite interesting by saying , we are citizens but we are facing a second - class citizenship , which is in fact not only a religious problem .
But the religious problem is added to socioeconomic problems , such as discrimination .
This is where you can find parallels with what the Muslim communities in Europe are experiencing .
Add to these challenges something which is now part of the identity crisis and the lack of intra-community dialogue – the fact that we have a great deal of racism within the American Muslim communities .
Islam is against racism , but Muslims could be racist and this is happening .
For example , in this country you had two conventions at the same time in Chicago .
African - American Warith Deen Mohammed had one convention at the same time as the ISNA .
So the immigrants and the African - American community , they were not dealing together .
These are fractures from within .
Come to Europe ; you will see exactly the same internal challenges when it comes to Turkish or Moroccan Muslims .
We are dealing with this still .
When you speak about feeling at home as a European , you have to go beyond that if you are obsessed with the countries of origin and all these things .
Add to this the class segregation that we have reached among Muslims now in Europe .
They are succeeding on the social ground in the inner cities , but there is a gap between them and the experiences of people who are still in the suburbs .
This is also something which is experienced in America .
So I would say , yes , there are different challenges .
The very specific environment has to be taken into account , but still we have common challenges within – internal challenges .
Just to tell you my own story , my first connection with the States was not with the immigrants .
In fact , Malcolm X was in touch with my father .
All I heard from this story was about African - Americans .
When I first came , I was connected to them and then you understand , wow , they are questioning not the religious dimension of their integration but the socioeconomic reality .
This is where we find common ground because this is what they were questioning .
Even more so , they were questioning the new immigrant by saying , you are not representing Islam ; you are not representing the only Islamic reality in this country ; you have money ; you are in the suburbs and we are in the inner cities .
We are facing discrimination ; we are facing the fact that there is social discrimination in this country .
So this is something that helps us to understand that the American dream is good for some and problematic for others .
If there is a European dream , it would be the same questions that we have .
ALAN COOPERMAN , PEW FORUM ON RELIGION & PUBLIC LIFE : Professor Ramadan , as I am sure you know , there ’s been a recent flare - up of a long debate in the United States over the centrality of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to U.S. foreign policy , and I ’m wondering if you ’d care to weigh in .
How central or primary do you think the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is to the challenges that the Obama administration faces all around the world ?
RAMADAN : Look , it ’s quite clear to me that I have been banned from this country exactly for my positions on that : the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , but also the Iraq war because when I went to the American Embassy in Switzerland , 80 , 85 percent of the questions were around my position and why I was critical of the unilateral support of the United States of America towards successive Israeli governments .
I said , you have to be more balanced ; it ’s not going to work like this .
And then , your war in Iraq is illegal , and I think that this is not the way forward .
Saying something which I continue to say , I think the Palestinian resistance is legitimate , the means are not .
So killing innocent people , I ’ve said it for years .
This is something which is quite important for me – to be clear on that .
Now , yes , I really think that it ’s central .
It ’s central psychologically speaking , politically speaking and in the way that you feel at home in this country .
Because at the end of the day , you can get social integration , intellectual integration , but miss psychological integration because something is missing , which is the sense of belonging .
The sense of belonging is what I call critical loyalty .
I ’m loyal to my government when I am able to say , I abide by the law , I love this country , but I do n’t like your policies and I am critical , and not see my citizenship or my belonging questioned because I ’m critical .
I think that this is where we have to be together – you and me .
This is what I call the “ new we , ” where we are citizens and we are critical .
While I think that what should come now from the new administration is really to deliver on that , it ’s quite difficult .
I said this from the very beginning .
First term , what we got as the first speech one year ago from President Barack Obama was a very good speech – very good .
I commented on this by saying , this is the first time we see someone speaking in that way : very cautious with the wording , very cautious also by not only addressing this to Muslims in Muslim - majority countries but also to Americans by telling them Islam is an American religion and Muslims are contributing to the future of this country .
He was talking about a “ we ” as the American nation , and this is very important .
Then , to speak about the suffering of the Palestinians and about the fact that we have to look at this issue seriously –
Now , I think that what we got during the last weeks and months is really tension between the Israeli government , Prime Minister Netanyahu , and the Obama administration .
Still , now , these are words and things are going on there .
I would say that within this term , it ’s going to be difficult .
Next term , I think it ’s quite important to see things moving in support of Palestinian rights .
What I am saying to the Muslims is , just do n’t assess the Obama administration or any American administration only on that because this obsession with this foreign policy is not helping us to be citizens and to be involved in all the discussions .
So I would say , at the same time as we are expecting something from the Obama administration , we also have to say to the American Muslims , you have to be involved in all the discussions .
When it comes to health , for example , what happened in this country is just tremendously important for all the American citizens .
You have to be involved in this ; you have to be involved in education .
You have to acknowledge the fact that there are constructive steps when it comes , for example , to meeting with entrepreneurs and Muslims and trying not to be obsessed only with the idea that Islam means we talk about terrorism .
No , Islam means we speak about America ; we speak about being American .
This obsession has to be reassessed from within by Muslims , but we need both .
It ’s a more balanced approach which is needed .
But I would like , yes , the American administration to be more balanced on Palestinian rights .
And it remains central .
It remains central even though I think Muslims should be much more involved in everything which has to do with global politics , beyond only this issue .
MICHELE KELEMEN , NPR : I ’d like to follow up .
As you mentioned this entrepreneur meeting this week , I wonder how you assess the Obama administration ’s outreach to Muslim communities – whether that ’s working and whether you think they ’re sort of leaning toward that instead of democracy ?
I mean , is this an either / or prospect ?
RAMADAN : No , I would n’t think instead of democracy or in spite of talking about democracy .
I would say that it ’s quite clear that the Obama administration is much more well - perceived by Muslims around the world in Muslim - majority countries .
It ’s not so difficult after what we got for eight years .
But I would say that yes , something is changing , and there is lots of hope coming from Muslims in Muslim - majority countries .
But still , they are suspicious about the room for maneuver he has to change his policy and the way he is dealing with some lobbies here – pro-Israeli lobbies – and is he able to change anything as to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , or to go beyond words ?
Because if you look at the first steps , some of the symbolic actions – for example , the fact that I am here with you today is coming from a symbolic act – we are opening up .
I spoke with the ACLU and others ; they are saying yes , it ’s changing .
There is a shift .
It ’s quite clear there is a shift .
So we have to be constructively positive on this .
There is a shift .
Now , up to which limit ?
How are we going to deliver ?
Is it going to follow on this ?
I think that the speech one year ago in June and what is happening – you have to push on this by speaking much more about domestic policy when it comes to the Muslim presence , living together – not only words ; it ’s just really practicality .
For example , when it comes to people still in jail for ideological reasons , this has to be changed .
Guantanamo should stop .
Reassessment of what is going on at the borders of this country – these are practical measures that are expected , and then beyond the discourse and the symbolic actions that we have .
So I would say on this , we really need to see more than that .
But by and large , if I have to assess what is going on , I ’m positive on many of the things that I am seeing , and I ’m trying to remain constructive .
But still , really , I ’m critical on security measures , on the Middle East policy .
And still , I can not be but critical on what is going on in Afghanistan and in Iraq .
I have serious questions about supporting Karzai in Afghanistan and the way we are dealing with the reality of the Iraqi future today .
This is , for me , problematic .
I would have thought on some of these issues he would have been more effective .
But once again , it ’s politics and it takes time .
ELEANOR CLIFT , NEWSWEEK : Could you elaborate – when you first said that the Bush administration banned you for what you said were silly reasons , mostly ideological – can you explain that ?
And were you one of a class of citizens who were banned ?
Or what were the circumstances around that ?
RAMADAN : The whole story is that in 2004 I was supposed to come to teach at Notre Dame University .
Nine days before coming , I was called by the American Embassy in Switzerland telling me that my visa has been revoked .
At first no reasons were expressed ; it ’s just revoked .
Then the PATRIOT Act , and then the allegation that I was connected to terrorism , which was dropped after the second interview , because they asked me to reapply .
I went , I reapplied , and they sent someone from Homeland Security who came all the way from here to Bern , and he was asking about my donations to organizations .
I mentioned 10 organizations .
Among them was one Palestinian organization supporting – and this was what I knew about them – educational projects in the occupied territories .
And then , a few months later , I got the response that my new application was rejected because I gave money to an organization which was blacklisted in the States – because I gave this money .
It ’s 700 euros that I gave .
But they made a mistake .
The first mistake is that for a European to live in Europe and to have an organization which is not blacklisted in Europe , it is quite normal that you can give money .
This organization was even in touch and dealing with the mayor of Lille , who is now the first secretary of the Socialist Party , Martine Aubry .
She was dealing and still is dealing with this organization .
And they have a twinning project with a Palestinian city .
So this , for me – they were known .
But the second big mistake was that I gave the money between ’98 and 2002 , and this organization was blacklisted in 2003 .
I got a letter from the American administration telling me , you should reasonably have known that they were connected to Hamas .
My answer was , you mean by this that I should reasonably have known before your own administration that they were going to be blacklisted in the States .
So this is what I call a silly reason .
But the judge in New York said , Tariq Ramadan could n’t have known this , but the law was retracted .
So the point is I got from the U.S. administration and people coming – even the civil servant who came from Homeland Security – it ’s just all about , “ What is your take on Iraq ?
What is your position on Palestine ? ”
And that ’s it .
This was 80 percent of the questions that I got .
This is , for me , an ideological exclusion because , at the end of the day , I lost a professorship at Notre Dame University .
Now , I ’m not coming back .
My project is not to come to teach in the States .
I ’m very happy where I am at Oxford University .
I will be visiting the country .
But in 2004 , it was quite heavy to face this .
And these arguments are just , I ’m sorry , silly and , I think , saying much more about the U.S. state of affairs at that time than about me .
LUGO : And did I hear correctly there was somebody from DHS at the airport to welcome you ?
RAMADAN : This time , yes .
LUGO : This time .
RAMADAN : The first time , I waited two hours .
They asked me , who are you going to see ?
Where are you going to speak ?
And there were some questions .
LUGO : This was your visit to New York –
RAMADAN : Yes , yes , two weeks ago .
But this time they knew that I was coming and it took me three minutes .
Very quick , very good – even faster than Switzerland .
DUIN : Tomorrow there ’s going to be a big report coming out on religious freedom around the world .
And as you know , one of the West ’s biggest values is freedom of religion and the right to change your religion .
You were talking about dialogue with other Muslims .
I think that all four schools of Islamic thought say that if a Muslim changes his religion , it ’s punishable by death .
In your dialogues with other Muslims , is this something you ’re bringing up ?
And if so , have you been able to get anywhere in terms of talking about religious freedom and the right to , if you ’re Muslim , leave your religion ?
RAMADAN : Yes , this is why it ’s good to read what I ’m trying to say and not to Google my name .
In a book I wrote in the beginning of the ’90s , and then in another book in ’ 97 , and then in another book recently , and even on The Washington Post and Newsweek ’s On Faith , we were asked a few years ago about our position on women and on religious freedom .
My position is clear , and I have said it many times : from the very beginning , scholars during the 8th century , including one of the main scholars , Sufyan al - Thawri , have said that it ’s possible , according to Islam , to change your religion .
This understanding of the two Islamic traditions – a very narrow understanding and out of context because this has to do with people changing their religion in time of war , coming to the Muslim community and taking information and being , well , betrayers , in fact – they were betraying the community .
But nowhere do we have in the Islamic tradition , and even in the Prophet ’s life , anything saying that he killed someone because he changed his religion , or she changed her religion .
If you look at my book on the Prophet ’s life , you can see that I mention three main cases where they changed their religion and were not killed , and he knew about this .
So my position on this and On Faith – this was my position ; I said this almost 20 years ago .
And I have been going on within the Muslim - majority countries and in Muslim communities saying and repeating this .
I have been criticized .
I have been just put outside the realm of Islam .
For example in Mauritius , the mufti of Mauritius was saying , “ Tariq Ramadan is kafir murtad . ”
If you know Arabic , kafir – “ infidel ” – in the way he was using it , murtad – “ he is an apostate . ”
This is the way he was treating me , but I kept on saying this .
Then the mufti of Egypt even on On Faith also took a similar position by saying , the punishment is not to be killed .
It ’s possible to change religion .
And you know what happened ?
He said this and then the council of scholars at Al - Azhar said , no , no , he was misunderstood .
And he answered , saying , no , this is what I meant exactly .
So there was a dialogue between him and the council .
So my position is clear .
I ’m challenging this , saying that this is possible .
And once again , I have been saying this for 20 years .
KATHY SLOBOGIN , CNN : I ’m sure you ’re familiar with what ’s been called the narrative embraced by apparently many Muslims , that the United States is at war with Islam .
RAMADAN : Sorry , I have n’t heard .
SLOBOGIN : Okay , well , it was just featured on a “ 60 Minutes ” piece two nights ago , but it ’s the idea that the United States is at war with Islam and apparently believed by many Muslims , a very potent recruiting tool for jihadists .
And I ’m wondering if you could give us your ideas on what the United States government can do that would be effective in countering that narrative , or what the United States government is already doing that ’s been effective .
RAMADAN : But what is the narrative , exactly , that you are talking about ?
SLOBOGIN : Maybe it ’s a Western term , but it describes the belief that the United States is at war with Islam , and it views American foreign policy through that prism .
RAMADAN : Yes , once again , you may have groups – tiny groups and minority groups – nurturing this narrative .
But I can tell you that the mainstream Muslim presence – Muslim organizations and communities – they do n’t , at all , buy that .
They just reject this .
So I would say it ’s exactly the same as what we have in Europe .
In fact , it ’s not only about the United States of America .
There are people saying the West is at war with Islam .
And they are saying exactly the same , this tiny minority , in Europe and even saying that I ’m too much a Westerner to be a true Muslim , while in the West I ’m too much a Muslim to be a true Westerner .
I am in between this .
But the mainstream is experiencing this exactly .
It ’s experiencing this : that we think that our life in the West , in the Western countries and the legal framework – it ’s us .
We do n’t have a problem with this identity .
–
So what could be the strategy ?
First , understand something which is quite important .
It is not for Americans without the Muslims to face this .
It ’s to understand that American Muslims are your partners on this , and not the people you choose .
You do n’t go for some Sufi saying , oh , this is the good Islam ; let the Sufi represent Islam .
Because by doing this , by choosing the authority or the representative , you are alienating the whole community .
Let the Muslims come with their people , and it could be diverse .
When you are dealing with Christians , you are not just choosing the moderate Christians .
You are choosing the people who are heard by the community , and they could be conservative .
You have some vocal , conservative Christians in the country , some vocal Orthodox Jews in this country .
They are quite strict , but they are heard .
As long as they are not advocating violence , they are not breaking the law – they abide by the law – and they are American citizens , you listen to them , even if you do n’t like them or you do n’t like their ideas .
You have to do the same with the Muslims .
It ’s just not to control who is talking or speaking for Muslims ; it ’s to facilitate the process of having representation of Muslims that is wide enough to be in the mainstream and to challenge the views of these radical , violent extremists .
This is where we can work together .
So first is to facilitate the process , which is a strategy .
Second is to understand that the American Muslims are your allies because they are the second victims of this discourse , this narrative .
The first are the people who are killed , but the second is them because it ’s coming back to them ; they are suspected as Americans .
This is what I got when I came to the ISNA convention just before I was banned from the country .
I got people who were so scared as Americans because the rhetoric coming from the Bush administration was , “ with us or against us . ”
And I ’m saying , I ’m sorry .
I ’m against these violent extremists , but I ’m against the American policy today around the world .
I can be against both , and it ’s not for you to question my loyalty to our values .
It ’s in the name of our common values that I am doing this because I think that what you are doing in this country is wrong .
So here we are , where it ’s exactly the same .
For example , in France or in Belgium , we are talking about the burqa and the niqab .
I am saying and repeating , I am against this .
I do n’t think it ’s an Islamic prescription when we deal with this .
But if you go to – ( inaudible ) – by preventing them , it ’s not going to help us .
Let us be allies to come together and to know what we are talking about , and then to go through a pedagogical , educational process from within to challenge these views by saying this is not Islamic .
Let your citizens be allies , your fellow citizens be the new “ we ” we are talking about when we come to common challenges .
So I would say there is no Western answer without Muslims .
It ’s a Western - Muslim answer against anything which is done by instrumentalizing the Islamic teachings .
I would say that this is where we are powerful and we can understand .
So when you are talking about terrorists , when you are talking about violence , when you are talking about this narrative , I will be the first to be at the forefront by saying , I will not buy this .
I will condemn it and I will say , this is not only wrong , this is anti-Islamic .
You are working against us .
But I want us to be together to understand that we have common values and not to be suspected because some of the Muslims are saying this .
So the suspicion is misplaced .
It ’s just misleading the whole common narrative that we are building .
My next point , by the way , is exactly on our common narrative .
It ’s our Europe , our West .
What are we talking about ?
What are the values that we are sharing and in which we have to work together ?
Because at the end of the day , if we get this message , it is that we have common enemies , and for Muslims , some of their enemies are Muslims .
And for the West , some of their enemies are Western intellectuals who are ready to forget our values in the name of spreading around fears .
I would say that one of the most important dangers for us , as Westerners , is just to forget our values , is just to betray them because we are scared .
It ’s just to deal exactly in the opposite way .
It ’s just to be ready to do things that are – just , it ’s crazy .
Four minarets in Switzerland and 66 percent of the population voting against minarets .
And so where are we heading ?
What is happening ?
And just after September 11th , what we heard in this country is worrying .
So we have to be very cautious .
We have common challenges here .
SUSAN GLASSER , FOREIGN POLICY : Thank you very much .
Just quickly , I wanted to follow up on something interesting .
You sort of left us with this notion that you are not happy with the way events are progressing in Afghanistan and Iraq today , and I wanted to ask you to clarify because you specifically mentioned President Karzai , and I ’m curious what your critique of him , specifically , is .
And then more broadly , I was hoping you could give us a sense of the context in which you think your ideas are being received in Muslim - majority countries .
You mentioned your recent trip to the Gulf and the warm reception you got there .
What is the level of appetite and interest in an intellectual movement at this point for what you call a transformational view of reform Islam , if you will ?
And to what extent have your ideas really become part of any kind of a mainstream intellectual dialogue in the Muslim - majority countries ?
It ’s very easy to see the appeal of your ideas in a Western context , not only here in the U.S. , but also in Western Europe .
You identify yourself as a European .
But where do your ideas – how do they take root in the Middle East ?
Thank you .
RAMADAN : Look , I ’m not happy with what is happening in Afghanistan and in Iraq .
If you are asking me about Afghanistan , I would say if you look and you study history , and you listen to what is said by some of the specialists who are there , it ’s a lost battle .
And I think it ’s a lost battle .
I think it ’s not going the right way .
To rely on someone who is perceived by all the Afghani people as protected by the United States of America and being a corrupt man in the way he is dealing with social affairs and political affairs and the economy is something which is not going to be accepted .
So I would say the very man is not respected by the Afghani people .
He is not .
He is protected , and understood as protected by the United States of America .
If you are serious about transparency , about democracy , about dealing with the reality of the Afghani setting and the environment , it ’s really to look at a broader picture with people who are now – it ’s a very difficult and complex issue , and I would say that we need an international force just to maybe do the job in a way that is helping the Americans leave the country , if we are serious about this .
If it ’s just about protecting your geostrategic interest as it is today and economy , go ahead .
You can just have a peaceful Kabul and war all around .
But all the specialists are telling you , it ’s not going well .
We are losing ground .
So this is my understanding of what is going on .
You can send soldiers .
The complexity and the difficulties of the environment and the way it ’s organized in tribes and the Islamic trends there make it very difficult .
I would say that I was expecting something else from the current administration , to tell you the truth .
About what is going on in Muslim - majority countries , I would say that students and scholars are listening to what we are doing .
Now , is it a trend among the population ?
There are three things that are important today .
What the people are expecting in Muslim - majority countries and especially in Arab countries is much more democratization and freedom , and to have something that is on this .
So when they see , for example , that we , as Western Muslims – and once again , for me , it ’s really also to be able to speak from an American perspective or Canadian perspective or a European perspective – and not only Western Europe ; Eastern Europe is very important for me , just to teach Western Europe that it ’s not because we are economically developed that we are culturally – to patronize and to lecture the Eastern Europe countries because I really think that this , also , is problematic .
But in Muslim - majority countries , when you go there and you speak with the people , you can see that there is an elite , yes ; there are students , there are scholars .
Now , what needs to be done is really to translate this to something which is not emotional belonging to the Islamic words of reference , but something which is more elaborate that has to do with education and democratization .
We will win this struggle and battle if we go also for something which is more democratization in the Muslim - majority countries and more education on that field .
So I would say that , for example , even in Pakistan , when I went to Pakistan , of course , I was dealing with elites and we still have very traditional trends .
They are the majority when it comes to organizational realities .
But when you speak with citizens and the way they deal with it , we can understand that there is something which is open to new – ( inaudible ) – and this is where we have to work .
It would be very difficult with Islamist organizations or organizations on the ground , but I would say that there is a way to be understood , and this is where we need to have this connection .
So I ’m not saying that we have reached that level .
I ’m saying that there is room for maneuvering here , that we need to carry on this discussion between intellectuals and Muslim scholars .
This is why one of my projects now is really to work on that .
It ’s just not to say you are Western Muslims who are doing a good job .
It ’s really to connect this with Muslim - majority countries , with scholars , with intellectuals .
And I want the scholars and the intellectuals , professors teaching within academia in the West , to be much more in touch with Muslim scholars coming from a specific traditional setting .
This is very important , to have this kind of connection and to create this .
So I would say this is what we have still to do , but I can tell you in some areas we have signs that things are moving .
A few years ago , we were not perceived as legitimate in that work .
Still now , for some , we are not legitimate .
We are now Western Muslims and this is not the real Islam .
I can give you an example .
For 20 years I have been involved in training women to reject , in the name of Islam , the cultural projection onto their religion transforming this into a patriarchal religion and to try to come with something which is a liberation process .
Even in the book , Western Muslims and the Future of Islam , I am speaking about an Islamic feminism , saying that in the name of Islam , you reject the cultural alienation and also the literal understanding .
So I went with this , and we have a connection , for example , with women in petrol monarchies .
And some of the women are connected with groups in Saudi Arabia .
There are things that are done and produced there that we have to listen to because this is the future , and this is also among students .
So I would say it ’s difficult .
Resistance is there .
It ’s a struggle from within .
But we need , I would say , to institutionalize this relationship between us , here in the West , and them in Muslim - majority countries .
It ’s a long process .
I ’m not saying that we are winning now , but I ’m saying that there are channels of communication that are working quite well , and much more than what we think .
LUGO : Thank you , Professor Ramadan , and thank you all for coming .
( Applause . )
RAMADAN : Thank you .
Thank you for the invitation .

ICD Gemini takes on iPad : 1GHz Tegra 2 , 3G , multitouch & Android
Last we heard of ICD , the company were showing us their Tegra 2 - based Vega and Ultra tablets at CES 2010 ; now they ’re back with details of a new model , the ICD Gemini , again using the second - generation 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra chipset and now paired with an 11.2 - inch touchscreen ( using either a resistive or capacitive panel , both of which support multitouch ) .
Android does duty as the OS , and the specs certainly do n’t disappoint at first glance : integrated 3G with voice functionality , WiFi b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR , together with USB peripheral support and twin cameras .
Up front there ’s a 2 - megapixel fixed - focus camera for video calls , while a 5 - megapixel autofocus snapper on the back is intended for photography .
There ’s also a 5 - axis accelerometer , digital compass , GPS , an FM radio and even infrared , while storage is from 4GB + of onboard flash and an SD slot happy with up to 32 GB cards .
Other connectivity includes a microUSB port , HDMI , 3.5 mm headphones socket ( there ’s also stereo speakers and a dual - microphone array with noise cancellation ) and contacts for dock - charging in the adjustable dock .
Software support includes Flash , HD video , an optional app store ( presumably some variant of the Android Market ) and POP / IMAP / Exchange email .
Unfortunately ICD have n’t released any shots of the Gemini turned on , so we do n’t know exactly what work they ’ve done on the underlying Android UI .
As well as their basic specs , ICD could n’t help but run some comparisons against what Apple ’s iPad and the Fusion Garage JooJoo bring to the table ; you can see the charts in the gallery below .
Unfortunately , while the two rival slates are shipping now , the Gemini ’s launch date and pricing are still a mystery .
Save
One of the reasons people buy cookware made from stainless steel is to have non-stick cooking experience .
However , this is not always the case ; if your food keeps sticking to the stainless steel base ; you are not doing something right .
In this post , I will be discussing some of the tips and hints that can help you avoid that problem and enjoy using your stainless steel cookware .
Buy Only High Quality
In the market , you will find different brands and grades of stainless steel cookware .
If you want to have a better experience in the kitchen , never compromise quality .
By investing in quality , your stainless steel cookware will last for many years .
Interestingly the stainless steel cookware our grandparents used did not have the triple - layered base found in these new models , yet , they hardly experienced problems such as food sticking to the base in their stainless steel cookware .
You will be making a good decision buying more stainless steel cookware because they are durable and can be used in different ways when compared to cookware made from other materials .
You will notice that the manufacturers of stainless steel cookware also offer a long - term warranty because they are confident in the quality of their products .
Instead of getting short - term value from the other types of cookware , you can save money to gather the funds you need and buy stainless steel pots and pans ; it will be worth the effort .
Fortunately , you can get deals for sales of stainless steel pieces instead of buying the whole set at once , which will be quite expensive .
The option to buy single pieces of stainless steel cookware can also help you get a variety of these wonderful kitchen tools in your collection .
Another reason to choose stainless steel cookware is that they are suitable for cooking foods with some acidic content .
These foods can react with materials such as aluminium and cast iron when they are used to make cookware .
However , you are safe with stainless steel products .
The surface and base of these stainless steel products are also anti-scratch which makes this cookware easy to maintain .
Non-Stick Cooking In Stainless Steel
What makes stainless steel so good ?
There is a secret .
These products are made to react in different ways when heated .
This is why you should always pre-heat your stainless steel cookware .
Depending on your recipe , when the right temperature is reached , you can put in your food .
There you have it , the secret to using stainless steel cookware is properly preheating the pans or pots before they are used .
Sounds so easy compared to the terrible cooking experience you can have if the pre-heating is not done right .
This approach can be used when you want to fry foods , browning and sautéing .
Pre-heating worked with the older models of stainless steel cookware , and even better with the products we have now because they have a layered base .
Browning in Stainless steel cookware
Let ’s talk about browning briefly because it is one of the common cooking processes done with stainless steel pans .
When you pre-heat and put some food in the pan , it begins to brown , depending on the type of sugar in the food , you may also experience caramelization .
The juices and brownish grease created during this process should be retained because of its unique flavour .
This is the part many people may experience some problems if your pan has not been pre-heated .
The brownish residues can stick to the base of your pan .
If this happens , you will lose a large part of the remains which can be used to add flavour to soups and stews .
You can cook your food to get it browned and easily remove the entire residue after browning .
Steps to non-stick cooking
First , you need to pre-heat your stainless steel pan ; you will know if it is ready by adding a drop of water .
If it sizzles and evaporates , your pan is ready .
Next , add a tablespoon of oil to create a thin film coating the entire base .
Please wait until you see the first signs of evaporation , then it is time for the test .
You can determine if it is time to add your meat or other foods by sliding a small piece across the base of your stainless steel pan .
If it glides from one end to another , the pan has been properly pre-heated .
You can proceed to cook and experience the non -stick features of your cookware .
Pre-heating your stainless steel cookware to the right temperature plays a major role in the outcome of your cooking .
Pre -heating has an impact on the taste of your food , the texture and how much juices are retained to give it a delicious flavour .
It should , however , be noted that you can enjoy these benefits only when you use high - quality stainless steel cookware .
How to determine quality stainless steel cookware
You should ensure the pan or pot has a three - layered base ; this feature will prevent scorching while you cook .
The three - layered base is a common feature of pressure cookers made from stainless steel .
Another feature to look out for is the label ; if the product you are thinking of buying is high quality , it should display the chromium steel / nickel steel ratio as 18/10 .
This is the standard for high - quality stainless steel cookware ; anything less may not give you the expected results .
You may also need to confirm that the triple - layered feature has also been used for the sides of the stainless steel product .
Some brands only manufacture the base with triple layers because it helps to distribute heat energy evenly .
You need the best , so buy only products that also have this triple layer on all sides of the pan .
Other features to consider include the handles of stainless steel cookware .
You should choose products that have a handle which is riveted to the pan .
This feature is important if you will be cooking foods with this pan in an oven .
The riveted handles can withstand the heat when placed in ovens .
That ’s it , the best tips to help you buy and get maximum value from your stainless steel cookware .
The benefits of these products in the kitchen are fantastic , and you deserve the excellent experience .

home | 1901 - WW2 Index The GREAT DEPRESSION to 1935 ( 1 of 4 )
The Great Depression , to 1935
The US Economy Hits Bottom , 1930 - 32 | Slow Recovery Begins in the United States | The US Economy in 1935 I Recovery in Sweden , France , Italy and Britain
The US Economy Hits Bottom , 1930 - 32
Between January and April in the year 1930 , the value of stocks rose 13 percent .
Then at the end of April the price of stocks began to decline again .
Production and consumer buying were declining , and President Herbert Hoover opposed the view among bankers that the economy should be allowed to deflate .
Hoover urged action .
He approved a program in which the federal government had a few buildings built , and he urged state and local governments to accelerate their spending .
From railroad and utility companies he acquired promises of investments .
He called conferences of industrial and labor leaders and obtained from them pledges to maintain employment and production levels and to avoid strikes .
But the economy continued to slide .
Businesses felt compelled to respond to markets – including the labor market – and they cut production and wages more .
Some financiers called for more government spending .
There were other financiers who saw reduced wages as a blessing that would improve discipline and character .
Investors – also known as risk - takers – were pulling their money out of the economy , away from risk .
Unemployment was rising , and consumers had less money to spend , adding to the downward spiral .
Bankruptcies were more numerous .
Bank loans were not being repaid .
There was no federally guaranteed depositors insurance to inspire depositor confidence .
In 1929 there had been 659 bank failures .
That number in 1930 rose to 1,352 .
In November 1930 a run on banks started in the city of Nashville and swept through the South .
Newark , New Jersey , October 31 , 1931 Texas , 1935
The congressional elections in 1930 reduced the Republicans in the House of Representatives to a majority of just six , and their majority in the Senate was reduced to one .
At the end of the year , calls for more government action increased .
Congress passed a law allocating 116 million dollars for public works and 45 million for drought relief .
Fundamentally the government was aiming at a balanced budget , while Hoover spoke of the public works project as a " new experiment in our economic life " and an " advance in economic thought and a service to our people . "
By the end of 1930 the value of stocks was down forty percent from its April 1930 high .
On New Year 's Day , 1931 , predictions were made that the depression would be over by the end of the year .
Instead , equities ( stocks ) continued to decline in value through the year .
In June 1931 , Hoover addressed the growing problem of international debt .
In the interest of people and companies being able to buy things , he electrified the world by proposing a one - year moratorium on all payments on reparations and other intergovernmental debts .
He rejected calls from the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Civic Federation for restoring economic order through compulsory , private cartels .
And he opposed a bill that would allow veterans to borrow against a pension fund , Hoover calling the bill a " breach of fundamental principle . "
During 1931 , world trade and Europe 's credit structure collapsed , deepening economic depressions in Austria , Germany and Scandinavia .
Europeans began withdrawing loans , investments and gold from the United States .
Hoping to end more withdrawal of funds and gold by Europeans , the Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates , making borrowing more difficult – a move that normally cools overheated economies but does not mend depressed economies .
Look closely at the face of this woman – including the expression in her eyes .
This is a photo of a destitute migrant family taken in 1936 by Dorothea Lange .
If the subject of this photo , Florence Owens Thompson , 32 , had grown up in affluent circumstances she could have been a striking beauty .
As they say in Hollywood , she has great bones .
Hoarding money rather than spending it was damaging the economy .
The world was on the gold standard and in the United States the Federal Reserve had an abundance of gold reserves , but this did nothing to increase buying and spending , an economy 's life blood .
Taxes could have been reduced , leaving more money for buying .
And the federal government could have pumped more money into the economy through relief to the unemployed .
But none of this was done .
There was fear that cheapening money by printing more of it ( increasing the money supply ) would further weaken the economy .
Also , Congress and President Hoover were opposed to creating an unbalanced budget .
They believed that unbalanced budgets and rising government debt retarded business recovery and that unbalanced budgets were a threat to the credit of the federal government .
Many banks experiencing shortages of cash were forced to sell their assets at fallen price levels and were thus driven to insolvency .
The federal government was not offering bailouts , believing that in every case it would be throwing good money after bad .
Depositors lost confidence in the financial system .
They did n't know which banks were sounder than others and they pulled their money out of all banks , good and bad , indiscriminately .
People across the nation were putting their money into safe deposit boxes or stuffing it into mattresses .
In 1931 , 2,294 banks in the US failed .
In Washington DC , 3,000 Communists staged a " hunger march . "
In rural America farmers were more focused on specifics .
They joined together to prevent insurance companies from foreclosing their neighbors ' farms .
In the spring of 1932 , 15 to 20,000 unemployed veterans camped out in a park in Washington D.C. demanding full payment of the bonus promised them for serving in World War I , and they were dispersed by the US army .
Meanwhile , various explanations for the Depression were voiced .
Some in the US blamed the Soviet Union for dumping goods on the world market .
Henry Ford , who considered himself an expert on just about everything , blamed the Depression on what he called an era of laziness .
Many blamed the Depression on high tariffs having caused a decline in world trade .
President Hoover saw the Depression as caused by attitude that had somehow gone awry .
And , of course , a few in the United States saw the Depression as the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy .
In Europe , many were blaming the Depression on the United States for withdrawing loans even to sound European enterprises .
And people blamed the United States for cutting back on imports and for failing as the world 's leading creditor nation .
Marxists had their own analysis of what was causing the economic crisis .
In 1928 the Communist International ( Comintern ) claimed that capitalism was entering its third stage since the Great War : stage - one being the crises just after the war ; stage - two the recovery that followed in the mid-twenties ; and stage - three being a crisis created by the old problem of production out - racing consumption .
By 1932 , rank and file Communists were impressed by the Comintern 's analysis .
With Karl Marx having predicted the fall of capitalism , they saw capitalism as having entered its final crisis .
The failure of capitalism , they believed , would bring the discontented masses falling in behind Communist Party leadership and then they would be able to overthrow the capitalist system – matching economic inevitability with human activity .
Decades after the Depression , " bourgeois " economists would argue that the Depression was more than just production out - racing consumption .
Monetary stability after World War I had not returned to what it had been before the war .
Before World War I , Great Britain had been the world 's creditor nation , the world 's lender of last resort and the world 's champion of free trade .
This had been destroyed by the war , and , according to some of these economists , the United States had not adequately taken Britain 's place as the world 's leader in sound finance .
Meanwhile the United States economy was sinking deeper , many believed that a sound recovery would come only by the government leaving the economy alone .
They believed in a natural process of liquidation – the ruination of the weak and the survival of the efficient .
And , indeed the US economy bottomed in 1932 .
Things could only get so bad in a society not engaged in a civil or international war or not suffering from some other great catastrophe such as plague or , widespread draught .
In the United States , hitting bottom meant that manufacturing was down 48 percent from what it had been in 1929 , and the prices farmers received for their products were down 44 percent .
The stock market was down 80 percent from what it had been in 1929 , but seventy - five percent of the workforce was still getting up in the morning and making themselves useful .
But 25 percent of the work force remained unemployed , and people had little money for the buying that would have stimulated the economy .
Recovery in the United States began around the same time that it did in other countries .
With the interconnectedness of economies in the world , it was more than a coincidence that economies in Europe also bottomed in 1932 .
And with economies having hit bottom , the issue became the speed of recovery – a matter affected by government policy .

Amnesty International ( AI ) Secretary - General Claudio Cordone has come under fire for defending jihad when it occurs in " self - defence " – a position many other human rights advocates believe " would gravely undermine the future of the human rights movement . "
Cordone 's comments came in response to a February 13 " Global Petition " to AI by human - rights and women 's - rights advocates protesting the suspension of Gita Sahgal , a senior AI official in London .
Sahgal was suspended after the Sunday Times of London reported she believed Amnesty 's collaboration with former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzem Begg " fundamentally damages " the group 's reputation .
In a letter sent to senior AI officials , Sahgal charged that Amnesty has mistakenly aligned itself with Begg and his organization Cageprisoners , which calls itself a human - rights organization working to " raise awareness of the plight of prisoners " held in the war on terror .
According to the Sunday Times , the prisoners it championed have included " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , and Abu Qatada , a preacher described as Osama Bin Laden 's ' European ambassador . ' "
Begg and Cageprisoners are also reported to have developed a relationship with Anwar al - Awlaki , the Al Qaeda cleric who endorsed the failed Christmas Day plane bombing near Detroit and who became a confidant of Nidal Malik Hasan , charged with carrying out the Nov. 5 Fort Hood massacre .

In the " Global Petition " sent to AI , the coalition of liberal human - rights advocates criticized what they called " U.S. / NATO imperialism . "
But the bulk of the letter consisted of criticism of Sahgal 's suspension and warnings about the pitfalls of negotiating with the Taliban and trying to advance human rights by working with " anti-democratic " groups .
On February 28 , Cordone responded with a letter defending AI 's work with Begg and Cageprisoners .
Begg " speaks powerfully from personal experience " about the abuses at the U.S. - operated Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba , Cordone wrote , and advocates detainees ' due process rights within " the same framework of universal human rights standards that we are promoting . "
Cordone added that Begg and Cageprisoners ' advocacy of " jihad in self defence " is not antithetical to human rights and that Begg is the victim of " many distortions , innuendoes and ' guilt by association ' " charges .
In response , the initiators of the Global Petition expressed dismay about Amnesty 's endorsement of a " defensive " jihad .
They noted that such a call " is a thread running through many fundamentalist and specifically ' salafi - jihadi ' texts .
It is mentioned by Abdullah Azzam , mentor of Osama bin Laden , and founder of Lashkar e Tayyaba .
It is the argument of ' defensive jihad ' that the Taleban uses to legitimize its anti human rights actions such as the beheading of dissidents , including members of minority communities , and the public lashing of women . "
Fritz Maytag , the washing machine heir who launched the microbrewery movement , has sold Anchor Brewing Co. in San Francisco to a pair of Bay Area entrepreneurs who plan to preserve and expand the iconic brand .
No terms were disclosed for the sale of the 70 - person Mariposa Street brewery and distillery that traces its roots to the Gold Rush , when local brewers produced a heady elixir known as steam beer .
In 45 years at the helm of Anchor Brewing , Maytag helped spark a revival in the craft of making beer by hand and inspired thousands of entrepreneurs to follow him in creating small , artisanal breweries .
Keith Greggor , 55 , and Tony Foglio , 64 , two veterans of the spirits industry , say they plan to expand Anchor Brewing 's operations and cement its position as a font of artisanal beers and spirits .
" This is something we want to build on for the rest of our careers and pass on to the next generation , " said Foglio , who will serve as chairman while Greggor runs the operation .
" Combining Keith and Tony 's passion for the Anchor Brewing Co. , their industry experience and expertise only means that Anchor will be enjoyed in San Francisco for generations to come , " Maytag , who will serve as chairman emeritus , said in a statement .
Maytag , who was traveling Monday after announcing the sale to employees , could not be reached for further comment .
Inspiring others
Maytag , 72 , who became involved with Anchor Brewing in 1965 when his investment saved the struggling brewery from bankruptcy , inspired many followers including Ken Grossman , who founded the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico in 1980 .
" I did n't think at this point he was ready to move on , " said Grossman , who recently collaborated with Maytag on a new beer .
" He was a legend for the many small brewers who came after him , " said Grossman , who got advice from Maytag when he was starting his own company .
Nico Freccia , co-founder of the 21st Amendment Brewery Cafe in San Francisco , said when Maytag was rebuilding Anchor Brewing in the 1960s and 1970s , mass market brands dominated the market , and there were only about 70 breweries in the country - down from more than 4,000 near the end of the 19th century .
" Now we are back up over 1,500 , " said Freccia , adding : " Fritz Maytag is revered in the craft beer world .
He fathered the whole culture of the movement . "
Freccia said " steam beer " was the term applied to San Francisco brews of the Gold Rush era , one reason being that extra yeast was often added to the barrels before they were shipped up the Sacramento River , causing additional carbonation en route and a geyser of foam to gush forth when the kegs were tapped .
Family fortune
Born into the Midwestern family that made its fortune with the washing machine , Maytag came to the Bay Area to study at Stanford University , but dropped out of graduate school in 1965 to become first a partner and later the owner of Anchor Brewing .
" I became enthralled with the process of brewing beer , " Maytag told Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler in 2000 .
" It was pure romance .
To see beer made , it was a miracle . "
Over the first 15 years , Maytag struggled to raise the quality and consistency of the beer and find consumers willing to buy it at a premium .
" I did have a nest egg ( from the Maytag inheritance ) , but I spent it all on the brewery , " he told Ostler .
By the 1980s consumers had begin to develop a taste for Maytag 's vision of a craft - made beer with a distinctive taste and other breweries followed his lead , including Sierra Nevada , Buffalo Bill 's Brewery in Hayward and the New Albion Brewing Co. in Sonoma , which spawned the Mendocino Brewing Co .
In 1993 , Maytag founded a distillery that was indicative of the revival of craft - made spirits .
The new owners of Anchor Brewing plan to capitalize on the firm 's reputation to expand their footprint in distinctive beers and spirits .
Through their Griffin Group investment company , Greggor and Foglio have already acquired Preiss Imports , a 14 - person San Diego firm that specializes in fine spirits .
They also have a minority interest in BrewDog PLC , a large independent brewery in Scotland , and hope to make that brew locally .
Greggor said the deal to acquire the company came about after he and Foglio purchased Preiss and started talking with Maytag , whom they had met some years earlier , about their plans .
" After 45 years of running the business , I think he felt it was time to let somebody else help lead the way , " Greggor said .

Sometimes Ruby code is too cool to run on just one computer at a time .
In this interview with Hal Fulton , Mark Bates explains how he defines distributed programming , reasonable concerns about Ruby performance , and how to choose Ruby libraries .

If you 're reading this , you may already be sold on the idea that Ruby is a fun and productive language .
Certainly , I am .
As someone with ten years of Ruby experience ( and two editions of The Ruby Way ) behind me , you must forgive me if I 'm not objective .
Besides the tendency toward more agile languages , the industry is also seeing distributed programming techniques grow in popularity .
Distributed programming in Ruby has been possible for years .
But certain areas were not well - understood by many people , since the documentation has not been wholly adequate ( unless you speak Japanese ) .
Mark Bates recently helped fill that gap .
His new book , Distributed Programming with Ruby , addresses libraries , tools , and techniques that facilitate distributed coding in Ruby .
Hal Fulton :
What was your motivation in writing this book , other than the minimum - wage pay ?
Mark Bates : A colleague approached me at the Ruby Conference last year ( in November 2008 ) , after I spoke about building distributed applications .
He suggested I should write a book on the subject , because no comparable book existed .
It seemed like a good idea , especially since the documentation around DRb / Rinda is almost nonexistent .
I thought it would be a real benefit to the community to explain what those libraries are , how they work , and what you can and can't do with them .
From that impetus , the book just grew .
Hal Fulton :
Do you write distributed applications often ?
Mark Bates :
In a way , I think we all write distributed apps more than we think we do ; we just usually do n't think about it .
The company I was working for a year ago was heading down a real distributed app path , which is how I got so deeply into this area .
Over the past year I 've been working at a company where we have a few applications that are n't traditionally " distributed " applications , but there is still a high amount of queuing and communication that needs to happen between the apps .
So in some way , I work on distributed apps every day .
Hal Fulton :
What problem domains have you specifically coded with these techniques ?
Mark Bates :
Throughout the book , I try to relate the technologies and techniques to problems that I or others have encountered .
I present the problems ( and the solutions to those problems ) in a way that makes sense to the reader , so that they can find value and relevance to their own projects .
Personally , I 've had to deal with communication between different apps , remote method invocation , offloading heavy tasks , messaging – really , the whole range of issues that accompany any decent - sized application .
A lot of those experiences are spelled out in the book to help keep people from falling into the same traps that caught me along the way .
Hal Fulton :
Is it your perception that there are significant gaps in distributed Ruby as it exists now ?
Tools , libraries , or features that are missing ?
Mark Bates : I do n't think there is any one perfect solution out there for Ruby , or for any other language for that matter .
This is a hard question to answer ; what is the real definition of " distributed Ruby " anyhow ?
In the book , as I talk about different technologies , and the solutions they present , I try to point out what 's missing and how things could be improved .
I think the DRb / Rinda packages offer some great tools .
But they can be slow at times , and they could be made easier to use .
Hal Fulton :
You said , " I think we all write distributed apps more than we think we do , we just usually do n't know it . "
That 's intriguing to me .
Can you give an example or two of applications whose distributed nature might be less than obvious ?
Mark Bates :
Any app that has ever offloaded some heavy lifting to a background process has dabbled in distributed programming .
If you use a service like Amazon 's new RDS , Hadoop , or any other remote service you are writing distributed applications .
I think people get it in their heads that distributed programming means just one or two different things , some sort of remote method invocation or having a bunch of computers all chewing on some complex data set or problem .
But really it 's a lot broader a field than that .
I tried to demonstrate that in the book by giving examples of some of the different types of distributed programming there are .
Hal Fulton :
Many people associate distributed programming with map - reduce type problems of the SETI@Home variety .
Do you find existing Ruby tools adequate for this type of task ( barring , of course , the fact that Ruby tends to be slower than C ) ?
Mark Bates :
There 's no denying that if you 're talking about raw number crunching speed , a C app will certainly be a lot faster than Ruby .
With that said , I do n't think most people are writing those kinds of programs .
For most of us , it 's offloading a heavy task , sending messages , or communicating with a service somewhere that is doing some heavy lifting or is " isolating " code for us .
In those circumstances , Ruby is definitely fast enough .
There are a few map - reduce libraries available for Ruby ; I talk about them in the book , but they have n't really caught on .
I do n't know if that is because there are n't enough people in the community writing applications that require map - reduce , or that the libraries are too slow .
During the course of writing this book , I looked at a few of those libraries , and unfortunately I was not overly impressed by them .
I 'm hoping that if this book goes to a second edition , there will be a really great Ruby map - reduce library out there for me to include .
Developers , start your engines !
Hal Fulton : Some applications are " inherently " distributed by their nature ( such as a multi- person chat client ) .
Do you see these as a special subset of distributed apps , or are they just " more of the same " ?
Mark Bates : I would n't say they are a special subset of distributed apps .
I think they are a flavor of distributed applications , of which there are many flavors .
Hal Fulton :
More generally :
Are there distinct classes of apps that are more or less challenging ?
Mark Bates : Dealing with background jobs can be fairly straightforward , and certainly libraries like Delayed : : Job help make it easier .
The same goes for message queuing .
Even so , it 's easy to get yourself stuck in a tricky situation with those .
On the more complex side of things , I think any sort of remote method invocation can easily lead you down a rabbit hole .
When you make RMI calls you are tying your application to the internal design of another application .
With a REST API you know that you will deal with a very clear API that should n't be changing too much , and that will publish basic data types .
With RMI , it 's possible that the developer of the other app could easily change a method definition , or change the return data type , or even make a simple change within the method itself which can easily break your application .
And security becomes an even bigger concern as you can now execute code remotely on another server .
Scary stuff .
Hal Fulton :
Many existing tools and libraries offer similar functionality in different ways , and therefore overlap here and there .
Have you discovered particular tools that conflict with ( or better , complement ) each other ?
Mark Bates : I believe that you should try to keep your environment as clean as possible .
If you do n't like the message queue you are currently using , do n't bring in a second one and use them both .
Instead , refactor your code to use the new one .
Otherwise it 's confusing to code , difficult to deploy , and definitely error - prone .
That 's the biggest conflict I think you 'd find with most of these libraries .
As for complementary libraries , I really enjoy using RabbitMQ / AMQP and Delayed : : Job together .
I find that these complement each other incredibly well .
For example , I had several business groups each asking for various " slices " of data from requests to the app .
One group wanted the data presented one way , another wanted it another way , and so on .
So I built a simple Rack app that took the request info ( headers , params , cookies , etc. ) and sent it to RabbitMQ .
Then we wrote some processes that would subscribe to the queue and generate Delayed : : Jobs for each type of reporting we needed .
We got the speed of RabbitMQ and the power of subscribing to queues .
And , in addition , we got the security of the Delayed : : Job database - backed storage and error handling .
It 's worked out really well for us , and it 's certainly a pattern I 'll use again .
Hal Fulton :
While you wrote this book , did particular libraries emerge as your favorite pieces of technology ?
Mark Bates :
If I had to pick one , it would have to be Delayed : : Job .
It 's incredibly easy to set up and use .
You can easily prioritize tasks and monitor them , and great error handling is built in .
I use it all the time .
It 's an excellent way to deal with those heavy background tasks .
I did have to extend it for my own purposes .
I wanted things like Hoptoad Notification and an easy way to re-enqueue a task , so I built the delayed _job_extras gem , but apart from those things , it 's pretty awesome right out of the box .
Hal Fulton :
In writing this book , what insights or important truths did you learn ?
Mark Bates : I learned that DRb / Rinda needs better documentation in the core !
While it 's not necessarily something I learned while writing this book , my advice would be :
Do n't get caught up with the " new , hot , sexy " library .
It 's easy to read a book like this one and decide you have to implement RabbitMQ because it 's so cool , even if you do n't have an actual business need for it .
Before you go and spend crazy amounts of time implementing any technology into your project , first ask yourself :
Is this the right technology for the problem at hand , or am I you just trying to add it to my resume ?
In either case , when you introduce a new tool , I recommend playing with it a little bit on a small scale .
Open up an empty editor and try playing with the technology on its own for a few hours .
Dig into the source code .
Read the documentation .
Try out a few of the features .
You 'll quickly learn whether the technology is right for you and the project at hand .
It 's quicker and easier than trying to shoehorn it into some big existing project .

Horny mother beetles fight for dung
Female dung beetles use their weight and horns to fight competitors for cow dung and breeding sites , say Australian researchers .
PhD researcher Nicola Watson and Professor Leigh Simmons from the University of Western Australia in Perth publish their findings today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
" If you 're bigger or have bigger horns , it 's easier to bully your opponent out of your way , " says Watson .
Biological weaponry , such as horns or antlers , evolves in males that compete for territory or access to females .
But rarely do females evolve such traits .
Watson and Simmons say the evolutionary pressure to grow weaponry on female dung beetles comes from competition for breeding grounds .
Watson studied female dung beetles of the species Onthophagus sagittarius , in which the female has much larger and differently - shaped horns than the males .
The females use their horns , which look a bit like the twin horns of a rhinoceros , to fight other females for desirable patches of cow dung and for access to the tunnels underneath the dung where they lay their eggs .
" In a tunnel the beetles interlock these horns like two prongs , " says Watson .
" The [ beetle ] that has the longer horn can keep the other at a distance and use the horn for leverage to evict the other female . "
Beetle study
In two separate studies , the researchers split 181 female dung beetles into three groups based on their body size , and found that larger females fared better in terms of their success at reproducing .
They then compared females of the same body size but with different horn sizes and found that beetles with bigger horns also had a greater reproductive success .
Reproductive success was measured by the number of ' brood balls ' - pieces of the dung compacted into the end of the tunnel - they were able to create .
Females create a ' brood ball ' for each egg , so that when the larva hatches , it has an instant source of nutrients from the dung .
The more dung in the brood ball , the bigger the larvae will grow .
So females with more dung and who are able to secure tunnels can ensure they are producing more and bigger offspring .
But competing females can take over or destroy other females ' brood balls .
Horny evolution
This competition for tunnels and dung favours the evolution of the female 's unique horns , says Watson .
The researchers say females produce significantly fewer broods when in competition with other breeding females , indicating that competition and / or interference from other females reduces access to dung for brood ball construction .
Since one brood ball represents one offspring , the acquisition of dung directly determines reproductive success , they say .

We all marvel at Facebook and its number of users , which at last check stood at around 400 million .
For context , consider Skype , which at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009 had 560 million registered users , a data point Skype ’s chief technology strategist , Jonathan Rosenberg , shared with the attendees of the eComm conference currently under way just south of San Francisco .
Skype , when it was still part of eBay ( s EBAY ) , issued quarterly updates but those have now stopped .
Nevertheless , here are the latest numbers :
Skype added 39 million registered users in the fourth quarter to end the year with a total of 560 million .
The number of Skype - to - Skype call minutes totaled 36.1 billion in the final three months of 2009 .
Skype users made more the 250 billion minutes worth of Skype - to - Skype calls from the time the service was launched through the end of 2009 .
Skype in 2009 accounted for 12 percent of the world ’s international calling minutes , a 50 percent increase over 2008 when it accounted for 8 percent of international calling , according to TeleGeography Research .
36 percent of Skype - to - Skype calls as of the end of the fourth quarter included video — in other words , Skype is going to figure prominently in the video conferencing business , challenging more established players with its no -cost solution .
Skype CEO Josh Silverman in a guest post for GigaOM explained why he views video as the future of Skype .
Here are some other random Skype stats :
At peak times , 23 million users are logged into Skype ( as of March 2010 ) .
Skype is available in 29 languages and is used in almost every country around the world .
35 percent of Skype users utilize it for business purposes .
INNOCENT CHUKWUMA , a visiting Nigerian and unofficial election observer , gravely ticks off his worries about the British electoral system : postal and proxy ballots are insecure , and why are voters ( outside Northern Ireland ) not required to show identification ?
“ If you had this system in Nigeria , the outsiders would say the potential for abuse would be massive , ” he says .
He should know , having led a team of 50,000 observers who declared Nigeria 's 2007 presidential election a charade .
A fellow monitor , Lisa Hanna , a Jamaican MP who happens also to be a former Miss World , frets about Britain 's increasingly incomplete electoral register .
In the 1950s the register reflected 98 % of the adult population ; today , it is more like 91 % .
Inaccurate voters ' rolls are the bane of many third - world elections .
“ In Jamaica scrutineers come to your homes to check , ” says Miss Hanna .
“ We do n't act on the basis of trust .
Britain has quite a bit to learn . ”
Despite such worries , these and other observers organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society will probably declare Britain 's elections broadly sound .
But they have troubling material to ponder .
The Daily Mail this week claimed it had evidence of “ massive postal - vote rigging ” as police around the country confirmed that they were launching dozens of criminal inquiries .
Particularly worrying are east London boroughs , where electoral rolls are said to have been packed with bogus voters .
When a journalist from the Independent went to Bow to investigate , a group of Asian men allegedly beat him savagely .
For much of the past century electoral fraud in Britain has seemingly been limited to local elections , in which a few hundred fake ballots are more likely to affect results than they are in general elections .
The last time a contest for a Westminster seat was declared void because of malpractice was in 1923 .
And even at the local level relatively few people have been found guilty of breaking electoral law .
Back in 1995 there were 14 convictions for it , the most in any single year before or since .
Yet two trends are troubling .
The first is the prevalence of Asians , especially of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin , among those convicted of electoral fraud .
Stuart Wilks - Heeg of Democratic Audit , a research group , points out that British Asians make up half of all those convicted since 2000 .
Where fraud is most common — such as in Burnley , Oldham , Birmingham — and allegations most persistent there are also large Asian populations .
He points to “ biraderi ” , brotherhood networks , used to rally support for particular candidates — a practice imported from Pakistan .
( He also notes that convictions for electoral fraud may be undercounted because some cases are pursued under general fraud laws . )
Such networks may be especially effective at exploiting the other trend : a sharp rise in postal voting .
A 2000 law , designed to boost turnout , makes it easy for voters to cast their ballots by post .
The share of the electorate who do so has risen from about 2 % in the late 20th century to 15 % in 2005 and probably above 20 % in 2010 .
In some constituencies it could pass 40 % and in certain wards , for example in Oldham , over half of all ballots will be postal .
Some constituencies have reported a surge in demand for postal ballots recently .
Thousands of Asian women are disenfranchised by male relatives who take control of their votes .
The most serious allegations of electoral fraud suggest that leaders of biraderi networks , or others , apply for postal ballots for non-existent or ineligible voters and then establish “ vote farms ” .
Residents of one small home in Tower Hamlets , for example , where five adults were previously registered , reportedly applied for an extra seven postal votes in recent weeks .
Even where voters do really exist , the suspicion is that network organisers put pressure on people to back a favoured candidate , or complete their ballot papers for them .
Salma Yaqoob , a Respect candidate in Birmingham , wants postal voting on demand scrapped because “ thousands ” of Asian women are disenfranchised by male relatives who take control of their votes .
The Electoral Commission retorts that it has robust measures to prevent fraud , and that the recent surge in allegations is a sign that people think the police will take them seriously .
In European and local elections last year 22 m votes were cast and 48 complaints made , but there were no “ major allegations ” of fraud or contested results , the commission says .
( Future polls may be safer as individuals , not merely a householder on behalf of others , will register to vote , supplying national insurance numbers to do so ) .
As for postal ballots , rules imposed in 2006 require an applicant to provide a sample signature and his date of birth , which are checked when the ballot is received .
That is hardly a cast - iron protection : anyone registering fake applicants for postal votes could easily supply fake signatures too .
But evidence from by - elections since 2006 suggests that the new signature system could lead to more rejections of postal ballots : in some constituencies 8 % of them were scrapped , says Mr Wilks - Heeg .
That brings its own troubles .
In close races defeated candidates might now claim that unfairly rejected postal ballots cost them victory , raising the prospect of more results being disputed .
No one expects bitter fights on the scale of Florida 's “ hanging chads ” fiasco , but wrangling — and allegations of fraud — may dent voters ' trust .
Mr Chukwuma concludes , quoting Lenin , that “ trust is good , but control is better ” .
He suggests it may be time to reimpose tighter restrictions on postal voters .

Apple fans who claim that the Mac is more secure than PCs not only are wrong , but they 're ignorant about their security risks , says a well - known hacker and security expert who has made a name for himself finding vulnerabilities in Windows .
And Apple itself does n't take security as seriously as does Microsoft , he claims .
Marc Maiffret , currently chief security architect at security firm FireEye first gained a modicum of fame as a hacker targeting Microsoft products .
For example , he uncovered the security hole that the Code Red worm exploited back in 2001 to attack Windows servers .
He 's been no stranger to publicity , being one of the hackers featured on MTV's I'm a Hacker , and named as one of People Magazine 's " Next Wave " of people to watch , back in 2004 .
In an interview with CNet , he claims that Microsoft takes security more seriously than does Apple , and excoriates Apple fans as being " ignorant " about security risks .
Maiffret says he believes Microsoft does one of the best jobs in the industry around security , telling CNet :
" From an internal process in how they go about auditing their code and securing software from a technical perspective , they do have one of the best models .
The area they still have room for improvement is around time lines of how long it takes for them to fix things . "
As for Apple and its fans , he has very little good to say , saying that the Mac is vulnerable , and its fans ignorant about security risks :
" ... they try to market themselves as more secure than the PC , that you do n't have to worry about viruses , etc .
Anytime there 's been a hacking contest , within a few hours someone 's found a new Apple vulnerability .
If they were taking it seriously , they would n't claim to be more secure than Microsoft because they are very much not .
And the Apple community is pretty ignorant to the risks that are out there as it relates to Apple .
The reason we do n't see more attacks out there compared to Microsoft is because their market share is n't near what Microsoft 's is . "
And he leaves no doubt that he believes Microsoft as a company pays more attention to security than does Apple , and says the only reason the Mac has n't been targeted by malware writers is that it does n't have a large enough installed base :
" I think Microsoft does a better job with their code auditing than folks like Apple do .
We 've only seen a scratching of the surface as far as Apple vulnerabilities because nobody cares to find them .
There 's nothing inherent with Apple themselves and their development .
The only reason Apple gets little increase in security is because they 're running on top of a Unix - based operating system and they can take advantage of some of the things that have been done for them . "

A lot of work is getting done on characters , programming and design , but little has been done with animations yet .
We need a specific topic which requests artists to start contributing animations .
I would hate to see this game grind to a halt just because interest in animating everything could n't get gathered .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- " Strategic defaults " are on the rise as more borrowers who are underwater on their home loans decide it 's not worth it to stay current on their payments each month .
That trend could have repercussions for the housing market , and for borrowers , in the future .
Strategic defaults are when borrowers who owe more on their homes than they 're currently worth choose to stop paying their mortgage but continue to meet other financial obligations , according to a definition by Morgan Stanley in a research report on the topic .
In other words , these homeowners neglect their monthly principal and interest payments , but still pay other bills on time , including credit cards and auto loans .
The Morgan Stanley report estimates that 12 % of mortgage defaults in February were strategic .
Other reports estimate an even higher proportion of this type of loan default .
Growing social acceptance of this behavior could have ramifications not only for personal credit histories and the health of neighborhoods , but also for the future of mortgage lending , according to those studying the issue .
For one , there 's a contagion effect :
As more people watch their friends or neighbors choose to default , the more it becomes a viable option for homeowners who may otherwise wait years just to return to a positive equity position in their properties , said Sam Khater , senior economist for CoreLogic , a provider of consumer , financial and property information .
The volume of foreclosures on the market today is also chipping away at the stigma that used to come with defaulting on a home loan .
" If you know someone who has defaulted strategically , you 're more likely to declare you 're willing to do it , " said Luigi Zingales , professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business .
In areas where home prices are severely depressed , social acceptance of this decision could lead to pockets " where strategic default becomes the norm , versus the exception , " Zingales said .
But look even farther in the future , and the repercussions of substantial strategic defaults could have a larger - scale effect .
" If it really does become a legitimate problem , the implications are pretty dramatic for anyone that wants to buy a home in the future , " said Rick Sharga , senior vice president of RealtyTrac , an online marketplace of foreclosure properties .
" The lenders would have to build this into their risk models with either larger down payments or higher interest rates . "
Some owners ' mimic investors '
Many agree the ranks of people taking this route are growing , but putting a number on the trend is n't as easy .
To measure the number of people who are strategically defaulting on their mortgage obligations , you have to assess borrower intent .
" Take all the numbers with a grain of salt , because it 's one of those topics which is really difficult to get a firm grasp on , " Sharga said .
" The projections are based on limited sample sizes , and [ people are ] doing projections that have a lot of implications on societal behavior and political policy . "
Researchers believe that being underwater on a loan is a prerequisite to strategic default , and the more underwater you are , the likelier you are to consider defaulting -- even if you can afford to keep making payments .
" In our data , what we 've noticed is at about 25 % negative equity , the behavior of owners begins to mimic that of investors -- they 're more ruthless and rational , they 're looking at it from a cash - flow perspective , " Khater said .
" The default rate rises as the negative equity gets deeper and deeper . "
Here are some estimates of how big a problem strategic default is :
Morgan Stanley 's recent report examined the payment habits of 6.5 million borrowers with first - lien mortgages that originated in 2004 or later , and estimated that 12 % of all mortgage defaults were strategic in February -- that is , the borrower who is underwater on his or her mortgage obligations and stops paying on that home loan , yet still meets other , " meaningful " non-mortgage obligations .
The authors used data from TransUnion in their analysis .
The report found that the incidence of strategic default is higher among those with higher credit scores and larger loan balances .
Analysis from Experian and Oliver Wyman estimated that strategic defaulters made up about 18 % of all borrowers who went 60 days past due on their mortgage in the fourth quarter of 2008 ; about 588,000 borrowers strategically defaulted in 2008 , up 128 % from 2007 .
Strategic default was also found to be most prevalent in areas that experienced steep price declines , including California and Florida , and among mortgages that originated in or after 2006 , because those borrowers did n't experience home price appreciation before prices headed south .
Research from the Chicago Booth / Kellogg School Financial Trust Index found a rising percentage of homeowners are willing to strategically default :
The percentage of foreclosures perceived to be strategic was 31 % in March , compared with 22 % in March 2009 .
The data is collected through a survey of about 1,000 people .
One possible reason the numbers are rising is some homeowners ' belief that lenders are n't aggressively pursuing those who default , according to the Chicago Booth / Kellogg School report .
" With more and more homeowners believing that lenders are failing to pursue those who default on their mortgages , there is a risk that a growing number of homeowners will walk away from their homes even if they can afford monthly payments , " said Paola Sapienza , professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and co-author of the report , in a news release .
Zingales was a co-author .
People are also learning they often have one or two years before they get thrown out of a home after stopping payments , said Frank Pallotta of RH Reward , or Responsible Homeowner Reward , a program that works with lenders to provide financial incentives for borrowers who are at a high risk of strategically defaulting .
Getting above water
A recovery in home prices could give people hope to stick it out and stay in their homes , even if they 're underwater , Zingales said .
" If prices were to drop again , people might lose hope , " he said .
CoreLogic estimates that the typical underwater borrower is five to seven years away from regaining their lost equity .
Eventually , those who do stick it out will see their equity increase due to simple amortization :
Over time , less of your payment is going to interest and more is going to the paying down of principal , Khater said .
" If they remain current on their home , simply paying their loan will help drive them back to positive equity , " he said .
But for some homeowners , that wo n't be enough .
" Strategic default will begin to pick up in numbers as the housing market begins to stabilize , " Pallotta said .
" Now you can almost quantify how long it is to see the light at the end of the tunnel . "
If people figure they 'll wait more than a decade before regaining the equity they 've lost , they 're much more likely to cut bait and leave , he said .

Canadian wireless subscribers have long since dealt with inhumane three - year contracts on mainstays like Rogers and Bell , signing over their cellular soul on a whim in order to get a marginally subsidized phone and a guaranteed bill for 36 months .
We 've heard for awhile now that Mobilicity was jonesing to change things up in the Great White North , and change it has .
Shortly after receiving an all - important green light from the CRTC , the company has gone live with mobile service in Toronto , with a number of other large Canadian cities to follow in the months ahead .
What 's most unique about the service , however , is that every single plan it sells is unlimited in nature , and there 's nary a contract to be found -- you simply pick the phone you want , the plan you want , and then you pay upfront .
It 's most akin to the various prepaid options here in the States ( Virgin Mobile , Boost Mobile , etc. ) , but still -- it 's a lovely alternative to have if you 're a Canuck .
Unlimited calling and texting can be had for just $ 35 per month , while $ 65 per month nets you unlimited everything ( including global texting , US long distance calling and data usage ) .
The phone selection ain't half bad either , with the only major " gotcha " being that extra roaming fees can apply if you use your mobile outside of metro Toronto ( or in the future , away from the carrier 's specific coverage cities ) .
Hit up the source link to get the facts straight from themoose 's mouth .

I had this idea in my head since I first picked up TF2 .
I 've been working on this forever and I 'm probably the only one who finds it funny .
Also if you do n't know where I ripped the dialogue from you should be ashamed of yourself .
Also this is awesome
Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
A while back in the US there was an ad for a hamburger chain .
It featured an old lady who bought a competitor ’s hamburger with a great big hamburger bun .
But when she opened it up she asked …
I got to thinking about this in the context of whether there is any real danger in a degree or two of average temperature rise , or whether it ’s a big bun with no beef .
In my previous post , “ Lies , Damned Lies , Statistics … and Graphs ” , I closed by saying :
My conclusion ?
Move along , folks , nothing to see here …
A commenter took exception to this , saying
When talking about global average temperatures , tenths of a degree really do matter .
Now , if tenths of a degree changes over a century “ matter ” for the globe , they certainly must matter for parts of the globe .
So here ’s your pop quiz for the day : Which US State warmed the most , which cooled the most , and by how much ?
To answer this , I used the USHCN State Temperature Database .
Here are my findings :
Figure 1 . Temperature trends by state , USHCN data .
Seven states cooled , and forty - one warmed .
The state that warmed the most was North Dakota ( top center ) , which warmed 1.4 °C per century .
The state that cooled the most was Alabama ( middle of three dark blue states , lower right ) .
It cooled by 0.3 °C / century .
To compare with my previous post , here ’s a similar graph , of the decadal changes in North Dakota by month .
Figure 2 . North Dakota decadal average temperatures by month , 1900 - 2009 .
Red line is the average for the decade 2000 - 2009 .
Photo is an old North Dakota farmhouse .
As with the US , for much of the year there is little change , and the warming is in November to February .
Note that unlike the US , during that four months , the temperature of North Dakota is below freezing ( 32 °F ) …
Now , if tenths of a degree “ matter ” , if they are as important as the commenter claimed , we should have seen some problems in North Dakota .
After all , it has warmed by 1.6 °C since 1895 .
That ’s almost three times the global average warming .
But somehow , I must have missed all of the headlines about the temperature calamities that have befallen the poor residents of the benighted state of North Dakota .
I have n’t seen stories about them being “ climate refugees ” .
I did n’t catch the newspaper articles about how it has been so hard on the farmers and the frogs .
I am unaware of folks moving in droves to Alabama , which has cooled by - 0.4° since 1895 , and thus should be the natural refuge of those fleeing the thermal holocaust striking North Dakota .
In fact , I do n’t remember seeing anything that would support the commenter ’s claims that tenths of a degree are so important .
North Dakota has warmed near the low end of the range forecast by the IPCC for the coming century , and there have been no problems at all that I can find .
So I have to say , as I said before ,
My conclusion ?
Move along , folks , nothing to see here … where ’s the beef ?
APPENDIX : R Code for the US Map
( I think this is turnkey .
Sometimes WordPress puts in extra line breaks .
If so , it is also available as a Word document here . )
The code requires that you download the USHCN Temperature Data cited above and save it as a “ Comma Separated Values ” ( CSV ) file .
I downloaded it , opened it in Excel .
I split it using “ Text to Columns … ” into the following columns , as detailed in the USHCN ReadMe file :
FILE FORMAT : STATE - CODE 1-3 STATE -CODE as indicated in State Code Table above .
Range of values is 001 - 110 .
DIVISION - NUMBER 4 DIVISION NUMBER .
Value is 0 which indicates an area - averaged element .
ELEMENT -CODE 5 - 6 02 = Temperature ( adjusted for time of observation bias ) YEAR 7 - 10
This is the year of record .
Range is 1895 to current year processed .
JAN - VALUE 11 - 17 Monthly Temperature format : Range of values - 50.00 to 140.00 degrees Fahrenheit .
Decimals retain a position in the 7 - character field .
Missing values in the latest year are indicated by - 99.90 .
FEB - VALUE 18-24 MAR -VALUE 25-31 APR -VALUE 32-38 MAY - VALUE 39-45 JUNE -VALUE 46-52 JULY - VALUE 53-59 AUG - VALUE 60-66 SEPT -VALUE
67-73 OCT - VALUE 74-80 NOV - VALUE 81-87 DEC -VALUE
88-94
If that is too complex , the CSV file is here .
Here ’s the R code :

from Julie Heffernan ’s Constructions of Self
Julie Heffernan creates sensuous figurative painting , like co-Yale MFAS , John Currin and Linda Yuskavage , but her luminous oils are patently unique among them and most working artists today .
A Victorian impetus to conjoin , edging toward pastiche , creates artfully staged Surrealist environments .
They avoid the mawkish or macabre by virtue of an evocative 17th century Baroque styling and the dignity with which she handles her primary subject , herself .
Good construction is essential to the success of such works , built of disparate things suggesting disparate philosophies and ages .
Yet the finished product is seamless , making it easy for the viewer to willfully suspend disbelief in the face of rampant artifice .

As the days drag slowly toward a new season , baseball fans can cling to three things — the return of Ken Burns ’
Baseball documentary , the promise of a new Ken Burns baseball documentary , and , should it be necessary in the winter of their cynicism , a Ken Burns pep talk .
Burns ’ nine - part documentary on baseball ’s history , produced in 1994 , is airing at 7 p.m.
Tuesdays during January and on Tuesdays and Thursdays in February as part of the opening month ’s lineup for MLB Network , which airs in Houston on Comcast channel 108 .
Burns , meanwhile , is working on an update to the series titled , appropriately , The Tenth Inning , that will air in the spring of 2010 on PBS .
Burns said Baseball is the only one of his documentary subjects , which range from the Civil War and World War II to jazz and the American West , that he would consider revisiting .
“ It ( baseball ) means that much to this country , ” he said .
In the release announcing plans for The Tenth Inning , Burns spoke of the sense of “ celebration and introspection ” that baseball continues to inspire even as he discussed plans to examine the game ’s steroid era and the labor unrest that resulted in the cancellation of the 1994 World Series .
Some fans have trouble reconciling the two , especially in a town ( Houston ) and at a time where every offseason move by the Astros seems to be countered by another multimillion dollar blockbuster signing by the Yankees or yet another development reminding them that Houston is at ground zero of what could become the grand show trial of the steroid era : the he - said / he - said battle of accusations between Roger Clemens and former trainer Brian McNamee .
" There was a guy named Pete O'Brien who said in 1858 , ' You know , they do n't play baseball the way they used to , ' " Burns said .
" Every 10 years , somebody is saying the same thing — that it 's all over . "
Burns clearly does not subscribe to that theory .
" Think of it .
Since the end of ( the original Baseball documentary ) , we have seen Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine and John Smoltz and the Braves , " he said .
" We have seen the Yankees finally coalesce under one of the game 's most gifted managers ( Joe Torre ) , throwing off the buy - buy mentality of George Steinbrenner to give him time to develop Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada and Mariano Rivera .
" Sure , we had steroids , but , man , look at what else we have to offer .
The Red Sox .
We have Ichiro .
We have Cal Ripken .
Think of the Willie Mays catch ( in the 1954 World Series ) .
Now we have a caliber of play and athleticism that produces similar ( catches ) all the time .
The Marlins won the World Series , twice .
The Rays made it to the World Series .
" We are in the middle of a baseball renaissance , as ( commissioner ) Bud Selig says , and , working on this , I have to agree . "
As Burns contemplates the steroid era , he looks at it through the filter of American life at large .
“ We live in the age of Viagra , ” he said .
“ People take ( medications ) to make things better .
Why would players be any different ? ”
The Tenth Inning will begin with the 1992 National League Championship Series , which would account for his comments about the 1990s Braves pitching staff .
Burns has yet to determine the end point or whether the episode will last two to four hours ( episodes of Baseball lasted from 107 to 151 minutes ) .
“ We were planning for it to be one episode , but we have such a wealth of material , ” he said .
“ Think about it : Baseball had nine episodes and 18.5 hours , and the last action it documented in the major league world was the 1992 World Series .
“ I still do n’t know how it will end or where we will put the stopper .
But God willing , maybe in 10 or 16 years we ’ll do an 11th inning . ”
vertical prison by chow khoon toong , ong tien yee and beh ssi cze
evolvo magazine today announced the winners of the 2010 skyscraper competition .
first place went to malaysian architectural students chow khoon toong , ong tien yee and beh ssi cze .
studies on prison sentence reveals that post - release offenses were higher after imprisonment .
taking criminals out of community and incarcerating them is just a temporary solution .
during their time in prison , inmates resocialize into a prison community or rather a crime community instead of rehabilitation ; eventually return to the path of crime .
the majority of offenses committed are lesser crimes , and these offenders are those with higher chances of rehabilitation .
community too plays a role in helping ex-convicts in their rehabilitation process .
yet there is a social stigma towards ex-convicts .
in the end , rejections and scorns forced them to go back into the way of crime .
rehabilitation essentially involves both the offenders and community .
to achieve this , we propose a prison where the criminals are taken off the street to a place within that community and while serving their sentences , they continuously contribute to that particular community yet remain separated ; a vertical prison .
design to separate – a prison without wall the purpose of a prison is to isolate the inmates from society and a prison needs a barrier to do so .
a vertical prison does so without a wall , instead it isolates the inmates through height , where jumping off the prison is the only option .
mobility and enforcement similar to the city below , the colony has its own transportation system which allows for law enforcement and other support system such as fire rescue and medevec to be provided by the means of mobile pods .
in a riot situation , the armored riot control pod with fast roping capability allow for rapid deployment of riot control team while the armored riot control pod serve as a mobile operation base and observation platform to control and monitor the situation from above .
meanwhile , the fire rescue and the medevec pods will move in to provide fire fighting , evacuation and medical support .
a parallel world the inmates will live in a parallel world with the surrounding .
they know , see and hear everything that happen in the city , yet isolated by the height .
it is similar to penal deportation to a colony above city .
in this colony , the inmates work to sustain themselves and support the city below .
they live freely in the colony and the city continues to have impact to their life .
in the end , it is hoped that they can adapt more easily back into the society .
the relationship between prison and the city in vertical prison system while serving their sentence , the inmates will work to help support the needs of the community , in a way of paying back to the society .
each prison is unique to its own context .
in a city , inmates undertake agriculture activities to help feed the city or in an industrial area , the inmates help manage and reprocess waste to help the environment .
gradually the tension between safe and unsafe will shift to understanding and eventually the prison will become part of the community .
it is hoped that through this symbiotic relationship , the social stigma of a prison would be softened and the society will be more in acceptance of the inmates , giving them a second chance for themselves and also giving society a second chance .
OTTAWA — Richard Préfontaine and his wife , Lynne Charbonneau , were watching a playoff hockey game with their two daughters on Monday night when the ground beneath their house gave way suddenly and without warning .
The house ’s bright green metal roof was all that was visible the next day in a vast mud crater near the village of St. Jude , Quebec , about 50 miles northeast of Montreal .
The landslide created a hole 100 feet deep , 300 yards wide and a third of a mile long .
The family ’s remains were found huddled together on a couch by the television , with rescuers discovering only their golden retriever , tied to a tree , alive .
On Wednesday , officials allowed residents of several nearby houses to return home .
But the family ’s shocking demise was a stark reminder of a hidden menace under many parts of Quebec , one that dates back 10,000 years to an ancient inland sea .
Uganda 's Rwenzori Mountains in 1987 on the left and in 2005 on the right
The ice cap on Uganda 's highest peak has split because of global warming , Uganda 's Wildlife Authority ( UWA ) says .
The glacier is located at an altitude of 5,109 m ( 16,763ft ) in the Rwenzori mountain range , near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The authorities say a crevasse has blocked access to the Margherita summit - the third - highest peak in Africa , and a popular destination with climbers .
Scientists say glaciers in the Rwenzori range could disappear within 20 years .
UWA officials said a team had been sent to the mountain to assess the extent of damage on the route to Margherita .
According to researchers , the ice cap covered 6 sq km ( 2 sq miles ) 50 years ago .
It is now less than 1 sq km .
The mountain range , which is one of the few places near the equator to have glaciers , was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1994 .

When applying , Rick appreciated Steve 's interviewing style .
They had a half - hour chat over coffee and he walked out with a job offer .
It seemed pleasant and homey , an inviting workplace .
After getting hired , Steve proved to be a smart , hands - off boss , who was a pleasure to work for .
He was The perfect chief for a ramshackle web shop .
Mostly .
It was a year later that he discovered the dark side to Steve 's laid - back interviewing style : Gary .
Gary had a solid - looking resume and managed to talk his way past Steve and into a job doing Perl / PHP .
Gary loved finding other people 's mistakes .
He made it a habit to shoulder - surf the other coders and give them a " real - time code review " .
The little list of stupid mistakes he gathered would then be brought up again in meetings so that Gary could pretend to be some sort of hero , like he was holding the entire shop together .
One day , Gary was being particularly annoying , riding Rick 's shoulder and ignoring his own work .
" That code is wrong , " he said .
Rick kept ignoring Gary , and doing actual work .
The " wrong " code , in this case , was just some basic array manipulation to build entries for a drop down list .
" You 're going to get an exception when you run that , " Gary warned .
" And even if you do n't , I do n't think it 's going to do what you think it 's supposed to . "
Rick slammed a finger down on his F5 key , a little harder than needed .
The browser refreshed and everything did exactly what it was supposed to .
Satisfied , he turned to glare at Gary .
The irritating little crawler shrugged and confessed , " I ca n't get my head around arrays . "
Something in Rick 's brain snapped .
" Hey , Gary , " he said , as sweetly as he could .
" How come you 're not on the CD - ROM project ?
I was surprised , because it 's a real high visibility project .
Management 's real excited about it .
I hear they want a volunteer . "
These statements were true .
Management wanted a CD - ROM version of their website .
Not an uncommon request in these pre-broadband days , but it was a tedious pile of garbage that none of the developers wanted to do .
Rick 's simple sales pitch sent Gary scurrying back to Steve so that he could volunteer for this important project .
It was a matter of organizing the files for the CD - ROM , and then building a search engine that could run inside of the web - browser for accessing some data files .
It was the very definition of " time consuming but easy " .
Weeks went by , and each staff meeting had a few minutes dedicated to Gary gushing about how well everything was going .
Then the deadline started to loom .
" Hey , I 've got a quick question for you . "
" I 'm a little stuck on something , could you take a look ? " " Help ! "
Gary 's plaintive cries initially drew nothing but snickers .
But eventually , either team spirit or morbid curiosity took over .
Rick popped into Gary 's cube to see if he could help .
In short , no , Rick could not help .
Mr. Confused - By - Arrays managed to get things so turned around that the only sane step would be to junk it entirely .
It was so tortured and crippled that it should have been euthanized on the spot .
There was one line in particular that was so broken , so mangled , so patently insane that it was n't even wrong .
It was so idiotic that Rick and his team use it as the benchmark of bad code to this day .
echo if ( isset ( $ bob +1000 ) ) ;
The deadline slammed down , and Steve suddenly realized that Gary did n't have anything that they could ship .
In the course of the next 48 hours , several things happened : Rick and two other competent developers pulled a pair of all nighters but were able to get the CD - ROM out the door , Gary was sacked , and Steve treated the entire dev team to a round at the local pub to celebrate .
Rick thought that was the last he'd hear of Gary .
But one day , years later , he heard Steve bawling with laughter in his office .
A few minutes later , a link to an Amazon listing showed up in everyone 's inbox .
The destination ?
A PHP book with Gary listed as the co-author .
And no , the table of contents did n't have a heading for arrays .
Back in February of 2007 , the Ars team was a bit miffed at what it saw as the half - hearted efforts of Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) to bolster fair use protections for consumers .
Boucher had just introduced his Fair Use Act to the House , a bill that would provide additional protection for consumers following the Supreme Court 's 2005 pile drive of the Grokster file - sharing service .
Boucher 's legislation , cosponsored by John Doolittle ( R - CA ) , offered a variety of new fair use exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
These included making " a compilation of audiovisual works " for classroom use , transmitting files over a home network , and accessing various works " of substantial public interest solely for purposes of criticism , comment , news , reporting , scholarship , or research . "
Unlike previous iterations of his proposed law , however , Boucher 's latest version did not offer protections to the developers of tools designed to facilitate these salubrious activities .
" So if Boucher 's legislation passed , " Tim Lee lamented in a post published a day after the law 's announcement , " a film studies professor would be permitted to use software such as Handbrake to circumvent the copy protection on DVDs and create an audiovisual presentation featuring scenes from various movies .
However , developing or distributing Handbrake in the United States would still be a crime . "
Now , three years later , the Public Knowledge advocacy group has a set of proposals that would address this strange shortcoming .
Substantial noninfringing use
PK has been especially busy with these matters of late , unveiling its proposed Copyright Reform
Act in stages .
Stage one urges an expansion of fair use concepts to the DMCA , including the incidental capture of images ( " for example , capturing music playing over radio when filming a family moment " ) and " personal and noncommercial uses " that would have " little chance of harming copyright holders " ( e.g. , making a CD of your favorite cardio - pop tunes for the fitness center ) .
Now Public Knowledge 's stage two addresses the " anticircumvention " trap embedded in Section 1201 of the DMCA , the first words of which read as so : " No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title . "
PK would add a codicil to this text :
" It shall not be a violation of this section to circumvent a technological measure in connection with access to , or the use of , a work if such circumvention is for the purpose of engaging in noninfringing use of a work . "
Then the group 's reforms address Section 1201 language forbidding anyone to make , offer or traffic any technology , product , or service that " is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title " and " has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title . "
To these sentences PK would append the following :
" It shall not be a violation of this section to manufacture , import , offer to the public , provide , or otherwise traffic in any technology , product , service , device , component , or part thereof capable of enabling substantial noninfringing use of a work protected under this title . "
This , of course , lands us deep in the muck which is Supreme Court 's Grokster decision , which ruled that the file - sharing service could find no safe harbor in the high court 's 1984 Betamax standard .
Betamax allowed that devices " capable of substantial noninfringing uses " could not be legally blamed for the infringing shenanigans of their users .
But Grokster found that device distributors who sold services and technologies with the object of promoting their uses to infringe copyright were indeed liable for the consequences .
What we have in Public Knowledge 's proposals , then , is a legislative attempt to address both the DMCA and Grokster 's overreach , empowering devices capable of " enabling substantial noninfringing use of a work , " while retaining the ruling 's oversight over bad intent .
Teachers , regional DVDs , backups , time shares
Why does PK think that consumers need these reforms ?
Lots of reasons .
High on the group 's first aid list are teachers who want to show films to their classes .
They 're hobbled by the law if they want to make film compilations from DVD media , a task that sometimes requires encryption circumvention technology .
Thus , classroom instructors " must both worry about liability for the act of circumvention and manage in spite of the prohibition on tools that would allow them to circumvent , " PK warns .
In other words , they have to navigate through a DVD 's scene index , creating long and awkward breaks in their lectures .
In 2006 the US Copyright Office granted a limited exemption on these restrictions for film and media studies professors , leaving historians , sociologists , anthropologists , ethnographers , and everybody else to fend for themselves .
Next , there are the roadblocks set up by the regional coding mechanisms stamped into many DVDs .
On top of CSS used by most DVD makers , regional playback control is added , making their media usable only in a specific geographical area .
" Consumers ' ability to make private use of legitimately purchased foreign DVDs on their DVD players in the United States is thus challenged regardless of whether they lawfully imported foreign DVDs themselves or legally purchased them from an overseas vendor , " PK notes , " though both methods of acquisition are ' plainly legal ' under copyright law . "
Then there are the backup technologies that have been pummeled under the DMCA , such as RealDVD , a system that allowed consumers to store DVD content on their hard drives .
Eventually RealNetworks settled its fight with Hollywood , agreeing to fork over $ 4.5 million make the Motion Picture Association of America 's infringement lawsuit go away .
But RealNetworks is n't always the defendant .
Do n't forget the time / format sharing Streambox VCR , which allowed users to record and play RealAudio streams .
Real Networks sued Streambox for DMCA copyright infringement .
Eventually the two companies settled .
Enacting these reforms " would remedy the unintended consequences caused by § 1201 's overbroad prohibitions while continuing to offer copyright owners extra protections for digital works guarded by TPMs [ technology protection measures ] , " Public Knowledge 's brief concludes .
Unfortunately , these suggestions are unlikely to ever darken the doors of Congress .
Even Boucher 's milquetoast fair use law did n't get very far ; it was referred to the House Judiciary Committee , and then to the Subcommittee on Courts , the Internet , and Intellectual Property back in 2007 .
That was the last anyone heard of it .
The government is attempting to ban the Ugandan MP who introduced legislation to execute gays from entering the UK .
David Bahati , the MP for Ndorwa West , introduced the anti-homosexuality bill last year .
If it succeeds in parliament in its current form , some homosexuality offences will be punished with the death penalty .
According to the Guardian , civil servants in the Foreign Office , the Department for International Development and the Borders Agency are drawing up plans to block Mr Bahati ’s visa if he does not drop the bill .
A senior government source said the issue could become “ a major diplomatic incident if the Ugandans do not back down ” .
The bill proposes the death penalty for people who have gay sex with minors , disabled people , or while infected with HIV , along with repeat offenders .
Others convicted of homosexual sex will face life imprisonment , up from the current 14 year sentence .
Since it was tabled by Mr Bahati as a private members bill , senior Ugandan politicians have been seen distancing themselves from it after countries such as the UK and US urged against it .
UK prime minister Gordon Brown has criticised it , while US president Barack Obama said it was “ odious ” .
Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni said several months ago that Uganda had to consider its foreign interests and Mr Bahati himself conceded that he would consider amending some parts of the bill .
Ugandan government officials have suggested it is unlikely to come before parliament before 2011 and observers say this may be a stalling tactic as the country is due to go to the polls in the next year .

Advantages of Underground Homes
The advantages of underground homes and houses that are earth sheltered or bermed are many as you will soon see .
While owning an underground home or one that is partially sheltered by earth is not for everyone there are some particular advantages , both practical and psychological worth noting .
Two Partially Underground Homes
Of course there will be naysayers and we like to give fair coverage here .
So , I 've also put up a disadvantages of underground homes and earth sheltered houses page so that you can weigh for yourself the pros and cons .
Top 20 Advantages
Less building material
Less labor
Less property tax
Warm in winter
Cool in summer
Energy Efficient
Pipes do n't freeze
Increased yard space
Fallout shelter
Cuts down on atmospheric radiation
Better shelter from storms
Home fortress and defense
Concealment and privacy
Sound proof
More fireproof
Long lasting
Insurance Breaks
Less maintenance
Abundant Natural light if desired
Good view if built right
So , these are the top 20 advantages of an underground or earth sheltered home .
Let 's go over them quickly .
Less building material is needed because most underground homes are relatively simple in design .
The materials mean less labor and lower costs to build the house .
Because the earth sheltered home costs less to build it is generally appraised at a lower price and thus property taxes will be lower .
Because Mother Earth keeps the lower levels of ground below the frost line in the 50's F , this means less cooling in the summer is needed as well as less heat in the winter , which means they are very energy efficient .
It also means that your pipes do n't freeze at these temperatures .
Because underground and earth bermed homes can have grass , yard or garden on top or partially on top of them , this means more space for planting whatever you wish .
Some people like to think of underground homes as fallout shelters which they are .
The house will cut down on natural atmospheric radiation from solar flares and other such outer space phenomena .
The earth bermed home is also a robust shelter from storms that bring tornadoes and hail .
Sheep Security System Concealment and privacy is gained with underground homes .
An intruder will generally have fewer entrances and exits and the grounds are easier to monitor .
The entire home is a panic room if needed .
Also , you 'll have privacy from neighbors if you like to bang on your drums all day or scream at the spouse and kids at night .
Being made of concrete , steel , PVC pipe or other non-flammable materials , underground and earth sheltered homes do n't catch fire and continue to burn as easily as above ground homes .
Because these homes are sheltered from storms , fires and the wear and tear other houses have to endure , you 'll usually get insurance breaks as the structures will last longer and be repaired less ( less maintenance ) .
Having an underground or earth bermed home does n't mean that you 've fallen down the Rabbit Hole and can't get back up , Alice .
You do n't have to give up your view , if the home is constructed with a view in mind .
Let There Be Light !
For instance , many underground homes have skylights and will even use mirrors to reflect and ocean or mountain view .
Earth sheltered homes can point the one exposed side towards the most favorable view .
And with a good view , skylight , mirrors and windows , comes as much natural light as you need .
So , this has been a quick overview of the top 20 advantages of owning or buying and underground or earth sheltered home .
Of course , you may find even more benefits that suit your own quirky personality that I have n't listed here .
The point is that even when living partly under the earth you can be as creative and flexible as you want to be .
Seize and Liquidate Goldman Sachs
Webster G. Tarpley
TARPLEY.net
April 27 , 2010
Today ’s Senate hearings , carried on CNBC , Bloomberg , and C - SPAN , represent the first major exposure of the American people to the scandalous frauds of the derivatives casino , including synthetic collateralized debt obligations ( synthetic CDOs or CDO² ) .
These are things most people have heard very little about .
They begin to open up the shocking reality behind such shopworn euphemisms like “ toxic assets , ” “ exotic instruments , ” and “ troubled assets . ”
Reactionaries in general and Republicans in particular have done everything possible to hide the role of derivatives , which must be considered the main cause of the financial panic of September 2008 which brought down Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch , and AIG , after felling Bear Stearns in March of the same year .
The reactionary legend , repeated yesterday on the Senate floor by financier minion GOP Sen .
Gregg of New Hampshire , is that the crisis was caused by poor people taking out subprime mortgages and then defaulting , bringing down the entire Anglo - American banking system and triggering the bailouts .
Either that , or too much government spending was too blame .
A mass of kited derivatives blew up in September 2008
This Big Lie has come from such propaganda sources as the Limbaugh Institute of Retarded Reactionary Ranting .
But the $ 1.5 trillion in subprime mortgages were dwarfed by the $ 15 trillion US residential real estate market , to say nothing of the $ 1.5 thousand trillion world derivatives bubble .
But , starting with Bush - Goldman Sachs Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the talk has been of a “ housing correction , ” not a derivatives panic .
It must be pointed out that derivatives are nothing but wagers , bets placed from a distance on securities which themselves are often not mortgages , but rather other derivatives .
The bettor buying a synthetic CDO or CDO² does not own the underlying mortgages or mortgage - backed securities , any more than someone who bets on a racehorse owns part of the horse .
Blankfein and others tried to portray derivatives as a service to hedgers and end -users , but it ’s clear that the vast majority of derivatives involve neither hedgers nor users , but only bettors on both side of the transaction .
It is in any case this mass of kited derivatives which blew up in 2008 , bringing on the present world economic depression .
Goldman Sachs executives are babbling cretins
The mystique of Goldman Sachs is based in large part on their reputation as the smartest financiers on Wall Street .
After today ’s hearings , this mystique has permanently dissipated .
The Goldman executives babbled .
They sounded dumb .
They stalled and stammered and went into contortions to avoid giving straight answers to simple questions .
They were mendacious and evasive when they did speak .
Financial powers around the world will note carefully the refusal of three out of four Goldman executives on one panel to state that they had a duty to defend the interests of their clients .
Who will want to do business with such a gang ?
Goldman Sachs got $ 10 billion of taxpayer money in low - interest loans under the Bush - Paulson TARP .
Part of that money went to pay for obscene bonuses for Goldman executives like the ones on display today .
The argument for bonuses is that they must be paid to retain the highly talented personnel , virtual geniuses , who are indispensable for Wall Street speculative success .
But these are no geniuses , they are imbeciles .
No more bonuses should be paid by banks saved through public money .
Do n’t buy any used cars from Lloyd Blankfein
Sleaziest of all was Goldman ’s risk - monger in chief , Lloyd Blankfein , who pretended not to know that derivatives are often kept hidden off balance sheet .
The morally insane Blankfein testified that his role was to provide the firm ’s clients with “ the risk they wanted . ”
Other GS witnesses represented the firm ’s role as “ distributing risk . ”
But it turned out that they were manufacturing risk through the very existence and activities of Goldman Sachs , which had the result of pyramiding the total risk of the US financial system into intergalactic space .
It is time to regulate much of that unbearable risk out of existence with appropriate regulatory legislation .
In the meantime , no sane person would buy a used car from Blankfein .
Nor should they believe his assurance that the “ recession ” has ended .
But when at the end of the day Blankfein finally suggested to Sen .
Tester that synthetic CDOs might be outlawed , we should accept his proposal immediately .
Today ’s hearings reveal the Goldman Sachs gunslingers and whiz kids as ignorant gangsters and con artists , notable only for their ability to practice massive fraud with impudence .
These sleazy mediocrities do not deserve bonuses paid for by taxpayers .
Rather , it is time to shut them down and put them in the dock .
If Goldman Sachs had cared about is clients , it would have urgently warned them to unload their subprime risk by late 2006 or thereabouts .
Instead , Goldman was busily increasing its clients ’ risk by selling them more toxic CDOs out of its own inventory warehouse .
Goldman Sachs : bookies who stack the deck and fix the games
As the philandering Sen. Ensign pointed out , comparing Wall Street to Las Vegas is a slander on the croupiers of Las Vegas , where everyone knows or should know that the game is rigged so that the house always wins .
To use the comparison introduced by Sen. McCaskill , Goldman Sachs was operating as the gambling house , or the bookie .
At the same time , Goldman was betting for their own account .
But much worse was the fact that Goldman was stacking the decks , loading the dice , fixing the games on which the bets were placed , and bribing the umpires .
As Ensign put it in a rare moment of lucidity , the subprime mortgage was bad .
But the collapse of subprime would not have had anything like its actual destructive effect on the US economy if it had not been compounded by the mass of synthetic derivatives that were piled on top of subprime .
No national or social purpose served by Goldman Sachs and toxic derivatives bets
The broader issue raised by today ’s hearing is : what human purpose is served by the existence of Goldman Sachs , which concocts toxic synthetic CDOs for the purpose of allowing speculators , who are often lied to and duped , to bet for or against them .
Goldman Sachs can only be described as a speculative parasite which promotes the activities of other speculative parasites , such as the John Paulson hedge fund at the expense of the public and of its other clients .
It was a crime to inject $ 10 billion of Treasury money into Goldman Sachs .
It was another crime for the Fed to lend Goldman untold billions ( just how many billions Bernanke still refuses to disclose ) to keep them afloat and enable more predatory profits .
These crimes must stop , and the public money must be clawed back .
Most important , it is time to shut down the derivatives rackets .
Goldman got $ 12.5 billion from taxpayers for AIG credit default swaps
Useful questions from GOP Sen .
Coburn pointed to another kind of derivative : the infamous credit default swap ( CDS ) .
These CDS are what brought down AIG , whose London hedge fund had issues $ 3 trillion in derivatives .
When the government bailed out AIG , part of that $ 180 billion of taxpayer money was used for payouts to the CDS counterparties of AIG , biggest among them Goldman , which got $ 12.5 billion from the US taxpayer .
That was 100 cents on the dollar on a mass of toxic CDS .
Coburn wanted to know why Goldman got all their money back , while GM bondholders took a bath as GM went bankrupt .
That was , of course , a matter of Goldman ’s political clout through GS alum Henry Paulson and Obama Car Czar Steve “ The Rat ” Rattner , backed up by the historic preponderance of finance capital over industrial capital in this country since Andrew Carnegie sold out to JP Morgan over a century ago .
Derivatives and zombie banks : the toll
Thanks to Goldman Sachs , the other Wall Street zombie banks , and their derivatives , the financial panic of 2008 has turned into a world economic depression of unimaginable proportions .
The unemployed and underemployed in the US alone are surely in excess of 20 million .
Five to six million home foreclosures are already done or in the pipeline , throwing tens of millions of Americans out of their homes .
World trade has been seriously impacted .
The budgets of California , New York , Illinois , and many other states are in crisis , with massive layoffs of teachers and other state employees .
An entire generation is being destroyed .
Now , Greek bonds are trading at junk levels under the attack of speculative predators including Soros , Greenlight Capital , SAC , and the protagonists of today ’s hearings – Paulson and Co and Goldman Sachs itself .
The attack on Greece and the euro represents the leading edge of the second wave of the depression , which is now arriving in much the same way that the second wave of the 1930s depression was unleashed by the Vienna Kreditanstalt bankruptcy in May of 1931 , about 79 years ago and just a year and a half into that depression .
The goal of the Republicans is to portray themselves as stern judges of Wall Street , even as they line up in a unanimous phalanx to protect the finance jackals from any meaningful regulation whatsoever — as seen in yesterday ’s vote to block cloture on derivatives re-regulation and reform .
The goal of the Democrats is to expose the sociopathic evil of Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street while preening themselves as defenders of the public interest , without however banning credit default swaps , banning synthetic CDOs , and imposing a Wall Street sales tax on all remaining derivatives and asset transactions .
To this degree , today ’s hearings are being conducted in bad faith by both major parties .
However , the dynamic of the resulting spectacle has the result of educating and mobilizing public opinion against the predatory practices which are the essence of Wall Street , even a year and a half after the banking panic of September 2008 and the monster bailout of zombie banks which soon followed .
What is required is a new edition of the anti-banker sentiment set off by the Senate Banking Committee hearings conducted from January 1933 to May 1934 by committee counsel Ferdinand Pecora , which unmasked the corruption of Wall Street .
Persons of good will need to get active now to push this process as far as possible while these social dynamics are working .
It is time to hit the zombie banks , the hedge funds , and their derivatives as hard as possible , before the second wave of the depression hits .
The program necessary to fight the depression and break the strangle - hold of Wall Street on the US economy and political system is given on my web site .
Mitch McConnell on the bailout : “ Harry , I think we need to do this , we should try to do this , and we can do this . ”
During a break the senators filed out , and the GOP reactionary lockstep once again blocked cloture for a final debate on the Wall Street reform bill , weak as it is .
Many activists of the Tea Party naively believe that they have been fighting for a year and a half that they have been fighting to take back the Republican Party .
If that is what they believe , today ’s second cloture vote proves that they have gotten nowhere in their efforts .
Despite their charades , the GOP are the bodyguards of the Wall Street predators .
Tea baggers who think they can break the Wall Street grip on the Republicans are pathetic dupes , and they need to wake up , pronto .
When Paulson went to the leaders of Congress to demand a $ 700 billion bailout for Goldman and his Wall Street cronies , GOP Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was “ deeply frightened ” by the apocalyptic briefing delivered by Paulson and Bernanke .
When Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid started talking about how difficult it would be to get so much money in a hurry , McConnell urged an immediate bailout , saying : “ Harry , I think we need to do this , we should try to do this , and we can do this . ”
( Andrew Ross Sorkin , Too Big to Fail [ New York : Viking , 2009 ] , p. 442 ) The GOP was the original party of the bailout , and they have not repented , as best seen through the continuance of McConnell , one of the key midwives of the bailout , as Republican Senate Majority Leader .
This is the same McConnell who went to Wall Street recently to meet with zombie bankers and hedge fund hyenas , pledging to block derivatives reforms in exchange for big bucks contributed to the GOP ’s campaign coffers .
Tea baggers who think the GOP has changed or is moving to their side are sadly deluded .
Today , the market fetishism of the crackpot Austrian school has taken a severe blow .
Now that Blankfein ‘s public image has been soiled by Goldman ’s scurrilous and scatological emails , the time is ripe for the radical reform of derivatives and the zombie banks .
This is a matter of national survival .
Now that Goldman Sachs is masquerading as a bank holding company , it is subject to FDIC rules .
If Goldman ’s derivative hoard is marked to market , it is bankrupt .
The FDIC should therefore seize Goldman and liquidate it under chapter 7 of the US Code .

For the first time , Facebook is now the leading publisher of display ads in the U.S. , according to comScore 's data for the first quarter of 2010 .
At least when measured by the number of ad impressions -- not by revenue or profits .
Facebook 's ad impressions increased steadily throughout 2009 while the numbers at other top publishers were flat or declining .
This past quarter , Facebook 's impressions took off , thanks to a more ad - friendly redesign and steadily increasing traffic .
In the process , Facebook blew past the long - time leading publisher : Yahoo .
( Though Yahoo still generates far more revenue from its ads than Facebook . )

" Is this a drastic call to action ?

Technology blog Gizmodo is in a difficult position .
The site 's editor , Jason Chen , recently had his home searched and electronics equipment seized to see if he committed a crime at any point over the past few weeks when he paid $ 5,000 for a lost iPhone 4G .
Chen says he 's innocent , and Gizmodo 's legal counsel has publicly said that Chen was acting well within journalistic standards .
The legal counsel says he cannot be charged with any crime for acquiring the iPhone 4G .
But determining exactly what happened and whether laws or journalistic ethics were violated might be more difficult than it seems on face value .
Gizmodo has been forthright about its contention that it acted within its rights as a news service in sharing information about the Apple iPhone prototype with the public .
If its account is true , it appears that Gizmodo tried to perform journalistic due diligence before it started the process of acquiring the iPhone 4G and posting details about the device on its site .
But that does n't mean that Gizmodo was necessarily entirely right in this scenario .
It also does n't mean that law enforcement has made the right moves .
It seems that there is adequate blame to go around .
And it 's incumbent upon us as the spectators to be as informed as possible before we pass judgment .
So , let 's take a look at 10 things to know about Gizmodo 's iPhone 4G saga .
1. An Apple employee lost it
Although some have said that Apple secretly leaked the iPhone 4G to Gizmodo , it reportedly did n't happen that way .
An Apple employee lost the iPhone 4G in a bar , which was eventually recovered by another patron .
After unsuccessful attempts at getting the iPhone back into Apple 's hands , the person offered it up to Gizmodo .
According to Gizmodo , the person held onto the iPhone for weeks before giving it to the tech blog .
That 's an important factor in all of this .
Considering the person tried hard to give the device back to Apple , some fault might need to be placed on the hardware company for not performing its own due diligence .
2. Gizmodo paid $ 5,000 for it
Gizmodo reported recently that it paid $ 5,000 for the lost iPhone .
That figure might not mean much to some , but under California law , that puts the transaction into felony territory .
That 's not a good thing .
But it also speaks to whether or not Gizmodo should have paid for the product and if it acted ethically by doing so .
It 's difficult to say what any publication or editor would do in a similar situation , but a spectator 's individual ethics must come into play when deciding where the fault should be placed .
3 . Apple had ample time to recover it
As mentioned above , Apple had about three weeks to find and retrieve the lost iPhone , according to Gizmodo .
The tech blog said that the person who recovered the iPhone from the bar attempted to contact the company to no avail .
Rather than hold on to it , he decided to sell it off for a handsome sum .
It makes sense .
But it also begs the question of whether or not Apple truly cares .
Steve Jobs has a proven track record of being secretive and unbending in his distaste for those who leak company secrets .
If he was really that upset about what was lost , would n't he have attempted to more proactively seek it out ?
One would think so .
4 . There 's still no telling if it 's really the iPhone 4G
Try as it might to say that the phone it found is in fact the iPhone 4G , Gizmodo , like the rest of us , cannot confirm it .
Apple has yet to say whether or not the lost device was actually the new version of the iPhone , and it 's entirely possible that the device is one of many prototypes the company is working on .
As appealing as it might be to seemingly look at the next version of the iPhone that Apple does n't want us to see , there 's no way to know if it's what we 'll be using in the coming months .
Gizmodo recovered an iPhone prototype , but not necessarily the iPhone 4G .
The Celiac Disease Foundation will be hosting their Annual Education Conference & Food Faire in Los Angeles , Saturday May 15 , 2010 .
This year ’s conference will host some of the countries world leading experts on celiac disease and gluten - free living including Peter Green , Sheila Crowe and Shelley Case .
There will also be a question and answer forum ; sessions focused on children and teens with celiac ; and book signings .
The early registration discount is extended until April 30th .
The conference and will be held at the Los Angeles Downtown Marriott and parking is included with registration .
The conference is going to kick off their 20th annual celebration with a pancake breakfast debuting General Mills new gluten - free Bisquick pancakes with syrup .
Registrants will be the first to be able to taste the new baking mix which will be introduced to the public later this summer .
In addition to this highly anticipated product introduction is the debut of gluten - free Hamburger Helper , which will also be available this summer in 3 flavors : Chicken Fried Rice , Cheesy Hashbrowns and Beef Fried Rice .
Since 1931 Bisquick has been a staple in the kitchens of many Americans , and finally the gluten - free community will be able to enjoy it again .
I know for me personally there are many quick and easy casseroles I would make that would call for Bisquick and have just put those recipes aside since I knew I was unable to use it .
I am really looking forward to the ease of using Bisquick again for many recipes , especially recipes that are easy for children to create .
General Mills continues to impress us with its commitment to serving the gluten - free community .
It is wonderful to see larger mainstream companies being able to make products that meet our needs and are widely available at mainstream grocery stores .
It is encouraging to see what General Mills is doing , and leaves me with hope that many other larger companies will follow suit .
Once being gluten - free meant having to travel far to speciality stores , mail order and pay double or more on products that were cheap to the rest of the population , and this is finally starting to change with increased awareness .
In December , Tiffany Janes wrote an article about the new website by General Mills which keeps us up - to - date on all of their gluten - free products .
This is definitely a good resource to keep bookmarked on our computers and phones .
I look forward to try the new products this summer .
I 've been dipping in and dipping out since it started - not even trying to follow the discussions , just pleased and impressed with the depth and intelligence that people are bringing to the conversation .
But I just hit a strange ethical dilemma .
I followed a link on , um , something in American Gods , to its Wikipedia entry .
And read an entry about something that I 'd made up ( because it fitted , because it worked , and because I did n't think anyone would mind ) that cited a reference book that talked about the thing I made up .
The reference book was written some years after American Gods was published , and the person who wrote the reference book has obviously cribbed a little information from American Gods .
The last time , some years ago , I 'd checked the Wikipedia entry , it was accurate , and noted that the thing in question had started in American Gods .
Now all reference to me and to American Gods has gone .
It now has , after all , a reference book link .
And something that I made up has become , to all intents and purposes , a fact .
I pondered fixing it .
I 'd need to do a blog entry clarifying exactly what I made up and what I did n't in this thing , to allow someone to do a fix , so they could link to that .
( I ca n't just fix the Wikipedia entry .
It does n't work like that : someone would just revert the change , dismiss it as " original research " or point out that there IS now a reference book reference .
I 'd need to cite chapter and verse over here on the blog , or in a book , to give the Wikipedia entry something to link to . )
But really , there 's probably a very useful lesson in there somewhere about what facts are .
And I quite like the idea that something that I made up has wandered out of a book and into the real world .
It seems very appropriate for that particular book , as well .
So my ethical question is ...
... should I tell ?
Would you ?

So who died and made Tony Hayward the king ?
Yes , that ’s the BP CEO yelling “ get ’em out of there , get ’em out of there ” to the media who is filming him as he “ works ” on the oil slick cleanup .
The last time I checked , we do n’t live in the United States of BP .
Again , would someone in the White House like to step up and take control of this situation ?
This pompous ass thinks he owns the place and quite frankly , he does at the moment .
“ Unfortunately , I am not going to be able to be of any help , ” Stan Rosenfield , a spokesman for George Clooney , said in response to a query about Mr. Clooney ’s pay for his work in Paramount Pictures ’
“ Up in the Air . ”
Image ‘ Inglourious Basterds ’ Brad Pitt attracted hefty upfront fees .
Credit ... François Duhamel / Weinstein Company and Universal Pictures
That film was made for about $ 25 million .
It was possible only because Mr. Clooney , according to people briefed on the film ’s finances but speaking anonymously to avoid conflict with the star or Paramount , took an initial fee that was roughly a tenth of the $ 20 million that Leonardo DiCaprio , a frequent Oscar contender , has received in the past .
Once upon a time , the biggest stars were rewarded with deals that paid them a percentage of so - called first - dollar gross receipts ; that is , they began sharing in the profits from the first ticket sale , not waiting until the studio turned a profit .
Now studios often insist that even top stars forgo large advance payments in return for a share of the profits after a studio has recouped its cash investment .
The fashionable deal now is called “ CB zero . ”
It stands for “ cash - break zero , ” and refers to an arrangement under which the star or filmmaker begins collecting a share of profits after the studio has reached the break - even point .
Such deals can be extremely lucrative when they give stars a substantial share in home - video revenue .

Carlo Ancelotti is one win away from guiding Chelsea to the Premier League title after a 2 - 0 victory at Liverpool that left Sir Alex Ferguson admitting his Manchester United side were " clutching at straws " going into the final weekend of the season .
Goals from Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard mean Chelsea will be crowned champions if they beat Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge next Sunday .
United won 1 - 0 at Sunderland , courtesy of a first - half strike from Nani , but they trail by one point as they prepare to take on Stoke City at Old Trafford .
Chelsea have now done the double over Liverpool , Arsenal and United and Ancelotti praised his players .
" This game was the key in the fight for the title and we played very well , " said the Chelsea manager .
" We deserved to win .
Defensively we did a fantastic job .
" We had a lot of opportunities on the counter - attack and it was a really important performance .
There was a lot of pressure on us but we had good control of our emotions .
The team shows good physical condition , good mentality and good physicality and now we have to train well this week and wait for Sunday . "
Liverpool looked tired and deflated after going out of the Europa League to Atlético Madrid last Thursday and contributed to their own downfall , with Steven Gerrard 's backpass setting up Drogba for the opening goal .
Ferguson described that as " a great gift " but was careful not to criticise United 's arch - rivals .
" Liverpool had a hard game on Thursday .
They 've lost 19 games this season so maybe we were asking too much of them to get a result .
It was always going to be a difficult job against Chelsea .
But it 's not what we wanted , that 's for sure .
" I thought Liverpool would do something , but I suppose it's hard to expect them to win against Chelsea .
It can happen and I 'm sure Gerrard will regret it , but there is nothing we can do about it .
We can't win everything . "
Ancelotti accepted that Liverpool had " looked a bit tired in the second half " but he said Rafael Benítez 's team should not be accused of failing to put in their usual effort .
" It is never easy to play here , " the Chelsea manager said .
" They have very good players and it is a fantastic atmosphere .
It is the first time for me here and I will always have good memories of it .
We made it a difficult game for them because we played well and had good control of the game . "
Drogba acknowledged that Gerrard 's error had been critical .
" He made a big mistake , " the striker said .
" I was lucky to be there and score .
It was good because this goal gave us a lot of confidence to play well . "
Lampard , the Ivorian 's fellow goalscorer , said the significance of the win could not be overstated .
" This was a huge game for us , " he said .
" If we had dropped points today we would have given the advantage to Man U . "
Chelsea were immediately installed as 1 - 14 favourites to end United 's run of three successive titles but Ferguson insisted that his players would not give up hope .
" We just have to get on with it .
We will play our game and you never know what can happen .
If we do our job right , at least we will stretch it out .
All we can do is win against Stoke and we want to do that , in front of our fans in the last game of the season .
" You never know ... football is a crazy game .
I would n't insult Wigan in any shape or form because they are a really good football team and they will have a go .
Manchester City did us a great turn by beating Chelsea twice and Wigan are another neighbour but , listen , we know we are clutching at straws a little bit .
" The important thing is for us to win our game and enjoy it .
We will play the right way and with dignity in our game .
The fight goes on .
We have stretched it out for another week and that is what we wanted to do . "
United 's players barely celebrated their win and Ferguson admitted it had been a bittersweet afternoon .
" We knew the result [ from Anfield ] when we kicked off and that there was nothing we could do about it , so I said just : ' Go and enjoy yourselves , play the Manchester United way and express yourself . '
We did our job .
We played with great confidence and expression in our game which is good to see at this time of the year . "
He was less enamoured with Dimitar Berbatov , substituting the Bulgarian after two second - half misses inside the six - yard area .
" We were frivolous , " he said .
" We had an awful lot of chances , but we wasted a lot , too , and towards the end I was beginning to think they were going to score because 1 - 0 is n't a healthy score .
It was just careless finishing .
Dimitar could have scored four . "

A secretive Middle East consortium has bid £ 1.5 bn for Manchester United only to be firmly rejected by the club 's owners , the Glazer family , it emerged last night .
According to information passed to the Guardian this was one of several covert offers which have been made for the club , all valuing United at more than £ 1bn and all of them rebuffed .
Despite the antagonism facing them from United fans , the rejection of the bids appears to signal the Glazer family 's seriousness about not selling the club – at least for the medium term .
The Glazers are now talking about staying at Old Trafford for another 10 years .
The news will come as a blow to the Red Knights , the group of businessmen who have been preparing a bid for United and have carried out their activities more publicly .
The biggest concern will be that the apparent valuation that others put on the club far exceeds their own , which has been put at around £ 800m .
The offer from the Middle East that valued the club at £ 1.5 bn was made towards the end of last year .
It was flatly turned down and the bidders were discouraged from returning with a second offer , despite being willing to pay significantly more than United 's £ 1.19 bn valuation in the Forbes football rich - list .
The revelation represents depressing news for those fans who have been campaigning for the Glazers ' removal and had hoped that the hostility shown towards the Americans would help to persuade them to sever their ties with the club .
More than 150,000 people have joined the Manchester United Supporters '
Trust , the group co-ordinating the anti-Glazer movement , and the protests have become increasingly voluble since the release of a bond prospectus in January that laid bare the Glazers ' business model .
The Glazer family are said to be unmoved by the animosity and thick - skinned enough not to allow it to affect their planning .
They are described as enjoying the prestige of being associated with a winning team .
That paints a bleak picture for the former United director Jim O'Neill , now the chief economist at Goldman Sachs , who had been hoping to move into power at Old Trafford via the Red Knights , the group of " high net value individuals " that also includes the former Football League chairman Keith Harris .
An offer from the Red Knights is anticipated in the coming weeks but , even if it is substantially higher than the £ 800 m initially discussed , the Glazers will reject it out of hand and offer no indication of a price that might tempt them to consider a sale .
This could be seen as a negotiating tactic , but the Glazers ' message is " thanks but no thanks " .
O'Neill and his associates have already inquired about the Glazers ' position via Rothschild , the investment bankers who helped the Americans with their takeover in 2005 , and were told that the club was not for sale .
That position is unlikely to change .
" It 's like having the most beautiful house , " according to one top - level source .
" They could sell that house but why would they want to sell it if it were the most beautiful house around ? "
On the contrary , the Glazers are already thinking far enough ahead to be talking about refinancing their debts in 2017 .
They accept they could have been more open with the supporters and are aware of the misgivings about the £ 700 m worth of debts they have brought to the club .
They also hope to be at Old Trafford more next season .
Avi Glazer has been a regular visitor but his brother Bryan has found it harder because his children are younger .
But they reject criticisms about the average 48 % rise in season - ticket prices , pointing out that Old Trafford sells out for every game and is cheaper than Arsenal , Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur .
Many supporters are planning to boycott the club next season , effectively going on strike until the Glazers have moved on , but the Florida - based owners are said to be relaxed about the possible financial implications , believing it will make little difference to their annual results .
They have also reiterated to Ferguson that he can spend significant sums in the summer transfer market if he wishes .
High - ranking sources at Old Trafford have confirmed that Ferguson is satisfied with the financial position and is genuine when he says he has a strong relationship with the Glazers .
However , he has resisted the temptation to pay exorbitant prices and has adopted a policy of bringing in young , up - and - coming players .
The Glazers , nonetheless , are satisfied with the financial backing they have given Ferguson during the last three title - winning campaigns , which also brought two Champions League finals , and believe they would not have come under such scrutiny had it not been for the huge sums of money being spent at Manchester City under the Abu Dhabi United Group .
They believe the criticisms of their regime have been exaggerated and have taken encouragement from the fact their bond issue , raising £ 504 m , was twice over - subscribed .
They are also unimpressed with the manner in which the Red Knights have waged an aggressive media campaign aimed at undermining their ownership and attracting support from the club 's phenomenal fan base .
Does n't look too bad for a $ 95 Android tablet , huh ?
Well , there 's plenty more where that came from .
Scattered along the main halls of CeBIT are dozens of Chinese and Taiwanese consumer electronics resellers looking to sell products to new customers , and this year they sure loaded up the suitcases with cheap Android / Windows CE tablets .
For the most part all these tablets ( or small smartbooks ) have ARM 9 or 11 processors and 5 to 7 - inch resistive touch displays .
While some like the FirstView PC607V tablet ( pictured above ) have attractive skins on top of Windows CE , others from companies like Forsa and Huawei have gone with stock versions of Android .
In truth , all of the ones we played with felt chintzy , but it was easier to lower our standards when we learned they would n't draw more than $ 150 from our wallets .
We 've got a hands - on video with FirstView 's Android tablet after the break , but if that does n't fill your cheap tablet needs hit the more coverage links for videos by some serious Android / ARM tablet lovers .
Once again Diego Forlan has broken the hearts of many British fans .
After knocking out Liverpool in the semi finals of the Europa Cup Diego Forlan was at it again today scoring two goals to give Atletico Madrid it ’s first major European trophy since 1962 .
Los Rojoblancos started the match strong and opened up with a 32nd minute goal from none other than Diego Forlan himself .
Troubled Fulham fans would be relieved as Simon Davies would equalize 5 minutes later on a nice volley from 6 yards out .
As the match went on it seemed that nothing could separate the two teams and there was just something that kept Fulham in this .
Throughout the season Fulham have made some amazing comebacks and have had great upsets .
A 3 - 0 victory against Manchester United , a 4 - 1 second leg victory over Juventus just to name a few .
The match would eventually move on to extra time , and it really seemed like the match would be heading into extra time .
This would all change after Sergio Aguero gave a nice chase of the ball and sent in a cross for Forlan to tap in again .
The match winner was his 24th goal in all competitions this season and has high hopes for this summer ’s World Cup .
Although many are celebrating Atletico ’s triumph in Germany , thousands across the globe were heart broken after the most deserving underdog were finished off in the dying minutes of extra time .
Roy Hodgson has really turned this London club around from battling relegation over a year ago , all the way to Europa League Final .
The manager had nothing but praise for his players saying , “ I do n’t have any word of criticism for the teams .
I thought the players were magnificent as usual and I think the fans will realise we did the best job we could possibly do . ”
Although Fulham fans wo n’t be seeing any European action next season , we can certainly expect them to finish off higher in the table and have domestic success in the FA and Carling cup next season .
Whether or not they win any of these trophies of course is a crapshoot , but Hodgson has certainly proved himself to be the best manager in the Premier League this season .
For now all Fulham fans can do is pray .

Jealousy among snails is a strange thing to witness
The laws of nature state that a bad thing cannot happen unless an equal and opposite good thing happens at the same time .
This has become known as the “ laws of balance and goodness reciprocity . ”
For this reason , if the military is causing bad things to happen on the other side of the world , then we will experience relatively better things on this side of the world .
Problem is that we have yet to figure out the exact location where the good thing will happen .
Its not an exact science by any stretch of the imagination , but at least the military is doing their part .

The image Microsoft does n't want you to see :
Too tired to stay awake , the Chinese workers earning just 34 p an hour
Showing Chinese sweatshop workers slumped over their desks with exhaustion , it is an image that Microsoft wo n't want the world to see .
Employed for gruelling 15 - hour shifts , in appalling conditions and 86 f heat , many fall asleep on their stations during their meagre ten - minute breaks .
For as little as 34 p an hour , the men and women work six or seven days a week , making computer mice and web cams for the American multinational computer company .
Worn out :
Some of the workers making computer accessories for Microsoft at a Chinese factory
This photo and others like it were smuggled out of the KYE Systems factory at Dongguan , China , as part of a three - year investigation by the National Labour Committee , a human rights organisation which campaigns for workers across the globe .
The mostly female workers , aged 18 to 25 , work from 7.45 am to 10.55 pm , sometimes with 1,000 workers crammed into one 105 ft by 105 ft room .
They are not allowed to talk or listen to music , are forced to eat substandard meals from the factory cafeterias , have no bathroom breaks during their shifts and must clean the toilets as discipline , according to the NLC .
The workers also sleep on site , in factory dormitories , with 14 workers to a room .
They must buy their own mattresses and bedding , or else sleep on 28 in - wide plywood boards .
They ' shower ' with a sponge and a bucket .
And many of the workers , because they are young women , are regularly sexually harassed , the NLC claimed .
The organisation said that one worker was even fined for losing his finger while operating a hole punch press .
Microsoft is not the only company to outsource manufacturing to KYE , but it accounts for about 30 per cent of the factory 's work , the NLC said .
Companies such as Hewlett - Packard , Samsung , Foxconn , Acer , Logitech and Asus also use KYE Systems .
Microsoft , which exports much of the hardware made at the factory to America , Europe and Japan , said that it is taking the claims seriously and has begun an investigation .
One employee told the NLC : ' We are like prisoners .
It seems like we live only to work - we do not work to live .
We do not live a life , only work . '
The NLC 's report included an account from one worker whose job consisted entirely of sticking selfadhesive rubber feet to the bottom of Microsoft computer mice .
But the monotony of sitting or standing for 12 hours , applying foot after foot to mouse after mouse , was not the worst of the worker 's testimony .
It was the militaristic management and sleep deprivation that affected the worker most .
' I know I can choose not to work overtime , but if I do n't work overtime then I am stuck with only 770 Chinese yuan ( £ 72.77 p ) per month in basic wages , ' the worker said .
' This is not nearly enough to support a family .
My parents are farmers without jobs .
They also do not have pensions .
' I also need to worry about getting married , which requires a lot of money .
Therefore , I still push myself to continue working in spite of my exhaustion .
' When I finish my four hours of overtime , I 'm extremely tired .
At that time , even if someone offered me an extravagant dinner , I 'd probably refuse .
I just want to sleep . '
Charles Kernaghan , executive director of the NLC , said : ' It sounded like torture - the frantic pace on the assembly line , same motion over and over for the 12 hours or more of work they did . '
Microsoft said it was committed to the ' fair treatment and safety of workers ' .
A spokesman added : ' We are aware of the NLC report and we have commenced an investigation .
This can't be right :
A powerful corporation making a risky decision that put costs ahead of environmental safety ?
That 's crazy talk !
About 11 hours before the Deepwater Horizon exploded , a disagreement took place between the top manager for oil giant BP PLC on the drilling rig and his counterpart for the rig's owner , Transocean Ltd. , concerning the final steps in shutting down the nearly completed well , according to a worker 's sworn statement .
Michael Williams , a Transocean employee who was chief electronics technician on the rig , said there was " confusion " between those high - ranking officials in an 11 a.m. meeting on the day of the rig blast , according to a sworn statement from Mr. Williams reviewed by The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Williams himself attended the meeting .
The confusion over the drilling plan in the final hours leading up to the explosion could be key to understanding the causes of the blowout and ultimately who was responsible .
What is known from drilling records and congressional testimony is that after the morning meeting , the crew began preparations to remove from the drill pipe heavy drilling " mud " that provides pressure to keep down any gas , and to replace this mud with lighter seawater .
Ultimately , the crew removed the mud before setting a final 300 - foot cement plug that is typically poured as a last safeguard to prevent combustible gas from rising to the surface .
Indeed , they never got the opportunity to set the plug .
[...]
Typically well owner BP would have final say , since it was paying roughly $ 1 million a day to lease the rig and pay for services from 12 companies that had people on the rig .
What is clear is that workers soon began displacing the mud .
Later that afternoon a pressure test provided ambiguous readings , a possible sign of gas seeping in , according to what Rep. Henry Waxman says a BP executive told House investigators .
Eventually , in the evening , after further tests , BP made a decision to carry forth in removing more drilling mud .
The rig blew about 10 p.m .
Preheat the barbecue .
I like to use a coal barbecue but gas barbecues work just as well .
I tend to cook the chicken skewers over a cool barbecue , so if you are planning to barbecue other food , then I would suggest that you cook the chicken skewers towards the end once the coals have cooled slightly .
Cut the chicken thighs into large ( 3–4 cm ) dice and set aside .
For the breadcrumb coating , put the breadcrumbs , parsley , oregano , lemon zest and Parmesan cheese in a bowl and mix together .
Set aside .
Put the butter and olive oil in a saucepan and heat gently until the butter is melted .
Remove from the heat and add the garlic , lemon juice and salt and pepper .
Dip each piece of chicken into the melted garlic butter , then roll in the breadcrumb mixture to coat completely , using your hands to press the breadcrumb mixture on firmly .
Lay the chicken pieces on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and leave to rest in the fridge for about 10 minutes .
Meanwhile , slice the courgettes lengthways into 2 mm - thick slices or long ribbons using a mandoline .
Wrap each piece of breadcrumbed chicken in a courgette ribbon and gently roll up .
Thread about 4 pieces of courgette - wrapped chicken on to each skewer ( use metal or soaked wooden skewers ) ; 1 skewer then makes a good portion .
Cook the chicken skewers over a cool barbecue for 18 – 20 minutes or until cooked all the way through and golden brown all over , turning them regularly .
Serve immediately with salads of your choice .
Cook ’s Notes
Use chicken breast fillets instead of chicken thighs , if you prefer , as the crumb and courgette coating protects the chicken and you will still retain the meat ’s moisture .
If you do n’t have a barbecue , this recipe works just as well if cooked in the oven .
Preheat the oven to 200 °C / Gas Mark 6 .
Place the chicken skewers on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and roast in the oven for 16 – 18 minutes or until cooked all the way through and golden brown all over , turning once .
I ’ve been playing around with the newest addition to Google Docs , Google Drawings , and I ’m quite liking it .
I tried drawing a few diagrams and even a wireframe , and it turns out the basic drawing interactions are just as good – in some cases even better – than what I ’m used to in Omnigraffle and Fireworks .
5 reasons Google Drawings beats Viso and Omnigraffle
We know the cloud computing arguments , and they certainly apply to wireframes
It ’s live .
The entire team can work on the same document and see each other ’s work instantly
The wireframes live in the cloud , no sending files around , no outdated documents
The risk of losing data is zero .
It saves for every edit you make
It ’s free Most people already have a Google account , so no sign up required
We need stencils
One thing was missing though : Stencils .
Omnigraffle has stencils coming out of its ears , and Fireworks has some excellent built - in ones .
But Google Drawings in its current early and simple form simply does n’t have it .
So I made one .
Leaving the stencils in the gutter
An interesting limitation is the fact that
there ’s no stencil library function and
you ca n’t easily copy and paste from one document to another .
One solution , it seems , is to clone one of the wireframe kits and thereby also cloning the stencils into each document .
To not print or export the stencils , I ’ve left them in the gutter area of the document .
Seems to work quite okay .
Kind of blue
I ’ve been wanting a blue kit since I left a project years ago where we used blue stencils ( the idea was Peter ‘s ) .
As you may have experienced , some customers simply do n’t understand wireframes .
The blue color gives that well - known blueprint feel , and should n’t prompt questions like “ I like it , does n’t it need a splash of colour ? ”
The templates
To make it even easier for you ( ehm , me ) I ’ve begun making simple starting point templates .

Rep. Darrell Issa has written a letter to the SEC demanding to know if the commission had any contact about the case , prior to its public release , with a variety of individuals .
GOP seeks SEC records on Goldman
Rep. Darrell Issa , the top Republican on the House Oversight committee , is demanding a slew of documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission , asserting that the timing of civil charges against Goldman Sachs raises “ serious questions about the commission ’s independence and impartiality . ”
Issa ’s letter , addressed to SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro and signed by eight other House Republicans , asks whether the commission had any contact about the case , prior to its public release , with White House aides , Democratic Party committee officials , or members of Congress or their staff .

“ [ W]e are concerned that politics have unduly influenced the decision and timing of the commission ’s controversial enforcement action against Goldman , ” Issa writes .
Issa implied that the timing was a bit too convenient , saying President Barack Obama ’s push on Wall Street reform “ neatly coincided with the commission ’s announcement of the suit . ”
SEC spokesman John Nester said : “ We will respond as appropriate to the letter , but the Commission does n't coordinate its enforcement actions with the White House , Congress , or political committees .
Regulatory reform has been pending for the past year .
We have brought many cases related to the financial crisis over that period and we will not let the reform debate deter us from bringing new ones . ”
The letter is also signed by Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio , Jason Chaffetz of Utah , Patrick McHenry of North Carolina , Dan Burton of Indiana , John Mica of Florida , Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri , Aaron Schock of Illinois and Anh “ Joseph ” Cao of Louisiana .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs has dismissed the connection Issa was trying to make .
“ The SEC does n’t notify the White House of its enforcement actions and certainly did n’t do so in this case , " Gibbs said Monday .
" [ I ] t ’s not as if the president began talking about financial reform sometime on Friday afternoon . ”
And White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel told Charlie Rose on Monday : “ [ E]verybody at the White House found out like everybody else , when it hit the news .
…
Nobody at the White House knew anything ahead of anybody else . …
I think what 's more important is not this particular case or what SEC did .
The need for this reform has existed for over a year . ”
The 1,000 - word letter , with 11 footnotes , also demands that the SEC “ identify all known communications by any commission employee or employees with The New York Times or other news outlets prior to the commission ’s public announcement of the suit .
If you are unaware of any such communications , please certify as such and explain what steps the commission has taken to identify any individual (s ) who may have engaged in unauthorized disclosure of information . ”
“ The Goldman litigation … has been widely cited by Democrats in support of the financial regulatory legislation currently before the United States Senate , ” Issa writes .
“ The American people have a right to know whether the commission , or any of its officers or employees , may have violated federal law by using the resources of an independent regulatory agency to promote a partisan political agenda .
… “ [ T ] he events of the past five days have fueled legitimate suspicion on the part of the American people that the commission has attempted to assist the White House , the Democratic Party , and Congressional Democrats by timing the suit to coincide with the Senate ’s consideration of financial regulatory legislation , or by providing Democrats with advance notice . ”
Here is the text of the letter :
April 20 , 2010
The Honorable Mary Schapiro
Chairman
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
00 F Street Northeast
Washington , D.C. 20549
Dear Chairman Schapiro :
The timing of the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s ( the “ Commission ” ) filing of a civil securities fraud action against Goldman Sachs & Co. ( “ Goldman ” ) has created serious questions about the Commission ’s independence and impartiality .
The Goldman litigation – filed by the Commission on Friday , April 16 , 2010 – has been widely cited by Democrats in support of the financial regulatory legislation currently before the United States Senate .
We are writing to request that you provide documents and information to this Committee regarding any sort of prearrangement , coordination , direction from , or advance notice provided by the Commission to the Administration or Congressional Democrats regarding last Friday ’s filing against Goldman .
The American people have a right to know whether the Commission , or any of its officers or employees , may have violated federal law by using the resources of an independent regulatory agency to promote a partisan political agenda .
The Commission ’s canons of ethics require its members to “ reject any effort by representatives of the executive or legislative branches of the government to affect their independent determination of any matter being considered by the Commission . ”
Moreover , the Commission is prohibited from using its resources to influence the passage of legislation .
Nevertheless , the events of the past five days have fueled legitimate suspicion on the part of the American people that the Commission has attempted to assist the White House , the Democratic Party , and Congressional Democrats by timing the suit to coincide with the Senate ’s consideration of financial regulatory legislation , or by providing Democrats with advance notice .
In fact , the aggressive campaign by Democrats in support of the legislation neatly coincided with the Commission ’s announcement of the suit .
For example :
-- The Commission approved the Goldman suit in a vote that spit along party lines – a rare occurrence for approvals of enforcement litigation .
-- Before the Commission had released its announcement , the New York Times published on its website a story describing the suit .
-- Less than half an hour after the Times story ’s publication , Organizing for America , the successor organization to Obama for America and now a project of the Democratic National Committee ( “ DNC ” ) , sent millions of supporters an e-mail message from President Obama urging support for “ Wall Street Reform . ”
-- Within hours , the Democratic National Committee had purchased AdWords advertising from Google , Inc .
The DNC ’s Google campaign fundraising advertisement , headed “ Fight Wall Street Greed , ” appeared whenever a user ran a Google search for the phrase “ Goldman Sachs SEC . ”
It read , “ Help Pres. Obama Reform Wall Street and Create Jobs .
Families First ! ” and included a link to www.BarackObama.com, the website of Organizing for America .
-- Democrats in Congress and the Administration have heralded the Commission ’s suit against Goldman as a welcome boost to their case for the legislation .
-- Members of the media have already begun to question the timing of the Commission ’s suit and the actions of the Democratic National Committee .
As supported by the Commission ’s canons of ethics , and as frequently reiterated by you and other Commissioners , the unqualified independence of financial regulators is crucial to the health of the financial system and the U.S. economy .
For this reason , doubts about whether the Commission has scrupulously guarded its independence from the Administration ’s partisan political agenda and concerted efforts to manipulate Congressional action are very serious , and should be addressed with full transparency .
The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is the principal oversight committee in the House of Representatives and has broad oversight jurisdiction as set forth in House Rule X .
In light of the circumstances described above , and the need for the Commission to avoid even the appearance of bias , please provide the following records and information as soon as possible , but in no case later than 5 pm EST on Tuesday , April 27 , 2010 :
State whether any Commissioner or Commission employee communicated regarding the Commission ’s suit against Goldman , prior to the public announcement of the suit on April 16 , 2010 , with any of the following :
-- Any employee of the Executive Office of the President ;
-- Any employee of the Democratic National Committee or Organizing for America ;
-- Any employee of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee ;
-- Any employee of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ; or
-- Any Member of the Senate or the House of Representatives , or any employee of the Senate or the House of Representatives .
Identify every person who sent or received any communication described in request no .
1 .
Identify all known communications by any Commission employee or employees with The New York Times or other news outlets prior to the Commission ’s public announcement of the suit .
If you are unaware of any such communications , please certify as such and explain what steps the Commission has taken to identify any individual (s ) who may have engaged in unauthorized disclosure of information .
State whether Commission Chief of Staff Didem Nisanci or Senior Adviser Kayla Gillan engaged in any communication with any individual in the subcategories listed in request no .
1 between March 1 , 2010 , and the present , and identify any other member of the Chairman ’s staff who engaged in any such communication .
Provide all records and communications referring or relating to the communications described in requests nos .
1 , 3 , and 4 .
For purposes of responding to this request , the terms “ records , ” “ communications , ” and “ referring or relating ” should be interpreted consistently with the attached Definitions of Terms .
In requesting records and information relating to the Commission ’s suit against Goldman , We make no judgment regarding the suit ’s legal merit .
However , we are concerned that politics have unduly influenced the decision and timing of the Commission ’s controversial enforcement action against Goldman .
The American people have a right to know whether the Commission , or any of its officers or employees , have attempted to use their positions to help President Obama and Congressional Democrats pursue their legislative agenda and seek victory in the 2010 Congressional elections .
If , however , the appearance of coordination between the Commission ’s Goldman suit and Democrats ’ partisan activities is merely the result of coincidence and extraordinarily fast political reflexes , disclosure should offer the commission the best opportunity to address outstanding concerns .
In either case , we look forward to your timely production of records and information in response to this letter .
If you have any questions regarding this request , please contact Christopher Hixon with the Committee staff at [ redacted by POLITICO ] .
Sincerely ,
Darrell Issa

Equipped with ropes and his bare hands , Bry Loyst spent Tuesday traversing a shallow , murky pond in Confederation Park searching for an elusive crocodile or alligator .
After several hours , the daytime search was called off in favour of a nighttime search , where Loyst ’s crew and Hamilton Conservation Authority staff hoped to spot the reptile ’s eyes that glow when flashed with light .
But , after nearly another hour Tuesday night , no such luck .
The pond leads into the Red Hill Creek , which leads into the Windermere Basin and eventually Lake Ontario — though that would be quite the journey for a cold , scared reptile , experts said .
Loyst , curator of the Indian River Reptile Zoo near Peterborough , was called in to find the crocodilian species after local birder Tom Badeau discovered the reptile and sent a photo to the authority Monday .
The distant photo shows what looks like a small gator poking its head out of the water .
Despite no sightings
Tuesday , Loyst said he is quite sure based on the photo and a far - away sighting Monday it is one of 23 crocodile or alligator species .
But he and authority searchers were satisfied after Tuesday night ’s effort it is no longer in the area .
No further searches are planned unless there are new sightings .
The animal must have been released from captivity , he said , adding that , unfortunately , people who keep reptiles as pets often release them when they get too big .
And , though he cautioned the public to stay away from the suspected gator if spotted , he said there is no serious public risk .
The greater concern is the survival of the reptile .
Crocodilian species do not eat in temperatures below 18 C and the cold temperatures make them slow , Loyst said .
They can survive a year without food , but cannot survive winter temperatures .
Conservation authority assistant ecologist Lisa Jennings said it ’s hard to say how often animals are dumped into local ecosystems since offenders are rarely caught .
Last year , the spawn of illegally dumped goldfish had to be removed from ponds in the Dundas Valley because they ate the eggs of endangered Jefferson salamanders and other native amphibians .
In the same pond where crews searched for the gator , there was also an exotic turtle species — a red ear slider — that had to have been dumped , Jennings said .
“ Education is No. 1 when it comes to owning exotic species , ” she said .
“ Take it too a zoo , the SPCA , where you purchased it . ”
The Confederation Park pond is also home to many birds , carp — which could be seen spawning in the shallow water — and turtles , including snapping turtles , a “ species of concern ” under the Endangered Species Act .
But a gator would be of no threat to them .
Animal control bylaws vary among the former municipalities that amalgamated into Hamilton , said city spokesperson Debbie Spence .
A “ gator - type ” animal is prohibited in the city , Dundas and Stoney Creek , but falls under the zoning bylaw in Ancaster and Flamborough .
Exemptions include pet stores , veterinary clinics and , in some areas , educational or display purposes .
Paul Kennedy , The Reptile Man , and owner of The Reptile Store on King Street East , said it ’s a shame a few reptile owners ruin things for the responsible ones .
He has a 61/ 2 - foot caiman and a seven - foot alligator that he uses for educational purposes in his store .
Knowing how big these reptiles can get , he built large cages and keeps the water between 27 C and 32 C .

During the early years of his business , which has been open 11 years , Kennedy said he sold some crocodilians and some people brought them back when they got too big .
He said fear over gator or croc attacks is often overblown .
“ I ’d rather take a big alligator out of someone ’s yard than a big dog , ” he said .
Great piece of reporting by Josh Nathan - Kazis at the Forward , on how the Israel lobby beat back divestment at Berkeley last week .
In the two weeks prior [ to April 14 vote ] , Berkeley Hillel coordinated a comprehensive national lobbying campaign consisting of a teach - in , face - to - face meetings with student senators and an intervention by a Nobel laureate , all aimed at robbing the divestment supporters of three senate votes .
Adam Naftalin - Kelman , the Hillel ’s newly installed executive director , said that the strategy for countering divestment efforts was devised at a roundtable meeting convened by Hillel and attended by representatives of local branches of the Anti-Defamation League , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , the Jewish Community Relations Council , J Street , Israel ’s consul general in San Francisco and local rabbis .
Outmaneuvering the pro-divestment supporters , this organizing coup appears to have worked :
After a marathon debate that lasted well into the next morning , two senators changed their minds and one abstained , and the veto was upheld .
“ Three votes changed , ” Akiva Tor , the consul general , told the Forward .
“ So something happened . ” …
The Hillel - organized teach - in , open exclusively to members of the student senate , featured talks by the consul general , an Israeli visiting professor , a professor of international law and others .
Seven senators attended .
One , a co-sponsor of the bill who did not change her vote , said that the presenters were respectful but she felt uncomfortable .
“ There were undertones of intimidation to me , ” Emily Carlton said .
“ For one thing , they were all a lot older , they were all a lot more distinguished . ”
Which Countries Are the Most Pro-American ?
Back in 2007 , then - candidate Barack Obama - writing in the pages of Foreign Affairs on America 's role in the world - promised that " the American moment is not over , " but that it " must be seized anew . "
Obama guaranteed , upon election , to begin that global renewal his first day in office .
We decided to put his words to the test .
Nearly two years later , RealClearWorld has teamed with Gallup to find out how the president has done abroad .
Using Gallup 's global survey data on ratings of U.S. leadership , we discovered that one region appears to be more supportive of American leadership abroad than all the others , and that region is Sub - Saharan Africa .

A Catholic nun and longtime administrator of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix was reassigned in the wake of a decision to allow a pregnancy to be ended in order to save the life of a critically ill patient .
The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted , head of the Phoenix Diocese , who indicated the woman was " automatically excommunicated " because of the action .
Neither the hospital nor the bishop 's office would address whether the bishop had a direct role in her demotion .
He does not have control of the hospital as a business but is the voice of moral authority over any Catholic institution operating in the diocese .
The actions involving the administrator , mostly taken within the past couple of weeks , followed a last - minute , life - or - death drama in late 2009 .
The patient had a rare and often fatal condition in which a pregnancy can cause the death of the mother .
Sister Margaret McBride , who had been vice president of mission integration at the hospital , was on call as a member of the hospital 's ethics committee when the surgery took place , hospital officials said .
She was part of a group of people , including the patient and doctors , who decided upon the course of action .
The patient was not identified , and details of her case cannot be revealed under federal privacy laws .
The Catholic Church forbids abortion in all circumstances and allows the termination of a pregnancy only as a secondary effect of other treatments , such as radiation of a cancerous uterus .
The hospital defended the ethics committee 's decision .
In a statement , Suzanne Pfister , a hospital vice president , said that the facility adheres to the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services but that the directives do not answer all questions .
" In this tragic case , the treatment necessary to save the mother 's life required the termination of an 11 - week pregnancy , " Pfister said .
Pfister issued the four - paragraph statement on behalf of the hospital , its parent company Catholic Healthcare West , and the Sisters of Mercy , McBride 's religious order .
McBride was part of the discussion about the surgery , described as urgent .
It involved a serious illness , pulmonary hypertension .
The condition limits the ability of the heart and lungs to function and is made worse , possibly even fatal , by pregnancy .
In a statement issued to The Republic late Friday , the diocese confirmed that Olmsted learned of the case after the surgery .
" I am gravely concerned by the fact that an abortion was performed several months ago in a Catholic hospital in this diocese , " Olmsted said .
" I am further concerned by the hospital 's statement that the termination of a human life was necessary to treat the mother 's underlying medical condition .
" An unborn child is not a disease .
While medical professionals should certainly try to save a pregnant mother 's life , the means by which they do it can never be by directly killing her unborn child .
The end does not justify the means . "
Olmsted added that if a Catholic " formally cooperates " in an abortion , he or she is automatically excommunicated .
Excommunication forbids the person from participating in church life .
Remedies are available through an appeal to the Vatican or confession .
" The Catholic Church will continue to defend life and proclaim the evil of abortion without compromise , and must act to correct even her own members if they fail in this duty , " the bishop said .
It is unknown whether the bishop took action against the others who were involved in the matter , and Pfister would not answer questions about the physicians involved in the surgery .
Neither Olmsted nor his spokesman at the Phoenix Diocese would answer additional questions .
Although Olmsted does not have direct control of the hospital , his authority as bishop over Catholic institutions is substantial .
For one thing , religious orders work in the Valley at his invitation .
In an e-mail , Pfister said McBride has been transferred " to another position in the hospital to focus on a number of new strategic initiatives . "
According to the medical directives that the hospital follows , abortion is defined as the directly intended termination of pregnancy , and it is not permitted under any circumstances - even to save the life of the mother .
On the other hand , a second directive says that " operations , treatments and medications that have as their direct purpose the cure of a proportionately serious pathological condition of a pregnant woman are permitted . . . even if they will result in the death of the unborn child . "
A letter sent Monday from Catholic Healthcare West , signed by Sister Judith Carle , board chairwoman , and President and CEO Lloyd Dean , asks Olmsted to provide further clarification about the directives .
Agreeing that in a healthy mother , pregnancy is " not a pathology , " it says this case was different .
The pregnancy , the letter says , carried a nearly certain risk of death for the mother .
" If there had been a way to save the pregnancy and still prevent the death of the mother , we would have done it , " the letter says .
" We are convinced there was not . "
James J. Walter , professor of bioethics at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles , a Catholic university , said a pregnancy may be terminated only in limited , indirect circumstances , such as uterine cancer , in which the cancer treatment takes the life of the fetus .
Catholic teaching , he said , is that a pregnancy cannot be terminated as a means to an end of saving the life of a mother who is suffering from a different condition .
Asked if the church position prefers the mother and child to die , rather than sparing the life of one of them , Walters said the hope is that both would survive .
Not all faith groups see things the same way .
The Jewish tradition , the Mormon Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America are among the groups that frown on abortion on demand but permit it when the life of the mother is at stake or if the mother is impregnated by rape or incest .
McBride declined to be interviewed .
She was the highest - ranking member of the Sisters of Mercy at the hospital , which the order founded in 1895 .
ABC Radio National ’s Science Show has a fantastic short segment on the ‘ unskilled and unaware of it ’ effect , also known as the Dunning - Kruger effect , where people with low levels of ability in a certain field vastly over - rate their talents because they lack the skills to judge their own competence .
It is my second favourite cognitive bias in psychology ( after Emily Pronin ’s discovery of the ‘ bias blind spot ‘ ) and the study also demonstrated the paradoxical effect whereby improving people ’s skills reduced their self - assessment as they also learned to judge their ability level more accurately .
The segment in the science show is a wonderfully concise guide to the effect and start with the same wonderful story of the lemon juice covered bank - robber as the scientific paper .

A recent study suggests that video game players could have the power to alter their nightmares , turning the tide on the things that go bump in our subconscious minds .
We are the Dream Warriors .

Jayne Gackenbach , a psychologist at Grant MacEwan University in Canada , thinks that gamers might have the power to alter their dreams .
Gackenbach 's main area of study used to be lucid dreams - dreams where the dreamer watches from outside of their own body .
3rd-person dreams , if you will .

Her studies veered towards video games in the 90's , after she watched her son repeatedly kiss the box of a new Nintendo console on the way home from the store .
Something that makes perfect sense to any gamer seemed strange to an outsider , and so she shifted her studies to incorporate gaming , perhaps as a way to cope with her son kissing cardboard boxes .
As she studied past research on video games , Gackenbach began to see parallels between lucid dreamers and gamers .
Both groups have better spatial skills , for instance , and are better at coping with motion sickness .
Both are able to achieve high levels of concentration and focus .

Both lucid dreams and video games are forms of alternate realities , though one is the result of a biological process and the other technological .
" If you 're spending hours a day in a virtual reality , if nothing else it 's practice , " said Gackenbach ...
" Gamers are used to controlling their game environments , so that can translate into dreams . "

Gackenbach further explored the relationship between lucid dreams and video games in a series of two studies published in 2006 .
The first surveyed a group of hardcore gamers and a group of non-gamers , with results suggesting that frequent gamers were more likely to have lucid dreams than non-gamers .
Furthermore , the dreaming gamers evidenced dream control , the power to actively influence their dream worlds .
The power to control dreams !
The second study , conducted to narrow down information from the first , showed that while gamers did have control over their dream worlds , the control was limited to their dream selves , as if controlling a video game character .

They also tend to flip between first and third - person view .
If gamers could control dreams , what about nightmares ?
Gackenbach explored that question with a new study in 2008 .
Using a group of 35 males and 63 females , she studied threat levels gleaned from after - dream reports .
The results indicated that not only gamers experienced lower threat levels in their dreams , they also experienced reverse threat simulation , where the dreamer turns the tide of the nightmare , becoming an even bigger threat .
" What happens with gamers is that something inexplicable happens , " Gackenbach explained .
" They do n't run away , they turn and fight back .
They 're more aggressive than the norms . "
Advertisement
In our dreams we are fearless .
In our dreams we are also particularly brutal , unafraid to bring a little bit of the old ultra-violence to bear against the nightmare nasties .
" If you look at the actual overall amount of aggression , gamers have less aggression in dreams , " Gackenbach said .
" But when they 're aggressive , oh boy , they go off the top . "

See ?
We 're totally dream warriors .
Gackenbach hopes to use the information she 's gleaned from studying gamers ' reactions to nightmares to see if she can apply it to victims of post - traumatic stress disorder , a symptom of which is usually terrifying dreams .
Could video games help control PTSD ?
That 's what she aims to find out .

She 's also studying the effect violent games have on dreams , based on ratings given by the ESRB .
Whatever her results show , I 'm sure the video game dream warriors will be able to handle whatever their subconscious doles out .

They must be kidding .
To break up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the dispersants Corexit 9500 and Corexit 9527 are used by the hundreds of thousands of gallons .
Right into the ecosystem of the Gulf .
But what is it they use ?
As ProPublica reported Monday , information about dispersants is “ kept secret under competitive trade laws . ”
I ’ve spent the last several days trying to confirm what many in the ocean - ecology and public health worlds seemed to know , but no one would say officially : that two different dispersants sold under the banner of Corexit were being used in vast quantities .
The Corexit brand is owned by an Illinois - based company called Nalco , which entered the dispersant business back in 1994 , when it merged with Exxon ’s chemical unit .
( By 2004 , Exxon had divested and Nalco was a standalone company , according to Nalco ’s company history . ) [… ]
So , what ’s in the stuff ?
According to their data sheets , both 9500 and 9527 are composed of three potentially hazardous substances .
They share two in common , organic sulfonic acid salt and propylene glycol .
In addition to those two , Corexit 9500 contains something called “ Distillates , petroleum , hydrotreated light , ” while Corexit 9527 contains 2 - Butoxyethanol .
Frustratingly , the sheets do n’t give exact information about how much of the substances are in the dispersants ; instead they give ranges as a percentage of weight .
For example , Corexit 9500 can be composed of anywhere from 10 to 30 percent petroleum distillates , while 2 - Butoxyethanol makes up anywhere from 30 to 60 percent of 9527 .

Protected under competitive trade laws ?
My foot , they are dumping it in our ecosystem the more the better and do n’t even have to let us know what ’s in it ?
I know , you can already hear me shout : “ Regulation ! ”
There would be an alternative chemical , I seriously doubt that it is really environmentally friendly , but obviously it ’s use was n’t even considered properly .
Called Dispersit , it ’s manufactured by the U.S. Polychemical Corporation and has been approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency .
Both Corexit and Dispersit were tested by the EPA , and according to those results , Corexit was 54.7 percent effective at breaking down crude oil from the Gulf , and Dispersit was 100 percent effective .
Not only did Corexit do a worse job of dispersing oil , but it was three times as lethal to silverfish – used as a benchmark organism in toxicity testing — and more than twice as lethal to shrimp , another benchmark organism and an important part of Gulf fisheries . [… ]
Relief agencies were not immediately available for comment about Dispersit .
In a Tuesday press conference , Charlie Henry , the scientific support coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said the potential effects of Corexit ’s use in the Gulf are unknown .
“ Those analyses are going on , but right now there ’s no consensus , ” he said .
“ And we ’re just really getting started .
You can imagine it ’s something we ’ve never thought about . ” ( read more )
Never thought about it ?
Figures .
You can find more information on the toxicity of Corexit here , here and here .
It is all just a matter of “ Now you see me , now you do n’t . ”

“ There ’s a great deal of freedom here to do what we want , ” said Yaneth Rivas , 27 , a member of the same street - art brigade as Mr. Zerpa , called the Communications Liberation Army .
Her work , mainly posters placed at bus stops , is more nuanced than Mr. Zerpa ’s .
She explores , for instance , the polarization of Venezuelan society in one image showing two policemen from different districts of Caracas pointing guns at each other .
Their groups , together with other street - art brigades , were created over the past year or so by the Ministry of Communes .
Some groups remain part of the ministry , like Guerrilla Communications , which offers graffiti and stencil workshops around the city .
Others , like Communications Liberation Army , operate somewhat autonomously but still get material like spray paint from the government .

“ These groups share the objective of reclaiming public space and turning it into a kind of street periodical that can be constantly renewed and painted over to get their message out , ” said Sujatha Fernandes , a sociologist at Queens College in New York who has written a book on urban social movements in Venezuela .
Not everyone putting up images on walls here draws support from the government .
Saúl Guerrero , a stencil painter who ranks among the city ’s most prolific street artists , has painted dozens of melancholic portraits of people around the eastern districts of Caracas , signing them with the nom - de - plume “ Ergo . ”
Mr. Guerrero , 29 , an anthropologist and aid worker who spends part of the year in Africa , opted to forego sharp political statements for simple portraits , often of young Africans or of worn - out faces that reflect a life of destitution .
He painted dozens of them on walls and telephone boxes in Chacao , a relatively prosperous municipality here .
“ The F.B.I. said that Jerry was at the driver ’s side of the van in the back , talking to the two officers peaceably , and that 16 - year - old Joe comes out guns ablazing , ” she said in a telephone interview on Sunday from her home in Clearwater , Fla .
F.B.I. officials declined to confirm that report , and Ms. Wray questioned why no videotape of the shooting had been released .

When the police caught up to the van 90 minutes later , the father and son began shooting as soon as Sheriff Dick Busby of Crittenden County and a deputy pulled up , said Mr. Busby , who was shot in the shoulder .
“ The driver jumped out with a high - powered rifle , and the other got out on the right side , ” he said .
“ They both started at the same time . ”
Mr. Kane was the son of a security guard .
Right after graduating from high school , he made the first of three unsuccessful races for the City Commission in Springfield , according to The Springfield News - Sun .
His campaign ended when he was arrested on charges that he had stolen beer from a railroad boxcar , The News - Sun reported .
He became a trucker , joining an industry that is dominant here , and married a nurse , Hope Drummond .
In 1993 , they had Joseph , and two years later , they had a daughter , Candy , who died as an infant , Ms. Wray said .
Candy ’s death , attributed to sudden infant death syndrome , became a defining moment for Mr. Kane , Ms. Wray said , when his lawyer told him he had to allow an autopsy even though he objected .
“ He could n’t comprehend how a corporation could have more rights than a father , ” she said .
“ That ’s where he started asking questions . ”
In recent years , Mr. Kane repeatedly attracted the attention of the Springfield authorities .
In 2003 , he tried to buy property at a sheriff ’s sale in exchange for an I.O.U. , Sheriff Kelly recalled .
In 2004 , he was charged with assault after he shot a passing teenager in the leg with a pellet or BB gun without provocation , according to a police affidavit that said he had a “ mental history . ”
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
An 89 - year - old Cleveland man was arraigned on six counts each of rape , kidnapping and gross sexual imposition in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Thursday .
Jolly B. Smith pleaded not guilty to all 18 counts .
Smith is accused of molesting a 32 - year - old developmentally disabled woman that he befriended .
The victim said that the abuse started in June 2009 and continued until March of this year .
Police learned of the abuse when they were called to the Cuyahoga County Board of Developmental Disabilities Center .
Smith 's bond was set at $ 10,000 .
He has been ordered to take an HIV test and to stay away from the victim .
Smith has posted his bond and is set to appear in court for a pre-trial hearing May 19 at 9 a.m. , four days before his 90th birthday .
I 've remained a barista at heart , even as my knowledge and duties have expanded to coffee tasting , green coffee analysis , and teaching at illy 's Università del Caffè .
One of my biggest honors was winning the title of Italian Barista Champion a few years ago .
For baristas , training is everything , and teaching my craft is my favorite thing to do .
Too often , those who drink or prepare coffee , even so - called " experts , " do n't pay attention to what they are doing , which is why illy asked me to spend all of 2010 in the U.S. , to educate both coffee lovers and professionals .

The American reality , a need for more training , was not a surprise for me .
But what I did n't expect were so many baristas using so many methods to prepare espresso , far from the authentic Italian technique .
Once you stray from the formula that international associations agree on , espresso is no longer espresso .
The biggest mistake I 've seen is an enormous quantity of coffee being used — way too much .
I 'm talking about 20 to 25 grams of coffee for a single espresso shot !
It is like making a mojito with half a mint leaf , one ice cube , a few grains of sugar , and a gallon of rum .
Undrinkable !
Espresso made this way — well , it 's not espresso , but I 'll call it that — turns out overly concentrated , and because of that it cannot delight the drinker with the magnificent aromas of toasted bread , chocolate , red fruit , orange , and jasmine flowers that are all present in a high - quality blend .
The beverages I tasted were almost syrups , full - bodied but with a very sour , almost salty taste .
I suspect that beans that were roasted too recently played a part .
After roasting , beans need a few days to breathe and mature .
These too - young beans are a big problem .
Also , I 've visited too many coffee bars that do n't heat cups before serving , and in the process sacrifice flavor and aroma .
Or that serve in wet cups , an espresso sin .
An espresso , a real one , requires seven to eight grams of freshly ground coffee roasted two to three days in advance , or preserved using pressurization .
The water can't be too soft , and must not exceed 200 degrees F to avoid burning , nor be lower than 190 F in order to extract all the best aromatic components .
The grind is also fundamental .
A too - fine grind can create burnt coffee and extract unpleasantly bitter and woody flavors .
This is why so many people describe espresso's taste as " bitter . "
An overly coarse grind does n't permit full extraction of certain key elements .
The proper , medium grind permits extraction of one ounce of aromatic black liquid in 25 to 30 seconds , the ideal amount of time .
If all these variables are respected ( amount of coffee , temperature , time , and volume ) , along with the right pressure ( around nine atmospheric units or 130 psi ) , you get an opaque , perfumed liquid containing microscopic oil droplets releasing precious coffee aroma , set fully free on your taste buds .
illy
A silky , persistent foam ( " crema " ) will appear on top , nut brown with red stripes , protecting the liquid underneath for a few minutes — just enough time to hold that ceramic cup in hand , feel the warmth , move it to the lips , and sense those freed aromas in the mouth , where they will combine to create a unique taste experience .
Otherwise known as espresso .
A real espresso .

Nicola Marzovilla runs a business , so when a client at his Gramercy Park restaurant , I Trulli , asks for a children ’s menu , he does not say what he really thinks .
What he says is , “ I ’m sure we can find something on the menu your child will like . ”
What he thinks is , “ Children ’s menus are the death of civilization . ”
Parents have so come to expect the safe fare ( and cheaper prices ) of a children ’s menu that Fornino , a pizza restaurant in Park Slope , nearly faced a boycott when it opened earlier this month without one .
But Mr. Marzovilla has never had one and swears he never will .
Easy for him to say :
He ’s not in nurture - happy Park Slope , and maybe expectations are different at a restaurant where a plate of handmade pasta costs $ 24 .
But even if he were running a pizza joint , he would never offer children what he considers a “ dumbed down ” menu on the side .
Mr. Marzovilla welcomes young children at his restaurant , even discounts their meals on Sunday evenings , and is not above serving a simple appetizer portion of pasta to please little ones .
But he has strong opinions about food , and about the messages parents convey to their offspring through what they eat .
Children ’s menus aim too low , he argues — they ’re a parenting crutch .
“ The table is very important , ” Mr. Marzovilla explained as we sat around one at his restaurant early Sunday evening with our five collective children .
“ It ’s about nutrition , it ’s about family ; you go right down the line .
And the children ’s menu is about the opposite — it ’s about making it quick , making it easy , and moving on . ”

The next - millenium - set animated comedy is returning to the air after being dropped by Fox in 2003 .
( Twenty six new episodes of the show will be unveiled on Comedy Central ; the first half of season 6 kicks off June 24 . )
EW.com checked in with executive producer David X. Cohen to find out what he and series creator , Matt Groening , have in store for us .
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY :
One cancellation and four direct - to - DVD movies later , you ’re on the air again .
That was some journey .
How surprised are you to be back ?
DAVID X. COHEN : I would say it ’s just sinking in now .
This journey started seven years ago with a call from Fox that we were off the air — which was n’t a big difference from being on the air , actually , the way we were being shown sporadically at that time .
So we packed our bags and went our separate ways and had no expectation of coming back in any form at that time .
And it really took the high ratings [ of reruns ] on Adult Swim to plant any kind of a seed that there might be more life in this thing .
And , gradually , the idea of the DVD movies filtered through to 20th Century Fox Television [ which produces the show ] , and they called us up a few years after that idea was sent to them and we started our return to life that way .
We did four DVD movies and our hopes started to rise because of what Family Guy had done .
They had gone a similar route and come back to TV , so we kept our fingers crossed and waited for the results from those DVDs and evidently they did okay . …
We ’re grateful to be here and we were definitely saved by our fans ’ enthusiasm .
Now that Futurama is on cable , will the tone of the show be any different ?
We ’re definitely not going way outside of the lines of what we ’ve done before .
My main priority is to make it feel like this is the same Futurama , and if you ’re a Futurama fan you ’re going to like these episodes .
That said , I think there are a couple of episodes where we do push that edge a little bit , thanks to our being on Comedy Central — nothing that could n’t have run the first time , but perhaps the quantity of borderline material is a little higher .
For example , we have an episode that was Matt Groening ’s brainchild , with Zapp Brannigan and Leela getting stranded on a Garden of Eden planet .
Matt wanted to do a story based on this science - fiction trope where man and woman land on a planet and at the end of the episode you realize that they ’re Adam and Eve and they ’re going to recreate society .
But he wanted to do that at the starting point of the episode , so we have Zapp and Leela stranded on this beautiful Garden of Eden planet and they ’re naked and wearing fig leaves immediately .
It ’s a little more cartoon flesh than we would have shown in the old days .
During a contract negotiation impasse last year , there was a possibility that the voice actors were going to be recast .
How close did that come to actually happening ?
Matt Groening and I tried to stay clear of that as much as possible , since we have to try to make both sides happy in that equation .
We have a contract with [ the studio ] on one hand to make these episodes , and on the other hand , I think our cast is the best voice cast you ’re going to find , and I would have been very upset if we had to do the show without them .
We just said to everybody involved , “ Please , you guys make a deal . ”
It went right up to the edge as The Simpsons has done a couple of times with Fox beginning the process of recasting the show , but nobody else was actually hired .
I think it was ultimately just business — both sides are trying to make the best deal and that causes it to come to a climax .
Just to reassure everybody , every single cast member is back .
We did not lose a single voice .
What can we expect from this season ?
Last time we saw the gang in Into the Wild Green Yonder , Fry and Leela were engaged in a kiss as the ship headed into a wormhole … .
Matt and I decided to make sure people knew right away that this was Futurama in its classic half - hour form .
We wanted to quickly establish in the first episode that the characters are back from their DVD adventures .
Fry and Leela return relatively quickly .
Very quickly we get back to the Planet Express headquarters in New New York City — and the only slight hitch is that everybody is dead .
That ’s quite a little hitch .
One of the few images that we ’ve released so far is all of their skeletons hanging over the stem cell vat .
[ Laughs ]
In Futurama , that ’s a minor stumbling block … .
That episode is entitled “ Rebirth . ”
We ’ll get to see the Professor ’s birthing machine and all the glory of artificial rebirth .
It ’s both a literal and figurative rebirth of the series .
Fry and Leela ’s relationship has a very bizarre science - fiction twist to it .
Are they going to pursue a relationship ?
We do n’t want to get into a rut where they ’re having a baby and moving away to the suburbs .
That would mess up the show to some degree .
Without giving too much away , to have their relationship be on - again , off - again is a little more exciting for the ongoing drama of the series .
Can you tease some other story lines ?
One thing that was beneficial to being off the air for a while was that society generated a few story lines for us .
We ’re going to see our versions of Twitter and iPhones in the future , as Fry posts embarrassing videos of Leela online .
The difference is , in our version of the iPhone , the iPhone is implanted in your eye .
It ’s a tiny hovering screen in front of you and it ’s even more annoying than the real iPhone .
One of my favorite episodes of the year is one where Bender tries to pass a ballot initiative called Proposition Infinity to legalize robosexual marriage , which is the marriage between a robot and a human .
It ’s taboo and illegal in the future , and there ’s going to be a very shocking romance between Bender and one of our female characters .
[ In another episode ] , the Professor invents a time machine that only goes forward in time .
Once they start going , there is no hope of return .
And the initial goal is to just go a minute forward into the future and test it out , but the Professor trips and they ’re immediately 1,000 years in the future with nowhere to go but forward .
So they spend the episode going further and further through all future history trying to find the technology for a backward time machine .
Guest voices ?
Katee Sackhoff is playing a visitor to Comic - Con who has a fetish for aliens .
She threw herself into the role in an impressive fashion .
In our 100th episode special , Mark Mothersbaugh and Devo campaign for mutant rights — Leela ’s parents are second - class , mutant citizens who live underground in the sewers .
The members of Devo have mutated over the years , and Mark Mothersbaugh helps out in their campaign for equality .
Craig Ferguson has the most remarkable guest role of the year :
He is playing a talking part of Leela ’s body .
We discover that Leela has a little more to her being a mutant than we knew about .
Chris Elliott is playing a very persnickety space probe that goes around censoring things that it thinks are indecent , and he finds nudity both interesting and offensive .
George Takei will be back .
I ’m proud to announce that Al Gore will be rejoining us in our environmental - themed holiday episode [ airing next season ] .
He will help explain the future versions of Christmas , Robanukah , and Kwanza , along with Coolio , a natural pairing .
Patton Oswalt will appear in next season , playing a character called Unattractive Giant Monster .
I would be remiss if I did n’t mention the first appearance by David X. Cohen , in the Comic - Con episode .
The heads of Matt Groening and David X. Cohen will appear on a panel of writers for the new show that Matt Groening has created in the Year 3010 .
Speaking of heads in jars , will Nixon be back ?
Nixon will be back .
We have a whole head - related episode .
It ’s discovered that you get a “ head trip ” if you lick one of the heads in the jars .
So Fry licks George Washington ’s head and it sends them off on a Revolutionary War adventure .
That ’s a plot line you would n’t see on most sitcoms .
Is that the most bizarre moment of this season ?
Actually , I can think of at least one even more bizarre moment .
It ’s a love scene between Dr. Zoidberg and Professor Farnsworth … .
Of course , it is quite touching in context .
And arousing .

Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) says he is not abandoning negotiations on a comprehensive energy and climate bill even as he warns of partisan gridlock following the Democrats ' push this week to pass health care reform .
" It 's going to make it very difficult to do anything complicated and controversial , " Graham told reporters yesterday .
" I 'm still committed to trying to roll out a vision of how you can price carbon and make it business - friendly .
We 're still going to do that .
...
But the truth of the matter is , I think you 're going to find most of our colleagues around here risk adverse . "
Graham 's continued role in the climate talks with Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) is critical for lawmakers trying to maintain momentum on an issue that has largely been kept on the sidelines while President Obama and Democrats focused on health care .
In recent days , Graham warned that immigration reform would be the " first casualty " following the Senate Democrats ' efforts to complete the health care bill via a fast - track reconciliation vote .
And he also predicted GOP gains this November .
" Republicans will pick up a lot of votes from people who think this is bad for their business , their family , and the process used to pass it was sleazy , " Graham said over the weekend .
Graham attended several briefings last week on the climate issue with major industry trade groups and senators , but his remarks about the health care bill nonetheless prompted speculation off Capitol Hill that the entire legislative effort could soon be over because of his wavering .
" If Lindsey Graham flies the coop , this thing is dead , " said Kevin Book , managing director with ClearView Energy Partners .
While Graham said he is staying put , his predictions about the Senate mood appear to be spot on -- at least among some moderate Republicans .
" It 's no different than it was last week , " Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) said of the mood on Capitol Hill .
" It was bad last week .
It 's going to be bad this week .
Who knows what it 's going to be like next week ? "
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) said she would " continue to work " with Democrats on energy and climate change legislation .
But she is not feeling very optimistic in light of the push on health care , another issue that put her in the partisan spotlight .
" I think it makes it a very difficult environment with which to deal with complex and big issues , most certainly incorporating Republican ideas in building that camaraderie , " Snowe said .
" Obviously , you 're always going to try to work on issues that are important to this country , but it takes patience to build that kind of consensus , and they have n't demonstrated the patience in that regard .
It 's regrettable . "
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) baited Democrats yesterday on the health care fallout during a radio interview back in Arizona .
" There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year , " he said .
" They have poisoned the well in what they 've done and how they 've done it . "
The 2008 GOP presidential nominee 's remarks prompted a quick reply from Majority Leader Harry Reid 's office .
" For someone who campaigned on ' Country First ' and claims to take great pride in bipartisanship , it 's absolutely bizarre for Senator McCain to tell the American people he is going to take his ball and go home until the next election , " said Jim Manley , a spokesman for the Nevada Democrat .
" He must be living in some parallel universe because the fact is , with very few exceptions , we 've gotten very little cooperation from Senate Republicans in recent years . "
Asked later if he meant the climate debate would be spoiled by health care , McCain said , " I never thought there was going to be one .
You 'd have to ask those who think there 'd be one , because they refuse to have nuclear power .
There 's no debate as far as discussion as far as I 'm concerned unless you had nuclear power . "
Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) said that there was still a chance for bipartisanship following the health care debate , starting with the Wall Street regulatory reform bill that Democrats passed yesterday out of the Senate Banking Committee ( see related story ) .
" What 'll happen is , people will go away for a couple of weeks on recess , and this will be behind us , " Corker said .
" I really do not believe that what 's happened , or will happen over the next four days on reconciliation , will in any way effect banking regulation .
I think people will dust off , they 'll come back , and we 're mostly adults around here , and I think we 'll deal with the next issue .
I really do . "
Kerry predicted a boost for his efforts after Obama signs the health care bill into law .
" In the wake of health care 's passage , we have a strong case to make that this can be the next breakthrough legislative fight , " Kerry said in a statement .
" Many senators who want to see a comprehensive energy and climate bill passed have been consumed with the drive to get health care passed .
The same was rightfully true of the White House even as they kept the coals warm on energy and climate .
Now they can pour their energy and attention into climate and energy .
And here I think we can put the pieces of real bipartisanship back together . "
Reid said he is meeting with Kerry today to go over the status of the climate and energy proposal .
Reid met last Monday with Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) and Democratic Policy Chairman Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) to discuss moving directly to floor debate on S. 1462 ( pdf ) , a bill approved last summer in Bingaman 's panel that includes a renewable energy standard and offshore oil drilling but no cap on greenhouse gas emissions -- a centerpiece of the Kerry - Graham - Lieberman effort .
Asked if he was considering the energy - only approach , Reid said , " I 've got lots of options on energy .
And I 'm going to try to work it through with Bingaman and Kerry . "
Kerry , Graham and Lieberman are expected to roll out further details of their proposal this week , including during a meeting today with key senators who have shown an interest in the issue over the last year .
The Senate trio hopes to send specifics to U.S. EPA by Friday to begin a multi- week interagency analysis , with a formal bill introduction expected next month .
Reid is also still angling for a floor debate in the late spring .
Feinstein speaks up on drilling , state pre-emption , allocations
The Senate 's top appropriator for environmental issues has also weighed in with a series of demands for the climate and energy bill .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) wrote Kerry a letter ( pdf ) last week calling for the climate legislation to begin with the electric utility sector , with more trade - exposed industries being phased in " at a later date . "
Draft language circulated last week to industry indicated the trio plans to do just that , with limits first on power plants in 2012 and the manufacturers following in 2016 ( E&E Daily , March 18 ) .
Feinstein also stated her preference on the allocation of valuable emission allowances for the power sector , urging Kerry to use the formula approved by most members of the Edison Electric Institute , the leading trade group for investor - owned utilities .
Under the EEI plan , which the House used in its version of climate legislation , allowances would be split 50 - 50 between companies based on their historic emission levels and retail sales .
But Kerry faces pressure from 14 other Democratic senators , mostly from the Midwest and Great Plains , who insist that the formula should be changed to reflect allocations based solely on emissions ( E&ENews PM , Nov. 12 , 2009 ) .
In her letter , Feinstein said a change from the EEI formula could force several electric utilities to drop their support for the legislation while leaving consumers in California paying higher costs for their past low - carbon investments .
" Abandoning the 50 - 50 agreement to shift more assistance to consumers in the Midwest and Great Plains would put the needs of one set of consumers ahead of the needs of others , which would undermine the over - arching goal of mitigating consumer impact , " she wrote .
Feinstein also pressed Kerry not to remove California 's ability to set stronger tailpipe standards than the federal government .
Automobile industry officials and Michigan lawmakers have repeatedly asked for such a move , and Senate aides confirmed last week that the trio is weighing the request .
But Feinstein argued that her home state should maintain authority it has had dating back to the 1960s under the Clean Air Act .
On another issue central to California , as well as other coastal states , Feinstein requested language requiring any state to first pass a law affirming its desire for companies to explore for oil and gas off their coasts .
" On such a substantial decision about the future of a state , a decision should be made by both the legislature and the governor , " Feinstein wrote .
" The state should also have the power to review its decision on a regular basis . "
And as the holder of the Senate 's purse strings at U.S. EPA and the Interior Department , Feinstein weighed in with concerns that climate legislation may not have enough congressional oversight when it comes to billions of dollars directed into off - budget accounts run by the administration .
Such a move , she wrote , " would diminish Congress ' ability to ensure that these funds were well spent or even spent for the purposes outlined in the legislation . "
Feinstein suggested instead that the Senate climate bill 's spending authorizations expire no later than 10 years after enactment .
" This approach , modeled on the Farm Bill and the Highway Bill , would ensure that Congress revisits spending levels and oversees how federal dollars are spent , " she wrote .
Feinstein suggested stronger oversight of carbon markets .
And on the mechanism under consideration for regulating transportation fuels , she proposed an adjustable carbon emissions fee that goes up or down a set amount each year depending on whether greenhouse gas emissions exceed or outperform the transportation sector 's target .
" This provides greater price certainty than any other option , removes concern with regard to the impact of market manipulation on price and keeps the transportation sector 's emissions subject to an emissions target , " she wrote .
Kerry , Graham and Lieberman have acknowledged they are working with oil industry officials on a " linked fee " proposal , but they have avoided talk on any specifics of their plan ( E&E Daily , March 3 ) .

During her speech in front of the NRA , Sarah Palin threw a little red meat to the crowd by claiming that President Obama wants to take away guns and ammo , but the truth is that Obama presidency has been extremely pro-Second Amendment .
Obama has been so pro-gun that the Brady Campaign gave his administration him an F on their annual report card .
Palin went with the standard claim that Obama is coming to get their guns and ammo .
According to CBS
News she said , “ Do n’t doubt for a minute that , if they thought they could get away with it , they would ban guns and ban ammunition and gut the Second Amendment .
It ’s the job of all of us at the NRA and its allies to stop them in their tracks . ”
The problem with this statement is that it is completely untrue .
The first splash of cold water in the face of gun control advocates came when the Obama Administration announced in April 2009 that they would not support reinstating the assault weapons ban .
When asked about reinstating the ban at a White House press conference , Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said , “ I was asked specifically about assault weapons .
I think the president would — the president believes there are other strategies we can take to enforce the laws that are already on our books . ”
( In case you are n’t sure , Gibbs was answering no to the ban ) .

In January 2010 , the Brady Campaign gave Obama ’s first year a big fat F on gun control issues .
The report said , “ Rather than showing leadership by calling for the stronger laws Candidate Obama had professed to support , the White House muzzled cabinet members who called for sensible gun laws .
Administration officials parroted NRA slogans to just “ enforce the law on the books , ” even though there are few such laws and those are riddled with loopholes .
It is no wonder that one pro-gun writer remarked that the NRA “ should erect a statue of Barack Obama in front of its D.C. headquarters . ”
The report was blunt and called Obama a failure on gun control , “ On pursuing sensible solutions to the continuing tragedy of gun violence , President Obama ’s first year in office has been a failure .
He has failed so far to live up to his campaign promises to strengthen federal gun laws and instead has signed legislation to weaken them . ”
( This certainly does n’t sound like the kind of president that is out to take away anyone ’s guns or ammo ) .
I would say that Sarah Palin was lying about Obama ’s Second Amendment record , but I do n’t think that she actually knows the President ’s record on the issue .
Palin seemed to be working under the assumption that of course Obama would be against the Second Amendment , because he is a black Democrat .
This episode is an example of why Palin can never be taken seriously .
Facts are strictly optional with Palin .
She is more worried about delivering applause lines than the truth .
We all know that in Sarah Land when the truth does n’t match her story , she simply changes the facts until it does .
Palin is the poster child for the intellectual lazy stereotypical Fox News viewer .
The ignorant and narrow minded adore her because she is one of them .
She is everything a leader and a role model should never be , and every time that she opens her mouth the IQ of our national dialogue drops ten more points .

This is a list of sexually active popes , Catholic priests who were not celibate before they became pope , and popes who were legally married .
Some candidates were sexually active before their election as pope , and others were accused of being sexually active during their papacies .
A number of them had offspring .
The Second Lateran Council ( 1139 ) made the promise to remain celibate a prerequisite to ordination , abolishing the married priesthood .
Sexual relationships were generally undertaken therefore outside the bond of matrimony and each sexual act thus committed is considered a mortal sin by the Roman Catholic Church .
There are various classifications for those who were sexually active at some time during their lives .
Periods in parentheses refer to the years of their papacies .
Background [ edit ]
For many years of the Church 's history , celibacy was considered optional .
Based on the customs of the times , it is assumed by many that most of the Apostles , such as Peter , were married and had families .
It is clear from the New Testament ( Mk 1:29 –31 ; Mt 8:14 –15 ; Lk 4:38–39 ; 1 Tim 3:2 , 12 ; Tit 1:6 ) that at least Peter had been married , and that bishops , presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well .
It is also clear from epigraphy , the testimony of the Church Fathers , synodal legislation , papal decretals and other sources [ not specific enough to verify ] that in the following centuries a married clergy , in greater or lesser numbers , was a normal feature of the life of the Church .
Celibacy was not required for those ordained , but still was a discipline that could be practised in the early Church , particularly by those in the monastic life .
Although various local Church councils had demanded celibacy of the clergy in a particular area , [ 1 ] it was not until the Second Lateran Council ( 1139 ) that the whole of the Latin ( Western ) Rite of the Catholic Church decided to accept people for ordination only after they had taken a promise of celibacy .
This applied to the leadership of the Church . [ 2 ]

The mining sector and unions have poured cold water on Opposition Leader Tony Abbott 's idea to scrap the dole for under -30s .
Mr Abbott says the Coalition is considering withdrawing the dole from some job seekers to push them into taking jobs in sectors where there are skills shortages , such as mining .
But some industry insiders say this could be a disaster .
Steven Smyth , from the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union , says it is not safe to push unskilled workers into the sort of mining work carried out by his members .
" To take people and say ' right , you can go and work in an underground coal mine or an open cut coal mine ' without having the proper training , the skills and the competency I think would be disastrous and is something the union is not in favour of , " he said .
" We 'd push the opposite , that the people be high skilled , highly trained , and competent . "
Queensland Resources Council director Michael Roche told ABC Radio that Mr Abbott seems misguided in his approach to addressing the skills shortage .
" If he thinks you can translate an unemployed young man or woman from Townsville or Cairns or wherever overnight into the resources sector , then clearly we need to give Mr Abbott a good briefing on the workforce 's needs and the fact that we need skilled people that have done some training , " he said .
Australian Workers Union national secretary Paul Howes has slammed Mr Abbott 's idea as " stupid " .
" This is crass politics at its worst .
It 's the type of thing we did hear from Pauline Hanson , " he told Sky News .
" I think it 's one of Tony Abbott 's Sarah Palin moments .
" You ca n't just pluck any old Joe out of an area of chronic unemployment , dump them in a mine and think that that somehow is going to solve the skills shortage , because the shortage is about skills . "
Kevin Wealand is chief executive of Downing Teal , a recruitment company specialising in finding workers for the mining industry .
He too says not just anyone can get a job in the mines .
" Labour has also got to be characterised as skilled labour , " he said .
" So unskilled labour that is incapable or untrained in the use of heavy equipment , working in dangerous or remote environments , is unlikely to be easily employed .
" Mining is inherently a dangerous business ... to take anyone who 's absolutely unskilled and say ' there 's a job in the resource sector ' would be contentious . "
But Mr Wealand says the industry is facing a critical shortage of workers , which is only going to get worse .
" We 're talking about the immediate term in the next decade , it seems to me there is unquestionably going to be a shortage of labour , " he said .
" Depending on what the job is .
Five years ago for every one job that was available , whether that be unskilled , semi-skilled , skilled or professional , five years ago we would have seen anywhere between 10 and 20 applicants .
" Today the chances are that there are one or two applicants . "
He says there will always be employment opportunities in the mining sector Australia - wide for skilled workers .
The mayor of the Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council in far north Queensland , Percy Neal , says denying the dole to people under 30 would destroy his community .
" In our community it 's bad enough as it is since the abolition of CDEP , " he said .
" The present Government 's actually taken it away , the work for the dole program , so if they want to take away the dole that 's OK , but give us back the work for the dole program . "
Upcoming Frozen Goodness
Folks , we have a Nexus One .
We also have Froyo .
In fact , we have the two mixed together in the most delicious frozen - yogurty Android 2.2 kind of way you can imagine .
Not much has been officially released by Google about Android 2.2 - probably less than any other release to date .
We all have a hunch about some new features but Google would n't officially confirm or deny any of them , other than the one about Flash 10.1 .
They 're saving it for May 19th - 20th , and we 're OK with that .
However , one of our team members has been playing with a Nexus One running Froyo for about a week now , getting more and more visibly excited every day .
Before we proceed , however , here 's a quick picture to squelch any non-believers .
These are not fakes and we will be playing with the phone on video very shortly .
Yes , it runs Flash , and it runs it very well ( we 'll demo that separately but you can get the idea here ) .
As you 've seen it already , it has a new home screen menu but we wo n't talk about that today .
Froyo 2.2 Performance
Today , we would like to point out the results of some speed tests we 've been running on Froyo , using a tool called Linpack .
These results are so impressive , most likely due to the introduction of the long awaited JIT compilation into the kernel , that we felt they deserved immediate attention .
Linpack
Linpack for Android was specifically created to test the performance of Dalvik VM which , in short , is the heart and the brains of Android .
The benchmark calculates how fast your phone can operate , which can then be used to compare various phone models ' relative performance .
Linpack allows users to publish these results to its online tracker , but we 'll talk about that a bit later .
Here 's a brief introduction to Linpack by the authors themselves , with interesting parts bolded :
The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system ’s floating point computing power .
Introduced by Jack Dongarra , they measure how fast a computer solves a dense N by N system of linear equations
Ax = b , which is a common task in engineering .
The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting , with 2/3*N3 + 2*N2 floating point operations .
The result is reported in Millions of FLoating - point Operations Per Second ( MFLOP/s , sometimes simply called FLOPS ) .
This test is more a reflection of the state of the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine than of the floating point performance of the underlying processor .
Software written for an Android device is written using Java code that the Dalvik VM interprets at run time .
What is the purpose of this app ?
This is a simple benchmark test to show performance relative to other phones for a standard calculation .
Linpack has been used for years on all types of computers , with a version used to rate the TOP500 computers in the world .
What speed is better ?
A higher number is better .
Does having faster speed improve the android phones or what ?
Yes , it should .
The Dalvik VM has a huge impact on the Linpack number .
A better number on the same device would indicate that a new version update has improved performance .
Or it could show that something has gone terribly wrong if the number goes down .
But enough about Linpack - let 's take a look at how Froyo performs .
Linpack Scores
Just so you have an idea of the kind of scores you can expect from the benchmark , let me list a few sample numbers :
the Nexus One running Android 2.1 gets about 6.5 - 7 MFLOPS
MFLOPS my HTC
Hero averages a measly score of about 2 MFLOPS ( the phone is pretty slow indeed )
Here is a screenshot of the last test I ran on the Hero :
Froyo Linpack Score
So how does the Nexus One with Froyo do ?
A whopping 37.5 MFLOPS .
Think about this for a second .
37.6 , compared to 6.5 - 7 - that 's about a 450 % speed improvement .
Conclusion
Things are starting to finally come together .
Flash and huge performance gains , all in the same release .
Flash is CPU hungry , so Android makes everything about the environment more efficient .
Do you see it ?
Adobe was n't giving Apple what they needed , and Apple was n't giving Adobe , well , anything .
But Google thought of the problem outside the box , like the ingenious engineers to the core that they are and made Android so much faster than it could finally run full Flash without a hitch .
Oh yeah , the phone is indeed noticeably faster .
Some of you ( like Some of you ( like Cyanogen and Uhhhh ) pointed out that JIT compilation only helps programs that are not compiled to native code , which Flash and some video codecs / drivers seem to be .
Thank you for this clarification .
While real - life improvements will most certainly not be 450 % across the board , we still expect the N1 and even Flash to benefit from JIT because , as other programs become more efficient , more CPU will be available to such natively compiled programs .
These mysterious numbers from the Linpack Top 10 do n't look so fake anymore now , do they ?

Gmail is hands - down the best web - based email service on the 'net .
Conversation threads , search , tagging , and keyboard shortcuts have completely revolutionized the way I look at my inbox .
I manage all of my email from my personal Gmail inbox , including the daily flood of Lifehacker messages .
At this point , I can't imagine a program I could use to manage my email any more efficiently .

Despite my undying love for Gmail , there are still a lot of people who are n't won over by sheer enthusiasm alone , and still others who just are n't taking full advantage of the features and functions they 've got at their fingertips in Gmail .
Either way , the only thing a Gmail naysayer needs is a better understanding of everything you can do with Gmail .
Today I 've got a rundown of the methods and add - ons I use to make Gmail more powerful .
By the time you 're done with this article you 'll be a bona fide Gmail power user , too .

Quick look at what to expect
When you 're done setting up your Gmail account , you should be able to do everything you see in this short video without once leaving your keyboard ( which means beaucoup productivity for you ) :
Let 's get started down your path to Gmail mastery .
Set up labels
The first thing you 'll want to do to flex Gmail 's muscle a bit is set up a few labels .
If you 're new to labels , think of them as folders , or better yet , tags . [ 1 ]
Your email does n't have to specifically reside in any folders to be just as accessible .
In fact , labels are great specifically because you can apply multiple labels to one email , making your email that much easier to find .
Setting up labels is super -easy :

Go to Settings , and then select the Labels tab .
In the textbox labeled , " Create a new label : " simply type your label and click Create .

Yep , that 's it .
I 'd suggest going through your email and figuring out how you might want to categorize and label your emails .
I generally create labels for any mailing lists I 'm on , along with labels for different work - related emails and an ever - important Follow - up label for the emails I want to make sure I remember to reply to ( e.g. , those emails I 'm not going to reply to immediately but I do n't want to fall through the cracks ) .
Of course , your labels will revolve around your needs ( as they should ) , and if you do n't already have an email system , I 'd encourage you to examine your email and develop one .

Set up filters
While labels are great on their own - and I label a lot of messages after they land in my Inbox - there are a lot of instances where you can assign labels automatically based on the characteristics of the message , thus saving yourself the work .
That 's where filters come in .

Gmail can filter an email based on six criteria : From , To , Subject , Has the words , Does n't have , and Has attachment .
Obviously this setup offers a lot of power for filtering your incoming mail .
After you choose your criteria , you can choose any combination of the following options : Skip the Inbox ( Archive ) , Star it , Apply the label ... , Forward it to , and Delete it .

When I set up a new filter , I commonly choose to Skip the Inbox and Apply a label .

Managing multiple email accounts with Gmail
It 's not at all uncommon to have more than one email address these days ( actually , for many of you it 's been pretty common for years now ) .
Though you may never be able to consolidate all of your email to one address , you can at least deal with all of your email from one account .

If your non-Gmail account allows for email forwarding , set it up to forward your mail to your main Gmail address ( this process will vary based on your email account , but it 's generally really easy to do somewhere in the settings ) .
For example , all of the Lifehacker tips email ( which comes to Gina , Keith , and me ) comes straight to my personal Gmail address , at which point it 's filtered out of my inbox and labeled " Lifehacker Tips . "

With Gmail 's recent addition of smart replying , you should n't have to worry about sending email from the wrong address .
When someone sends you an email , Gmail will automatically use the appropriate email address when replying ( whether it 's a Gmail address or not ) .
Gmail adds smart replying ZDNet is reporting that Gmail has added the much - needed feature of smart - replies , allowing you to …

Using keyboard shortcuts
This is where Gmail really starts to shine .
Despite the fact the Gmail does a lot of things very well , a lot of these features were just sort of ho - hum for me .
It was n't until I started using keyboard shortcuts , and then the Gmail Macros script , that I completely fell in love with Gmail .
Advertisement
The first thing you 'll want to do is enable keyboard shortcuts in Gmail .
This is as simple as navigating to the General tab in the Settings and selecting " Keyboard shortcuts on . "
The keyboard shortcuts let you navigate through your messages , within your conversations , archive a conversation , and jump to your inbox without ever having to go for the mouse .
Here 's a list of the default Gmail keyboard shortcuts .
Gmail 's keyboard shortcuts by themselves are great , but if you really want to take control of your Gmail inbox , I very highly recommend installing the Gmail Macros script for Greasemonkey .
Though it does a lot , the most powerful thing you 'll use the Gmail Macros script for is navigating through your labels ( including your inbox , trash , drafts , etc. - after all , they 're all just labels ) and labeling your conversations with a really slick Quicksilver - like interface .

First you 'll need to install the Greasemonkey Firefox extension if you do n't already have it installed .
Next , install the Gmail Macros script .
There are a couple of different scripts available on the linked blog post , but I prefer a patched version of the script that stays more true to Gmail 's original keyboard shortcuts .
Here 's a quick look at the key commands that the Gmail macros script provides ( click for a larger version ) :

It may take a little time to get the shortcuts embedded in your memory , but you can easily bring up the list of shortcuts at any time in Gmail by typing a question mark ( ? ) .
Knock out repetitive email
If you do a lot of repetitive typing in your emails ( if I type the same thing three times a day I consider it repetitive ) , you can really knock down your repetitive emails quickly with AutoHotKey HotStrings .
I 'd never get through my inbox without them , and they 're very easy to set up and edit .

Searching your Gmail inbox
Of course , a solid Gmail tutorial would n't be complete without a quick rundown of searching your Gmail ( it 's Google , after all ! ) .
Advertisement
Search operators in Gmail work much the same as they do with Google .
Type the operator followed by a colon , and then your search term ( e.g. , to:tips@lifehacker.com ) .
Likewise , you can exclude terms from your search with the hyphen ( - ) .
The search operators allow you to limit the scope of your search to the to ( to : ) , from ( from : ) , and subject ( subject : ) fields .
Easy enough , right ?
You can also search based on labels ( label : ) , emails with attachments ( has : attachment ) , and even dates ( after : / before : yyyy / mm/dd ) .
Advertisement
Search operators will come in especially handy if you need more flexibility when setting up filters ( you can add any search term to the " Has the words " field ) .
Here 's a comprehensive list of Gmail search operators .
Take your Gmail toolbox on the road
Finally , to make my Gmail add - ons ( Greasemonkey , Gmail Macros script , and AutoHotKey assignments ) as portable as possible , I email them to myself as attachments so that whenever I 'm away from my computer I can work just as efficiently as if I were at home .

With all of my systems in place , I 'm more pleased with Gmail than I have been with any other email client , desktop or web based .
Of course , I 'm sure I have n't exhausted the matter .

There are a lot of advantages of Labels or tags over folders .
One huge benefit of labels is that if you choose to delete a label because you no longer find it useful ( perhaps your system has evolved and you want to clean house ) , the associated email will not be deleted .
Instead , the label is simply removed .
Remember that with Gmail , the whole point is that you do n't have to delete any of your email - ever .
A second benefit of labels is that you can mark one email with as many labels as you like .
