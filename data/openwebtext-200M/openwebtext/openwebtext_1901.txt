Maine officials taking big cat photo seriously
By Kathryn Skelton , Staff Writer
Friday , June 29 , 2007
A photo making e-mail rounds Thursday [ June 28 , 2007 ] that shows what looks like a big , rare cat in a Sidney backyard is real , according to the Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife spokesman .
Whether that ’s actually a mountain lion leaning on a rock wall is up in the air .
The cat ’s tail , the easiest way to tell a bobcat from a mountain lion , is hidden by a tree .
“ That ’s why we ’re sending someone out there , ” said Mark Latti .
“ Maine does n’t have a wild population of mountain lions . ”
The picture came in to IFW on Thursday .
He said the homeowner wants to be anonymous .
A biologist will go out soon to look for other evidence , like tracks , and measure the size of the rocks where the cat stood to get a sense of scale .
Maine has n’t had wild mountain lions since the late 1800s , Latti said .
Vermont and New Hampshire do n’t have them either .
“ We do receive a handful of sightings a year , ” he added .
The last significant one was about six years ago in Monmouth .
Plaster casts were made of what turned out to be mountain lion tracks , “ but we never saw it again . ”
In the mid-1990s , mountain lion hair was found in Cape Elizabeth .
The animals live mostly out West and sometimes make headlines with vicious attacks .
According to SanDiegoZoo.org , the male mountain lion can get up to six feet long and 227 pounds .
Central Maine Medical Center spokesman Randy Dustin had a friend send him the photo with a note that read , “ This thing ran in front of me the other night in Sidney . ”
It was on the Turnpike and the friend thought he ’d been seeing things .
The family of Jean Charles de Menezes , the young Brazilian man mistakenly shot dead by police hunting a suicide bomber in south London two years ago , reacted angrily to the announcement yesterday that none of the officers involved in the operation would face disciplinary proceedings .
One of his relatives said the police were being allowed " to get away with murder " .
None of the 11 officers whose actions were investigated will face proceedings , the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled yesterday .
No decision has yet been made about the four senior officers who authorised the shooting at Stockwell underground station on July 22 2005 when Menezes was on his way to work .
Nick Hardwick , chairman of the IPCC , said he had made the decision after careful consideration .
He said he was " struck again by the challenge facing officers of the [ Metropolitan police ] following the carnage on July 7 2005 .
" Set alongside this is the fate of Jean Charles who was entirely innocent ...
The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged . "
A Metropolitan police spokesman said : " The shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes is a matter of very deep regret to the Metropolitan police service and our continued thoughts are with his family .
We have apologised publicly and in private to them and we would again like to take this opportunity to say sorry for this tragedy . "
Four senior officers , including Commander Cressida Dick , who authorised the shooting , were also investigated by the IPCC .
No decision about them will be made until after the prosecution of the Met in connection with the shooting , under health and safety laws , due in October .
The family and supporters of the dead man attacked the decision .
Patricia da Silva Armani , Menezes 's cousin , who shared a house with him at the time of his death , said : " It is disgraceful the IPCC can make such a decision - they are letting the police get away with murder .
" First officials killed my cousin , then they lied about it and now the officers are walking away without any punishment . "
A spokesman for the Justice4Jean Campaign , the group set up by Menezes 's family and friends , said : " Today 's decision effectively says police officers can act above the law , free to take human life without facing a full legal investigation like anyone else . "
The family have already applied to the House of Lords for a review of an earlier decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring criminal charges against any individual officer in connection with the shooting .
A second IPCC investigation , known as Stockwell 2 , is still looking into complaints about comments made by Sir Ian Blair , the Met commissioner and colleagues in the wake of the shooting .
This inquiry is due to report later this year .
Today the City Council of Portland , Oregon , voted unanimously to ban the use of facial recognition technology by City agencies or by private entities in places of public accommodation within the City limits , including at the Portland International Airport ( PDX ) , effective immediately .
Many local and national organizations and individuals testified eloquently in favor of these proposals .
We do n’t need to repeat all of their general arguments .
But a point of particular concern and particular pleasure for us is that the Port of Portland asked the City Council for an exemption from the ban to allow use of facial recognition “ for air carrier passenger processing ” — and was turned down .
No member of the City Council mentioned the Port ’s request for a carve - out for facial recogntion of air travelers during the City Council discussion , and the proposals were adopted without amendment except for making the ban on private use of facial recognition in places of public accommodation effective immediately , as had already been proposed for the ban on use by city agencies .
( The amendment to make the private entity ban effective immediately was made verbally during the City Council meeting , so it is n’t reflected in the advance text of the proposal . )
This is an important precedent , as Portland is only the second jurisdiction in the US to consider local rules related to facial recognition at its airport .
Earlier this year , after behind - the - scenes threats by the US Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to make life difficult for the Port of Seattle if it did n’t collaborate with DHS facial recognition schemes at Sea - Tac International Airport ( SEA ) and allow airlines and contractors also to do so , the Port of Seattle Commission reneged on the aspirational policy principles it adopted in 2019 and decided to buy and operate common -use facial recognition cameras integrated with DHS and airline databases and operations .
( See our written testimony to the Seattle Port Commission on use of facial recognition at SEA : 1 , 2 , 3 . , and articles in our blog here and here . )
The decision by the Port of Seattle was made just before the COVID - 19 pandemic drastically reduced traffic at SEA and other airports and delayed the need for the new gates at SEA where the DHS - linked cameras were to be installed .
A broad coalition of local and national community and civil liberties organizations has called on the Seattle Port Commission to use the opportunity provided by this delay to reconsider its decision on facial recognition .
Portland did significantly better than Seattle in working to distance itself from and isolate the DHS — not surprisingly in light of the object lesson the DHS has provided in Portland recently with respect to DHS trustworthiness ( not ) , self - restraint ( not ) , commitment to the rule of law ( not ) , and respect for civil and human rights ( not ) .
Portlanders do n’t trust the DHS to behave any better at PDX Airport than it ’s been behaving on the streets of Portland .
PDX airport is located within the City of Portland but operated by the Port of Portland , a special - purpose agency of the state of Oregon governed by a board appointed by the Governor of Oregon .
The City of Portland ca n’t prevent use of facial recognition by the DHS or the Port of Portland , but can regulate or prohibit its use by private entities , including airlines , within the city limits , including at the airport .
The Port of Portland has the authority to enter into contracts , borrow and spend money , manage its employees , and enact rules for activities at PDX Airport .
But in addition to the requirements of due process and other Constitutional rights , and the obligations on the airport as a publicly owned and operated place of public accommodations and common - carrier facility , the legislative authority of the Port is limited to the issuance of rules consistent with city ordinances .
That appears to mean that the Port may not prohibit that which the city has duly prohibited .
( If readers have more expertise on this jurisdictional issue , feel free to leave a comment or drop us a line . )
The Federal government could preempt the Portland ordinances if it enacted valid laws or promulgated valid regulations mandating use of facial recognition by Federally - regulated airlines and / or airports .
But no law mandates use of facial recognition for US citizens , even when traveling internatoinally , or for passengers on domestic flights
The DHS has refrained from promulgating any such regulations , preferring to operate outside the law than to establish any legal framework for its use of facial recognition or subject it claim of authority to notice - and - comment rulemaking or judicial review .
A petition for rulemaking on use of biometrics for traveler identification submitted to the DHS by the Portland - based World Privacy Forum has been ignored by the DHS for almost two years .
While the DHS has engaged in heavy - handed behind - the - scenes lobbying and threats to “ persuade ” airlines and airport operating agencies to become its “ partners ” in biometric surveillance and control of air travelers , as it did in Seattle , the DHS has continued to maintain — correctly — that this “ cooperation ” is entirely voluntary .
In declining to participate , and by exercising its jurisdiction to prohibit airlines or other contractors form doing so within the city limits , the City of Portland is doing only what the DHS has consistently said that local jurisdictions have the authority to do , if they so choose .
The July 14 , 2020 , letter from the Port of Portland to the Portland City Council requesting exemption from the facial recognition ban made numerous false factual claims and specious arguments .
Since these bogus arguments are likely to be raised again in other cites despite having failed to persuade any of the members of the Portland City Council , it ’s worth noting and debunking them :

UCL ( University College London ) researchers have found the first physiological evidence that invisible subliminal images do attract the brain 's attention on a subconscious level .
The wider implication for the study , published in Current Biology , is that techniques such as subliminal advertising , now banned in the UK but still legal in the USA , certainly do leave their mark on the brain .
Using fMRI , the study looked at whether an image you are n't aware of ¬- but one that reaches the retina - has an impact on brain activity in the primary visual cortex , part of the occipital lobe .
Subjects ' brains did respond to the object even when they were not conscious of having seen it .
Dr Bahador Bahrami , of the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and the UCL Department of Psychology , said : " What 's interesting here is that your brain does log things that you are n't even aware of and can't ever become aware of .
We show that there is a brain response in the primary visual cortex to subliminal images that attract our attention - without us having the impression of having seen anything .
These findings point to the sort of impact that subliminal advertising may have on the brain .
What our study does n't address is whether this would then influence you to go out and buy a product .
I believe that it 's likely that subliminal advertising may affect our decisions - but that is just speculation at this point . "
Subjects wore red - blue filter glasses that projected faint pictures of everyday objects ( such as pliers and an iron ) to one eye and a strong flashing image known as ' continuous flash suppression ' to the other .
This recently developed technique effectively erases subjects ' awareness of the faint images so that they were unable to localise the faint images on screen .
At the same time , subjects performed either an easy task - picking out the letter T from a stream of letters , or a task that required more concentration in which subjects had to pick out the white N or blue Z from the same stream .
During the harder task , the subjects ' brains blocked out the subliminal image and the fMRI scan did not detect any associated neural activity .
This finding - that the brain does not pick up on subliminal stimuli if it is too busily occupied with other things - shows that some degree of attention is needed for even the subconscious to pick up on subliminal images .
Dr Bahrami said : " This is exciting research for the scientific community because it challenges previous thinking - that what is subconscious is also automatic , effortless and unaffected by attention .
This research shows that when your brain does n't have the capacity to pay attention to an image , even images that act on our subconscious simply do not get registered . "
The research challenges the theory of the pioneering American psychologist and philosopher , William James , ( 1842-1910 ) , who said : " We are conscious of what we attend to - and not conscious of what we do not attend to " .
The team 's findings show that there are situations where consciousness and attention do n't go hand in hand .

Update ( July 22nd ) : See this MySpace forum for more info .
A converter was released to help MySpacers get around the block , and a fix now appears to have been deployed .
—
This is just bizarre : MySpace has started to filter out the letter " i " on MySpace blogs - all of them .
No matter where the letter " i " appears in a word or sentence , it gets replaced with " .. " .
The only place where an " i " can be used is in the title of a post .
MySpace users , of course , have been trying to complain about it on their blogs , with the obvious limitation that they can't actually mention the blocked letter in their complaints .
You can see some fun examples here , here , here , here and here ( contains swearing , if you 're sensitive about that kinda thing ) .
We can only assume that MySpace is really , really fed up of all the iPhone coverage .

" Toe the Line , " NOT " Tow the Line "
by Tina Blue
August 14 , 2003
I saw it again today , this time in a comment on an article on a political website .
It referred to reporters who mindlessly " tow the administration 's line . "
Um , that should be " toe the line . "
A lot of people who do n't know the origin of the phrase picture someone pulling a rope , cord , or some other " line " - -" tow the line " -- as a way of working for whomever the " line " belongs to .
Thus , if the administration has a " line " -- i.e. , a " party line " -- then those who side with the administration help to pull it ( " tow " it ) along .
Wrong .
The phrase " toe the line " is equivalent to " toe the mark , " both of which mean to conform to a rule or a standard .
The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories ( Oxford : Oxford Univ. Press , 2002 ; ed. by Glynnis Chantrell ) says , " The idiom toe the line from an athletics analogy originated in the early 19th century " ( 514 ) .
The specific sport referred to is foot - racing , where the competitors must keep their feet behind a " line " or on a " mark " at the start of the race -- as in " On your mark , get set , go ! "
So one who " toes the line " is one who does not allow his foot to stray over the line .
In other words , one who does not stray beyond a rigidly defined boundary .

The earth experienced its biggest mass extinction about 250 million years ago , an event that wiped out an estimated 95 % of marine species and 70 % of land species .
New research shows that this mass extinction did more than eliminate species : it fundamentally changed the basic ecology of the world 's oceans .
Ecologically simple marine communities were largely displaced by complex communities .
Furthermore , this apparently abrupt shift set a new pattern that has continued ever since .
It reflects the current dominance of higher - metabolism , mobile organisms ( such as snails , clams and crabs ) that actually go out and find their own food and the decreased diversity of older groups of low - metabolism , stationary organisms ( such as lamp shells and sea lilies ) that filter nutrients from the water .
So says research to be published in Science on November 24 , 2006 .
An accompanying article suggests that this striking change escaped detection until now because previous research relied on single numbers -- such as the number of species alive at one particular time or the distribution of species in a local community -- to track the diversity of marine life .
In the new research , however , scientists examined the relative abundance of marine life forms in communities over the past 540 million years .
One reason they were able to do this is because they tapped the new Paleobiology Database , a huge repository of fossil occurrence data .
The result is the first broad objective measurement of changes in the complexity of marine ecology over the Phanerozoic .
" We were able to combine a huge data set with new quantitative analyses , " says Peter J. Wagner , Associate Curator of Fossil Invertebrates at The Field Museum and lead author of the study .
" We think these are the first analyses of this type at this large scale .
They show that the end - Permian mass extinction permanently altered not just taxonomic diversity but also the prevailing marine ecosystem structure . "
Specifically , the data and analyses concern models of relative abundance found in fossil communities throughout the Phanerozoic .
The ecological implications are striking .
Simple marine ecosystems suggest that bottom - dwelling organisms partitioned their resources similarly .
Complex marine ecosystems suggest that interactions among different species , as well as a greater variety of ways of life , affected abundance distributions .
Prior to the end - Permian mass extinction , both types of marine ecosystems ( complex and simple ) were equally common .
After the mass extinction , however , the complex communities outnumbered the simple communities nearly 3:1 .
The other authors are Scott Lidgard , Associate Curator of Fossil Invertebrates at The Field Museum , and Matthew A. Kosnik , from the School of Marine and Tropical Biology at the James Cook University in Townsville , Queensland , Australia .
" Tracing how marine communities became more complex over hundreds of millions of years is important because it shows us that there was not an inexorable trend towards modern ecosystems , " Wagner said .
" If not for this one enormous extinction event at the end of the Permian , then marine ecosystems today might still be like they were 250 million years ago . "
These results also might provide a wake - up call , Wagner added : " Studies by modern marine ecologists suggest that humans are reducing certain marine ecosystems to something reminiscent of 550 million years ago , prior to the explosion of animal diversity .
The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs could n't manage that . "
Lidgard added , " When Pete walked into my office with his preliminary results , I simply could n't believe them .
Paleontologists had long recognized that ecosystems had become more complex , from the origin of single - celled bacteria to the present day .
But we had little idea of just how profoundly this one mass extinction -- but not the others like it -- changed the marine world . "

The longstanding advice to " sit up straight " has been turned on its head by a new study that suggests leaning back is a much better posture .
Researchers analyzed different postures and concluded that the strain of sitting upright for long hours is a perpetrator of chronic back problems .
Using a new form of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , researchers studied 22 volunteers with no back pain history .
The subjects assumed three different positions : slouching ; sitting up straight at 90 degrees ; and sitting back with a 135 - degree posture — all while their spines were scanned .
Back pain , according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , is the most common cause of work - related disability in the United States .
It costs Americans nearly $ 50 billion annually .
Sitting appears to be a major cause of this ailment .
" We were not created to sit down for long hours , but somehow modern life requires the vast majority of the global population to work in a seated position , " Bashir said .
" This made our search for the optimal sitting position all the more important . "
here
When strain is placed on the spine , the spinal disks start to move and misalign .
At a 90 - degree sitting position , this movement was most prominent .
The disks were least moved when subjects were sitting back at a 135 - degree sitting position .
" We have to do something that is similar to the lying position , " Bashir told LiveScience .
Lying down in a relaxed position with your knees slightly bent is the best position that a person can be in , because it does n't cause any stress on the ligaments , the thigh muscles as well as on the back .
Sitting on a chair that provides proper support , such as a slightly tilted back car seat , can mimic the relaxed supine position .
Slouching caused a reduction in the spinal height which means that there was high rate of wear and tear in the lowest two spinal levels .
" This may be all that is necessary to prevent back pain , rather than trying to cure pain that has occurred over the long term due to bad postures , " Bashir said .
The study was detailed today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America ( RSNA ) .
Cheney appears to say that Bush will be remembered fondly on his deathbed Michael Roston

President George W. Bush will be remembered fondly on his deathbed .
Vice President Dick Cheney appeared to deliver that message on CNN's Larry King Live Tuesday night .
When asked if he should take the President 's poor poll numbers more seriously , Cheney pointed to the administration of Gerald Ford , in which he also served .
Ford , who replaced Richard Nixon after his resignation from the Watergate scandal , was remembered well after his death .
" [ J ]ust last year , when he passed away and we had memorial services and so forth for him , he was held in very high regard ; across the country his praises were sung for some of the really tough decisions he made that were very unpopular at the time , " Cheney insisted .
The Vice President 's paralleling of Bush 's 6 1/2 years with Ford 's abbreviated succession into a disgraced presidency stood out in the pre-recorded interview , in which a largely defiant Cheney stood by his decisions and acknowledged little error or wrongdoing .
Note :
An earlier preview clip with commentary by Larry King can be viewed at this link .
Vice President challenges ' too powerful ' criticisms
Cheney attempted to insist that as Vice Presidents have gone , he was more modest because he was not ' angling ' for future elected office .
" I made the decision when I signed on with the President that the only agenda I would have would be his agenda , that I was not going to be like most Vice Presidents , " he told King .
" And that was angling , trying to figure out how I was going to be elected President when his term was over with . "
But one verbal slip appeared to show that the Vice President saw himself ' making decisions ' for the president .
" Brent does n't walk in my shoes these days .
He 's not in the job I 'm in , " Cheney said , deflecting a criticism by Brent Scowcroft , a George H.W. Bush administration official who is a long time friend of the Vice President .
" He 's not responsible for making the decisions the President has had to make and those of us who support him and advise him . "
As one example , Cheney did not rule out directing then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to visit Attorney General John Ashcroft in the hospital .
Gonzales asked Ashcroft to overrule his deputy , who had refused to certify the legality of a counterterrorism spying program .
" I do n't recall that I was the one who sent them to the hospital , " Cheney said .
However , he acknowledged that " [ C]ertainly I was involved because I was a big advocate of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , and had been responsible and working with General Hayden and George Tenet to get it to the President for approval . "
At the same time , Cheney attempted to put to bed the notion that he was not bound by controls on the executive branch because his office was in the legislative branch .
However , he also seemed to hold out that the President could give him any authority he needed .
" In the executive branch , you do only what the President asks you to do -- he gives you assignments -- but whatever authority you have is delegated by the President himself , " Cheney told King .
" The Constitution , on the other hand , provides for your role as the President of Senate . "
Cheney acknowledges underestimating Iraqi insurgents
On Iraq , the Vice President admitted he was ' incorrect ' when he said that the insurgency was in its ' last throes ' in mid-2005 .
" I thought there were a series of these milestones that would in fact undermine the insurgency and make it less than it was at that point , " he told King .
" I think the insurgency turned out to be more robust . "
But he insisted that success was not far off , pointing to an op - ed in the ' not exactly ... friendly ' New York Times from Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack of the Brookings Institution .
Cheney noted the two were strong critics of the war effort , and saw success coming .
" They 're just back from visiting over there , " he said .
" They both have been strong critics of the war , both worked in the prior administration ; but now saying ... that we could be successful . "
Cheney also called Gen. David Petraeus , the commander in Iraq , " a great soldier , " and said his September report would point the way toward progress .
But he tried to deemphasize the General 's role , too .
" I do n't want to put the whole burden on him , " Cheney said , pointing to the " literally hundreds of thousands of people , especially the young men and women serving , who deserve credit for the effort that 's currently underway . "
Earlier in the interview , Cheney also invoked the spirits of earlier Presidents , particularly George Washington and Abraham Lincoln , to say that America should fight on in Iraq . " [ I ] f you looked simply at public opinion , for example , a lot of the key decisions in our history would never have been pursued or followed through on , " he said .
" Washington never would have carried through for seven years of the Revolution .
Abraham Lincoln would never have stayed with it in order to win the Civil War .
We would have been two separate nations by then .
' Glad ' Bush commuted Scooter Libby 's sentence Larry King brought up the subject of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , the Vice President 's former chief of staff .
After being convicted for perjury and other charges in the probe of the outing of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson , President Bush commuted Libby 's sentence .
Cheney supported the decision .
" I am glad that the President saw fit to commute Scooter 's sentence , " he said .
" I thought that was a good outcome , and I supported the President 's decision . "
Cheney demurred when asked if Libby should have been pardoned .
Instead , he focused on Libby 's ' burden ' from his guilty sentence .
" [ H ]e still has a very difficult road , " he said .
" [ H ]e needs to find work .
He 's got legal bills .
He carries the burden of having been convicted . "
' No crime ' in US Attorneys controversy The Vice President strongly defended embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who he said had the President 's full confidence .
" [ T ]he President is the one who has to evaluate the individuals who serve for them , " he said .
" He has confidence in Al , and that 's good enough for me . "
Cheney instead dismissed the investigation of the firing of the 8 US Attorneys as a ' witch hunt . '
" What 's the allegation of the wrongdoing here ?
Frankly , there is n't anything , " he asked , and answered .
" With respect to the U.S. attorneys , there 's been , I think , a bit of a witch hunt on Capitol Hill , as they keep rolling over rocks hoping they can find something . "
The Vice President went on to reason that the assertion of executive privilege against Congressional subpoenas of key White House advisers needed to be done to protect future presidents .
" [ I ] t's important for us to pass on these offices we occupy to our successors in as good a shape as we found them , " the Vice President argued .
" And that means protecting and preserving the integrity of those processes . "
Knocks Hillary Clinton ; ' probably ' done in 2009
Toward the end of the interview , King lured Cheney into 2008 's political waters .
First , he praised a letter written by Pentagon official Eric Edelman to Senator Hillary Clinton , accusing her of ' aiding the enemy ' by seeking contingency plans for withdrawal from Iraq .
" I agreed with the letter Eric Edelman wrote .
I thought it was a good letter , " he said .
He described himself as " totally neutral in the upcoming presidential contest , " only endorsing the Republican Party generally .
" I will support the Republican nominee , " he said .
" And the fact that others have signed on with Fred [ Thompson ] or John McCain or Rudy Giuliani , Mitt Romney , they 're all good men , I hope one of them is the next President . "
And ultimately , Cheney said he ' probably ' was done with public service for good .
" Probably not .
I can't think of one , " Cheney said when King asked if he would serve in any other Republican administration .
He added , " I 've had a great tour , Larry .... the time comes when you need to recognize it 's over , and for me that will be January of ' 09 . " #

US study finds link between location and anaphylaxis .
Four times as many epinephrine injectors are prescribed in Massachusetts as in New Mexico .
PAUL RAPSON / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
Potentially lethal allergic reactions are much more common in the northern United States than in the south , researchers have found .
What links geography and allergy is unknown , but the team behind the discovery suggests that sunlight might be a factor .
Extreme allergic reactions , commonly called anaphylaxis , result when the immune system overreacts to a usually harmless foreign substance , such as seafood , insect venom or peanuts .
Such reactions are becoming more common , but little is understood about their causes , partly because of the diversity of allergens and allergic reactions , which can include hives , vomiting , diarrhoea and respiratory distress .
Carlos Camargo at Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues estimated the distribution of anaphylaxis in the United States by collecting information from all 50 states about prescriptions of the adrenaline auto - injectors used to treat attacks .
Some northern states such as Massachusetts and Connecticut had more than four times more prescriptions of adrenaline , at nearly 12 per 1,000 people , than southern states such as Hawaii and New Mexico , they report in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology1 .
" We were very surprised by the large difference , but previous research has shown that a related disease , asthma , follows a latitude gradient too , so the results were not completely unexpected , " says Camargo .
Lack of sunlight
How geography affects anaphylaxis is unknown .
The team looked at many different factors , including the number of allergy specialists per 1,000 people and the frequency of medication prescription in general , but none of these explain the north - south difference .
Camargo suspects that in the north a lack of vitamin D from sunlight may lead to the development of anaphylaxis .
" We know that vitamin D affects the immune system in many different ways and that vitamin D is much harder for humans to obtain at higher latitudes , so this is something we need to look into more closely , " adds Camargo .
" Connecting vitamin D and its effects on the immune system is an interesting hypothesis that would benefit from being rigorously tested , " says Roger Katz , an allergy specialist at the University of California , Los Angeles .

Given how little we know , all ideas are welcome , he says : " There certainly are other possible explanations for these results , but thought provocation is what ultimately gets things done . "
" We know that other explanations for the north - south gradient are going to arise , and we are open to exploring them too , " agrees Camargo .
" An important next step is to see if our finding can be replicated in other countries at similar latitudes . "

Having explored Mars for three - and - a - half years in what were missions originally designed for three months , NASA 's Mars rovers are facing perhaps their biggest challenge .
For nearly a month , a series of severe Martian summer dust storms has affected the rover Opportunity and , to a lesser extent , its companion , Spirit .
The dust in the Martian atmosphere over Opportunity has blocked 99 percent of direct sunlight to the rover , leaving only the limited diffuse sky light to power it .
Scientists fear the storms might continue for several days , if not weeks .
" We 're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms , but they were never designed for conditions this intense , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator of NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
If the sunlight is further cut back for an extended period , the rovers will not be able to generate enough power to keep themselves warm and operate at all , even in a near - dormant state .
The rovers use electric heaters to keep some of their vital core electronics from becoming too cold .
Before the dust storms began blocking sunlight last month , Opportunity 's solar panels had been producing about 700 watt hours of electricity per day , enough to light a 100 - watt bulb for seven hours .
When dust in the air reduced the panels ' daily output to less than 400 watt hours , the rover team suspended driving and most observations , including use of the robotic arm , cameras and spectrometers to study the site where Opportunity is located .
On Tuesday , July 17 , the output from Opportunity 's solar panels dropped to 148 watt hours , the lowest point for either rover .
On Wednesday , Opportunity 's solar - panel output dropped even lower , to 128 watt hours .
NASA engineers are taking proactive measures to protect the rovers , especially Opportunity , which is experiencing the brunt of the dust storm .
The rovers are showing robust survival characteristics .
Spirit , in a location where the storm is currently less severe , has been instructed to conserve battery power by limiting its activities .
" We are taking more aggressive action with both rovers than we needed before , " said John Callas , project manager for the twin rovers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
By Opportunity 's 1,236th Martian day , which ended Tuesday , driving and all science observations had already been suspended .
The rover still used more energy than its solar panels could generate on that day , drawing down its battery .
" The only thing left to cut were some of the communication sessions , " Callas said .
To minimize further the amount of energy Opportunity is using , mission controllers sent commands on Wednesday , July 18 , instructing the rover to refrain from communicating with Earth on Thursday and Friday .
This is the first time either of the rovers has been told to skip communications for a day or more in order to conserve energy .
Engineers calculate that skipping communications sessions should lower daily energy use to less than 130 watt hours .
A possible outcome of this storm is that one or both rovers could be damaged permanently or even disabled .
Engineers will assess the capability of each rover after the storm clears .

1月29日付の業界紙「新文化」の1面に、「アマゾン『なか見！検索』についての紙上議論」という記事が掲載されました。「紙上議論」は、言語学出版社フォーラムという組織の代表である岡野秀夫さんによる、「アマゾンに対する危惧」という文章を基本提言とし、それに対していろんな立場の人が意見を述べるかたちになっています。
くわしい内容は「新文化」を読んでいただくとして、以下に発言者と発言の要点のみ記します。基本的に、岡野さんが提示している「反対する理由」の是非をめぐって、他の方が意見を述べています。
岡野秀夫さん( 言語学出版者フォーラム代表 )
「 アマゾンに対する危惧 」
・出版社は自らコンテンツ価値極大化を。「利用する側」になるべき
・彼らは「書店」ではない。地球規模で覇権を争う巨大世界企業であり、コンテンツの内容よりもテクノロジーと資本の論理で動く会社だ
・そういう会社からのコンテンツ提供の要請に、出版社は慎重になるべき
・ 「なか見！検索」の出現で、出版界を支えてくれた書店の利益は、減るのではないか
なか見！検索」に反対する理由>
①このシステムは読者の利便性に適っているか？ イエス
②それでは、著作権者、出版者の利益になるか？ ノー
③今まで出版界を支えてくれた書店の利益になるか？ ノー
高須次郎さん( 流対協会長、緑風出版代表 )
「 出版者の存亡に関わる――結集し組織的に対応を」
・新品とユースドを並列販売するのは、出版社への営業妨害
・読者サービスの美名の下に本のコンテンツすべてをネット書店がスキャンすることを許したら、出版社の存亡にかかわる恐れがある
・著作権ビジネスとして組織的に対応していかないと、IT企業の前で出版社は埋没する
福島聡さん( ジュンク堂書店池袋本店副店長 )
「 ネットシステム、書店も利用――座り読み歓迎の現場から」
・書物は、実際にコンテンツの一部を確認した上で「読んでみよう」という欲求(＝需要)を生み出す商品
・ジュンク堂では座り読み用の椅子・机を設置しているが、それらが売上げにマイナスの効果をもたらした感触はない
・インターネットは 「開かれた空間」であり、リアル書店がネット書店のサイトを利用することは日常的。よって、「なか見！検索」はアマゾンによるコンテンツの「囲い込み」には、なりえない
・ただし、データが容易にダウンロードできる点には注意が必要
安藤哲也さん( 楽天ブックス店長 )
「 相手にないもの追求――リアルとネットの共存は可能」
・ 「図書館栄えれば書店も栄える」の論理で、リアルとネットの共存は可能
・賢い読者はリアルとネットをうまく使い分けている
・互いに相手にないもの( サービスや売れ筋)を追求すれば、リアル書店とネット書店は共存できる
匿 名( 「なか見！検索」に参加している出版社の営業職)
「読者動かす進化重視――出版社・書店こそ努力を」
・書店の利益にならない、とはいえない。ネットで検索してリアル書店で買う人は多い
・従来の売り方のまま進化しようとしない、多くの出版社や書店に問題がある
・アマゾンの問題点は、データを拾いきれていないことと「マーケットプレイス」
Shedloads of lycra -clad peddlers nearly careered off the road this week after being told their daily exertion on two wheels could be doing more harm than good .
Tiny specks of air pollution belched from diesel - fuelled taxis and buses can damage blood vessels , and , according to the Sunday Times , could outweigh the obvious health benefits of cycling .
" The health warning will dismay the large number of commuters who have switched to bicycles to improve their fitness , to avoid high fuel prices or , in London , because they fear another terrorist attack on public transport , " the report said .
The newspaper issued its warning after research in the laboratory of David Newby , a British Heart Foundation senior lecturer in cardiology at Edinburgh University .
In his tests , 15 healthy men cycled on exercise bikes in a chamber while being exposed to levels of diesel pollution similar to those found on a congested city street .
After an hour of cycling , the scientists found their blood vessels became less flexible and produced less of a protein that breaks down blood clots in the heart - damage associated with the early stages of heart disease .
All very worrying , particularly that , as the faster a cyclist pedals the more air they breathe in , those who believe they are improving their fitness the most are storing up the biggest trouble for themselves .
" Cycling is a good thing to do , " Dr Newby insists .
" We do n't want to give the message that it is n't . "
His team has made no direct comparison of the risks versus the benefits , and what the original story failed to mention , he says , is that the situation for car drivers is even worse .
Drivers face a bigger risk as car ventilation systems vacuum up pollution at ground level , which cannot then disperse , leading to concentrations inside some three times higher than on the street .
For cyclists there is both good news and bad news .
The latter is that no type of expensive mask and filter can block the tiny carbon particles that do the damage .
" They 're just so small they behave almost like a gas , " Dr Newby says .
The positive spin is that the levels of pollution drop off considerably just a few metres from the congested source - so cyclists who stick to less busy roads should have nothing to worry about .

Mr Semel admitted all was not well with Yahoo's financial performance
In the post since 2001 , Mr Semel has been under pressure for some time amid disappointing trading results and the growing dominance of rival Google .
The firm suffered a 16 % fall in profits in the first three months of 2007 .
Mr Yang helped launch the business , which now has more than 500 million users worldwide , in 1995 .
Recent struggles
Mr Semel will take on the role of non-executive chairman but will no longer be involved in the day - to - day running of the business .
Yahoo has struggled in recent years , losing market share to rivals such as Google and being criticised for poor technology and a lack of innovation .
This is a time for new executive leadership
Terry Semel , former Yahoo chief executive
Analysis : A turnaround for Yahoo ?
See Yahoo shares
It currently accounts for about 26 % of all online searches in the US , well behind Google which has a market share above 49 % .
Announcing his departure , Mr Semel said no - one at the firm was " satisfied " with the company 's recent financial performance .
" This is a time for new executive leadership , with different skills and strengths , to step in and drive the company to realise its potential , " he said .
" It is the right thing to do and the right time is now . "
He will be much missed inside the company
Eric Schimdt , CEO , Google
Google boss Eric Schmidt paid tribute to his rival .
Speaking to BBC News in Paris , Mr Schmidt said :
" Terry is a valued friend ..
He has shown great leadership at Yahoo and he will be much missed inside the company . "
In a statement , Yahoo acknowledged that the past year had been a " difficult one " for the business .
JERRY YANG FACTFILE
Born in Taiwan , moved to US aged 10 Developed website concepts while studying at Stanford University Co-founded Yahoo in 1995 Estimated to have a personal fortune of $ 2.2b n
But it stressed that it had made progress in key areas such as developing advertising search functions and building its presence in video and on mobile platforms .
Mr Yang , 38 , created the original Yahoo search engine in 1995 alongside partner David Filo before helping to launch the business on the stock market a year later .
Since then , he has held a number of important roles overseeing corporate strategy , technological development and international expansion .
Microsoft link
Yahoo has repeatedly been linked with a deal with Microsoft to try and counter Google 's increasing supremacy in the online search market .
The two were reported to have held informal merger talks last year and to have revived discussions over possible co-operation earlier this year .
The two firms have dismissed the reports as speculation but , on both occasions , such talk led to a sharp increase in Yahoo 's share price .
Mr Semel joined
Yahoo at a time when its fortunes were at a low ebb following the collapse of the dotcom boom and helped to lead a revival in its business .
But Google 's formidable growth and concerns about Yahoo's ability to respond has led to growing doubts about the firm 's direction .
Yahoo's shares rose nearly 3 % after news of Mr Semel 's departure was revealed .

Leahy : Bush ' must go back to the rule of law ' David Edwards
Published : Sunday July 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , appearing on Face The Nation today , slammed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for not " telling the truth " during testimony before Congressional committees investigating the firing of nine US attorneys , adding that President Bush " must go back to the rule of law . "
" Well , many say he should fire the attorney general , but I think it 's more than that , " Leahy said .
" I think he has to state we have made -- we , the administration have made -- some bad mistakes in saying we 're above the law .
Nobody 's above the law .
The president 's not above the law , you 're not , I 'm not .
And he 's got to go back to the rule of law .
If we need to make changes in our Intelligence Surveillance Act , for example , we 'll do that .
We 've done this a half a dozen times already . "
Leahy added , " The irony is , though , the Department of Justice which is supposed to be very impartial , it 's supposed to be impartial to law enforcement , is being shredded by his activities . "
Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , called for Gonzales to correct the record .
" Let 's give him a chance , " he said .
When moderator Bob Schieffer questioned Specter as to the importance of the situation with the attorney general , Specter replied , " The Department of Justice is second only to the Department of Defense in protecting the American people . "
The following video is from CBS's Face the Nation , broadcast on July 29 .
Transcript : # MR. SCHIEFFER : Today on " Face the Nation , " did Attorney General Alberto Gonzales lie to Congress ?
And sports in crisis .
The divide between the Democrats and the administration has grown so wide that now Democrats want a special prosecutor to determine of the attorney general is a liar .
What is the impact of this Washington argument on the Justice Department and the American public it is supposed to serve ?
We 'll talk to key members of the Judiciary Committee -- Democratic Chairman Pat Leahy and Republican Arlen Specter .
Then we 'll turn to what may be the worst week ever in sports -- the basketball betting scandal , the dog fighting charges against football star Michael Vick and the baseball record that 's about to fall under a steroid cloud .
We 'll talk about all that with sports commentators Frank Deford , John Feinstein and Jason Whitlock .
We 'll round it out with our weekly check on politics as we bring in Jim VandeHei of politico.com .
Then I 'll have a final word on Iraq , the war that never ceases to stop .
But first , the fight over Gonzales on " Face the Nation . " ( Announcements . ) MR .
SCHIEFFER : Good morning , again .
Well , joining us now , the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate Patrick Leahy , Democrat of Vermont .
With us from Philadelphia , the committee 's Ranking Republican Senator Arlen Specter .
Senator Leahy , this week Democrats called for a special prosecutor to determine if the attorney general of the United States , the highest law enforcement officer in the government , has been lying to your committee and Congress .
This grows out of whether he told your committee the truth about whether there was disagreement within the administration over the president 's eavesdropping program , the once - secret eavesdropping program .
Just the latest in the series of controversies with your committee .
Now , you told the attorney general this week that you were going to give him one week to correct the answers that he gave to your committee .
What if he does n't ?
SEN .
LEAHY : He answered under oath at great length .
I think a lot of us , Republicans and Democrats , were incredulous at some of the answers .
I told him , frankly , I do n't trust him .
But in fairness , I 've given him the testimony .
He has a week to correct it if he wants .
I suggest he consult with a lawyer as he does it .
If he does n't correct it , then I think that there are so many errors in there that the pressure will be very , very heavily felt , whether it's a special prosecutor , a special counsel , efforts within the Congress .
The irony is , though , the Department of Justice which is supposed to be very impartial , it 's supposed to be impartial to law enforcement , is being shredded by his activities .
And if you lose confidence in law enforcement , it hurts everybody all the way down to the cop on the beat .
Frankly , at this point , the president ought to take a long look at this and ask , does he want to go down in history with this attorney general as part of his historical record ?
MR .
SCHIEFFER : Well , let me just ask you , if he does n't change testimony , then will you go along with the four Democratic senators who say there should be a special prosecutor ?
SEN .
LEAHY : I think if he does n't change then what I want to do is spend some time discussing it with Senator Specter .
This is a matter that I 'd like to approach on a bipartisan fashion .
But I think that we would also be asking whoever 's left there at the Department of Justice who does n't have to recuse themselves to take this , go through it and give us some recommendations back .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : Well , Senator Specter 's in Philadelphia with us this morning .
Let 's just ask him .
What do you think ought to be the next step here , Senator ?
SEN .
SPECTER : Well , I think we ought to give the attorney general a chance to correct the record .
There is no doubt , as I have said repeatedly for months now , that the Department of Justice would be much better off without him .
One of the problems which we have is that Senator Leahy and I have never been read into the program .
I tried to get it done when I was chairman , and we need to know precisely what there is to the program .
There have been some suggestions in the last couple of days that there may have been a separate facet of the terrorist surveillance program .
So let 's give him a chance .
The Judiciary Committee is not in the business of setting up perjury prosecutions .
What we want to do is find out what the facts are so that we can formulate public policy and legislation and get the Department of Justice back on its feet .
I think it 's premature , until he's had a chance to review the record and supplement his answers , to call for a special prosecutor .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : Yeah , let me just ask you this question , Senator Specter .
Is this just another of those so - called Washington arguments ?
Or does what happens here really matter to the average American sitting out there watching television this morning ?
SEN .
SPECTER : It matters a great deal .
First of all , we do not yet know the details of the wiretaps without warrants , and that 's an invasion on privacy , and we have n't yet gotten to the bottom of that .
Secondly , the Department of Justice is second only to the Department of Defense in protecting the American people -- investigations on terrorism , on organized crime , on violent crime , on drugs .
And that department is dysfunctional , and it's been dysfunctional for a long time .
SEN .
LEAHY : I think it 's important , because law enforcement is supposed to be impartial , and it 's supposed to follow the law .
Here we have an administration that feels they 're above the law , that the law applies to everybody except them , and we have a Department of Justice that goes along with that .
Bob , you can't -- I mean , I was a prosecutor .
Arlen Specter was a prosecutor .
A number of us in there , both Republicans and Democrats , are really upset with this , because we know how law enforcement is supposed to work .
This is going to have a devastating effect on law enforcement throughout the country if it 's not cleared up .
I think we have a responsibility to try to clear it up .
It would help if the president would stop turning a blind eye to what is really misconduct in the Department of Justice .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : So what should the president do ?
SEN .
LEAHY : Well , many say he should fire the attorney general , but I think it 's more than that .
I think he has to state we have made -- we , the administration have made -- some bad mistakes in saying we 're above the law .
Nobody 's above the law .
The president 's not above the law , you 're not , I 'm not .
And he 's got to go back to the rule of law .
If we need to make changes in our Intelligence Surveillance Act , for example , we 'll do that .
We 've done this a half a dozen times already .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : Is that what this is all about , when you come down to it , is whether or the administration has been telling you the truth about this eavesdropping program ?
SEN .
LEAHY : Well , they have n't been telling the truth .
And after the attorney general testified , you had key members of the intelligence committee that he testified about said that 's not the way it happened .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : It 's all very , very arcane , and I think that 's why it 's hard for a lot of people to understand what 's going on here .
SEN .
LEAHY :
It is , but you have to follow the law , I have to follow the law , they should have to follow the law .
That 's the bottom line .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : Do you think , Senator Specter , as The New York Times said today , that perhaps you should consider , the Congress should consider impeaching the attorney general if the president can't get him to leave ?
SEN .
SPECTER : I think it 's premature to consider that .
Bob , we do not know if the administration has been leveling with us or not on the terrorist surveillance program .
I do n't know , because I have n't been read into the program .
Finally , I got a call yesterday from a ranking administration official describing the program to me , and on Monday , tomorrow , I 'm going to be read into the program .
I want to know what the program is all about .
I do n't know if they 've been telling us the truth or not , because I do not know what the program is .
Essentially , what the attorney general has said , is that there are two programs , more than the one the president has identified .
I want to find out if that 's true or not .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : All right .
So he has a week here .
SEN .
LEAHY : He has a week , but the testimony he gave is not truthful .
I want the truth .
That 's all I want .
MR .
SCHIEFFER : All right , gentlemen , thank you very much .
We 'll be back in a minute to talk about this week that was in sports . #
SAN FRANCISCO , May 2 —
There is open revolt on the Web .
Sophisticated Internet users have banded together over the last two days to publish and widely distribute a secret code used by the technology and movie industries to prevent piracy of high - definition movies .
The broader distribution of the code may not pose a serious threat to the studios , because it requires some technical expertise and specialized software to use it to defeat the copy protection on Blu-ray and HD DVD discs .
But its relentless spread has already become a lesson in mob power on the Internet and the futility of censorship in the digital world .
An online uproar came in response to a series of cease - and - desist letters from lawyers for a group of companies that use the copy protection system , demanding that the code be removed from several Web sites .
Rather than wiping out the code — a string of 32 digits and letters in a specialized counting system — the legal notices sparked its proliferation on Web sites , in chat rooms , inside cleverly doctored digital photographs and on user - submitted news sites like Digg.com .
My friend Harry had a unique response to my little story about visiting Cindy Sheehan in Crawford the other day .
Most people who called or e-mailed , commented on the emotional ( or political ) impact it had on them .
Harry , however , wanted to know all about the Bush compound .
" Why would he live out there in the middle of nowhere ? " he wondered .
I did a little diggin ' around and I want to tell you about the Bush Compound .
My favorite L.A. band is actually a Texas band living in L.A .
I can't reveal their name because the drummer told me a story in confidence .
His great grandfather was the local grand - something - or - other of the Ku Klux Klan in that part of Texas .
And he owned a pig farm .
And that pig farm is now " the Western White House .
" Bush bought the pig farm -- the KKK fella had long departed for the Great Klavern in the sky ... or wherever -- in 1999 , soon after reaping a $ 14.3 million dollar profit in the sweetheart deal he got by selling the Texas Rangers .
( Bush 's value - add on the deal was the brilliant move to trade away Sammy Sosa just before he became a household name . )
Bush bought it as a prop .
It is n't a real ranch and he 's afraid of horses anyway .
It really and truly is just a photo - op backdrop for the " reality " tv show , " The Tragic Presidency of George W. Bush , " that masks the biggest theft in the history of our nation .
Harry wants to know why Bush chose a place so remote from civilization and in so desolate and barren an area .
It is more than just a choice to avoid reality -- something Cindy completely shattered anyway ( ruined the whole damn vacation and pissed him off no end ! ) .
Back in 2001 , before 9 - 11 made anyone pay any serious attention to Bush , complainers were already complaining that he was spending as much time out of D.C. as he was in D.C.
He was looking like he was going to preside over a very hands - off , passive presidency ( wow - - did we ever get that wrong ! ) .
" I think it is so important for a president to spend some time away from Washington , in the heartland of America , " Bush explained .
Is Crawford " the heartland ? "
Before Cindy even said anything when I met her last week , she brushed a fire ant off my face .
Crawford 's environs are crawling with 'em .
If the area does n't insulate the inhabitants from aggressive , stinging insects , it does insulate them from people , the kind , presumably , that represents " the heartland " ( unless " the heartland " is just about geography and not about the American community ) .
The roads are narrow , unmarked , some are rutted ; a stretch is dirt .
And the re-done pig farm sits behind electronic fencing .
KOS made some very good observations about Bush 's pig farm : " The world of Crawford insulates travelers in another way as they leave the shopping malls of Waco behind .
An invisible ideological cocoon seems woven around mid-Texas .
Its threads consist of strong strands of conservatism knotted together with strings of distrust of all things from the outside world .
Simply put , ' If you 're not from here , you do n't belong here . '
But membership can , it seems , be bought .
The president is n't a long - time resident of this community , having moved into his new digs on Election Day , 2000 , but his picture , as well as that of the First Lady , grace a tall billboard welcoming travelers to the area .
He literally gives all who enter a ' thumbs up ' . "
( My pal Andy has written me some instructions for how to insert a photo and if it works you see that billboard at the edge of town with me standing in front of it . )
Cheryl Seal wrote a well - researched piece in 2003 that goes into a lot of details about the pig farm
Bush revamped and had ready for action on the exact day he , his brother , Katherine Harris and the U.S. Supreme Court stole the 2000 election .
" Have you seen all those article and pictures of Bush 'at home on the ranch ' in Crawford -- the ones that imply that he is ' just an ole ranch hand ' more comfortable on the family homestead than in the ' Big City , ' be it Austin or D.C. ?
Well , if you bought this image , you 've been royally snookered .
The Bush family homestead in Crawford is nothing more than an elaborate set , " she wrote .
" The whole idea behind the ranch set , of course , was so that the public could be treated to footage of Bush seeking a quiet ' retreat ' at the family ranch .
Americans would thus assume that the ranch was a rooted family homestead or compound like the one Kennedy 's had in Martha 's Vineyard or FDR had at Campobello .
But when Bush retreated into his ' homestead ' in November , 2000 , he was merely walking onto a prepared set upon which the paint had barely dried , let alone even the barest of roots put down !
Until Bush and handlers decided that a rural ranch would be a slick bit of PR for the presidential campaign , Bush had no interest in a ' home on the range . '
Instead , his preferred weekend retreat was to the Rainbo Club , an exclusive lakeside hunting club in Henderson County , about an hour south of Dallas .
" It is widely assumed that when Bush is finally out of the White House he 'll sell the pig farm and move to Dallas .
The pig farm compound is closer to Waco than the Branch Davidian Compound was but no one ever mentions that for some reason .
And , of course , Bush does n't own any of the cattle on his " ranch " .
They are the cattle of the previous owner , who still lives there and actually runs Bush 's little movie set for him .
As for the horses you see in the backdrops ...
Bush is afraid of them and has never ridden any ; like so much in his anti-reality - based presidency , it 's all window dressing and all for show ) .
I had never honestly considered this question before until I read the article " A Billion Tons of Nickel " by Chad Orzel ( In case you were wondering his article was inspired by a previous article of mine : A Floating City on Venus ) .
The author brings up a good point :
What advantage would mining the asteroid belt really have ?
After reading his article I honestly could not come up with a reason off the top of my head .
I had just assumed it would be a great thing that one would jump at the opportunity to take advantage of .
He made an excellent point questioning the economic viability of such a mining operation :
Absent some project that requires vast quantities of whatever you can mine out of the rock , the main effect of this would seem to be a global crash in the price of whatever you can mine out of the rock .
At which point , I do n't know how your recoup your investment .
This is barely Economics 101 -- if you have a billion tons of nickel sitting around , and nothing to do with it , the price will be very low .
We 've done the experiment , after all -- ask the Spanish about all that New World gold ...

and
( And circular arguments like " We need a billion tons of nickel to build space ships to mine the asteroids / colonize the moons of Jupiter / fly to Alpha Centauri " are cheating . )
does

Frustrated that I could not find a good answer quickly enough I decided to a little research and here is what I came up with :
He 's absolutely correct .
Though the article is missing the true incentive to asteroid mining .
The key to asteroids are that they have a relatively high proportion of precious metals such as platinum and those in the platinum group .
On top of that they also contain many other metals in high demand such as aluminum , copper , and titanium among many others .
Here is a chart of the approximate composition of a C - type ( Carbonaceous ) asteroid ( including potential values per metric ton in dollars ) .
According to the chart platinum contains roughly 1,000 parts per billion in a typical C - type asteroid .
This equates to about 2,000 metric tons in a one kilometer diameter asteroid or approximately $ 50 billion worth of platinum .
Albeit the price of the metal would drop as more metal is introduced into the market but nowhere near the catastrophic affect that Chad proposes with the mining of nickel .
This is simply because platinum is in very high demand and an exorbitant amount is n't being introduced .
The other metals I mention could also conceivably be very profitable though likely not to the same extent .
Now the situation he describes with the introduction of Aztec gold is a bit different than platinum .
During that time gold was primarily sought after for its beauty and luster alone .
Platinum on the other hand is used in jeweleryindustry -- especially in electronics .
This should further resist a collapse in the metal 's economy and perhaps increase the economy overall .
Even a drastic price drop in platinum would n't be so bad .
One can simply look at the history of aluminum .
Aluminum used to be worth more in weight than gold .
Then in 1886 a young engineer from Oberlin , Ohio named Charles Martin Hall invented a new method of extracting aluminum that eventually made it cheaper to obtain by a factor of 200 .
Clearly the economy was n't ruined by an over - abundance of aluminum .
This is because aluminum was rare in pure form but had many potential uses .
The case is very similar for platinum .
At the end of his article he also left us with this :
And though the space enthusiast in me really wanted to justify mining the asteroids with this I knew he was correct ; we have to be realistic and know how the world works .
I believe I 've addressed the incentive to mine the asteroids without using this cheating circular argument though .
Thus since we have created a market for going to the asteroid belt we can now fairly use this argument !
Because with the advent of mining operations we will indeed create a whole new ' space market . '
Sending materials up into space is costly ( currently around $ 12 million per metric ton ) .
This means that billion tons of nickel now has a new purpose -- building those spaceships to mine the asteroids .
So , while gleaning materials to build ships that can mine the asteroid belt or to build colonies is not the initial reason to mine the asteroid belt it is a natural progression and soonbecome an incentive in itself .
For more information on the potential of mining asteroids I suggest reading through these two sites : Asteroid Mining for Profit ( chart came from this site ) andAlso , if anyone has any counter - arguments or questions I would definitely like to hear them .
I tried to stick to the main points to maintain the brevity of this post so I 'm sure there is still much to discuss if anyone is interested .
Choosing Daniel Craig as the new James Bond upset some fans
Casino Royale clips
The first verdicts on Craig - who was a controversial choice to play the spy - have been gushing .
The Daily Mirror said he was seen " oozing the kind of edgy menace that recalls Sean Connery at his best " .
And the Daily Telegraph wrote that he " steps with full assuredness into Sean Connery 's old handmade shoes " .
Connery , who appeared in seven Bond films , was recently voted the best 007 of all time .
The actor has promised a tougher and grittier 007
In the new film , Bond makes a break from the super - slick , stereotyped spy of the past , the UK newspaper critics said - but all declared the end result a triumph .
" It 's Bond , but not as we 've known it , " according to the Telegraph .
" The guns and action are there ... the girls are certainly there ... but the clonking double entendres of the old days are gone - in their place is a much more teasing , smartly written prospect . "
' Unpredictable and vulnerable '
Daniel Craig had a face " like an Easter Island statue " and makes " a terrific debut " , it added .
" He manages to exude not only danger and unpredictability and wit - but also , and this is a first , some vulnerability . "
Daniel Craig has earned comparisons with Sean Connery
Craig 's impressive physique makes him " a far more plausible Bond than many of his predecessors " , it added .
" But his main asset quickly becomes evident .
He can act . "
The action was " edgy " , the paper said , with stunts that were more physical and violence that was more raw .
The Mirror said the James Bond rule book had been " well and truly torn up " for the 21st official film .
' More human '
" From the start you can tell this is n't your average Bond film , " its critic wrote , adding that it was " easily the best film since GoldenEye " .
Based on Ian Fleming 's first Bond novel , Casino Royale begins with a brutal black - and - white fight scene in a bare bathroom .
Since Craig was chosen , the actor and film - makers have promised a more human and gritty character .
Casino Royale reaches cinemas on 17 November .

Are teens insanely boring ?
Upon the hot heavy - petted hard drive inside the overworked MacBook Pro on which I am typing these words right now sits a rather wide variety of video clips -- homemade , semi-pro and otherwise -- of a nature that would surely make an evangelical congregation scream and their pastor secretly swoon and a few adult - film companies send me a nice fruit basket as a personal thank - you .
I know , big shock .
I am also , I humbly admit , in comfortable possession of large quantities of digital pictures and letters and even IM transcripts of a deeply delectable and hotly intimate nature that could , given their content and their overexposed flesh tones and should they fall into the wrong mealy hands , entirely ruin my chances of becoming a state senator , an insurance adjuster or dorm floor leader .
I believe I am rather OK with this .
There is also , of course , much more mundane fare : Pictures from parties .
At the beach .
Posing with friends and family and leering at the camera and looking tired or happy or baffled or drunk or entirely frightening to small children .
There are yoga pictures .
Head shots .
Girlfriends .
Holidays .
Vacations .
Personal notes and spiritual meanderings and deep thoughts about shallow topics ( and vice versa ) , scraps of columns that never made it to fruition right alongside brilliant hilarious full - length pieces that were never allowed to run because they apparently contain too many dildo / Jesus / you - might - offend - someone - in - Walnut - Creek references .
I tell you all this because a )
The Chronicle does n't have to pay for my home office computer and therefore I am allowed to endow it as I desire ; b) I sometimes flatter myself into believing it is my job to hint at secret salacious personal anecdotes that make me sound much kinkier and weirder and more scandalous than I probably am .
But most importantly , I tell you this because c ) I am not a member of Generation Next , and therefore not a glimpse of any of said material is posted anywhere online , and never really will be , and no one really cares about this fact ( and in fact , most are probably rather happy about it ) , and this is exactly as it should be .
Ah , but if you 've been reading the media lately , this is far from the case for Generation Next , that highly visible , fascinatingly shameless , apparently horrifying segment of tech - soaked teens and twentysomethings who are , right this minute , photographing and itemizing and reorganizing their nervous little worlds and then blithely revealing every quasi - sordid detail on MySpace and Facebook and YouTube and MyFaceLogSlutBook because , well , because it 's just what they do .
Perhaps you 've heard .
Perhaps you know them .
They 're the ones entering online contests with names like Hottest Naked Dorm Whore and AreYourBoobsBig.com .
They 're the ones you see taking endless low - grade cell phone pictures of themselves at the beach in Cabo as they binge drink and sunburn their genitals and give mock oral sex to a beer bong and posting them online , thus crushing their shot at becoming CFO of Hewlett - Packard in , say , 2024 .
Yes , they are the " show everything " generation , always live , always " onstage , " always craving to snort a line of cheap reality show - style fame no matter what the cost to personal freedom or privacy or the fact that no one really cares how many times they made out with a certain hottie backstage at the Linkin Park concert and then threw up three times .
It is , some say , a serious issue .
An impending disaster .
Some even believe it will be the humiliating downfall of a generation as already many Nexters entering the workforce are finding that HR departments are increasingly performing actual online background checks , and should you have had all your icky dating habits and fetish for pot brownies and spanking photographed and posted online , well , you 're probably not getting that sweet gig as sales assistant at Smith Barney .
Shame .
Here is the question : Does it matter ?
Should you care ?
Is it really a new , panicky , frightening mutation of the culture that confounds adults and shakes up our notions of privacy and secrecy and cheap dime - store fame ?
Well , not really .
For one thing , if everyone in Generation Next eventually has their tell - all MySpace journals that only 10 friends and their therapist are forced to read , then soon enough the whole culture , the entire workforce will mutate and absorb the phenomenon , and it will become exactly no big deal at all that you once revealed your crazy love of pet rats and tequila shooters and boys ' butts online , because hell , everyone revealed similar silliness and everyone saw everyone else 's drunken underwear and everyone stopped giving much of a damn about 10 years ago .
But there is another big factor in the messy analysis of this supposedly brazen generation , another angle that gets drastically overlooked in the shock and awe of this new wave of online teen behavior .
It is this :
After scanning your 125th profile of yet another pale , spazzy Good Charlotte fan from Minneapolis , after seeing 257 pictures of Jenny from Orlando 's drunk , giggly friends at hookup parties and reading about her love of dolphin tattoos and her desire to get her eyebrow pierced , oh my God my mom will kill me lol , it hits you : Sweet Jesus with a bottle of Tanqueray and a polysyllabic thought , these are the most boring people I have ever seen in my entire life .
It is like watching ferrets finger - paint .
It is like watching kittens with ADD chase flashlight beams .
It is like reading only US Weekly and eating chocolate Pop - Tarts and masturbating with a brown Microsoft Zune .
Interesting for a few minutes , then it's all oh my God my brain is seeping through my toes and everything hurts and please make it stop .
Put another way : Aside from the " thrill " of seeing bits of young flesh and cringing at the 10 million ways teens can find to abuse the English language , there is really nothing of substance here .
All that revealing and all that shamelessness and all that detailing of personal lives and you end up with ... well , not much at all .
And why ?
Simple : No matter how " fearless " they seem , the YouTube generation simply have yet to do much of anything truly interesting .
There are , for example , no brutal divorces .
There are no terrorist offspring .
There are no intriguing scars of the world , no warped wisdom , no kinky sex and no mortgage - payment blues and no experimental gender play and no painful rashes in unexpected places .
There are no wild travel tales to share , no lost weekends in Vegas with three midget hookers and a small pony , no stalkers , no tales of violent acts of revenge .
There is , in other words , very little of that most precious and revealing of personal issues known as , you know , life .
Hey , they 're teens .
It 's supposed to be cute and shallow and irritating and angsty .

Congress wants all international companies to end their investment in Iran now and is pushing through a bill that would penalise companies that fail to do so .
The British government , along with other European governments , views the US approach as draconian and are lobbying hard against it .
The US move reflects frustration at the failure so far of western diplomacy to persuade Iran to stop its uranium enrichment programme , which the US , Britain and others suspect is a step towards achieving a nuclear weapons capability .
Iran denies it has ambitions to build a nuclear weapon .
A senior British banking source said today there was a great deal of annoyance in the City with the US approach .
The two British banks most frequently mentioned in Washington in relation to Iran are HSBC and Standard Chartered .
The banker said both HSBC and Standard Chartered have run down their operations in Iran and maintain a modest presence in Tehran .
However , much of their former business there , which consisted principally of managing payments between companies , has now been picked up by German and French banks , whose governments have resisted pressure from Washington , the source said .
The US state department has been pressing for disengagement for months .
But the move is being given added impetus by the Iran counter - proliferation bill going through Congress , which would penalise the US interests of companies that continue to have a presence in Iran .
European governments are lobbying against the bill .
The chairman of the House foreign affairs committee , Tom Lantos , said : " Our goal must be zero foreign investment . "
The bill appears to have overwhelming support in Congress .
Congress passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act in 1996 that threatened action against non-US governments and companies , but gave the state department discretion over when to implement it .
The new bill proposes to remove that discretion .
The US state department prefers persuasion to coercion , fearing the latter will alienate allies , and is opposed to the bill .
The United Nations security council has so far passed two resolutions imposing limited sanctions against Iran , mainly economic and travel bans , and a third round of sanctions is being discussed .
The US administration sees it as inconsistent for European countries to support sanctions but to allow companies to continue trading .
But the British government says that it has no legal basis to order the banks to close their Iranian operations .
European diplomats meanwhile say that the US is aiming at the wrong targets and should be focusing on Arab and far east banks and companies that have greater exposure to the Iranian market .
They point out that any penalties imposed by the US would be in breach of World Trade Organisation rules .
A senior US official said that there have been discussions between Stuart Levey , the US undersecretary of state at the Treasury , and the British government , though he acknowledged the involvement of British banks and companies was not as deep as some on the continent .
He said the European Union had $ 22bn ( £ 11 bn ) in export credits to Iran in 2005 , the latest figure available .
" So we have been in discussions with many of the leading governments - Germany , France , Italy , Spain - the four largest countries with exposure to export credits .
This is really quite inconsistent with where we are going with UN sanctions , " he said .
" We have had two sanctions resolutions : so why would you be promoting trade with Iran ? "
He added : " Germany and Italy and France have all told us they have begun to diminish ( their involvement ) .
There has been a slight downturn . "
Hi there .
I 'm David fucking Milch .
You may remember me as the creative tour - de - force behind Deadwood , a critically acclaimed HBO series that ended prematurely so that I could launch John From Cincinnati .
Some people say that was like ending Seinfeld in season 3 to jump right into The Michael Richards Show , but those people do n't understand the subtlety and nuance of ten annoying surfers in varying states of insanity wandering around and getting into pointless arguments with one another until there 's a clumsy physical altercation and a pointless " mysterious " ending .
This is a summation of the lessons that I learned during my transition from Deadwood to John From Cincinnati .
How I grew as a writer .
The mistakes I made with Deadwood .
What I was doing right all along .
Hopefully it can help someone out there to get into the business of writing television that 's half as good as the stuff I make .
YOUR FIRST STEP
Your first step is to think of what genre you want to work in .
There 's a lot of them , right ?
Seems like you 've got a tough choice ahead of you , but you do n't .
The only genre you need to work in is " a group of loosely connected people stand on a beach and stare off into the ocean when they take a break from mysterious things happening to them " .
I know what you 're thinking .
That 's basically Lost , right ?
No .
Lost was simply the first show to work within this genre .
There have been hundreds of westerns and thousands of comedies .
Is it right for there to be just one show about a group of loosely connected people that stand on a beach and stare off into the ocean when they take a break from mysterious things happening to them ?
I think not .
Working in this genre is great because , really , you can write whatever you want and you can make it fit since the show will be " mysterious " .
Let 's say you want to write some sci- fi , specifically shit about astronauts and rockets and the like .
Go ahead and write your astronaut story , then have those astronauts crash land on this crazy beach where things are n't as they seem .
The astronauts can come across the sandswept top floors of the World Trade Center 's twin towers .
Punctuate even the worst episode with an ending like that and people will tune in next week , guaranteed .
Actually , no .
Do n't use that .
That 's my idea .
Another Step
Many young writers make the mistake of giving their characters actions that make sense within the framework of each person 's motivations and personality .
I was guilty of this myself while working on Deadwood .
See , if a character merely does what you would reasonably expect him to do , there 's no real room for unpredictability .
No way to leave your creative fingerprints smudged all over every frame of the show .
Those of you who are eagle - eyed will notice that two characters from John From Cincinnati are essentially the same person .
One talks to a bird and one talks to a stuffed bear , and when the bear and bird are n't around each man speaks to himself / God / ghosts .
Everyone else on the show is equally crazy but in a general way that does n't make sense or follow any guidelines .
Do you have any idea how much freedom that gives me to be creative ?
Characterization is a burden .
It will only weigh you down .
These processors are buggy as hell , and some of these bugs do n't just cause development / debugging problems , but will * ASSUREDLY * be exploitable from userland code .
Full ( current ) errata from Intel :
http://download.intel.com/design/processor/specupdt/31327914.pdf
We bet there are many more errata not yet announced -- every month this file gets larger .
Intel understates the impact of these erraata very significantly .
Almost all operating systems will run into these bugs .
Basically the MMU simply does not operate as specified / implimented in previous generations of x86 hardware .
It is not just buggy , but Intel has gone further and defined " new ways to handle page tables " ( see page 58 ) .
Some of these bugs are along the lines of " buffer overflow " ; where a write - protect or non-execute bit for a page table entry is ignored .
Others are floating point instruction non-coherencies , or memory corruptions -- outside of the range of permitted writing for the process -- running common instruction sequences .
All of this is just unbelievable to many of us .
http://www.geek.com/images/geeknews/2006Jan/core_duo_errata__2006_01_21__full.gif
Note that some errata like AI65 , AI79 , AI43 , AI39 , AI90 , AI99 scare the hell out of us .
Some of these are things that cannot be fixed in running code , and some are things that every operating system will do until about mid-2008 , because that is how the MMU has always been managed on all generations of Intel / AMD / whoeverelse hardware .
Now Intel is telling people to manage the MMU 's TLB flushes in a new and different way .
Yet even if we do so , some of the errata listed are unaffected by doing so .
As I said before , hiding in this list are 20 - 30 bugs that cannot be worked around by operating systems , and will be potentially exploitable .
I would bet a lot of money that at least 2 - 3 of them are .
For instance , AI90 is exploitable on some operating systems ( but not OpenBSD running default binaries ) .
At this time , I cannot recommend purchase of any machines based on the Intel Core 2 until these issues are dealt with ( which I suspect will take more than a year ) .
Intel must be come more transparent .
( While here , I would like to say that AMD is becoming less helpful day by day towards open source operating systems too , perhaps because their serious errata lists are growing rapidly too ) .
In just the past six weeks , two supernovae have flared up in an obscure galaxy in the constellation Hercules .
Never before have astronomers observed two of these powerful stellar explosions occurring in the same galaxy so close together in time .
Image right : Supernova 2007ck ( left ) is a Type II event , and Supernova 2007 co ( right ) is a Type Ia event .
The image is a combination of red , green , and blue pictures taken on June 9 and 12 by the Ultraviolet / Optical Telescope on NASA ’s Swift satellite , which was designed primarily to study another type of stellar explosion – gamma ray bursts .
Click image to enlarge .
Credit : Stefan Immler NASA / GSFC , Swift Science Team .
The galaxy , known as MCG +05 - 43-16 , is 380 million light - years from Earth .
Until this year , astronomers had never sighted a supernova popping off in this stellar congregation .
A supernova is an extremely energetic and life - ending explosion of a star .
Making the event even more unusual is the fact that the two supernovae belong to different types .
Supernova 2007ck is a Type II event – which is triggered when the core of a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses gravitationally , producing a shock wave that blows the star to smithereens .
Supernova 2007ck was first observed on May 19 .
In contrast , Supernova 2007 co is a Type Ia event , which occurs when a white dwarf star accretes so much material from a binary companion star that it blows up like a giant thermonuclear bomb .
It was discovered on June 4 , 2007 .
A white dwarf is the exposed core of a star after it has ejected its atmosphere ; it ’s approximately the size of Earth but with the mass of our Sun .
" Most galaxies have a supernova every 25 to 100 years , so it ’s remarkable to have a galaxy with two supernovae discovered just 16 days apart , " says Stefan Immler of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center .
In 2006 Immler used NASA ’s Swift satellite to image two supernovae in the elliptical galaxy NGC 1316 , but both of those explosions were Type Ia events , and they were discovered six months apart .
The simultaneous appearance of two supernovae in one galaxy is an extremely rare occurrence , but it ’s merely a coincidence and does not imply anything unusual about MCG +05-43-16 .
Because the two supernovae are tens of thousands of light - years from each other , and because light travels at a finite speed , astronomers in the galaxy itself , or in a different galaxy , might record the two supernovae exploding thousands of years apart .

I have a laptop and a desktop sitting on my not so huge desk and I particularly hate typing on my ancient ( 4.5 years old ) laptop when few of the keys are missing and the mousepad is sticky .
The conveniently placed keyboard and mouse of the desktop are very handy , so when I heard about Synergy it made things very easy to handle .
The small application lets you share your keyboard and mouse across all the monitors and also across multiple platforms , Windows , MAC OSX and even multiple variants of Unix ( Linux , Solaris etc ) .
The small application runs on multiple platforms and is very easy to configure and install .
It took me about 5 minutes to install and configure on both my laptop and desktop , but another 20 minutes to figure out how to connect them both .
The problem was the firewall client .
The software has stopped evolving after 2006 , may be some popularity will help .

“ Against the Odds ” is the autobiography of vacuum guru James Dyson .
Jason recently mentioned it in our internal Campfire chat room : “ One of the best books about design , business , invention , and entrepreneurship I ’ve ever read .
Highly recommended .
It ’s really inspirational .
His persistence is otherworldly .
You wo n’t believe what he went through to get this product to market . ”
Here ’s one customer ’s review of the book at Amazon :
I especially enjoyed the part about the early development of the machine , in which he made something like one version per day for over three years , varying things one at a time , measuring everything to exhaustion , all the while sinking further and further into debt .
Edisonian it was , but sometimes that is the only way — the quest for the quick breakthrough emphasized by modern industrial managers can be a real obstacle to progress .
Ahead , a couple of interesting excerpts from articles on Dyson …
The inventor 's life , he says in The Independent , is " one of failure " .
When you watch a writer on a movie programme tearing up page after page , you think he ’s in utter despair .
And , in many ways , that ’s what it ’s like for us , but you learn much more in fact from an experiment which did n’t work out how you intended , but instead sheds some light on possibly another way of doing something .
It can get very depressing but then suddenly , one day you make a break through , and that ’s very exciting …
You ca n’t go out and do market research to try to solve these problems about what to do next because usually , or very often , you ’re doing the opposite of what market research would tell you .
You ca n’t base a new project two years ahead on current market trends and what users are thinking at the moment .
That sounds very arrogant .
But it is n’t arrogance .
You ca n’t go and ask your customers to be your inventors .
That ’s your job …
The article also describes the suspended table in the company ’s boardroom :
Mr Dyson thought it might “ be nice ” to have a table with no legs .
At all .
So in the company ’s boardroom there is a giant glass table that is suspended from the ceiling by four cables .
Another cable in the centre anchors it to the floor .
And there you have the perfect example of how form fuses with function in Mr Dyson ’s world .
Bush 's sarcastic response sends a girl into tears Nick Juliano

Although his biting sarcasm in response to unfriendly questions can make members of the White House press corps grumble under their breath , President Bush got a different reaction from a 13 - year - old girl who asked him about immigration during a forum in Ohio .
The Washington Times reports Jessica Hackerd was left in tears after Bush gave her a wry " yeah , thanks " in response to her query , drawing laughter from the crowd of 400 in Brecksville , Ohio Tuesday .
Bush immediately began to backpedal when he saw the reaction from Hackerd , who told the Times she was crying because she is very shy and was nervous questioning the president .
" No , it 's a great question .
No , I appreciate that , " Bush said , before giving a more - than - 1,100 - word answer about the death of his immigration bill .
The 13 - year - old , who was at the forum with her parents and younger sister , continued to wipe tears from her eyes for several minutes , the Times reported , and Bush again tried to encourage the young girl .
" It 's a great question by the way , and I 'm glad you asked it , " he said .
After the appearance , a Bush aide ushered Jessica and her family backstage to meet with the president .
" He said it was really brave of me to do that and he said he probably would n't have been able to do that , " Jessica told the Times .
" And he said it was the first time anybody had asked him about [ immigration ] since it happened . "

THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE .
I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION , WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE .
I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ .
MY PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY FATHER , WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , AND BRAVELY SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY .
IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN - EIGHTIES , MY FATHER , THEN VICE - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , SOUGHT TO WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN .
THIS UNSUCCESSFUL VENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A FALLING OUT WITH HIS IRAQI PARTNER , WHO SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF KUWAIT , A WHOLLY - OWNED U.S. - BRITISH SUBSIDIARY .
MY FATHER RE - SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991 AT A COST OF SIXTY - ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS ( $ 61,000,000,000 ) .
OUT OF THAT COST , THIRTY - SIX BILLION DOLLARS ( $ 36,000,000,000 ) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS PARTNERS IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF MONARCHIES , AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ( $ 16,000,000,000 ) BY GERMAN AND JAPANESE PARTNERS .

WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS , WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ .
THAT IS WHY MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE .
OUR DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE SITTING VICE - PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , RICHARD CHENEY , WHO IS AN ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE ALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY , AND CONDOLEEZA RICE , WHOSE PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER .

Right .
This is the same mentality that looked at a Univac and thought " Well , is n't that lovely ?
I think we 'll only need 8 of those in the entire world .
And no mere mortal would ever want to own one . "
Boy , were those people stupid .

THE Arab world has long been criss - crossed by feuds and rivalries .
But if there is one point on which Arabs have agreed for more than half a century it is the justice of the Palestinian cause .
Much as they may have loathed him in private , all Arab leaders had to show public respect for Yasser Arafat , the emblematic freedom fighter ( and terrorist ) who as leader of the Fatah movement personified the Palestinian struggle from the 1960s until his death three years ago .
That is why the scenes from Gaza have shocked Arabs far beyond Palestine .
Arafat 's portrait was torn off office walls and smashed under the boots of the Islamist fighters of Hamas .
The Palestinian flag was hauled down and the green banner of Islam hoisted in its place .
In one brutal week Hamas 's swift destruction of Arafat 's Fatah movement in Gaza summed up a change that is spreading across a broad swathe of the Middle East .
Secular nationalism of the sort Fatah stood for is coming to look like the weak force and radical Islam like the strong force .
This poses a huge danger to a region already beset by violent conflicts .
What is worse , Western policy is in danger of strengthening the wrong side by making the Islamists look like martyrs and the secularists like traitors .
In Washington this week George Bush met Ehud Olmert , Israel 's prime minister , to work out what to do after Hamas 's seizure of power ( see article ) .
Their plan , which may be co-ordinated by Tony Blair when he steps down as Britain 's prime minister , is to keep Hamas penned up in its Gaza enclave and to shower love , money and weapons on Palestine 's president , Mahmoud Abbas , whose Fatah - dominated security forces are still more or less in control of the larger and more populous West Bank .
The hope is that if Gaza fails under Hamas while the West Bank prospers under Fatah , Palestinian opinion will eventually swing back behind the moderates .
Can such a plan possibly work ?
There are reasons specific to Palestine that suggest it will not .
But the first point to note is general .
Any Arab leader who wins the label “ moderate ” and is showered as a result of this with American love and money is in danger of being called a traitor .
The most dangerous love
Egypt 's president , Anwar Sadat , was called a traitor for making his courageous peace with Israel in 1979 ( and assassinated by jihadists two years later ) .
Arafat was called a traitor after shaking hands with an Israeli prime minister on the White House lawn .
In Lebanon right now the Hizbullah movement calls the beleaguered government of Fouad Siniora traitorous because it is propped up by France and America .
Iraq 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , needs to keep his distance from America to fend off accusations that he is a puppet of the occupation .
And , of course , the assumption of many Muslims that a pro-American leader must in some way be a traitor to the cause extends beyond the Arab world : in Pakistan and Afghanistan Presidents Musharraf and Karzai have constantly to face down the cry that by allying with the superpower they have sold out their countries — or , worse , their religion .
America 's allies cannot stop the martyrs from calling them traitors .
America has made itself deeply unpopular in the Islamic world by invading Iraq and standing by Israel .
This is bound to taint any Muslim leader who looks as if he owes his position to American military or economic power .
But guilt by association is only one half of the reason for the growing popularity of the martyrs and the spreading idea that America 's allies must be traitors .
The other half is that , by comparison with the traitors , the martyrs look clean .
When Arafat returned to Palestine from exile his honeymoon was brief .
The returning hero created a regime of a kind all too familiar in the Arab world .
It was riddled by corruption and ruled over by a sinister mukhabarat — the secret - police network that spies on and bullies the citizenry in most Arab states .
By contrast , Hamas in Palestine , Hizbullah in Lebanon and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan have earned a reputation for both honesty and efficiency .
They often provide the poor with the health and social services that the state fails to deliver .
When Hamas blew up Fatah 's security headquarters last week , many Arabs silently cheered .
All the more pity that Mr Bush has lately dropped his efforts to push Arab allies towards greater accountability and human rights .
The banker in the suit
The martyrs have another selling point .
They are still “ resisting ” .
During the Lebanon war last summer Hizbullah won millions of admirers for breaking the spell of Israeli invincibility .
Hamas claimed credit for forcing Israel to evacuate its settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip two years ago .
Salam Fayyad , the new Palestinian prime minister installed by Mr Abbas , is a decent man .
But he is a former World Bank employee in a suit .
The Hamas fighter with a bandanna and machinegun makes much better box office .
After Fatah 's debacle in Gaza , Mr Bush and Mr Olmert see an opportunity to prove via a Hamas - free government in the West Bank that moderation pays .
But it is not enough for Israel and America to release the economic help they withheld from the Palestinians when Hamas was still formally in charge .
For the Palestinians ' principal grievance is not economic .
What they chiefly want is an end to Israel 's occupation of the West Bank as well as Gaza so that they can enjoy an independent national existence in both places .
And in this respect the West Bank is a tougher problem than Gaza , because it remains speckled by Israeli settlements and throttled by checkpoints .
What America must now prove is that its moderate Arab allies , far from being traitors , can actually deliver desirable results .
In the case of Palestine , Mr Abbas and his new prime minister have to show not only that they can govern cleanly but also that they can get Israel to start dismantling outposts and leaving the West Bank .
This , as it happens , is not something martyrs can do : Hamas 's rockets just make the Israelis less willing to take risks .
But to offer the moderates money and no visible progress towards statehood is to treat them with contempt — and to invite Arabs everywhere to do the same .
The lethal strain has already spread from Asia to Europe
An official said it would take a number of days to determine whether the birds are carrying the strain of the avian flu that is lethal to humans .
He said evidence suggested the birds were not infected with the same virus that has affected birds in Asia .
The H5N1 strain has killed more than 60 people in South East Asia since 2003 , most of them in Vietnam and Thailand .
Low threat
Thirty - three ducks in Canada tested positive for the virus , among thousands of healthy animals tested across the country .
H5N1 BIRD FLU VIRUS
Principally an avian disease , first seen in humans in Hong Kong in 1997 Almost all human cases thought to be contracted from birds Possible cases of human - to - human transmission in Hong Kong , Thailand and Vietnam , but none confirmed
Q&A : Bird flu
" These findings do not indicate that we are dealing with a virus strain capable of causing significant illness , " Jim Clark of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said .
" It 's important to clarify that the avian influenza virus is not new to wild birds , " he added .
Tens of millions of birds have been destroyed around the world since the deadly strain of the virus was first detected in 2003 .
The disease has also been detected in birds in Russia , Croatia , Turkey and Romania .
While more than 60 people have died of the virus , there is only one suspected case of the disease being passed from human to human .
But that is the challenge Anne Wilde has taken up , as a sort of unofficial spokeswoman for the polygamists of Utah .
There is a mystery to why this woman should be devoting herself to the cause when she has no apparent personal connection to polygamy , but we will come to that later .
For now , she is sitting in her kitchen in Salt Lake City , explaining why taking multiple wives - " sisterwives " - is a necessary prerequisite for reaching the highest level of Heaven .
Wilde 's purpose is made particularly tough because polygamy gets a consistently bad press , fuelled by events in some polygamist communities that appear to be anything but celestial .
Today , the " Prophet " of a polygamist community in Utah , Warren Jeffs , will be brought handcuffed into court and the evidence presented in public for the first time .
He is charged with assisting the statutory rape of a 14 - year - old girl , who had allegedly been forced into a spiritual marriage with her cousin .
The girl was said by prosecutors to have been ordered to " multiply and replenish the earth " - in other words , procreate - or risk eternal damnation .
Jeffs was the spiritual leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , a group that detractors call a cult , which is concentrated in Hilldale , a small town straddling the southern Utah border with Arizona .
His lawyers will argue that to commit him to trial would be to continue the persecution Utah 's polygamists have suffered since the late 19th century .
To a degree , Wilde would agree with that .
As one of the leading historians of the practice , she describes how it has its roots in the early days of Mormonism , the Church of Latter Day Saints , which is the dominant religion in Utah .
It was the founder of the Mormon church , Joseph Smith , who first revealed the principle of celestial - or plural - marriage in the 1830s .
It was persecution , says Wilde , that forced the Mormons to drop polygamy in the 1890s when the federal US government gave them an ultimatum : end its practice or forfeit all your lands .
The church elders did as they were told and in return were rewarded with the granting of statehood to Utah in 1896 .
But there were many refuseniks , who were driven underground , excommunicated by their own church .
Though the Mormons deny any connection now to the polygamists , the latter continue to claim a common ancestry , calling themselves Fundamentalist Mormons , much to the annoyance of the official church .
The polygamists have also been regularly targeted by the civil authorities .
In 1935 , polygamy was made a crime in Utah , punishable to this day with five years in prison .
But at this point Wilde 's account and that of Jeffs ' lawyers would probably part .
She believes that in recent years there has been a thawing of relations between the civil authorities and Utah 's polygamists .
In an unwritten pact , the state 's attorney general has made it clear that if they keep the law in all other respects , the felony of polygamy will be overlooked .
So it is no coincidence that Jeffs is being prosecuted for assisting the statutory rape of an underage girl , rather than for the many plural marriages he has presided over .
Other recent prosecutions of Hilldale residents have also focused on underage sex and on the widespread abuse of state benefits to support plural wives .
I talked to several teenagers who fled Hilldale and they too said that they wanted to escape not because of polygamy per se but because of the increasingly harsh and bizarre way in which Jeffs allegedly ruled over them .
Take Joe , a keen , bright - eyed 18 - year - old who left the town two years ago and is now living in Salt Lake City .
Using a false name as he hopes to remain in contact with his parents , he recalls a childhood with his mothers and 31 brothers and sisters where the two families lived happily in the same house .
" Things were good .
But then every one of us felt the change . "
The change happened when Jeffs took over as leader , or Prophet , when his father died in 2002 .
Before the change the rules were stringent , but afterwards they became strangulating : no more hiking in the countryside , bicycles , swimsuits or computers .
Jeffs forbade T - shirts and bright colours , particularly red , the colour of the devil ( an irony as he was caught wearing a T - shirt and driving a bright red car ) .
Long underwear and long shirtsleeves and trousers had to be worn at all times , buttons done up .
Pop music was out , to be replaced by tapes of Jeffs preaching .
Fawn Broadbend ran away almost three years ago , when she was 16 , and now also lives in Salt Lake City .
She remembers before she left being told not to laugh , but that was not why she fled Hilldale .
At the age of 14 her name was added by her father to the " joy book " , a list allegedly collated by Jeffs of young girls whose parents believed they were ready to be put out to marriage , often with a husband who already had one or several other wives .
When Broadbend learned that she was in the book , she resisted : her elder sister had become the 23rd wife of a polygamist with 106 children in Bountiful , an outpost of the faith in British Columbia , Canada , and she did n't want that for herself .
In January 2004 , fearing that she could be married off with just 15 minutes ' notice , as had happened to others in the community , Broadbend ran .
The day before had also proved to be the final straw for her when Jeffs had called an extraordinary meeting of townspeople .
In front of a crowd of 1,500 , he read out a list of 21 of the community 's fathers , telling them they had sinned but without telling them why , and ordering them to leave immediately .
All 21 men packed their bags and were gone that night .
Most of them are still expelled from the town , separated from their wives and children , frantically trying to work out which sins they must repent .
Many teenaged boys were also turfed out of the community .
Chuck , also a false name , is 15 .
Last December he was called in to a meeting of church leaders in Hilldale and told he had broken the rules by wearing T - shirts and going to the cinema .
He was told to leave by the following morning .
Diversity , a group in Salt Lake City that works with teenagers thrown out of Hilldale - the Lost Boys , as they are known locally - puts their number at up to 1,000 .
At its most extreme , the reign of Jeffs saw families torn apart at his whim .
Carl Holm , 42 , was ostracised by the church elders several years ago for having married outside the religion , and now lives in Salt Lake City .
His sister is one of more than 40 women in Hilldale believed to be married to Warren Jeffs ( he is said to have more than 60 children ) .
Two other sisters were married to the same man - a common practice in Hilldale - until Jeffs stepped in and ordained that one of the sisters was no longer to be married .
Again , without being told her sin , she was banished from the family .
All her children were " reassigned " to the other sister .
Broken families , kids cast asunder , father wrenched from son , sisterwife from sisterwife : there is little sympathy for Jeffs from those who were forced out .
" I 'd like to see him behind bars , " says Joe , now dressed freely in T - shirt and jeans .
Why ?
" The way I see it , God is a good person .
He would not do those things to families . "
So what of the polygamists themselves ?
What do they think of the prosecution of Jeffs and of the future of their way of life ?
Utah polygamists are notoriously secretive .
The community of Hilldale has been closed to the outside world for months as Jeffs issued an edict before he went on the run that excluded contact with outsiders .
I made approaches to several other groups and churches but no one wanted to talk .
And that is how I ended up in the kitchen of Anne Wilde .
She is an expert on Utah polygamy who has co-authored one of the most informative books on the subject , Voices in Harmony : Contemporary Women Celebrate Plural Marriage .
Going to see her would , in the absence of actual polygamists who would talk , at least give me the context .
I asked her why , as someone with no personal connection to the practice , she had written such a book .
Oh , but she had , she said .
For 33 years she had " lived the principle " within the independent tradition - a loose affiliation of men and women who see themselves as being more moderate and reasonable than the Hilldale community - the acceptable face of polygamy .
She was the second wife of Ogden Kraut , who also wrote about the religion .
There is no mention of that in her book , she explained , because she feared prosecution , but since her husband 's death four years ago she has gradually come out , revealing her unconventional marital arrangements for the first time to many of her family , some of whom had ostracised her .
She would n't say how many sisterwives she had had , other than " a few " , all but one of whom were now dead .
She had been unable to have children with Kraut so instead they had written books together on polygamy .
She says that Kraut treated all his wives fairly , not equally , as one wife might be more needy than another .
The fact that he was with her only periodically meant that she had more freedom , she says , " as there were others around to cook his food and wash his clothes " .
She keeps stressing that she feels that being a polygamist gave her more , not less , independence as a woman ; and although her husband was a patriarch , part of his role as head of the family was to treat his wives with respect .
Jeffs does not fit into that definition .
His mistake , she believes , was to try to find utopia on Earth where perfection is unattainable .
But she says that the unhappy experiences of the few in Hilldale should not be used to discredit the many .
We are back where we began , to Wilde 's public relations campaign for a most unfashionable creed .
" I want you to know , I was totally happy in it .
Ogden and I got on absolutely beautifully .
We had 33 years of glorious , loving marriage . "
Polygamy as liberation - is it really time to rewrite the annals of feminism ?
Not at all , says Broadbend .
Her upbringing and education , what little she had of it , was all about female subservience .
Even before Jeffs came on the scene she was being taught her role in life : " Girls are put on Earth to obey the man who is superior .
We are here to bear children for him and to do his bidding .
You do what your man says , and you certainly do not question him .
If I had stayed I would have had no say at all over my own life . "
Anne Wilde 's job as public relations consultant has some way to go .
Google is the 600 - pound gorilla : the company that no one wants to see build a competing product .
Google dominates many of the markets it enters , whether by building a superior product or acquiring one .
But Google is n't perfect : in some areas , they come out behind .
Today , Mashable takes an in - depth look at 10 markets where Google wants to win .
Google became the Internet ’s biggest company by dominating what has become the web ’s biggest market segment – online search and paid text links .
Google claims a dominating 56 % market share in search ( Nielsen / NetRatings , May 2007 ) , but that has n’t stopped dozens ( probably hundreds ) of companies from trying to grab a piece of the action .
Most of the major search engines also come with their own advertising system , while a few startups actually rely on Google to serve up paid text ads .
Yahoo –
Once the web ’s biggest search engine , Yahoo still handles a reported 21.5 % of searches worldwide .
The company ’s much anticipated but delayed Panama system for text ads has finally gone live , with early results pointing to better click through rates .
MSN – While rumors of Microsoft acquiring Yahoo have persisted ( and been discredited in the same breath ) , the company ’s Live Search product remains number three .
Ask.com –
As the crown jewel of the IAC network of sites , Ask.com has received rave reviews , including Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal declaring , “ Google deserves credit for universal search , which I ’m sure will get better .
But Ask ’s new design is much more compelling and well worth a try . ”
Nonetheless , Ask.com is a distant fourth in the race for search dominance .
Eurekster – Social search engine Eurekester is built around users tagging and promoting the best results .
The company also markets the “ Swicki ” platform allowing online communities to create their own vertical search engines for users .
Rollyo –
This search engine allows you to create a personalized search engine .
With Rollyo , you set up a “ search roll ” which searches only from sites you specify , in the hope of providing you with only content you trust .
Additionally , you can opt to share your search rolls with others .
Quintura – Visual search engine Quintura lets you search visually , presenting you with tag clouds relating to your search terms .
As we noted in “ Google Labs : A Look Under the Hood ” , Google is experimenting with contextual search that shows related searches side - by - side with your original query .
Mahalo – Recently launched Mahalo is a commercialized Wikipedia of sorts , paying people to create pages on thousands of topics and continually update the results .
Each content creator also gets their own profile pages where you can see the pages to which they have contributed .
Powerset – Much hyped Powerset has n’t launched yet , but intends to build a natural language search engine that could change the way people find things online .
The company has raised significant venture capital that has already valued PowerSet at more than $ 40 million .
Wikiasari –
As part of his for - profit company , Wikia , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales looks to create the world ’s largest human - powered search engine .
The project is still in development , but with Wikipedia now one of the world ’s largest web sites , it has an opportunity to grab a piece of the market .
Image Search -
In addition to text queries , Google faces a variety of competitors in image search , including all of the usual suspects plus upstarts like Pixsy , Picsearch , and Yotophoto .
We previously covered the image search competitors after Google proved victorious in a court battle over the thumbnailing of images .
Our Take : Google is the dominant player here , but we should remember that less than a decade ago , Yahoo owned search .
Competition from both big web companies and well - funded startups will force Google to remain focused on continuing to innovate in search .
With AdWords the most dominant player in paid search , Google is looking to take the same system of aligning buyers and sellers to other forms of advertising , including web banner ads , radio , print , and mobile .
Through acquisitions and several homegrown initiatives , the company is now lined up against dozens of other companies competing for ad dollars both online and off .
Contextual Advertising
Thousands of companies have built a business around Google ’s contextual advertising platform that matches text ads to web site content .
While AdSense dominates this market , all of the big players have competing offerings , as well as a few specialty outfits .
In its most recent quarter , AdSense accounted for $ 1.35 billion in revenue for Google .
Yahoo Publisher Network – YPN still claims to be in Beta , but offers a very similar product to AdSense .
Publishers create an account and cut and paste code to their site , and Yahoo serves up ads relating to the content of the page .
MSN AdCenter – Microsoft offers its AdCenter platform to advertisers looking for exposure in Microsoft Live searches and on other MSN Properties .
Currently Microsoft does not provide an open system for other web sites to serve AdCenter ads , although the company does sell advertising for Facebook .
Meanwhile , Google powers the search and contextual advertising on MySpace .
Ask.com Sponsored Listings – Ask.com recently launched an AdSense competitor , going after one of Google ’s perceived weaknesses – a lack of transparency in terms of telling publishers what their cut of revenue is .
MIVA – Formerly known as FindWhat.com , a popular search engine in the first Internet boom , MIVA focuses on a variety of advertising options for publishers , including contextual product MIVA MC .
Kanoodle – Kanoodle offers a solution for publishers that want to run ads next to their own search results .
It ’s a subsidiary of Seavast , an online marketing conglomerate .
AdBrite – Offering a marketplace of sorts , AdBrite allows publishers to place text ads on their site and have advertisers buy them directly at a fixed price .
They also allow you to set a floor price and run ads from a competing network ( such as AdSense ) when that price ca n’t be beaten .
Our Take : Until someone proves they can pay more than Google and still make a profit , AdSense will likely be the preferred contextual ad provider for Web publishers .
However , there are only so many ads to go around , so there is also a place for competitors with strong offerings .
Online Display Advertising
With its acquisition of DoubleClick in April , Google set off a buying spree in the online ad space .
In the weeks that followed , Yahoo snapped up Right Media , Microsoft bought aQuantive , and 24/7 Real Media was taken out by WPP Group .
In addition to the DoubleClick purchase , Google has increasingly been integrating graphical advertising into its AdSense platform for web publishers .
While it remains to be seen how exactly Google will integrate DoubleClick , the company is positioned to take a big slice of the online display advertising market , alongside these competitors :
Right Media – Acquired by Yahoo for $ 680 million , Right Media offers web publishers both a web - based ad management system and a marketplace called RMX Direct where advertisers can compete for publisher inventory .
aQuantive –
The biggest acquisition in the history of Microsoft , aQuantive is the parent company of several online advertising outfits , including Razorfish , Atlas , and Drive .
The company offers both technology for managing advertising and services for aligning buyers with web publishers .
Advertising.com – AOL was actually one of the first big players to move in on display ad networks , acquiring Advertising.com in 2004 for $ 435 million , a steal given the price tags of recent online advertising deals .
Advertising .com claims their network of publishers reaches more than 85 % of online users .
Valueclick –
The biggest remaining independent ad network , Valueclick owns a wide variety of online ad properties , including Fastclick ( banner ads ) , Commission Junction ( affiliate advertising ) , and PriceRunner ( comparison shopping ) .
Wall Street currently values the company at $ 3 billion .
Tribal Fusion – Tribal Fusion is an ad network serving an estimated 19 billion monthly impressions .
They provide advertisers with a variety of topical channels on which to target their ads .
24/7 Real Media – A provider of both technology and one of the Web ’s largest banner advertising networks , 24/7 Real Media was acquired by global advertising agency WPP Group in May for $ 649 million .
The company was founded all the way back in 1994 .
Our Take : DoubleClick works with most of the web ’s largest publishers , providing Google with new relationships to not only sell display ads , but increase AdWords usage .
Google ’s main competitors have tried to keep up , but the company has clearly positioned itself to take the lead in this category .
Other Ad Formats – Broadcast , Print , In - Game
In print , Google has extended its AdWords platform to allow you to bid on ads in major newspapers .
In broadcast , Google acquired dMarc , a company that aligns radio advertisers and stations .
For in - game advertising , the company acquired AdScape , a small startup .
Competitors abound in all three segments , primarily in the form of the status quo of buying ads directly from the newspapers and radio stations with whom you want to advertise .
Meanwhile , here is how a few key players are attacking these markets :
Microsoft – In May , Microsoft acquired Massive Incorporated , which has deals with major gaming companies like Electronic Arts to provide in - game ads .
IGA Worldwide –
The largest independent in - game ad network , IGA places ads in popular titles like Counter Strike and works with major advertisers like T - Mobile and Intel .
Linden Labs –
As the operator of virtual world Second Life , Linden Labs has attracted major brands like Pontiac , Dell , and Coca Cola to its " game " with mixed results , including several incidents of virtual vandalism .
Bid4Spots –
An online auction of sorts for last minute buying of radio advertising across the US .
SWMX Radio – Provides tools that allow radio stations to manage their advertising inventory , while offering a marketplace for advertisers to buy air time .
Newspaper National Network – Jointly owned by 24 of the nation ’s largest newspapers and the Newspaper Association of America , Newspaper National Network connects advertisers directly with some of the largest newspapers in the US .
The company also helps sell inventory for newspaper ’s online versions .
Nationwide Newspapers –
An ad agency specializing in placement of both display and classified ads in newspapers across the US , including mailers like the Penny Saver and college newspapers .
Nationwide Newspapers claims a circulation of up to 60 million papers weekly .
Our Take :
As the manufacturer of Xbox , Microsoft has a leg up on in - game advertising .
Meanwhile , print and broadcast are notoriously slow to adopt new technologies , so it will likely take Google some time to gain traction in this area , although acquiring dMarc certainly gave them a head start .
With Google clearly intent on spreading its advertising platform to the offline world , more acquisitions are likely in the space .
Google responded to the rather lackluster performance of homegrown Google Video by purchasing market leader YouTube for $ 1.6 billion in November 2006 .
While Google also inherited the legal headaches including a $ 1 billion lawsuit from Viacom , the purchase instantly made Google the # 1 player in online video by a landslide .
Nonetheless , dozens of companies have received funding in this space , and the other big players have also launched competing products :
Metacafe –
This startup offers a similar video sharing experience to YouTube , with a focus on the male audience .
Metacafe has been a rumored acquisition target of Microsoft and Yahoo .
MySpace Video – MySpace launched its own video sharing service last year that integrates tightly with user profiles , allowing users to instantly add videos to their space with no need for copying and pasting embed codes .
Recently , this became MySpaceTV , which has been labeled as a " YouTube clone " .
Yahoo Video – Yahoo offers a fairly standard video sharing service with tagging , favorites , featured videos , etc . Yahoo also acquired online video editing service JumpCut in September ’06 .
Blip.tv – Blip.tv is designed for serious video bloggers , offering tools for uploading high quality video , inserting ads , and maintaining a feed so fans can keep up with your show .
Revver – Originally Revver was the first video site to offer a revenue share with users , but others including YouTube have since followed suit .
Beyond the financial arrangements , Revver offers a fairly standard video sharing experience , showcasing recent videos , most watched , and editor ’s picks .
Dailymotion –
One of the most popular video sites ( particularly in France ) , Dailymotion is comprised of a variety of channels that users can join , such as Extreme Sports , Funny , and Webcam .
The site also includes privacy options for sharing videos with select family and friends .
See also : Video Toolbox : 150 + Online Video Tools and Resources
Our Take : While Google will spend plenty of time in the court room over copyright issues on YouTube , the company has the financial strength to fight off just about any lawsuit thrown its way and preserve a dominant position in online video .
Meanwhile , niche players like Blip.tv have an opportunity to take advantage of the growing market for high quality user generated content .
Google was ahead of the game with blogging , acquiring Pyra Labs , parent company of Blogger , back in 2003 .
Last month , Google acquired FeedBurner , which is far away the dominant player in RSS feed management .
Rounding out Google ’s efforts to dominate the blogosphere is Blog Search , which the company developed in - house .
While FeedBurner is the industry standard for feed management , there are dozens of blog software and search options .
Here are a few key competitors :
WordPress –
The preferred software package for serious bloggers , WordPress offers both an installable version at wordpress.org and a hosted product at wordpress.com .
The company maintains an open platform allowing third - party developers to create plugins .
Six Apart –
The biggest independent blog company , Six Apart owns the hosted Typepad platform , the installable Movable Type software package , the community - focused LiveJournal , and the recently launched Vox personal publishing solution .
Technorati –
The largest search engine focused exclusively on blogs , Technorati monitors , organizes , and ranks the authority of the blogosphere .
Recently , the site has had its share of bumps ( technical glitches , key staff departures , etc. ) , and a recent move towards multimedia has taken the focus off the core product .
Sphere –
This blog search engine also offers the popular “ Sphere It ” widget that allows bloggers to show related blogs from around the web on their sites , and earn a share of the revenue on advertising .
Pheedo – As Google looks to monetize FeedBurner , they go up against Pheedo , who specializes in RSS advertising .
Pheedo is compatible with most feed management services , including FeedBurner , Typepad , and WordPress .
Our Take : News out of Blogger has been nearly non-existent since Google acquired it , and Blog Search is not nearly as reliable as Google ’s main search engine .
FeedBurner is dominant in RSS , but advertisers still have plenty of options for feed - based advertising .
The blogosphere remains a healthy area for competition .
Recently making headlines with its purchase of GrandCentral , mobile is an area Google has had its eyes on for a while .
Google Labs features GOOG411 , which goes up against a variety of companies looking to transition paid 411 services into an advertising - based model , while the company has also made acquisitions in the space including AdScape Media and Dodgeball .
Here are some key players Google is up against for domination on your handset :
Jingle Networks –
As the first mover in the space with 1-800 - FREE - 411 , Jingle Networks is already up to a reported 3 % of market share for 411 volume .
GOOG411 is still in Google Labs , but presumably will use an AdWords - inspired system to allow advertisers access to user ’s 411 queries .
Yahoo Mobile ! – Yahoo has made major efforts in mobile , offering a comprehensive application designed for cell phones and PDAs .
Yahoo !
Go adds mobile widgets to the equation .
MSN Mobile – Microsoft offers a free mobile version of its search and popular web sites .
Weather , news , sports , movie times , and more are all available via MSN Mobile .
InfoSpace – InfoSpace specializes in mobile content , providing applications for search , content , and commerce that are typically private labeled by other brands and carriers .
The company claims more than 250 million WAP page views per month .
VoIP – While the GrandCentral acquisition gave Google a unique offering , dozens of other startups are creating innovative applications that will keep Google on its toes .
Check out “ The 7 Most Disruptive VoIP Services ” for a few prime examples .
Our Take : Adoption of the mobile Internet in the US trails Europe and Asia , leaving the space wide open .
Yahoo has a head start here , while specialists like InfoSpace and the VoIP value - added service companies know the market better than anyone .
However , GOOG411 and Google SMS ( search by text message ) offer a compelling user experience that is perfect for advertising .
Google Personalized Home has become iGoogle , going up against the likes of My Yahoo ! , Netvibes , PageFlakes , and dozens of other companies that want you to start your online experience with them .
We list a few of the top competitors here , but you should also check out “ 14 Personalized Homepages Compared , Feature by Feature ” to get an overall view of the innovation taking place in this market .
My Yahoo ! –
The original dominant portal , Yahoo can still claim the most widely used start page on the web .
The company has continued to upgrade the service in hopes of retaining users , adding the ability to drag and drop content items , subscribe to RSS feeds , and integrate other Yahoo services like mail , weather , and finance .
AOL – While its subscriber base continues to dwindle quarter by quarter , millions of people still start their Internet experience by signing on to AOL .
However , Google powers AOL ’s search , and Google took a 5 percent stake in the company back in 2005 .
My Netscape -
One of the early big names on the Internet , Netscape has moved on to become a Digg clone and a start page provider .
The site still gets considerable traffic thanks to its iconic brand and AOL relationship .
Netvibes –
The hottest startup in the start page space , Netvibes provides a beautiful drag and drop interface for organizing your start page content , and also allows you to pull in widgets from third - parties .
The company recently launched Netvibes Universes , private label versions of its start page product that other companies like The Washington Post and USA Today offer to their users .
Our Take :
If it was n’t clear already , iGoogle solidifies Google ’s quest to be more than a search engine and take up more minutes of the user ’s online time .
While the startups have proven most innovative in this space , Google can use its massive reach and brand cache to convert users to iGoogle .
However , Yahoo has the advantage of more than a decade of start page experience , and convincing the average user to invest a few hours in changing services is n’t easy .
While Gmail dubiously maintains its “ Beta ” tag , Google ’s email service put the company on the map in being much more than a search engine and going after the big boys .
The company has also launched Gtalk in an effort to join the instant messaging space , though the product lags behind competitors in adoption .
Maintaining webmail and instant messaging services requires massive amounts of manpower and hardware , making it for the most part a four - way race between the big boys : Yahoo , Microsoft , and AOL .
AOL – Millions of people remain attached to their AOL email addresses .
AOL has made it easy to do , allowing users to keep their address even if they cancel their AOL accounts .
This makes AOL.com ’s webmail product one of the more popular , albeit less advanced email services .
Meanwhile , AOL Instant Messenger ( AIM ) is a major player in IM , particularly in the US .
MSN – Microsoft owns the original big boy in webmail – Hotmail – which recently received a major facelift and became Windows Live Hotmail ( see : “ Face Off : Windows Live Hotmail versus Gmail ” ) .
MSN Messenger has a huge user base globally .
Yahoo !
– Yahoo
Mail recently upgraded to offer an Outlook - like interface that includes the ability to chat with Yahoo Messenger buddies from within your account ( Gmail does this with Gtalk ) .
Yahoo’s IM product is among the top commercially - run products .
Our Take :
Do n’t let the market share numbers deceive you ; Google is a serious player in communications .
The other three players have a head start thanks to longevity , but Gmail has become the email provider of choice for professionals , thanks to a clean interface , effective spam filtering , and offering the most storage space .
Meanwhile , Gtalk faces a slightly bigger challenge , since users have entrenched buddy lists with the other services that make changing a hassle .
While it can be argued that YouTube is one of the world ’s biggest social networking sites in addition to being the # 1 video site , Google has been relatively quiet in the space .
Friendster passed on a rumored $ 30 million Google bid back at the dawn of the social networking boom , while homegrown Orkut has enjoyed some success , primarily in South America .
Readers of Mashable are no strangers to the hundreds of social networks looking to gain users , or at least , get acquired by Google .
Facebook –
The hottest social network of ’ 07 , Yahoo reportedly passed on buying Facebook for $ 1 billion last year , a bargain by today ’s standards .
With the Facebook Platform all the rage right now and an advertising deal with Microsoft , Google may be starting to feel it backed the wrong horse …
MySpace – News Corp made the savvy purchase of MySpace for $ 580 million back in 2005 , just when the social networking leader was at the height of its exponential growth .
The site has lost its swagger to Facebook in recent months , but still remains the biggest by far .
Bebo – Extremely popular in the UK , Bebo has been on the rise in ’07 .
It has also been the subject of acquisition rumors with Yahoo .
The site receives praise for its privacy options .
AIM Pages – AOL made the logical move of extending AIM to include social networking through AIM Pages , enjoying moderate but not phenomenal success .
Windows Live Spaces – Microsoft ’s social networking play is very youth - oriented , providing simple blogs and profiles to MSN users .
Yahoo !
360 – Yahoo ’s biggest social networking effort has been criticized for not doing enough to integrate other Yahoo services and overlapping too much with other Yahoo products .
The lack of success may be why Yahoo is always at the top of the rumored buyers list when other social networks go up for sale .
Our Take :
The social networking space has proven fickle in its early history , with Friendster the early leader , MySpace the current dominant player , and Facebook on the rise looking to unseat MySpace .
With YouTube already under its roof and one of the deepest pocketbooks in the industry , Google can sit back and wait for the right time to acquire one of the top social networks .
Google was relatively early to jump on the photo sharing bandwagon with the 2004 acquisition of Picasa , but the service has since been surpassed by rivals that do a better job of integrating with blogs and social networks .
Here are the prime players :
Flickr –
One of the darlings of Web 2.0 , Yahoo deserves praise for acquiring Flickr in early 2005 before valuations became far steeper .
The site is a favorite of techies and serious photographers , and is moving towards mainstream adoption as Yahoo closes Yahoo Photos in favor of Flickr .
Photobucket –
By offering a free place to store photos that can be embedded on social networks , Photobucket became one of the most highly trafficked sites on the Web .
While MySpace briefly blocked Photobucket , it recently decided to acquire the company for an estimated $ 250 million .
Zooomr –
This startup receives a lot of hype , but is also becoming the choice of some high end photographers and giving Flickr some competition .
We compared the two in “ Face - off : Flickr versus Zooomr Mark III ” after Zooomr ’s latest round of enhancements .
BayImg – The Pirate Bay provides free uncensored image hosting for files up to 100MB .
Given the big player ’s need to appease advertisers by removing offensive content , it ’s an interesting alternative that has some traction .
For a look at dozens of other players in the online photo space , check out “ 90 + Online Photography Tools and Resources ” .
Our Take :
With a fairly dominant image search product , Google does n’t really need to move into the high maintenance area of photo storage and sharing .
However , with the company expanding into display advertising , which is favored on many photo sharing sites , Google may become interested should the right company become available .
With the acquisition of Writely , which has since been merged into Google Docs & Spreadsheets , and the launch of a PowerPoint competitor imminent , version 1 of the Google office suite is nearly complete .
While the company has a long way to go to match the feature set of the ever dominant Microsoft Office , it has Redmond moving fast to market web - based versions of its core products .
Several startups are also working on word processing , spreadsheet , and presentation software to compete with Microsoft .
Microsoft – With Word , Excel , Powerpoint , and Outlook the entrenched franchises of nearly every personal computer on earth , Microsoft Office is a mighty foe to take on .
While it is by no means
Google ’s core business yet , they are clearly putting pressure on Microsoft to remain innovative in the office arena .
Zoho –
This well - funded startup has a full office suite of its own , with products including Zoho Writer , Zoho Sheet , and Zoho Show .
Many of the company ’s products are free .
Open Office –
The free , open source office project that originates with Microsoft foe Sun Microsystems includes word processing , spreadsheets , presentations and more , and is designed to be compatible with as many operating systems and programs as possible .
Our Take : Microsoft ’s dominance in office software stems from dominance in operating systems , a market it still controls .
However , Google Docs & Spreadsheets ' web - based , collaborative approach is very lightweight and useful for certain tasks .
While it will take years to build a product that offers the full functionality of Microsoft Office , Google is the best - positioned company by far to build a viable competitor if it wants to .
THE FUTURE
As the most watched , scrutinized , and reported - on company in the web space , Google ’s every move is analyzed by competitors big and small .
Its rapid expansion into areas beyond search and seemingly insatiable appetite for acquisitions has the company strongly positioned to dominate numerous key parts of the Internet .
However , we should be reminded that not everything Google touches turns to gold ; for example , the demise of Google Answers and the demotion of Froogle .
Stay tuned for what are sure to be hundreds of announcements in the years to come .

The rush for biofuels could have a major environmental impact
The charity - called Grain - says its research shows the rush for biofuels is causing much more environmental and social damage than previously realised .
Biofuels from crops are being heavily promoted by the US and Europe as a welcome solution to climate change .
In theory , their emissions are much lower than from fossil fuels .
But the report from the charity Grain amplifies recent warnings from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) that some biofuels produce hardly any carbon savings at all .
The UN says basic food prices for poor countries are being pushed up by competition for land from biofuels .
Name change
The Grain report says its research shows how governments and biofuels firms in developing countries are collaborating to push hundreds of thousands of indigenous people and peasant communities off their land .
" The Inter - American Development Bank says that Brazil has 120 million hectares that could be cultivated with agrofuel crops ; and an agrofuel lobby is speaking of 379 million hectares being available in 15 African countries .
We are talking about expropriation on an unprecedented scale . "
It points out that one of the main causes of global warming is agro- industrial farming itself , thanks mainly to the use of chemical fertilisers which introduce nitrous oxide into the air .
The group says the media has been spun into using the attractive term biofuels - and wants them referred to as " agrofuels " instead .
The plant fuel industry accepts that there is a limit to the energy to be obtained from crops - but believes plant fuels can be produced sustainably on a large scale .
The EU wants to see at least 10 % of road fuel derived from plants by 2020 .
Oil firms believe this target is achievable using farm surpluses combined with fuel digested by bacteria from waste - so called second - generation biofuels .
But their economic calculations do not include competition for feedstock from power firms wanting biofuel for combined heat and power - which produces much more energy more economically than liquid fuel .
The UK government 's climate envoy John Ashton recently told BBC News : " The policy on biofuels is currently running ahead of the science . "
Breastfeeding is becoming more common
The Infant Feeding Survey shows in 2005 76 % of UK mothers started out breastfeeding - up 7 % from 2000 .
However , most resort to formula within weeks , and fewer than half still breastfeed by the time their child is six weeks old .
By six months , just one in four are still breastfeeding .
Women need to be able to feel confident and comfortable to breastfeed wherever they need to
Alison Baum
Breastfeeding Manifesto Coalition
The survey , which has been carried out every five years since 1975 , also found that well educated , professional women aged over 30 who were first time mothers were the most likely group to breastfeed .
Professor Denise Lievesley , of the Information Centre , which produced the study , said the overall message was positive as more women were breastfeeding for longer .
She said the survey would help health workers to target resources at those on which they would have the most impact .
" Overall , it is encouraging to see that more mothers than ever before are starting out breastfeeding their babies and , while there is a sharp drop - off , more are continuing to breastfeed for longer . "
Manifesto
The figures were released on the first day of National Breastfeeding Week , which will see the launch of a breasteeding manifesto in Westminster on Wednesday .
BREASTFEEDING BENEFITS
Breastfed babies five times less likely to end up in hospital than formula - fed babies with gastroenteritis Breastfed babies half as likely to end up in hospital with respiratory disease in their first seven years of life Breast milk protects against diabetes and obesity
The manifesto , supported by 183 MPs and various celebrities , aims to promote breastfeeding and create an environment in which women feel more comfortable about doing so .
Alison Baum , from the Breastfeeding Manifesto Coalition , said : " Women need to be able to feel confident and comfortable to breastfeed wherever they need to .
" Babies need to feed at all sorts of times , and you can never know when a baby is going to need to feed
" It 's the most natural thing in the world , and the evidence for the health benefits are huge , so we should be doing all we can to support women . "
She said most women who breastfed in public did so discreetly , with people not realising .
But she said : " There are the odd cases where women are thrown out of restaurants and cafes . "
It is illegal in Scotland to ask someone to stop breatsfeeding in an establishment that normally serves food .
If you live in Vermont you understand that your state economy depends on a couple of things .
They do n’t call it the green mountain state for nothing , Vermont ’s economy is almost solely based on its environment .
Boating , hiking , skiing , hunting , logging , eco-tourism and the things that support them ( bed and breakfast , gear sales , etc ) make up the majority of its economic activity .
That is why I was pretty surprised when I heard this from Vermont Governor Jim Douglas regarding the recent approval of a wind farm in Vermont ; “ I do n’t think industrializing our ridge lines is the right thing to do for the natural beauty of our state . ”
He went on to say “ I do n’t think the modest amount of electricity that will be generated from wind turbines is worth the impairment of our ridge lines . ”
What is this guy thinking ?!
Global warming will destroy Vermont ’s economy .
Last winter was a horrible year for skiing , global warming will do similarly bad things to the rest of Vermont ’s eco-dependent industry .
Perhaps the governor would like them to erect a coal power plant some place in the mid-west where he wont have to look at it .
Unless Vermont residents figure out a way to use less energy they will continue to need more supply .
ISO New england has released several statements calling for more energy production in the north east , especially wind power .
The reason is that New England economy as a whole is based around the changes in the weather .
From winter skiing to fall leap peeping , to the health of the forests , Vermont and New England as a whole will be hit hard by global warming .
With his bully pulpit Governor Douglas should be encouraging people to see wind power as a beautiful and carbon neutral way of supplying the energy that Vermonters need for daily life .
Perhaps he could have a press conference showing what happens to the ridges of mountains in the Appalachian region when they blow the top off for coal mining .
So much of what people think about wind turbines is influenced by “ intangible ’s ” , not about actual facts .
Its about how you “ feel ” about the view , not about the cold hard fact of energy need and energy supply , and global warming .
The governor could play a big role in making people see the beauty of the technology .
You tell me what is worse :
This
Or This
Or perhaps we should use oil and get it from places like Iraq or Saudi Arabia , or maybe we can get natural gas from Hugo Chaves or Russia .
Maybe we could build a nuclear power plant in Vermont and let them deal with where to put all that waste .
When you take a step back and look at the problems of global warming and energy security seeing a couple spinning wind turbines on your ridge does n’t look like such a bad choice .
" Thumb candy for dummies . "
That 's how , in 2003 , Time magazine described Nintendo President Satoru Iwata 's conviction that what consumers really wanted out of video games was simpler , more accessible entertainment – not the photorealistic graphics and massive online worlds that the company 's competitors were chasing .
Less than four years later , the machine that Iwata built around his controversial strategy is the world 's top - selling game console .
In the United States , Nintendo's $ 250 Wii sold 360,000 units in April , while Sony's $ 600 , graphically intense , Blu-ray - powered PlayStation 3 props up the bottom of the sales chart like a doorstop , with 82,000 units sold .
Wii is sold out across the globe .
Having already moved more than 6 million of the consoles worldwide in the six months since launch , Nintendo is fighting to keep up with demand .
On eBay , secondhand systems sell for around $ 380 .
In Tokyo , stores mark the consoles up well above retail price .
Before it 's done , Nintendo believes that one out of every two next - generation game consoles sold could be a Wii , says George Harrison , the company 's senior vice president .
Nintendo is putting " the bulk of our mass - market effort against this extended audience , " creating software that appeals to seniors , women and former gamers who had given up the hobby , he says .
" I can't think of anyone who has n't expressed joy over Wii Sports , " says John Schappert , COO of Electronic Arts ' game studios .
" They 've hit a bull 's - eye , delivering a console that gamers like and that brings nongamers to gaming . "
By now , it was supposed to be all over for Nintendo .
The company that once ruled the video game world with an iron fist had lost its hegemony in the late '90s to Sony and the PlayStation .
Any chance that the company might rebound seemed to evaporate when Microsoft entered the picture in 2001 , and Nintendo's GameCube console fell into a distant third place behind PlayStation 2 and Xbox .
The 40 - year history of the video game industry has been volatile , marked by drastic , unpredictable shifts in market dominance .
But one of the maxims that has always held true is that third place is a dangerous position to occupy .
Every other game hardware maker that found itself behind two rivals eventually dropped out of the race : Atari , NEC , Sega .
And four years ago , most everyone assumed that Nintendo would face the same fate .
Nintendo itself probably even thought so .
That 's why the company decided to create a product that could carve out its own market niche – a game machine so different that even if it fell to third place , it would support a viable business model .
Rather than pursuing high - def graphics , Nintendo made Wii smaller and cheaper , leaving the graphics capability nearly identical to the GameCube's .
Then it redesigned the game controller to look more like a one - handed television remote control .
Built - in motion sensors meant that a game of tennis or bowling felt just like the real thing .
In a twist worthy of a Zen proverb , it was exactly when Nintendo decided to stop competing with Sony and Microsoft that it began to trounce them .
Since launch , Wii has constantly outsold the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 .
In the portable game sphere , Nintendo 's touch - screen DS system , built around the same philosophy as Wii , has outsold Sony 's high - end PSP two to one .
The simpler - games philosophy has proven to be a lucrative one .
Nintendo recently reported operating income of 226 billion yen ( $ 1.9 billion ) for fiscal 2007 , up 150 percent from 2006 .
Meanwhile , Sony 's games division experienced a drop in operating income of more than 80 percent .
Analyst firm iSuppli reported in November that Sony is taking a $ 250 loss on every PS3 sold .
That 's in keeping with the long - practiced business model of game consoles :
Sell hardware at a loss with the hope of making it up on software .
But Nintendo , with its cheap , last - gen electronics , is making money at every turn .
The Wii is also defying the conventional wisdom that a game publisher must produce a continuous string of hit products to satisfy the fleeting attention span and fickle tastes of gamers .
In Japan , where Wii Sports is sold separately , it has stayed on the country 's weekly top - 10 sales chart since the Wii 's launch .
In April , the games Super Paper Mario and Wii Play moved more than a quarter million copies each in the United States , outselling every Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game .
The shake - up in the console market has been great for Nintendo 's fortunes , but has left gamemakers off balance .
Most third - party game developers bet that the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 would be selling the most titles by summer .
Electronic
Arts had only two games at the Wii launch in November , versus five for PS3 .
And when they did ramp up their efforts , EA 's game designers found that creating games that utilize the Wii's controller is challenging .
" We 've done a great job with cross - platform code , with being platform agnostic , " says EA 's Schappert , but " to make a game for the Wii is more difficult . "
Bringing the Madden football game to the Wii cost EA " an enormous amount of money , " he says , declining to put it in numbers , because of the extra cost of designing the game for the motion - sensitive controls .
Tony Key , vice president of Ubisoft , offers a more optimistic spin .
" Designing a game around the Wii controller does n't add cost , just opportunity , " he says .
Ubisoft recognized the Wii's potential early on , and was the first publisher to get a Wii development kit , says Key .
Consequently , Ubisoft had nine games on the Wii by the end of 2006 , which netted the company 11 percent of Wii software sales that year .
" You really had to make a commitment back in the spring of 2006 to be involved " in the Wii launch , says Nintendo 's Harrison .
" Many publishers did n't ... understand that there would be a market for Wii . "

A good night ’s sleep just takes too long .
Scientists may soon be able to cut those eight wasted hours down to three or four — by waving a wand , more or less .
The technique , transcranial magnetic stimulation , involves an electromagnetic coil that emits pulses of skull - penetrating , neuron - activating magnetic energy .
Depending on where the wand is and how fast it pulses , TMS can play all kinds of tricks .
It can make a thumb twitch , create the illusion of a flash of light , or even treat depression .
Neuroscientist Giulio Tononi of the University of Wisconsin set out to see if TMS could switch on certain sleep phases .
Working with a group of six sleeping men , Tononi and his team located a spot on the skull that they could zap to induce the brain waves characteristic of deep , non-REM sleep .
Although Tononi ’s volunteers got only a few minutes of artificial sleep — not enough for the volunteers to draw meaningful subjective conclusions about sleep quality — previous studies have indicated that TMS applied at certain frequencies during sleep can improve memory .
Even more intriguing , says Tononi , “ there is the possibility that if you have particularly intense slow waves ” like the ones the machine induces , “ you may be able to do with less sleep . ”
Electronic naps are a long way off , though .
Between the armchair , the clicking coil , and electrodes , “ it ’s clearly not a machine that you can use at your house , ” Tononi says .
“ It ’s actually hard to get the person to sleep while doing these magnetic stimulations . ”

A loyal reader sent me this tidbit : Microsoft is offering its large enterprise customers free service and product credits if those customers push Live search inside their enterprises .
Called “ Microsoft Service Credits for Web Search , ” a Powerpoint overview of the program sent to me states :
“ Employees search the web daily with tools from Google , Microsoft , or Yahoo .
OEMs and web sites are already earning credits based on searches that their users bring .
Now , your organization can earn credits for Microsoft web searches and redeem them for Microsoft or preferred partner deployment and training services .
More searches earns more credits towards the services you value . ”
The value is non-trivial – the presentation estimates companies can get from $ 2 to $ 10 per computer annually , plus a $ 25 K “ enrollment credit ” .
For sites that have tens of thousands of computers , that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in free stuff from Microsoft .
Most large enterprises spend millions on Microsoft services and software each year .
It ’s not hard to imagine a CFO getting slightly moist over savings like these .
In short , Microsoft is leveraging its massive installed base – and its cash – to push search .
It ’s not a bad idea , though there are possible drawbacks .
The presentation goes into detail about how a large company might promote this program to its employees , suggesting three levels of communication – “ low , moderate , and high . ”
Moderate and high promotions include “ In - house training session on ‘ how to get the most from web search ’ using Windows Live Search , ” “ Remove all existing toolbars , ” “ Set Homepage to Live Search , ” and “ Email message of encouragement from CEO . ” IE 7 is mandatory for the program , as one might expect .
Interesting .
This could work , but it could sure backfire .
How would you feel if , to save a few bucks , the CIO and CFO dictates that you now have to use IE7 preset to Live Search ?
I can imagine a backlash where usage of Firefox goes way up in large corporations so as to avoid that “ Browser Helper Object ” installed in IE 7 … .
Fun / Dangerous Experiments ( 17 ) These are elements I 've done experiments with at one time or another :
Click the sample pictures to read about them .
Some of these experiments are quite dangerous , and will result in burns , chronic or acute poisoning , blindness or death .
Unless , of course , you are careful and understand what you are doing , what the dangers are , and how to protect yourself .
Danger is part of life : Respect it and it will let you live .
I would like to add a special note for any teenagers who are reading this section .
One of the great things about teenagers is that you are , for the most part , biologically incapable of confronting your own mortality .
And I mean that in the best possible way .
I know you 're perfectly well aware , in an intellectual sort of way , that you 're human and that no one lives forever .
But you do n't really believe that , do you ?
You do n't , and that 's why you can go out and take chances , break barriers , change the world , in ways that more sensible people would be way too sensible for .
That is your power : Use it .
And some day in your late 20s or early 30s , you will stop in your tracks and for the first time in your life really understand death : Yours .
It 's scary , but it 's how you grow .
That is the day you 'll start wearing safety glasses when you do these experiments .
In the mean time , all I can say is , please wear glasses anyway , even though you know in your heart that nothing could ever happen to you .
Ideally they should be wrap - around safety glasses , but let 's be realistic here :
Any glasses are better than none .
If you do n't wear corrective lenses , find some good open - frame safety glasses at the hardware store .
They are comfortable , do n't steam up , and are much easier to clean than the goggle - type .
If you 'll actually wear those , that 's way better than sealed goggle types you are n't wearing .
Why are glasses so important ?
Because having your cheeks ripped off by shrapnel , your hair burned to the roots , and your nose split open and folded up over your forehead is nothing , nothing compared to being blind for the rest of your life .
Not even close .

RANDY THORNHILL is not a man to shy away from controversy .
It was he who showed , just over a decade ago , that like most other animals who pick their mates by sight , the thing that humans seem to value above all in a partner is bodily symmetry .
It was also he who argued that far from being a pathology , a propensity to rape is a normal part of the evolutionary inheritance of men — a point of view previously confined to militant feminism .
Now he is looking at the evolutionary roots of political preference .
In particular , he is asking if there is a Darwinian explanation for why some people are liberals and some conservatives .
Curiously , his answer also casts light on the ideas of another 19th - century scientist , Sigmund Freud .
Alamy
Psychologists have long known that conservatives and liberals differ in more than whether they vote Tory or Labour , Republican or Democrat .
Indeed , the perverse mixtures of policies on offer from these parties , conflating social conservatism with economic liberalism and vice versa , mean that voting preferences are often an unreliable guide .
But bundles of personality traits do tend to cluster together in people .
Some are sceptical of tradition , open to new experiences , rebellious , pleasure - seeking , egalitarian and risk - prone .
Others value tradition , duty , close family relationships and security .
What no one knows is what causes the difference — and , inevitably , some people prefer genetic explanations while others cleave to environmental ones .
Dr Thornhill and his colleague , Corey Fincher , however , come down on neither of these sides .
They think an individual 's early environment is responsible for switching on one pattern or the other , but that this switch is an evolved — and thus genetically controlled — response .
The crucial environmental factor , they believe , is childhood stress — particularly how securely someone was attached to his mother when a child .
And they lay out their case that this is so in a paper just published in Evolution and Human Behavior .
To conduct their study , the two researchers asked 123 students from the University of New Mexico , where they both work , to fill in a questionnaire .
This asked about the volunteers ' political beliefs , personality traits and childhood memories .
Dr Thornhill and Dr Fincher then used a version of what is known as the Wilson - Patterson conservatism scale to classify their volunteers as conservatives or liberals on the basis of their personality traits .
( Conservatives complain , with some justification in this case , that academics have a tendency to pathologise conservatism by defining liberalism as a default from which conservative tendencies deviate , in the same way that a schizophrenia scale or a depressiveness scale measures a deviation from healthy normality . )
When they correlated their volunteers '
Wilson - Patterson scores with childhood memories the researchers discovered that those classified as conservatives tended to report having had secure childhoods with strong attachments to one or both parents , and low stress .
Those classified as liberals reported having stressful childhoods and weaker attachments to their parents .
Freud , on this reading , was right about the importance of early experience on character formation .
The second part of the paper is more speculative .
Conservatives , the authors suggest , are likely to do best in stable societies — say , a village where there is plenty to eat and no marauding enemy , and the biggest danger to stability might come from dissatisfaction within the community .
The traits associated with liberalism , on the other hand , might be most effective when there is a lot of stress on a population .
If food is scarce and other people are pressing in , then a liberal 's willingness to challenge traditional ways of doing things , and his greater willingness to embrace outsiders ( often literally ; liberals tend to have more sexual encounters than conservatives ) might come in handy .
Evolution has thus fixed it so that appropriate patterns of personality are activated in response to the environment in which they are most likely to cause an individual to thrive .
Which is all fine and dandy — except that last year a group of researchers at the University of California , Berkeley , came to exactly the opposite conclusion .
Their study found that insecure and fearful children were more likely to grow up into conservatives , and that confident kids were more likely to become liberal .
Clearly , as scientists are so fond of saying , more research is needed .

“ The Pentagon has padded this budget with tens of billions of dollars not related to combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” said Christopher Hellman , military policy analyst at the Center .
“ It is a fiscal slight - of - hand that Congress ought to reject . ”
Traditionally , supplemental spending requests have funded unanticipated emergency needs that the normal annual federal budget process cannot accommodate .
But the Administration ’s request today includes billions for Army modernization programs , day - to - day Pentagon operations , weapons purchases and additional troops that should be funded through its annual budget .
Supplemental spending requests also lack the usual detail used to justify the federal government ’s annual budget request , making accounting more difficult .
Moreover , supplemental funding is left out of the deficit projections that accompany the annual budget .
“ This method of budgeting hides the true size of the deficit , and it makes it extremely difficult for Congress to track how these funds are being allocated , ” said Hellman .
“ Members of Congress should insist on better Pentagon budgeting practices and not simply sign a blank check . ”
“ When asked recently if the Pentagon was using the supplemental to fund non-combat requirements , Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said , ‘ that would be wrong , and we would n't do that . ’
Well , it is wrong , and they are doing it , ” concluded Hellman .
So You Think It 's Hot ?
Southwest to Sizzle for 90 Years Scientists say global warming is causing a drought as severe as the Dust Bowl .
July 6 , 2007  --
As the country sizzles from Phoenix to Las Vegas , scientists and environmentalists are saying , " I told you so . "
Although it 's hard to judge long - term trends from individual seasons , a study co-written by researchers at Columbia and Princeton universities confirms that long - term drought is already under way in the American Southwest — one that may last the rest of this century , if not longer .
These scientists attribute this new climatology in one of the fastest - growing regions of the United States to global warming .
" It 's already on the way , " said senior researcher and geophysicist Richard Seager of the Lamont - Doherty Earth Institute at Columbia University .
" Even if we intervene , it will persist for a few more decades .
It takes that long to respond . "
Seager and his colleagues at Lamont - Doherty , and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab at Princeton , looked at 19 different computerized climate models from around the world .
Similar to those used for weather forecasting , the models dated back to 1860 and projected to 2100 .
The models showed a marked increase in arid climate beginning around now and worsening through the current century .
The team reported its findings this year at the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , often called the supreme court of climate science .
Its research was also published in April in the journal Science .
Temperatures 10 - 15 Degrees Higher
Today , temperatures climbed to 115 degrees in parts of Arizona and as high as 125 degrees in Baker , Calif .
Power plants failed in the now week - old heat wave .
Meteorologists report that summer temperatures are running 10 to 15 degrees above normal in states like Utah and Nevada .
" It 's dangerously hot , " said Rob Smith , whose thermometer reached 104 degrees in the shade this morning at his Sonora Desert home in Arizona .
" This is what global warming looks like . "
As regional staff director of the Sierra Club , Smith has watched trees die of insect infestations and reservoirs for power and drinking water dwindle .
For the second year in a row , fireworks were cancelled in Flagstaff near the Grand Canyon because of threat of fire .
The study predicts that the drought could be as severe as the Dust Bowl of the 1930s .
Unlike historical droughts , this climate change seems linked to the overall warming of the oceans and atmosphere caused by rising greenhouse gases , according to the Columbia study .
The Colorado River is the " lifeblood " of the Southwest and supplies most of the water to the region .
Its levels have dropped by about 15 percent .
About 90 percent of its water is used for agriculture , but as the population swells , so will the need for drinking water .
A Million Moved to Southwest
Five of the 10 fastest - growing states are in the Southwest , and nearly 1 million newcomers moved to Arizona , Nevada , Texas , Utah and Texas last year , according to 2006 census data .
" It is certainly consistent with what scientists have projected , " said Dan Becker , director of the global warming program at the Sierra Club .
" We 're certainly seeing worse drought in the Southwest as a harbinger of things to come . "
The searing heat of the Southwest means people largely stay indoors and jack up their air conditioners .
When they do go out , they drive everywhere , according to Becker .
" Running air conditioners is not a formula for sustainable living , " said Becker .
" It 's not good news for the planet that people are choosing a lifestyle that is dependent on more energy . "
If these scientists and their models are correct , severe drought could ignite conflicts over water that will have epic effects on development , immigration and even international politics .
" Being in the desert is unnatural , " said Seager .
" The whole Southwest is dependent on massive works of engineering , all of which were built assuming there would be more water available than there really is .
How is that whole system going to stand up to this kind of stress ?
Who gets the water ? "
Droughts as far back as the medieval period have devastated populations across the United States .
During the medieval period , a series of megadroughts of multi-decadal length struck the West and one of these , at the end of the 13th century , has been linked to the demise of the Anasazi culture .
The Dust Bowl on the Plains in the 1930s and droughts in 1950s had catastrophic effects on agriculture , migration and employment .
Since the recent drought of the 1990s and 2000s , the water levels in Nevada 's Lake Mead and Arizona 's Lake Powell are only half full .
Without smart growth and good planning , says Seager , a long - lasting modern drought could stretch water resources to the " point of social conflict . "
Border and immigration conflicts could flare as drought in Mexico pushes thousands more poor , rural migrants into the United States looking for work .
International treaties with that country may also be strained in the quest for water .
Lamont Doherty scientists said adjustments can be made to deal with the change , perhaps by withdrawing some land from production and by conserving water in urban areas .
But green policies often collide with green backs .
" We like to think that a developed country can adjust to these things , " said Seager .
" But look at the catastrophic response to Katrina .
That does n't inspire confidence at all . "

They were toys destined only to bob up and down in nothing bigger than a child 's bath - but so far they have floated halfway around the world .
The armada of 29,000 plastic yellow ducks , blue turtles and green frogs broke free from a cargo ship 15 years ago .
Since then they have travelled 17,000 miles , floating over the site where the Titanic sank , landing in Hawaii and even spending years frozen in an Arctic ice pack .
And now they are heading straight for Britain .
At some point this summer they are expected to be spotted on beaches in South - West England .
While the ducks are undoubtedly a loss to the bath - time fun of thousands of children , their adventures at sea have proved an innvaluable aid to science .
Scroll down for more
The toys have helped researchers to chart the great ocean currents because when they are spotted bobbing on the waves they are much more likely to be reported to the authorities than the floats which scientists normally use .
And because the toys are made of durable plastic and are sealed watertight , they have been able to survive years adrift at the mercy of the elements .
Boxes of the bathtime toys - made in China for the U.S. firm The First Years Inc - were washed overboard in the eastern Pacific Ocean one stormy January night in 1992 and broke open .
In the intervening time an oceanographer , Curtis Ebbesmeyer , has devoted his retirement to tracking the little yellow ducks and their friends over 17,000 miles , and it is he who has predicted that this summer they will land in the
West of England .
Mr Ebbesmeyer said : ' We 're getting reports of ducks being washed up on America 's eastern seaboard .
" It is now inevitable that they will get caught up in the Atlantic currents and will turn up on English beaches .
" Cornwall and the South - West will probably get the first wave of them . "
Mr Ebbesmeyer said the toys will be easy for British beachboardcombers to spot because they have largely faded to white and have the words " The First Years " stamped upon them .
George Bush Snr was still US President when the toys from The First Years Inc. were made in China , packed into a container and put on a ship for the US .
But after falling overboard , the sea water corroded the card - packaging and the toys floated free .
They circled the northern Pacific once before being washed up on the Alaskan shore , then all down the West coast of Canada and the US .
Mr Ebbesmeyer saw immediately how valuable the little toys would be to scientific research of the great ocean currents , the engine of the planet 's entire climate .
He correctly predicted what many thought was impossible - that thousands of them would end up washed into the Arctic ice near Alaska , and then move at a mile a day , frozen in the pack ice , around their very own North - West Passage to the Atlantic .
It proved true years later and in 2003 , the first " Friendly Floatees " were found , frozen and then thawed out , on the eastern seaboard of the U.S. and Canada .
So precious to science are they that the US firm that made them is offering a £ 50 bounty for finding one .
THE JOURNEY SO FAR :
10 JANUARY 1992 : Somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean nearly 29,000 First Years bath toys , including bright yellow rubber ducks , are spilled from a cargo ship in the Pacific Ocean .
16 NOVEMBER 1992 : Caught in the Subpolar Gyre ( counter - clockwise ocean current in the Bering Sea , between Alaska and Siberia ) , the ducks take 10 months to begin landing on the shores of Alaska .
EARLY 1995 : The ducks take three years to circle around .
East from the drop site to Alaska , then west and south to Japan before turning back north and east passing the original drop site and again landing in North America .
Some ducks are even found In Hawaii .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) worked out that the ducks travel approximately 50 per pent faster than the water in the current .
1995 - 2000 : Some intrepid ducks escape the Subpolar Gyre and head North , through the Bering Straight and into the frozen waters of the Arctic .
Frozen into the ice the ducks travel slowly across the pole , moving ever eastward .
2000 : Ducks begin reaching the North Atlantic where they begin to thaw and move Southward .
Soon ducks are sighted bobbing in the waves from Maine to Massachusetts .
2001 : Ducks are tracked in the area where the Titanic sank .
JULY TO DECEMBER 2003 : The First Years company offers a $ 100 savings bond reward for the recovery of wayward ducks from the 1992 spill .
To be valid ducks must be sent to the company and must be found in New England , Canada or Iceland .
Britain is told to prepare for an invasion of the wayward ducks as well .
2003 : A lawyer called Sonali Naik was on holiday in the Hebrides in north - west Scotland when she found a faded green frog on the beach marked with the magic words ' The First Years ' .
Unaware of the significance of her find she left it on the beach .
It was only when she was chatting to other guests at her hotel that she realised what she had seen .
One of the big question now being debated is " What would happen if China were to dump its entire Treasury portfolio in one fell swoop ? "
Caroline Baum addressed that question in China Does n't Steer the U.S. Interest - Rate Ship .
Like a highly contagious virus , fear that foreigners will dump all their U.S. Treasury securities spreads through the market at periodic intervals .
The fear is not totally unfounded .
Foreigners own a little more than half of publicly held U.S. government securities , according to the Treasury Department .
So if these foreigners -- both central banks and private investors -- woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning and decided to give the Treasury portfolio the old heave - ho ... well , you can begin to understand the basis for the recurrent nightmare .
" When people say , what happens when foreigners dump U.S. securities , I say , tell me why , " says Jim Bianco , president of Bianco Research in Chicago .
" It 's never happened before " on a long - term basis .
The latest bout of flu - like symptoms was triggered by news earlier this year that the People 's Bank of China was setting up an investment vehicle to diversify its $ 1.2 trillion of dollars .
Real - World Example
Last month , China announced it was investing $ 3 billion of its dollar reserves in Blackstone Group LP , manager of the second - largest buyout fund , to boost its returns .
What if China were to shoot itself in the foot and dump its entire Treasury portfolio in one fell swoop ?
It just so happens we have a real - world example of what it would mean , according to Bianco .
The Bank of Japan bought $ 244 billion of Treasuries in the 12 months ended August 2004 .
During that time , U.S. long - term interest rates rose and the dollar fell versus the yen .
By April 2006 , the BOJ was a net seller of U.S. Treasuries ( on a 12 - month basis ) to the tune of $ 26 billion , a swing of $ 270 billion .
U.S. interest rates fell during that period while the dollar rose .
" The BOJ bought a quarter - trillion dollars of Treasuries and then abruptly stopped and no one noticed , " Bianco says .
Never let the evidence stand in the way of a popular obsession .

Never let the evidence stand in the way of a popular obsession .
Are Dumping Fears Overblown ?
There is little reason to fear a wholesale pullout by China from U.S. government bonds , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday .
While expressing concerns about China 's runaway growth rate and what he described as overvalued stocks , Greenspan played down the prospect that Chinese authorities would sell Treasurys in earnest , forcing a sharp spike in U.S. interest rates .
Asked at a commercial real estate conference if investors should be worried about this oft - cited concern , Greenspan said : " I would n't be , no . "
Greenspan said the reason such a withdrawal was unlikely was that China would not have anyone to sell the securities to .
Greenspan said that a global liquidity boom , which he traced back to the end of the Cold War , would not go on forever .
" Enjoy it while it lasts , " he told the audience .
Now a private - sector consultant following more than 18 years at the U.S. central bank , Greenspan reiterated his prediction that China 's latest growth spurt had come too far , too fast .
" We cannot continue this rate of growth in China and the Third World .
This cannot continue indefinitely , " Greenspan said in a speech .
" Some of these price / earnings ratios are discounting nirvana . "
China would not have anyone to sell the securities to
While I agree with Bianco that no one noticed when Japan stopped buying , that simply is not a valid model for what would happen if China ( or Japan ) were to .
There is a big difference between stopping additional purchases ( or selling them slowly over a period of time ) , than a massive dump of selling everything at once .
Furthermore , given that Bianco states " " how can anyone come up with a " " about what might happen ?
Nonetheless I am sympathetic towards what I believe to be a key idea of the article : that China or Japan stopping additional purchases or divesting slowly over time , does notspell disaster .
Perhaps it will , perhaps not .
There IS a real world example of that , with falling treasury yields to boot .
On that score it's as Caroline suggests " Greenspan says there is nothing to fear : Former Federal Reserve chairman dismisses fear of China dumping U.S. Treasurys
Now there 's a comfort ...
China wo n't sell them because " " .
So instead of accumulating more treasuries , China is plowing US dollars into inflated US stocks , agencies ( tied to horrendous fundamentals in the US housing market ) , junk bonds and other garbage .
Why is it that foreigners always seem to buy market tops ( first treasuries , now equities ) ?
Regardless of the answer to that last question , there 's always a buyer at the right price .
That holds true for housing , treasuries , and even CDOs .
Let ’s have a count of hands please :
Other than bond funds that deal in treasuries , is there anyone anywhere that has anything positive to say about treasuries ?
Has such pessimism at market bottoms ever in history been rewarded ?
There ’s no denying that China has cut back on Treasury purchases .
In fact , avoidance of U.S. treasuries in now approaching a near mania everywhere , even as funding can easily be found for the junkiest of junk offerings ( not related to housing ) .
But is there any reason for China to do a wholesale dump ?
I personally doubt it .
If you disagree tell me how it suits China 's interest to massively dump treasuries in one fell swoop .
More to the point , is lack of foreign demand the reason for the recent bond selloff ?
That ’s what everyone seems to believe , but if that is the reason then what ’s the explanation for falling yields as Japan was selling ?
You can't have it both ways .
Greenspan has been wrong at every major turning point his entire career .
The fact that Greenspan states there would be no buyers could be yet another of a long series of contrary indications suggesting that internal demand just might be ready to soar .
If that 's the case , the real question then is : " How high do yields get in the meantime ? " as opposed to these unlikely " What If ? " scenarios .
As an aside , the higher rates get in the meantime the bigger the debacle in housing .
It ’s a no win situation for the Fed .

Most of my non -tech - savvy acquaintances , if given a choice between a just - barely - working Microsoft Windows 98 system and a nicely purring but alien Linux system , will choose the Microsoft Windows system .
Odd though it may seem , the average Joe is comfortable with Microsoft Windows .
The challenge facing desktop Linux is to achieve the same or greater level of comfort that Microsoft Windows enjoys .
Here are a few areas where Linux 's comfort level needs to be raised before it can thrive on the desktop , plus links to ongoing work in these areas :
win 96MB win 352MB suse 96 MB suse 352MB Linspire 96MB Linspire 352MB boot / login 50 25 94 55 132 107 start OOo2.0 - - 48 10 56 16 start MS Word 2003 3 3 - - - - CPU : 1.7GHz Sempron
RAM : 128MB ( 32 MB taken up by the onboard graphics ) , also tested with an extra 256MB of RAM installed
OS : OpenSuse 10.0 , Linspire 5.0 , or Windows XP Pro sp2
Desktop : KDE ( not sure which version )
That system is more or less unusable as shipped due to the observed poor performance .
( I 'm not trusting George here ; I verified this myself . )
Presumably the similarly equipped system sold by Wal - Mart suffers as well .
This gives Linux a bad reputation .
Surely we can improve our performance on 96MB machines .
But given the software as it stands , surely retailers can configure their systems to perform well .
To determine how much RAM OpenOffice 2.0 really wants , I benchmarked Red Hat 9 on a dual 650 MHz Pentium 3 system using lwm in place of kde or gnome .
Boot time and firefox 1.5 startup were constant at about 60 and 10 seconds regardless of RAM , but OpenOffice 2.0 startup time varied as follows :
64MB 96MB 128MB 192MB 448MB OOo2.0 startup 41 28 21 15 12
( I did similar benchmarks on an Athlon 64 laptop , and was surprised to find that the Windows version of OpenOffice starts faster under Wine than the Linux version does when the system only has 96MB of RAM !
Something 's gotta be wrong there . )

Case in point : OpenOffice .
Some blind users are worried that OpenOffice will be hard to use .
Sun has put lots of work into making OpenOffice fully accessible but admits there 's more to do .
They 're planning to use the 2.0.2 release of OpenOffice to address a few issues in OpenOffice , and they 're working on an open source tool called Orca that should make many users happy .
( Especially since it replaces packages that cost $ 500 - $ 1000 . )

In this sense , Linux is highly fragmented ; there is no universally accepted way of packaging third - party Linux software for sale or download , as each distribution requires slightly different toolchains or packagers .
The LSB is an effort to solve this problem ; their Desktop profile should make it possible to package the most common desktop Linux software portably sometime in 2006 .
But above and beyond the current LSB goals , we should enhance updaters like apt - get , yum , and up2date to treat LSB packages as first - class citizens .
It should be possible in Debian to use " apt - get install " to install or upgrade apps built as LSB packages , and it should be easy to add third parties ' repositories to the network updaters .
Distributions can help by making sure they 're LSB - compliant .
Developers can help by packaging their applications as LSB packages and giving feedback to the LSB project .

if you leave a USB device powered off when you boot , the system should not ask you whether you want to unconfigure it
if you close your laptop , it should hibernate or suspend properly ( ok , this is n't quite pluggability , but it 's close )

The Road to Actionscript 3
In : Articles
By Jonathan Greene
“ So you ’re an OOP guy , huh ?
What languages do you work in ? ”
“ Java , C# , ActionScript … ”
“ Pfft , ActionScript is n’t an OOP language ! ”
Sound familiar ?
Well , while you may not have been able to convince the masses that previous versions of the Flash scripting language , ActionScript , allowed for object - oriented programming ( OOP ) , there will be no doubt that you are a capable OOP programmer when you get some AS3 under your belt .
( For those who are unfamiliar with the term , object - oriented programming is a programming style that breaks an application into abstract data - types , or objects , which work together .
It allows for greater development flexibility , code reuse , and developer collaboration than traditional procedural programming . )
ActionScript has come a long way from its initial implementation in a little application called FutureSplash .
As Flash has grown and become a standard on the web , ActionScript has evolved beyond a traditional scripting language and has become a fully OOP language .
This article is not intended to be a tutorial of any sort , it ’s more of a brief history of ActionScript from its beginnings to AS3 .
ActionScript from play ( ) to package{}
In the earliest versions of Flash , scripting support was limited to handling very basic functionality .
Simple methods like stop ( ) and play ( ) were the main staples , but as Flash began to stake its claim as a viable rich media format on the web , developers started to push the limits of the language and began to require ever more powerful scripting capabilities .
New functionality was continually added to subsequent releases , but it was not until the release of Flash 4 in 1999 that scripting was implemented .
Flash 4 scripting introduced variables and conditionals — huge elements in a scripting language — and enabled the creation of more interactive content .
Finally , in August 2000 , ActionScript 1.0 ( AS1 ) was formally introduced with the release of Flash 5 .
This release marked the start of a trend in ActionScript that is now nearing fulfillment , namely , to transition Flash ’s coding language from a quirky scripting language to a fully realized programming language based on the ECMAScript 4 scripting proposal .
The potential for Flash to take the web by storm was already there ; giving developers a more familiar language and powerful control would be the catalyst for Flash ’s acceptance and creative dominance on the web .
( If you were wondering , ECMAScript is an international programming language that is viewed by many as the standard for handling events , objects , and actions in a programming language .
Before it was standardized , it was known as Netscape JavaScript . )
Soon after AS1 was introduced , more robust and dynamic Flash applications began to be developed .
However , AS1 was still very much a unique language with serious limitations .
At the top of the list of its shortcomings was a lack of class support .
Not having class support either kept developers from working in an object - oriented manner , or required them to use programmatic workarounds such as _prototype .
Either way , developers were having trouble writing the clean OOP code they were used to in other programming languages .
Fortunately , Macromedia was aware of Flash ’s limitations and was working on a way to make ActionScript OO - capable while still supporting all of its legacy code and syntax .
Within two years of the release of AS1 came the release of Flash MX 2004 ( version 7.0 ) , and with it the inclusion of ActionScript 2.0 ( AS2 ) .
AS2 was a major step toward bringing ActionScript up to par with other development languages such as C# and Java .
It allowed for developers to more easily implement object - oriented design patterns and techniques into their Flash projects by including an OOP development model .
While moving to a class - based approach helped developers to design their applications with scalability and re-use in mind , some tension still remained — AS2 was not a real OOP language in many people ’s eyes .
While it implemented concepts such as strong typing of variables and core OOP techniques such as extension and polymorphism , it still relied on legacy methods and techniques ( for example , having to use this.createEmptyMovieClip( ) instead of new MovieClip ( ) ) .
Another outstanding issue with AS2 was how events were handled : Listeners were attached in various ways depending on what type of object you were trying to use .
For example , a v2 component would require the addEventListener method to be used , but with different parameters than other object types that harnessed AS2 ’s event capabilties .
Furthermore , the standard mouse events for objects such as MovieClips and Buttons could only be accessed via standardized handlers such as onPress and onRelease , and would not respond to the addListener or addEventListener methods .
Considering these minor drawbacks , AS2 was a welcome addition to Flash , and helped push its limits even further than before .
as - new - and - more - complicated - flash - applications - began - to - be- deployed , - many - developers - were - overclocking <- em >- flash , - and - their - apps - were - starting -to-eat-up-resources-on-end-user-machines.-in-other- words , -co” ActionScript 1 ″ >AS1 , the AVM1 is still included in the new version of Flash Player , and you can continue to develop in AS1 or AS2 .
However , to utilize the much improved and much faster AVM2 , you must use AS3 .
Why target AVM2 ?
There are many answers , but the biggest are simple :
It ’s much faster , more secure , and its penetration is sky - rocketing .
According to Adobe ’s estimates , it has an average general speed increase of eight to fifteen percent over its predecessor .
Adobe does clarify that the speed improvements are feature - based ; certain features and calculations run twice as fast , while others run up to one hundred times faster .
As far as Flash Player 9 penetration , heavy hitters such as MySpace and YouTube have required their users to upgrade to Flash Player 9 , so this release has seen unusually fast browser penetration .
Also , the Express Install feature allows users who have not yet upgraded to the newest version of the player to perform an easy , player - based installation that returns the user right back to the Flash content .
Keeping the AVM1 was a hugely beneficial decision on the part of Adobe , as it allowed for legacy content to continue to be played and developed .
It also allowed for an as3 <- abbr >- project - targeting - avm2-to-utilize-old-content-for-example ,-to-load-an-.swf-file-targeting-avm1-.-even-with-legacy-support,-it-is-to-everyone-#8217-s-advantage-for-new-content-to-target -the-avm2.-i” ActionScript
2 ″ >AS2 , strong typing your variables ( defining a variable ’s type when the variable is declared ) was introduced as a best - practice approach .
It encouraged developers to write cleaner code and it eased debugging by allowing the compiler to fuss over cross-typing errors that could mess up an application during runtime .
However , it did not increase the efficiency of the end product .
In AS2 , all variables ( whether strongly typed or not ) were considered dynamic types , meaning more memory was required to store them as the Flash Player had to allow these variables to be recast at runtime .
In the AVM2 , the opposite is true ; only variables left un - typed will be allotted the extra memory space , while the typed variables will only be allotted the memory needed for that variable type .
Since computer memory and processing power are finite resources , the more efficiently they are used , the better an application — and the computer itself — will run .
Another major change in the AVM2 was run -time error checking .
In previous versions of ActionScript , if a variable was mis-typed ( for example , a a variable typed as a number was trying to hold a string value ) , the AVM1 would cause a compiler error and would prevent the entire SWF file from compiling correctly .
Using the Flash 9 public beta ( the publicly available version that allows for compiling AS3 code for the AVM2 ) it is easy to notice that the AVM2 breaks down gracefully from such errors .
If a typecasting error is detected , it throws a runtime error which will not prevent other areas of your SWF from continuing to work .
( While it could be assumed the error - checking will remain the same in the upcoming Flash IDE release [ Flash CS3 ] , it is a little premature to make any definitive claims . )
Summary
There are many more great changes to the new ActionScript virtual machine , and the new Flash Player in general .
However , many of them are beyond the scope of this article .
Simply noticing performance increases when using the new player and viewing AVM2 targeted content have convinced me to preach its benefits ( not to mention the wonderful development strides that come with AS3 ) .
If you have n’t done so , download the newest version of the Flash Player .
If you are a flash geek and still have not yet worked with AS3 , grab the public alpha of Flash 9 ( essentially Flash 8 with AS3 support ) , Flex Builder 2 , or the free Flex SDK and start getting familiar with AS3 .
Hopefully I ’ve whet your Actionscript 3.0 appetite ; in the future , I hope to delve into the language itself and highlight some of its key new features , including the new display list , E4X ( the new XML library ) , standardized event handling , regular expressions , and others .

正規表現ってナニモノ？
正規表現というと何やら難しそうですが、要するに文字列を指定する方法です。Windowsではファイル名を指定するとき、複数の文字と一致する「*」、任意の1文字と一致する「?」が使えます。例えば、「拡張子がwavのファイル」だったら「*.wav」とするわけです。Windowsでは、この「*」や「?」を「ワイルドカード」と呼んでいます。これを強化したものが正規表現だと考えればいいでしょう。ただし、柔軟な指定が可能な分だけ複雑になっています。
正規表現を覚えるとどんなときに便利なのか、簡単な例を挙げてみましょう。例えば、きれいに整形されてインデントの付いたテキストファイルをHTML化したいとしましょう。そのまま<PRE>タグを使うのも手ですが、やはりちゃんとしたHTMLにするには行頭の空白を削除したうえで単語の途中で改行しないようにする必要があります（たいていのWebブラウザは改行を空白として扱います。単語の途中に空白が入っていると、見た目がよろしくありません）。しかし、段落によってインデント数は違うし、行の途中に空白があるかもしれません。これでは、単純に空白を全部削除するわけにはいきません。しかし正規表現なら、「行の先頭から続く空白」という指定ができるので、これをヌル文字で置き換えれば目的が達成できるわけです。多くのWindowsアプリケーションに実装されている単純な置換コマンドではとてもこうはいきません。
コラム 正規表現とgrepとed 私が正規表現というものに初めてお目にかかったのはgrepコマンドの引数としてでしたが、大本はedあたりのようです。そもそも正規表現は英語で「
Regular Expression」と表記し、grepはg/Regular Expression/pというedのコマンドを省略したものですから。
この正規表現は、カーネルの機能ではありません。一応、POSIX 1003.2 でBasic Regular Expression とExtended Regular Expressionが定義されています。しかし、実際には文字列を扱うのに便利なことからvi、Emacs、sed、awk、Perl、Rubyといった個々のプログラムがそれぞれに実装しているというのが実情です。ライブラリも複数存在しています。Windowsでも秀丸エディタなど、正規表現をサポートしているプログラムがあります。この辺を含めて、プログラムによって細かいところが微妙に違ってきます。これはもうオンラインマニュアルやヘルプを参照しつつ、慣れるしかありません。今回は広く普及している部分を基本に、プログラムによって違う場合には注釈を入れて紹介します。

CIA analysts ' disagreed with more than 50 % ' of Pentagon team 's ' controversial ' Iraq WMD findings RAW STORY
Published : Saturday February 10 , 2007 Print This Email
This CIA analysts " disagreed with more than 50 % " of a Pentagon team 's " controversial " Iraq WMD findings , the LA Times reports .
" As the Bush administration began assembling its case for war , analysts across the U.S. intelligence community were disturbed by the report of a secretive Pentagon team that concluded Iraq had significant ties to Al Qaeda , " Greg Miller and Julian E. Barnes write for the LA Times .
The article continues , " Analysts from the CIA and other agencies ' disagreed with more than 50 % ' of 26 findings the Pentagon team laid out in a controversial paper , according to testimony Friday from Thomas F. Gimble , acting inspector general of the Pentagon . "
Excerpts from article : #
The dueling groups sat down at CIA headquarters in late August 2002 to try to work out their differences .
But while the CIA agreed to minor modifications in some of its own reports , Gimble said , the Pentagon unit was utterly unbowed .
" They did n't make the changes that were talked about in that August 20th meeting , " Gimble said , and instead went on to present their deeply flawed findings to senior officials at the White House .
The work of that special Pentagon unit  which was run by former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas J. Feith  is one of the lingering symbols of the intelligence failures leading up to the war in Iraq .

Andromeda , as it looks if observed from Seattle , WA at 8 pm PST on Jan. 7 , 2007 .
The discovery of halo stars located far from Andromeda 's center suggest our nearest galactic neighbor is much bigger than previously thought .
SEATTLE -
The discovery of several large , metal - poor stars located far from the center of the Andromeda galaxy suggests our nearest galactic neighbor might be up to five times larger than previously thought .
The newfound stars are massive , bloated stars known as red giants .
Although found far beyond the most visible portion of Andromeda - its swirling disk - the stars are still gravitationally bound to the galaxy and make up part of its extended " halo . "
" We 're typically used to thinking of Andromeda as this tiny speck of light , but the actual size of the halo ... extends to a very large radius and it actually fills a substantial portion of the night sky , " said study team member Jason Kalirai of the University of California , Santa Cruz .
The finding , presented here Sunday at the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society , suggests Andromeda is at least one million light - years across [ image ] and could help settle a discrepancy between Andromeda and the Milky Way that has long puzzled astronomers .
Andromeda
Also known as M31 , Andromeda is located only about 2.5 million light - years from Earth , making it our nearest galactic neighbor .
Like our own Milky Way , Andromeda is a classic spiral galaxy , which typically consists of three main parts : a flattened disk , a bright central bulge of densely packed stars and an extended spherical halo where stars are more sparsely distributed .
Using the Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak and the DEIMOS spectrograph on the the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii , the researchers found previously unseen red giant stars out to a distance of at least 500,000 light years from Andromeda 's center .
The researchers picked out Andromeda 's faint halo stars using a technique developed by Karoline Gilbert , a UCSC graduate student , which distinguishes the halo stars from the more numerous foreground stars in our Milky Way .
A dim foreground star and a bright star located much farther away - whose light can be diminished by interstellar gas - can be hard to tell apart because they appear to have similar luminosities as stars in our own galaxy .
The researchers liken the effect to distinguishing between the light of a firefly 10 feet away and that of a powerful beacon in the distance .
" In this case , the fireflies are dwarf stars in our own galaxy and the beacons are the red giant stars in Andromeda , " said study team member Puraga Guhathakurta , also from USCS .
Metal - poor halos
According to current galactic formation theories , the halo is the first part of a galaxy that forms .
Stars in the halo are predicted to be metal poor because they formed during a time when the universe had much less heavy metal content than it does now .
Heavy metals are created as stars evolve and then spewed out into interstellar space when ancient stars either explode as supernovas or shed their outer layers to become white dwarfs .
" The first stars are expected to be chemically deficient , and as these other components such as the disk of the galaxy form later , it is contaminated by the products of those first stars , so those stars are more metal rich , " Kalirai said .
However , instead of being metal - poor , previous studies have found that Andromeda 's halo stars were actually 10 times richer in metals than halo stars in our galaxy .
This finding puzzled astronomers because both Andromeda and the Milky Way should have similar formation histories .
The new findings could solve this discrepancy because the red giant stars are anemic , as is expected from galaxy formation theories and what is known about the Milky Way .
" If you plot the metalicity as a function of radius , you see a very nice trend where the inner parts of the galaxy are metal rich , and the outer parts of the galaxy are dominated by stars that are metal - poor , " Kalirai said .
" We now believe that previous groups have been mistakenly identifying the outer parts of the Andromeda bulge as its halo , " Guhathakurta said .
Paul Hodge , an expert on the Andromeda galaxy from Washington University who was not involved in the study , said the new finding paints a very different picture of our galactic neighbor than was available only a few years ago .
" It 's a new galaxy , " Hodge said .
" The outer parts of this galaxy are finally being revealed and its turning out to be much more interesting and beautiful than when could have imagined . "
Editor 's Note :
All week , SPACE.com is providing complete coverage of the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
It might yet turn out to be what everyone seems to hope and expect : a tale of sex and power , secrecy and scandal , hypocrisy and comeuppance .
So far , though , what we seem to have is a tale of murky motives , shifting legal strategies and chutzpah .
We ’re talking about the tangled matter of one Deborah Jeane Palfrey , who is being prosecuted in connection with what the authorities say was a pricey prostitution ring in the Washington , D.C. , area that serviced as many as 15,000 clients between 1993 and 2006 .
A federal indictment was handed up in the district on March 1 .
Ah , seen that movie , you may be thinking : Mayflower Madam , Hollywood Madam , now the D.C. Madam .
Boldface names turn up among the customers , faces are reddened , reputations punctured , all good gossipy schadenfreude fun — and the poised , polished businesswoman at the center of the affair probably winds up with talk show appearances and a book deal .
Well , not quite so fast .
There are some distinctly odd twists this time around , and we ’re not even talking about the rather postmodern fact that Ms. Palfrey apparently ran the business in question , Pamela Martin & Associates , while living a continent away in Vallejo , Calif. , north of San Francisco .
( She insists it was a legal escort service , not a call - girl ring . )
Ms. Palfrey , evidently short of money for legal defense since prosecutors froze her $ 400,000 in cash and stocks last fall , attracted a good deal of attention over the last few weeks , some of it perhaps of a panicky nature , by threatening to sell her business ’s phone records , showing the telephone numbers of thousands of customers , to the highest bidder .
( But wait : If , as she insists , nothing naughty went on , who cares who her customers were ?
Is n’t the list only worth something if it points a finger of guilt at some famous johns — and therefore at Ms. Palfrey too ? )
On Tuesday , Ms. Palfrey changed course .
Her lawyer told WTOP radio in Washington that she had decided not to sell the records .
Instead they will be handed over to a news organization , free of charge .
Which one ?
Nobody is saying yet .
What , if not money , does Ms. Palfrey get out of that ?
The news organization ’s help in combing the records and identifying customers , who can then become witnesses for the defense , the lawyer , Montgomery B. Silbey , told WTOP .
And what does the news organization get ?
The opportunity to break the news if it finds anyone prominent in the list .
About everybody else , we are told , the news organization has promised to be discreet .
Mr. Silbey said Ms. Palfrey shied away from a sale , and the presumable mass revelation of names to follow , because “ she does n’t want to do the average customer any harm , unless that customer would be critical to her defense . ”
More twists abound .
Prosecutors usually like to lay out damning evidence publicly , but in this case , they tried for a court order to prevent Ms. Palfrey from giving anyone the phone records or any other evidence from the case .
( The motion is on The Smoking Gun here , along with archived copies of Pamela Martin & Associates ’s web page offering a flat $ 275 rate for 90 minutes , and a help - wanted ad seeking atttractive women over 23 with at least two years of college . )
And another : Ms. Palfrey is herself suing 15 woman she formerly employed as escorts , 14 of them as yet unnamed , saying that when they did things with customers that amounted to illegal prostitution , they were violating their contract with her .
( Oh , so something naughty was going on , after all ? )
The number of respondents in that suit happens to match pretty closely the number of former escorts who testified before the grand jury , according to charging documents cited on The Smoking Gun .
That suit wo n’t go ahead until the criminal charges are disposed of , a judge ruled last week .
Meanwhile , whoever might be embarrassed to be found in those phone records is now no longer just at Ms. Palfrey ’s mercy , but also at the mercy of that mystery news organization .
Wonder how long before we know .
Meaning often needs to be extracted from the specific context in which a gesture is being used .

Human spoken language may have evolved from a currency of hand and arm gestures , not simply through improvements in the basic vocalisations made by primates .
This “ gesture theory ” of language evolution has been given weight by new findings showing that the meaning of a primate ’s gesture depends on the context in which it is used , and on what other signals are being given at the same time .
Gesture is used more flexibly than vocalised communication in nonhuman primates , the researchers found .
A proto-language using a combination of gesture and vocalisation is therefore more likely to have given rise to human language , than simply an improvement in the often involuntary vocalisations that primates make , they say .

Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta , Georgia , US , tested the idea by looking at how strongly gesture and vocal signals are tied to context in our closest primate relatives – chimpanzees and bonobos .
Versatile gesture
By observing captive groups of bonobos and separate groups of captive chimps , Pollick and de Waal identified 31 gestures and 18 facial or vocal signals made by the apes , and recorded the context in which they were used .
It turns out that the facial and vocal signals were practically the same in both species , but the same gesture was used in different contexts both between and within species .
For example , the vocal signal “ bared - teeth scream ” signals fear in chimps and bonobos , but the signal “ reach out up ” – where an animal stretches out an arm , palm upwards – has different meanings .
It may translate as begging for food or as begging for support from a friend , says de Waal .
“ The open hand gesture is also used after fights between two individuals to beg for approach and contact during a reconciliation .
So the gesture is versatile , but the meaning depends on context . ”
The work offers strong support for the gesture hypothesis of language evolution , says psychologist Michael Corballis at the University of Auckland in New Zealand .
“ It implies that manual gestures are freer of context than vocal ones , and can therefore be adapted to language , ” he says .
“ To put it another way , manual gestures can be controlled voluntarily , whereas in non-human primates , vocalisations are largely involuntary and limited to emotional situations . ”
Closer than chimps
Humans often gesture in combination with speech – likewise , chimps and bonobos will make a gesture and vocalise at the same time , which is known as using “ multimodal ” signals .
Pollick and de Waal found that multimodal signals were more likely to elicit a response in bonobos than in chimps .
“ It seems to fit other indicators that bonobos have a more complex integration of signals , so that gestures do not just emphasise the meaning of other signals , but perhaps transform them , ” says de Waal .
Bonobos and chimps both split from the line that led to Homo sapiens about 6 six million years ago , and they themselves parted about 2.5 million years ago .
However , several lines of evidence suggest we are slightly closer to bonobos than we are to chimps .
De Waal says that their work suggests bonobos are a more useful species for understanding the evolution of language .
For one thing , they seem to have moved further from the common ancestor , at least in terms of the complexity of their communication , than have chimps .
Bonobos also engage in dialogue - like vocalisations .
For example , during confrontations , males alternate screams at each other .
And now Pollick and de Waal have found that gestures vary from group to group , and are more effective in combination with other signals , which is not seen in chimps .

The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can ‘ throw the rascals out ’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy .
— Carroll Quigley , Tragedy and Hope : A History of the World in our Time
People who think of themselves as Democrats need to look in the mirror and deal with reality .
They want so hard to believe that their party is n’t responsible for this catastrophe ( and offers a solution to it ) , but , deep down , they must know that there ’s only one party allowed in the Legion of Doom .
Democrats need to come clean with themselves .
No more lies .
There are no Democrats .
There are no Republicans .
There are only fascists .
My unwavering cynicism toward the Democratic Party has NEVER let me down .
That ’s why , with total confidence , I wrote the following before the last midterm election :
Please understand : THERE ARE NO POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THE U.S. IS FACING .
The outcome of this election is meaningless , one way or the other .
The more you keep grasping for glimmers of hope within the political system , the worse off you will be .
…
Will a big Democratic win calm people down ?
Maybe that ’s what They ’ll allow .
It might ease the panic , so the ship of fools can sail on for another few months .
If They were smart , that ’s what They ’d do .
I got emails from smart , kind , well - meaning people , telling me that I was n’t “ thinking positively ” and that I should give the Democrats a chance …
Where are those people now ?
Why do n’t I hear from them ?
Will any of you admit to sending me those emails now ?
Well , it ’s “ another few months ” on and the panic is setting in again .
Democrats are like victims of domestic abuse .
They keep coming back , no matter what , until the abusers eventually kill them .
That abuser / victim cycle is incredibly difficult to break , and I think that much of what motivates Democrats is misguided energy borne out of a subconscious realization that they are helpless in a time of increasing chaos .
They have a desire to save themselves , but are running back into the arms of the abuser , the cause of their grief .
The abuser offers solutions and protection , but , as we know , that just means more insults and savage beatings .
Embrace that desire to save yourself , but not the abuser .
Stop worrying about trying to “ save the world . ”
Sorry , friend , but that me - too ego trip is going to get flattened under the weight of almost unbelievable ignorance , greed and what has become an endemic zombie consumer death urge .
Besides , how can you save the world if you ca n’t even save yourself …
Want to learn necessary skills for the future , improve the environment and constrain the RepubliCrat vampire ?
Drastically reduce your requirements for — and your pursuit of — money and the rest will follow .
How ?
There are as many ways as there are people .
Think about it .
Turn off the TV , the radio .
Take a vacation from the Internet for a while .
Listen to yourself .
My wife and I offer an example , but ours is just one way .
It ’s not for everyone , but then again , what is ?
Hmm …
Well , we all need clean air , food and water .
Those are a few factors to consider in your plans , whatever they happen to be .
Again , the Democrats and Republicans have nothing to offer you on these issues .
Realize that , while there ’s no out of the Matrix , you can hack the thing in innovative , interesting and efficient ways .
Politics , though , is a prison inside the Matrix .
It ’s a honeypot designed to trap your consciousness .
There ’s nothing useful or even interesting about politics .
It ’s a mechanism of formalized , legalized graft .
Why look to it to improve the situation ?
Turn your back on politics and take responsibility for your own life .
Set your own priorities .
Plan .
Execute .
For the rest of the victims , there ’s always the next election and another black eye .

The first fossils of half - billion - year - old clusters of soft - shelled eggs have been found preserved in a strange new way in south China - some of the eggs were even caught in the act of dividing .
The three - dimensional clusters of petrified eggs from invertebrate animals that lived in a sea 501 million to 510 million years ago are preserved in silica - glass essentially .
Jih - Pai Lin , an Ohio State University ( School of Earth Sciences ) paleontologist , explained this is a totally unexpected way for soft eggs to fossilize and survive for eons .
Lin is the lead author of a report on the egg clusters published in the December issue of the journal Geology .
The discovery means there are probably even more early eggs and embryos fossilized in ancient rocks .
Fossil hunters just need to keep in mind the different ways they might be preserved , and therefore the different types of rocks in which they might be found .
Continued at " Dinosaurs : Ancient Egg Cluster Preserved in Glass "
-------
Based on the Geology paper " Silicified egg clusters from a Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale - type deposit , Guizhou , south China "
Abstract :
Although knowledge of Cambrian fossil eggs and / or embryos has increased dramatically , embryos were previously unknown in siliciclastic settings of coeval strata .
Here we report for the first time egg clusters in a fine - grained siliciclastic matrix from the Middle Cambrian Kaili Formation lagerstatte ( 513-501 Ma ) , south China .
Some were imaged under synchrotron radiation .
These spheroids are preferentially preserved as microcrystalline quartz and interpreted as marine invertebrate fossil eggs based on patterns of spheroid arrangement , shape , and analogues of fossil and modern invertebrate eggs .
Embryos with cleavage cells are evident in at least one cluster .
Detailed element analyses show that eggs are primarily preserved as solid silica replacement , and there is a calcite layer covering the eggs replacing the original organic layer .
Silicification of intact invertebrate egg clusters is reported here as a new mode of preservation associated with a Burgess Shale * - type deposit .
-------
* Info on the Burgess Shale :
The Burgess Shale is a black shale fossil bed ( Lagerstatte ) named after Burgess Pass , close to where it was found , high up in the Canadian Rockies in Yoho National Park near the town of Field , British Columbia .
Fossils were first found in the Burgess Shale in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott ( info ) , who returned in the following years to collect additional specimens .
Walcott recognized the arthropod fossils were new and unique species , but careful reexaminations showed that many in fact constituted entire new phyla of life , and even today some have proven impossible to classify .
The fossils are especially valuable because they include appendages and soft parts that are rarely preserved .

LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Leading media executives took a combative tone against Internet companies on Tuesday , suggesting that Big Media increasingly considers new content distributors like Google Inc. to be more foe than friend .

At a panel discussion on the second day of the 56th annual National Cable & Telecommunications Association conference , top executives said talk of the demise of traditional media in the digital age was overblown .
While new distribution technologies like the Internet and mobile phones are siphoning television audiences , media companies argued that the Web also brings new revenue streams .
But the discussion quickly moved to criticism of the perception that traditional media businesses are dead , and to the rampant copyright offenses enabled by new digital technologies .
“ The Googles of the world , they are the Custer of the modern world .
We are the Sioux nation , ” Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive Richard Parsons said , referring to the Civil War American general George Custer who was defeated by Native Americans in a battle dubbed “ Custer ’s Last Stand ” .
“ They will lose this war if they go to war , ” Parsons added , “ The notion that the new kids on the block have taken over is a false notion . ”
Time Warner defended its discussions on copyright protection with Internet search leader Google Inc. , which another panel member , Viacom Inc. , has sued .
Viacom , owner of the MTV and Comedy Central networks , is seeking more than $ 1 billion from Google and its online video site YouTube , accusing them in a lawsuit of “ massive intentional copyright infringement . ”
Viacom CEO
Philippe Dauman said on the panel his company had discussed working with Google and YouTube earlier than other major media companies , by virtue of the popularity of its programs on the Web and their resonance with young viewers .
Dauman said Viacom had little choice after failing to reach an agreement , as video clips of its shows were uploaded by YouTube users without its permission .
“ So , it was only reluctantly after trying for a long period of time , to reach a deal that we found that we could not tolerate having our content taken , when we ’ve got Brian and Dick and others compensating us for it , ” Dauman said , referring to Comcast Corp.
Chief Executive Brian Roberts and Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons .
“ We were forced into it , ” he added .
Google , whose advances in applying its Internet paid search technology to the television industry , radio and print has spooked traditional media companies , owns a 5 percent stake in Time Warner ’s AOL Internet unit .
“ We ’re in a world where we ’re a partner with everybody and we ’re fighting everybody , ” News Corp .
Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin said on the panel .
Despite the attention from Wall Street , the media industry and the press , executives said the percentage of overall sales contributed by digital businesses remained small and they should be mindful of destroying existing lucrative businesses .
“ The amount of money we get from those ( Internet companies ) are a fraction of those we get from the cable industry , ” Chernin said .
“ We have to be careful not to disaggregate . ”
News Corp. is likely in a position to know how enemies today could turn into friends tomorrow .
A source familiar with the matter said News Corp . ’s Fox Interactive Media , which oversees its popular Internet social network MySpace , had reached a preliminary deal to buy photo sharing site Photobucket for an estimated $ 250 million .
MySpace last month blocked traffic coming from Photobucket after the photo service began running ads on photos displayed on MySpace sites .
MySpace said it had violated its service terms .
“ You ’ll see more acquisitions , ” Chernin said .
“ This is a world where the big get bigger .
You ’ll see increased consolidation . ”
Can you name all three branches of government ?
Can you name even one ?
Do you know who your congressman is ?
Your senators ?
Do you even know how many senators each state gets ?
If you know the answers to these questions ( and you probably do because you ’re a newspaper reader ) , you ’re in the minority .
In fact , the data have long been settled .
A very high percentage of the U.S. electorate is n’t very well qualified to vote , if by “ qualified ” you mean having a basic understanding of our government , its functions and its challenges .
Almost half of the American public does n’t know that each state gets two senators .
More than two - thirds ca n’t explain the gist of what the Food and Drug Administration does .
Now , the point is n’t to say that the American people are stupid , which is the typical knee - jerk reaction of self - absorbed political junkies .
Rather , it ’s that millions of Americans just do n’t care about politics , much the same way that I do n’t care about cricket :
They think it ’s boring .
Ask me how cricket works and I ’m likely to respond with the same blank , uncomprehending stare my old basset hound used to give me when I asked him to chase a Frisbee .
Ask the typical American to explain , say , what a cloture vote is , and you ’ll get the same .
And yet , even to suggest that maybe some people just should n’t vote is considered the height of un-Americanism .
Indeed , as economist Bryan Caplan notes in his bracing new book , “ The Myth of the Rational Voter , ” there are few subjects on which Americans are more dogmatic and ideological .

Consider the hoary cliche , attributed to Democratic New York Gov. Al Smith in 1928 : “ All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy . ”
As Caplan notes , this means that no evidence of any nature can ever , under any circumstances , be held against democracy : “ A person who said , ‘ All the ills of the markets can be cured by more markets ’ would be lampooned as the worst sort of market fundamentalist .
Why the double standard ? ”
One response is that democracy is at the core of our secular faith .
But surely even democracy voluptuaries can appreciate that faith - based ideologies can be taken too far .
We do not let children vote , yet no serious person would argue that our democratic values are significantly undermined because we bar 10 - year - olds from the voting booth .
Voter turnout fanatics concerned with more than mere aggrandizement for the Democratic Party argue that voting is of itself a sign of civic health .
But does n’t it matter why you vote ?
Last summer , an Arizona activist went so far as to propose that every voter be enrolled in a state lottery , on the assumption that what our political system really lacks is more voters who need to be bribed with lottery tickets .

Some more serious people suggest that voting should be mandatory , believing that if the “ disenfranchised ” -- often code for dream Democratic voters -- cast ballots , the country would move profoundly to the left .
John Kenneth Galbraith proclaimed in 1986 : “ If everybody in this country voted , the Democrats would be in for the next 100 years . ”
This last bit is almost certainly false .
The evidence is that if every eligible voter voted , national elections would probably remain unchanged .
“ Simply put , ” political scientists Benjamin Highton and Raymond Wolfinger wrote in their 2001 article , “ The Political Implications of Higher Turnout , ” in the British Journal of Political Science , U.S. “ voters ’ preferences differ minimally from those of all citizens ; outcomes would not change if everyone voted . ”
S o , maybe , just maybe , we have our priorities wrong .
Perhaps cheapening the vote by requiring little more than an active pulse ( Chicago famously waives this rule ) has turned it into something many people do n’t value .
Maybe the emphasis on getting more people to vote has dumbed - down our democracy by pushing participation onto people uninterested in such things .
Maybe our society would be healthier if politicians aimed higher than the lowest common denominator .
Maybe the opinions of people who do n’t know the first thing about how our system works are n’t the folks who should be driving our politics , just as people who do n’t know how to drive should n’t have a driver ’s license .
Instead of making it easier to vote , maybe we should be making it harder .
Why not test people about the basic functions of government ?
Immigrants have to pass a test to vote ; why not all citizens ?

A voting test would point the arrow of civic engagement up , instead of down , sending the signal that becoming an informed citizen is a valued accomplishment .
And if that ’s not a good enough reason , maybe this is :
If you threaten to take the vote away from the certifiably uninformed , voter turnout will almost certainly get a boost .

When are you done writing a piece of code ?
Is it when you have implemented the necessary functionality ?
When you have tested it ?
I believe there is more to professional - quality code than just getting it to function properly .
What else is there ?
Making sure the code is maintainable - well designed and understandable .
I use the term polishing code to refer to this kind of work that is done on a code base after it is functioning properly .
I like the analogy with woodworking : once a piece is assembled and finished , the final step is to polish the surface to make it shine .
Based on the code bases I have seen and worked with , polishing code is not a frequent practice .
In fact , I have encountered people who are surprised by my commitment to it , or who do not believe in its value .
Many of these people are not developers , or have not spent much time doing ongoing software maintenance .
Part of the reason for the lack of appreciation is that polishing code provides long term benefits for a short term cost .
This induces project managers and developers on development projects with compressed time frames to skip such kinds of activities .
In other cases , non-technical managers simply have no idea of the poor quality of code their developers are producing .
One project manager I dealt with personally reviewed and made minor grammatical corrections to the documentation produced by the project team , but had no similar processes in place for the poor quality code produced by the project team .
So why do I believe that polishing code is valuable ?
I have several reasons .
The most important is that it minimizes the long term cost of maintaining the software .
To explain this , I like to use the concept of technical debt .
Quality issues such as poor design in software represent a debt for which you will need to make continuing interest payments later in the form of increased effort to understand or change the software .
This is the case even if the software functions correctly .
To pay off that debt , you must address the underlying quality issues - in other words , you must polish the code .
Martin Fowler wrote a recent article about this topic in the context of good design that explains the trade - offs involved .
Another reason I polish my code is that it is a permanent record of my capabilities as a professional software developer .
My reputation amongst developers who need to work with my code later is in large part determined by my code 's quality .
Code of mine that is difficult to understand or change or is riddled with defects will have maintenance developers cursing at me .
I would rather have them be pleasantly surprised at finding helpful comments and a clean design .
So now you hopefully believe that polishing code is valuable , but you may be asking how exactly to go about it .
In terms of timing , polishing of code should ideally be done throughout the development of a section of code .
In reality , however , it is much easier to focus on one issue at a time , and the primary issue is just getting the code to work .
Therefore after the code is written and passing the automated unit tests , it is only natural for it to have some rough spots .
This is the ideal point to do a review of your code to identify places to polish .
My basic goals when polishing are to improve the understandability of the code and to improve its design .
During the review , I look for specific problems impacting these two goals .
When I find such a problem , I immediately rectify it by refactoring the code .
Often it is as easy as using one of the built - in refactoring tools of the development environment to safely make the change with a near - zero risk of introducing defects .
Some examples of specific problems I look for are :
Duplication of logic in two or more places .
Undesired dependencies .
For applications divided into layers such as persistence , business and user interface , the dependencies between the layers need to be managed .
Finding undesired dependencies such as the use of persistence code directly within the user interface layer is a strong indicator of a design problem .
Overly complex logic , like a large switch statement or series of nested if - else statements .
Sometimes such logic can be drastically simplified through the use of object - oriented design principles .
Too many classes within one package .
Too many methods within a class , particularly public methods .
This is often an indicator that the class is trying to do too much and should be split into multiple classes .
Overly long file , in excess of a couple thousand lines .
Even in Java where each public class is forced to be in its own file , it is possible to end up with very long files .
This may be because there is too much logic within the class , or it may be because of many nested classes or private classes in the same file .
In the latter case , these can be moved to one or more separate files .
Overly long methods .
Anything longer than about one screen warrants a closer look to see if it can be simplified , usually via an extract method refactoring .
Poorly named classes , methods , fields or local variables .
One indicator I look for is a one - sentence comment describing a vaguely named variable or method .
Usually the variable or method can be renamed to capture the essence of the comment and the comment can then be deleted .
Lack of a class comment .
A concise summary of the purpose of the class is often quite useful .
If it is difficult to come up with such a summary , it is an indicator that the class may be trying to do too much or does not have a clear focus .
Ron Jeffries ' site http://www.xprogramming.com/ has a great series of articles that provide concrete examples of polishing code , including before and after samples of the source code .
Polishing your own code is good , but it is better if your entire team adopts the practice .
An effective way to ensure code is polished within a team is via code reviews .
While ideally everyone should polish their own code , having a separate reviewer check for code quality problems is a big help .
This is especially true for ensuring that the code is understandable by someone other than the original developer .
Applications with polished code are easier to understand and modify , which helps extend their useful life .
Applications with poor quality code are more likely to be partially rewritten or even completely replaced if the cost of ongoing maintenance becomes too high .
Which of these applications would you prefer to contribute to ?
The choice is yours .

CHICAGO , July 30 — Tens of thousands of people here have signed petitions protesting a permit granted in Indiana that allows the largest oil refinery in the Midwest to discharge more pollutants into Lake Michigan .
The petitions , which advocates say they expect to deliver next week to Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana , reflect growing concerns in the Great Lakes States that the permit undercuts efforts to clean up Lake Michigan .
Organizers said Monday that they had collected 45,000 signatures .
“ At a time when we ’ve spent billions and billions of dollars investing in the rehabilitation of the Great Lakes , we should not be taking a step backward , ” said Cameron Davis , the president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes , a conservation advocacy group that has participated in the petition drive .
Last week , by a vote of 387 to 26 , the United States House of Representatives approved a resolution urging Indiana to reconsider the permit .
The resolution was introduced by Representatives Rahm Emanuel , Democrat of Illinois , and Vernon J. Ehlers , Republican of Michigan .

The super heavy weight fight
The first issue with the weight started in the wheels and tires .
I replaced the stock tires and wheels to 2.2 , but immediately encountered flat tires , especially when crawling .
The stock foam can not support the weight , and the tires basically were always compressed , with the rim of the wheels grounded .
This also made it impossible to turn at all .
I found the foam solution by replacing the tire foams with extra large pool noodles .
These have the correct outer diameter , and only required the inner hole to be trimmed to fit the rims .
Although it looked like one of the simpler projects , it turned out to be quite a nightmare solving all sorts of issue while converting it to steam .
In the end it ran better than I could have hoped for , but it was not an easy road .
Tamiya designed the High - Lift for the light weight of electric rigs .
The single biggest problem was the weight of the steam parts , the Steam Beetle weighs in at 20 lb. empty with no water .
The first issue with the weight started in the wheels and tires .

I found the foam solution by replacing the tire foams with extra large pool noodles .
These have the correct outer diameter , and only required the inner hole to be trimmed to fit the rims .
RC4WD provided me with a set of really sweet bead locks , and these really helped in holding the foam and tire in place , bolts to both sides of the rims .
These aluminum wheels are really nicely machined , and fit perfectly .
2.2 rims with foam .
The foam did not support the 20 lb weight of the steam beetle .
RC4WD bead locks with pool noodle as foam .
These rims are beautifully machined aluminum , and bolted on both sides .
Final wheels works perfectly .
Second issue was the suspension .... when you turn , it leans , and stays leaned .
I had similar issues with my steam rover , but at least that one had 6 wheels and shocks to spread out the load .
Luckily this was easily solved by using the maximum amount of leafs supplied in the High - Lift kit .
And lastly , the weight really gave the servos a hard time when it came to steering .
I had doubled up the servos with 2 high torque futabas , initially for 4 wheel steering .
However , the wheels just would n't budge under the load .
I then locked the back wheels , and linked the servos together to just steer the front .
I also had to , for the first time , rely on 7.2 v battery to power the servos .... all 7 of them .
The Air Steam Bug
Allomyrhina dichotomus ) .
First step is to switch the front and rear ends of the high lift , because I really wanted to have the engine exposed in the back , and not hidden in the head .
Part of the appeal of SteamPunk is the visibility of the mechanics , and I rather not cover it all up .
After laying out the aluminum frame , I realized that it looked very familiar .
After some surfing , I found that an old anime show called Time Bokan , has a beetle vehicle called Mechabuton , it has wings that can open , as well as an engine in the back !
I have vague memories of the show .... must have stored it away as a kid , and filed it under : " make one of these when you grow up "

I 'm a huge fan of Tamiya , everything Tamiya is subject to careful consideration for a steam conversion ( this is the 8th one so far ) .
I 've been thinking about this High - Lift steam conversion for quite some time , and finally devoted my best running steam plant to the project .
The reasons for using the High - Lift as a steam project , are because it has a nice location for a motor , strong frame , nice stiff leaf spring , and 3 speed tranny .
The Cheddar Pegasus is a marine plant , so the engine is made to fit propeller shafts .
Adapting it for this project required the engine to adapt to a much smaller pinion shaft .
Luckily the High - Lift chassis had just enough room in the front ( which later became the back ) to fit the 4 cylinder engine .
The boiler was mounted as centered to the chassis as possible to spread out the distribution of the weight to the four wheels .
To further improve the performance to the chassis , I upgraded all of the bearings to ball bearings .
This made a pretty noticeable difference .
I just wished that I had put in the ball bearings during the initial build of the chassis , as replacing them meant disassembling just about everything !
I also locked the front and rear differentials , since this thing wo n't be breaking any land speed records ..... although I am pretty sure that it's the fastest R/C steam beetle on the planet .
After getting these issues worked out , it 's time to take just a steam 4x4 and add some character to it .
Once again I turn to nature for the best designs .
I decided a beetle would be suitable for a crawler , and immediately went for my favorite bug , the Japanese rhino beetle ( The aluminum frame were bought at a local hardware store , they come in variety of thickness and lengths .
Aluminum is light , easy to drill , cut , and bend , great stuff to work with .
The aluminum sheet metal was then applied by nuts and bolts .
Hinges were used for the head - as to get to fueling the gas tank , water reservoir , and igniter .
hinges were also added for the wing shells - to get to the condenser and rc gear .
I got all geeked out and used 2.4 GHz DSM spread spectrum this time , and used the Spektrum DX6 .
After using up the joysticks , I had 2 extra channels left , might as well add servos to the wing shells .
Adding the servos to the wings were more challenging than I had anticipated , there is n't much room for servos .
After some hair pulling , I realized that servos can be mounted to the inside of the shells themselves , rather than to the frame to control the shells .
Vegan Mango Salad Recipe

Fried Chinese Chive Cakes Recipe Fried Chinese Chive Cakes are a favorite snack that Thais inherited from our Chinese immigrants .
Fresh Chinese chives on their own do not have much flavor , but have a spiciness that resembles garlic .
When stir - fried , the leaves transform into a tasty vegetable dish .
Combining the sauce , the crunchy fried cake exterior and the tender cake on the inside makes Fried Chinese Chive Cakes a hit .
In Thailand , you see the same vendor offering both chive dumplings and chive cakes .
While the flavors are comparable , the Chive Cakes are so much easier to make .
I personally prefer eating the cakes to the dumplings .

Pork Meatballs
Pork meatballs are a big hit amongst Thai children .
You can often see a meatball vendor by the school entrance .
Fried and grilled pork meatballs are skewed for easy handling and dipped in a sweet and spicy sauce .
The meatball vendors pride themselves in having a delicious secret sauce .
The pork meatballs are made with lean pork and spices .
The mixture is finely ground until very smooth at a low temperature .
Sometimes , ice is added in the grinding process .
The pork mixture is made into balls and dropped into a hot water bath .
Good meatballs are bouncy and smooth .
When boiled , they expand to double in size .

Tom Yum Noodles Recipe Most people know Tom Yum Goong but a few know Tom Yum Noodles or ‘ Guay Tiew Tom Yum ’ .
Some dishes come and go but the noodles are as popular now as when I was a kid .
The flavors are a combination of Chinese noodles with Thai flavors , similar to Pad Thai but different .
Both share the key ingredients : ground peanuts , lime and chili powder .
Like Pad Thai , Tom Yum Noodles were never a haute cuisine but everyday lunch .
You can walk into most Thai noodle shops and ask for Tom Yum Noodles .
They ’ll ask you for your choice of noodles ; egg noodles ( sen mi ) , small rice noodles ( send lek ) , large rice noodles ( sen yai ) or rice vermicelli ( mi kow ) .
You also have a choice to have the soup or not .
There are 2 steps in making the noodle soup .
First , you make the soup and let it simmer for 1 hour while you prep the noodles and the condiments .
The second step is assembling the noodles , vegetable and condiments into a bowl .

Braised Pork Shank on Rice Recipe Walking around Thailand ’s streets , markets and food courts , if you spot a giant bowl the size of baby bathtub with rich dark brown liquid bubbling with deep brown pork shanks and green Chinese broccoli on the side , you might want to stop for a treat .
It ’s a comfort food , it ’s a favorite food and it ’s so delicious .
In Thailand , when you order the Braised Pork Shank ( aka Kow Kha Moo ) , you 'd let the vendor know if you want , rind only , meat only or combo .
The skin on Braised Pork Shank is soft and gummy and the meat is tender and full of seasoning .
Together with the blanched Chinese broccoli and pickled mustard , the braised shank tastes so good with the slightly spicy and sour chili garlic sauce .
You ’ll also get fresh garlic cloves and Thai chili peppers to cut the cholesterol down .
Served with rice , the Braised Pork Shank is a complete meal with meat , vegetable and pickles .
This braised pork shank recipe is easy to make but has many steps to it ; boil the pork shanks , make the seasonings , boil the eggs , blanch Chinese broccoli and chop the pickled mustard .
With 2 shanks , you can make it a day in advance and have many delicious meals .
You ca n’t go wrong with Kow Kha Moo. Read On ! >>
Pad Kee Mao Recipe
In Thailand , traditionally , hard liquors are more popular than beer and wine .
People get together to drink and eat at a restaurant and then just continue to sit and talk and drink long past dinner .
Since drinking reduces the sensitivity of the taste buds , people ask for spicier food as the evening progresses , so the cooks pile on chili peppers and seasonings to please the crowd .
Pad Kee Mao has changed quite a bit in Thailand .
Some people now make it with vegetables .
Some recipes confused Pad Kee Mao with Pad Cha which starts the same as Pad Kee Mao with garlic and chili peppers but ends up with Chinese keys , green peppercorns , kaffir lime leaves and Thai basil .
This Kee Mao recipe keeps the authentic flavors and ingredients with the right amount of heat .

Drunken Noodles Recipe
Over the years , Drunken Noodles or Pad Kee Mao has acted like drunkard , relaxing its boundaries .
What started simple and clean , got dressed in random vegetables and herbs .
Then people confused it with another dish .
Now it is barely recognizable .
This recipe dials Pad Kee Mao back to its roots .
When I was still living in Thailand , Pad Kee Mao was a very hot stir fry with meat , holy basil and seasoning .
When oyster sauce became popular ; it was incorporated into Pad Kee Mao. Spaghetti Kee Mao was popularized .
Seafood Kee Mao was added .
Recently , Pad Kee Mao has gotten so drunk that it ca n’t even remember its repertoire .
More vegetables and herbs slowly show up on Pad Kee Mao ’s ingredient list ; mushrooms , onions , baby corn , bell peppers , carrots , green beans , kaffir leaves , Chinese keys and fresh green peppercorns , Thai basil and even eggs .
All in all , the common thread is still the intense heat .
The tongue of a drunk can’t feel the spicy hot chili peppers ; the vibrancy of the flavors and seasoning must make up for it .
As most of us will be cooking and eating Drunken Noodles sober , I tone down the heat but keep all other flavors true to the dish .
When you feel like having the noodles with an insanely amount of alcohol , crank up the seasoning and the chili peppers as you please .
Enjoy !

Even in a political climate where everyone agrees that change needs to be made , that change never happens :
WASHINGTON , July 25 â € ”
For the many critics of farm subsidies , including President Bush and Speaker Nancy Pelosi , this seemed like the ideal year for Congress to tackle the federal payments long criticized as enriching big farm interests , violating trade agreements and neglecting small family farms .
Many crop prices are at or near record highs .
Concern over the countryâ€™s dependence on foreign oil has sent demand for corn - based ethanol soaring .
European wheat fields have been battered by too much rain .
And market analysts are projecting continued boom years for American farmers into the foreseeable future .
But as the latest farm bill heads to the House floor on Thursday , farm - state lawmakers seem likely to prevail in keeping the old subsidies largely in place , drawing a veto threat on Wednesday from the White House .
â€œThe bill put forth by the committee misses a major opportunity , â€ Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said Wednesday .
â€
œThe time really is right for reform in farm policy .
â€
Faced with fierce opposition from the House Agriculture Committee , Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders lowered their sights and are now backing the committeeâ€™s bill , in part to protect rural freshmen lawmakers who may be vulnerable in the 2008 elections .
Things like this are n’t the fault of Republicans or Democrats , they are the natural outgrowth of the political system that we live in today .
To a large degree , the United States Government exists as a massive conduit for the transfer of wealth from one sector of the economy to the other .
In this case , the so - called impoverished family farmer has convinced politicians , largely through the exercise of political power and the power of the purse , that your tax money and mine to them .
It makes no economic sense whatsoever , and everyone agrees it ’s a bad idea .
And yet , it continues , and continues to grow .
This , I am afraid , is the political reality that anyone who truly advocates liberty must deal with .
Until the attitude of the general public is changed , any incremental victory that liberty may win will be temporary at best .

Chertoff chides left , right over bill
Says opposition may hurt interests of both
McLEAN , Va. — Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Wednesday that Republican conservatives working to block an immigration bill risk endorsing a " silent amnesty " by insisting on deportations that are " not going to happen . "
Chertoff also leveled criticism at liberal immigrant rights advocates , saying they could prolong the anguish of immigrant families by withholding support for legislation that could make them legal .
His warnings came in an 80 - minute appearance he and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez made before the USA TODAY editorial board .
The two men's appearance is a preview of a media blitz by the Bush administration as Congress prepares to go on a week - long Memorial Day recess that will give both sides in the emotional debate a chance to sway senators on a bill President Bush wants as part of his legacy .
The Homeland Security secretary said he canceled an overseas trip to help .
In addition , the president is expected to stump for the bill next week and a " rapid response " team is countering critics , not only in the conventional media but , for the first time , on Internet blogs , said White House communications director Kevin Sullivan .
The president 's press secretary , Tony Snow , already has debated talk radio host Rush Limbaugh and TV commentator Lou Dobbs , both critics of the bill .
Chertoff acknowledged that there is " a fundamental unfairness " in a bill allowing illegal immigrants to stay .
But trying to force them to leave would be impossible , Chertoff said , " We are bowing to reality . "
He dismissed the argument of Republican conservatives , such as Rep. Brian Bilbray , R - Calif. , who argue that illegal immigrants will leave if strict enforcement of U.S. laws makes it impossible for them to find a job .
" You 're not going to replace 12 million people who are doing the work they 're currently doing , " Chertoff said .
" If they do n't leave , then you are going to give them silent amnesty .
You 're either going to let them stay or you 're going to be hypocritical . "
Bilbray said his idea has n't worked because " there 's been a conscious strategy of not enforcing the law . "
Chertoff , whose department has staged a number of recent raids that have resulted in mass roundups of illegal workers and sharp protests from religious groups , warned there will be more if the workers do n't get a chance to become legal .
" We 're going to enforce the law , " he said .
" People all around the country will be seeing teary - eyed children whose parents are going to be deported . "
Both he and Gutierrez warned that major changes could kill the compromise bill .
Kevin Appleby of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops rejected what he called the " take it or leave it " argument .
" The groups who represent those who do n't have a voice in the debate want to get the best deal possible , " he said .
Gutierrez addressed another controversial aspect of the immigration bill , a program to expand the number of foreigners who can work temporarily in the USA .
The Senate on Wednesday voted to reduce the number of guest workers from 400,000 to 200,000 a year , a move Gutierrez called " a bit concerning . "
The USA needs more foreign workers as baby boomers retire , the Commerce secretary said .
His department 's figures show the population ages 25 - 54 growing at 0.2 % a year while the workforce is growing at 1.2 % a year .
" The reality is , we do n't have enough people , " said Gutierrez , adding that many of the USA 's economic competitors , such as France , Germany , Japan and China , will be facing a similar demographic shift .
" The big challenge of the 21st century is : Who gets the people ?
Who gets the immigrants ? " he said .
" We do n't appreciate today that these people are coming in for free . "
The lab is climate - controlled to 104 degrees Fahrenheit and 66 percent humidity .
Sitting inside the cramped room , even for a few minutes , is an unpleasantly moist experience .
I ’ve spent the last 40 minutes on a treadmill angled at a 9 percent grade .
My face is chili-red , my shirt soaked with sweat .
My breath is coming in short , unsatisfactory gasps .
The sushi and sake I had last night are in full revolt .
The tiny speakers on the shelf blasting “ Living on a Prayer ” are definitely not helping .
Then Dennis Grahn , a lumpy Stanford University biologist and former minor - league hockey player , walks into the room .
He nods in my direction and smiles at a technician .
“ Looks like he ’s ready , ” Grahn says .
Grahn takes my hand and slips it into a clear , coffeepot - looking contraption he calls the Glove .
Inside is a hemisphere of metal , cool to the touch .
He tightens a seal around my wrist ; a vacuum begins pulling blood to the surface of my hand , and the cold metal chills my blood before it travels through my veins back to my core .
After five minutes , I feel rejuvenated .
Never mind the hangover .
Never mind Bon Jovi .
I keep going for another half hour .
The test is n’t about my endurance ; it ’s about the future of the American armed forces .
Grahn and his colleagues developed the Glove for the military — specifically , for the Pentagon ’s way - out science division , Darpa : the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
For nearly 50 years , Darpa has engineered technological breakthroughs from the Internet to stealth jets .
But in the early 1990s , as military strategists started worrying about how to defend against germ weapons , the agency began to get interested in biology .
“ The future was a scary place , the more we looked at it , ” says Michael Goldblatt , former head of Darpa ’s Defense Sciences Office .
“ We wanted to learn the capabilities of nature before others taught them to us . ”
The Advanced Research Projects Agency was founded in 1958 ( the D was added in 1972 ) as a place to noodle around on ideas too big , or too far out , for the Cold War military - industrial complex .
The results can sometimes be spectacular failures ( nuclear hand grenade , anyone ? ) .
But Darpa has also pushed the development of some things that have become part of the fabric of military and civilian life : wearable computers , long - range drone aircraft , night vision , even the M16 rifle and the computer mouse .
But the agency had mostly avoided the life sciences .
Darpa ’s directors in 1980s and 1990s were n’t interested — and were happy to avoid the tangled ethical issues that often go along with research on human beings .
Then , in June 2001 , Tony Tether , an electrical engineer and Darpa veteran , left his job at the Sequoia Group , a venture capital firm , and returned to head the agency .
Under his guidance , Darpa ’s embryonic biology efforts began to multiply and expand .
Research on biodefense led to research on the immune system , which led to more general research on the human body .
“ There was a sense before that Darpa would n’t get into human R&D .
That was somewhere Frank Fernandez did n’t want to go , ” one former program manager says , referring to Darpa ’s director from 1998 to 2001 .
But Tether “ had a more open attitude .
He was more permissive about dealing with humans . ”
The agency had already enlisted an unusual team of bioscience experts .
One program manager had been a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory working on biomimetics ; soon he was funding research on artificial limbs .
Another early member of the team , Joe Bielitzki , studied the effects of space travel on animals while he was NASA ’s chief veterinary officer .
To head the push , Darpa had turned to Michael Goldblatt , VP of science and technology at McDonald’s .
He ’d helped develop a self - sterilizing package and pitched Darpa on the material ’s potential as a bandage , figuring that what was good for a Big Mac might be good for bullet wounds .
The agency offered him a job ... which he turned down .
But two years later Darpa supersized the offer — Goldblatt was hired to head the Defense Sciences Office , a division with a major focus on human enhancement .
Grahn and his research partner , biologist Craig Heller , started working on the Glove at Stanford in the late 1990s as part of their research on improving physical performance .
Even they were astounded at how well it seemed to work .
Vinh Cao , their squat , barrel - chested lab technician , used to do almost 100 pull - ups every time he worked out .
Then one day he cooled himself off between sets with an early prototype .
The next round of pull - ups — his 11th — was as strong as his first .
Within six weeks , Cao was doing 180 pull - ups a session .
Six weeks after that , he went from 180 to more than 600 .
Soon , Stanford ’s football trainers asked to borrow a few Gloves to cool down players in the weight room and to fight muscle cramps .
In 2001 , Heller went to Darpa .
The agency saw the potential of the Glove for training recruits ; the Stanford researchers received their first funding in 2003 and got $ 3 million .
In trying to figure out why the Glove worked so well , its inventors ended up challenging conventional scientific wisdom on fatigue .
Muscles do n’t wear out because they use up stored sugars , the researchers said .
Instead , muscles tire because they get too hot , and sweating is just a backup cooling system for the lattices of blood vessels in the hands and feet .
The Glove , in other words , overclocks the heat exchange system .
“ It ’s like giving a Honda the radiator of a Mack truck , ” Heller says .
After four months of using it himself , Heller did 1,000 push - ups on his 60th birthday in April 2003 .
Soon after , troops from Special Operations Command were trying out the Glove , too .
Darpa ’s human - enhancement programs were looking promising .
In February 2002 , Darpa asked Congress for a new , $ 78 million - per - year push for research including “ the development of biochemical materials for enhancement of performance . ”
That was on top of $ 90 million to explore how “ biological systems … adapt to wide extremes . ”
The human being , a Darpa fact file proclaimed in April 2002 , “ is becoming the weakest link in Defense systems . ”
Strengthening that chain meant “ sustaining and augmenting human performance , ” as well as “ enabling new human capabilities . ”
Darpa was going to figure out how to build a better soldier .
Mark Roth never expected his research to have military applications .
He was a biochemist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , studying how chromosomes move during cell replication .
Then , about a decade ago , his second daughter , Hannah Grace , died of heart failure at the age of 1 .
Her death sent him down a much stranger path .
“ I became interested in immortality , ” he says .
Roth knew that some animals hibernate — slowing their metabolisms until environmental conditions improve .
He also knew that some cells can enter a kind of dormancy and then spring back to life — essentially , they go into suspended animation .
Roth wanted to better understand this “ metabolic flexibility . ”
He started testing various chemicals that slowed metabolism , like heavy water and tetrodotoxin ( puffer fish poison , used in Haiti to turn people into zombies ) .
Nothing worked .
But then Roth found a loophole in one of nature ’s seemingly absolute rules : Animals need oxygen .
But some creatures , like nematodes , fruit flies , and zebra fish , do n’t die if oxygen levels drop .
Instead the critters suspend .
Their hearts stop beating for up to 24 hours .
They do n’t breathe .
And they do n’t die .
Wounds stop bleeding ; nearly any injury becomes survivable , and the brain shuts down without damage .
“ If you were shot , this is exactly what you would want , ” Roth says .
It ’s a timing issue :
At oxygen concentrations below some critical level , animals kick off .
But take the oxygen level even lower than that , fast , and they do n’t .
The problem was , Roth could n’t figure out how to pull off his oxygen reduction trick in mammals , let alone humans .
What would a battlefield medic do ?
Tie a plastic bag over a wounded soldier ’s head ?
A television show gave Roth the clue he needed .
In October 2002 , he was watching a PBS show about caving in Mexico .
The host had to don a breathing mask because the cavern ’s air was full of hydrogen sulfide , which binds to mitochondria and impedes the body ’s ability to use oxygen .
“ Oh my gosh , ” Roth thought .
“ We can de-animate people . ”
Three weeks later , Roth was at a meeting at the Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado , organized by DSO ’s Bielitzki , the ex-NASA veterinarian .
The agency was looking for ways to extend the “ golden hour , ” the period of time within which massive - trauma victims need to get medical care .
Bielitzki thought Roth had the best shot , and was prepared to fund further research .
But before the program could start , DSO ’s performance - enhancement push ran into trouble in Washington .
The President ’s Council on Bioethics was publishing reports decrying body hacks .
Some in Congress worried about being accused of funding a Frankenstein army .
In response to those critics , the agency already predisposed to clandestine research — decided to go underground .
Program names were changed to dull their mad- scientist edge .
Metabolic Dominance became Peak Soldier Performance .
Augmented Cognition became Improving Warfighter Information Intake Under Stress .
Researchers were told to keep their mouths shut ; many current and former program managers still wo n’t talk on the record , requesting anonymity for this story .
The Surviving Blood Loss program , meant to fund Roth ’s work , was itself put into suspended animation .
At Darpa headquarters — a blandly menacing office tower of brown stone and curved black glass in suburban Virginia — the pall of that near - death experience still hangs over the program .
Or maybe it ’s just the pictures of Dick Cheney that stare down from the walls of director Tony Tether ’s fluorescent - lit office .
DSO is n’t trying to create posthuman troops , Tether says .
“ You know the old Army saying , ‘ Be all that you can be ’ ?
Well , that ’s really what we ’re doing . ”
In training , soldiers “ become extraordinary in strength and endurance .
But it ’s not any better than their body can be .
And what we try to do is come up with techniques that allow them to maintain that level . ”
Tether is also careful not to take too much credit for Darpa ’s forays into biology .
“ Darpa started these kinds of programs in the ’ 90s , ” he says .
“ The fact that we had small units meant that the medical ability was n’t going to be there .
So we went in and started developing things that would allow soldiers to take care of themselves .
As time went on we found more things we could do . ”
Most of Darpa ’s performance - enhancement projects will take years , even decades , to show up on battlefields , Tether notes .
Many are still in petri dishes or lab rats .
That pace is just fine with Tether .
Darpa , he says , needs to be extra cautious .
During the mid–20th century , the US government did some pretty ugly things to people in the name of science : exposing soldiers to A - bomb blasts , psychologically abusing Harvard students ( including a young Ted “ Unabomber ” Kaczynski ) , letting hundreds of black men die of syphilis in Alabama .
Today , things are different .
Organizations that conduct research on people use Institutional Review Boards to evaluate every proposal .
Anyone who wants to study human beings with Darpa money has to further apply to a second , federal IRB .
“ When you ’re dealing with things that eventually have to be tested on living things — animals and eventually humans — yeah , you ’re much more cautious , ” Tether says .
“ We spend a lot of money on creating IRBs . ” Guys like Grahn and Heller hate the extra paperwork .
“ It ’s an incredible pain in the ass , ” Grahn moans .
“ It ’s like , ‘ Heart monitors may cause chafing .
In such event , will discontinue use . ’”
Tether ’s reply : “ You ca n’t just take the gun out in the back and shoot it , you know ?
It does slow things up , but it ’s a good check . ”
Even as the research environment grew more restrictive , Mark Roth kept working .
In his first tests , he lowered the oxygen content in his mouse enclosures to just 5 percent — and watched his lab mice drop dead in 15 minutes .
He gave the second group a whiff of hydrogen sulfide first .
They survived in the 5 percent oxygen environment for six hours — unconscious but alive .
Roth was ecstatic .
He even brought his kids to see the mice in stasis and took pictures of the rodents while they were out .
“ I ’d never done that in 30 years of research , ” he says .
“ But this is one of those once - in - a - lifetime chances to change the playing field . ”
In March 2005 , the money from Darpa finally came through .
The agency was looking for techniques that would keep animals alive for three hours with 60 percent of their blood gone — a lethal wound .
Roth tried his hydrogen sulfide approach :
He knocked rats out with a blast of the gas and drained 60 percent of their blood .
They lived for 10 hours or more .
Now Roth is considering going to the IRBs for permission to suspend human beings .
Bioethical safeguards have n’t stopped dozens of other DSO - funded projects around the world : energy cocktails that shave seconds off the race times of world - class cyclists , magnetic waves beamed at people ’s heads to detect alertness , EEGs to detect when satellite imagery analysts spot a target — even before the analysts realize it themselves , meaning they can work much faster .
In peacetime , this work might not have much urgency .
But the US military is chest - deep in a pair of nasty counterinsurgencies .
Fighting this kind of war requires huge numbers of troops , none more important than the so - called “ strategic corporal ” — the average infantryman on patrol .
The Bush administration wants to increase the overall size of combat forces by 92,000 people over the next five years .
The problem is , the military is already struggling to meet current recruiting goals .
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , Congress authorized a temporary , 30,000 - troop increase in the Army ; the service still has 7,000 slots left to fill .
Up to 12 percent of the military ’s recruits can now come from the lowest admissible pool of applicants , “ Category IV . ” ( In the 1980s and 1990s , it was 2 percent . )
The maximum age for new privates has been raised from 35 to 42 .
Last year , 8,000 recruits got waivers for past drug use and criminal histories .
Drill sergeants have been told to back off the trainees — and even allow them to do push - ups on their knees .
Those same grunts will need to pull 24 - hour patrols in Iraq ’s Venutian heat .
Intel officers must cope with a cascade of data from sensors , drones , and informants .
Rangers go on weeklong chases in the bitterly cold Hindu Kush .
Everyone , in other words , has to perform at their peak .
Which brings me back to Stanford .
Heller and Grahn are developing a new version of the Glove : one that fits less like a coffeepot and more like , well , a glove .
And it ’ll have some added functionality .
Those assemblies of radiator veins in our extremities do n’t just release heat — they can collect it , too , and use it to warm the rest of the body .
In a green and orange tent on a balcony outside their lab , I strip down to a bathing suit to test their theory .
Next to me is a gray tub filled with 150 gallons of water , into which Vinh Cao , the pull - up–happy lab technician , dumps 30 pounds of shaved ice .
It ’ll take just 10 minutes or so , he says , to get the water down to 60 degrees Fahrenheit .
I wait , shivering slightly in the wind .
Then , eyelids squeezed tight , I step into the water .
It stings , horribly .
I yip in pain .
My shoulder and neck muscles clench like fists and brace to fight the elements .
I exhale once , twice .
I lean on my forearms and lower myself in .
Deep , low - toned breaths rush out from the deepest part of my lungs .
Water splashes as my biceps and legs start to twitch .
“ Y’know , we can cut this short , ” Grahn says .
After seven minutes , my fingers have turned white , and the nails have settled into a dull purple .
I touch my hands to my face .
It ’s like being caressed by a corpse .
“ You ’ve shut off the blood flow to these vascular structures , ” Grahn explains .
“ Standard suite of responses . ”
That ’s moderately comforting .
So is the fact that I ’m now totally numb .
For the first time , I notice three little yellow duckies bobbing in my Arctic tub .
Over the next 45 minutes , Grahn talks — about the scars on his nose and cheek that he got playing center in the old Western Hockey League , about his days driving Sno - Cats at Mount Hood Meadows Ski Resort in Oregon , about the Glove ’s trials at the marines ’ mountain warfare training center .
But his stories get harder and harder to follow .
I ’ve started shivering again — all across my legs and chest , muscles pulse to a manic rhythm .
And then I start having tremors .
My thighs jackknife to my chest , unbidden .
I moan , and darkness closes in from the edges of my vision .
Then , just like on the treadmill , Grahn takes my wrist .
He slips each of my hands into a modified Glove prototype .
This time , the metal hemispheres inside are hot to the touch — 113 degrees .
After two minutes , I can think again .
The tent comes back into focus .
“ You can stay this way indefinitely now .
You ’re at a thermal equilibrium ; the heat going into these two hands is equivalent to what ’s going out of the rest of you , ” Grahn says .
“ Now you ’re uncomfortable again — merely uncomfortable .
That ’s a huge difference when you ’re talking about survival . ”
The water is still bitter , of course .
But now I can take it .

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales speaks during the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism conference in Miami , Florida , in this June 11 , 2007 , file photo , after a meeting with attorney generals from the U.S. , Mexico , Central America and Colombia .
Gonzales , under congressional pressure to quit over the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors , vowed on Monday to stay and fix problems with the Justice Department .
REUTERS / Carlos Barria ( UNITED STATES )
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , under congressional pressure to quit over the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors , vowed on Monday to stay and fix problems with the Justice Department .
In testimony prepared for a congressional hearing on Tuesday , Gonzales acknowledged the Justice Department has been shaken by accusations that partisan politics played a role in hiring practices and the administration of justice .
“ There are two options available in light of these allegations , ” Gonzales said .
“ I could walk away or I could devote my time , effort and energy to fix the problems . ”
“ Since I have never been one to quit , I decided that the best course of action was to remain here and fix the problems . ”
Gonzales , who with the support of President George W. Bush has withstood bipartisan calls to resign , was certain to be hammered with questions at Tuesday ’s hearing by Democrats and some fellow Republicans .
Many questions are expected to deal with his firing last year of nine of the nation ’s 93 U.S. attorneys .
Gonzales contends the dismissals were justified but mishandled .
Others are likely to challenge Bush ’s warrantless domestic spying program and inquire about an ongoing Justice Department probe into an admission by a former Gonzales aide that she considered the politics of career personnel when hiring them .
“ There are probably only two people on Earth who think the attorney general ought to stay : Alberto Gonzales and President Bush , ” Sen .
Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , said in response to Gonzales ’ prepared testimony .
“ As long as he ’s in charge , the Justice Department , the rule of law and America will suffer . ”
Bihar : Brahmins bar Dalit woman from cooking mid-day meal
Anand Mohan Sahay in Patna | August 11 , 2007 12:27 IST
In a shocking case which exposes the prevalence of untouchability in rural India , a Dalit woman was prevented from cooking mid-day meals for students at a government - run school in Bihar .
The incident took place at Pipri , a village traditionally dominated by Brahmins in Roktas district .
" I was warned , abused , assaulted and forcibly stopped from cooking mid-day meals by the upper caste Brahmins of my village , " Lalita Devi told rediff.com .
" They targeted me because I belong to an untouchable class , " she added .
No mid-day meal has been cooked in the school for the last two months , after the Brahmins announced a ban on serving food cooked by a Dailt woman .
" I was dragged out of the school kitchen and my husband was assaulted and threatened with dire consequences by the Brahmins .
I am waiting for justice , but the government is yet to take any steps about the issue , " said Devi .
Devi was appointed as a cook by the Mahila Samkhya Society , which is in charge of implementing the mid-day meal scheme under the Bihar Education Project at the village level .
A five - member committee , comprising four Dalit women , was constituted by the society to monitor the mid-day meal scheme in the Pipri school .
Of the 87 students in the school , 39 are Dalits .
" The Brahmins did n't like this decision .
They have been opposing it since the very beginning , " said Haria Manjhi , a Dalit villager .
Lalita Devi has filed a police complaint about the issue .
In her complaint , she has stated that the school committee 's secretary Uma Shankar Tiwari and his upper - caste henchmen have warned her not to cook mid-day meals for students .
" Tiwari and his men damaged the hearth and took away all the cooking utensils , " added Devi .
The exceptional Lie group E 8 is a marvelous 248 - dimensional monster , with mysterious connections to the octonions and string theory .
Here ’s a nice webpage about a new calculation involving E 8 \mathrm {
E}_8 :
As part of a project called the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations , a team of mathematicians led by Jeffrey Adams have computed the Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials for E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 .
You may have heard some hype about this , because it ’s a really big calculation , and the American Institute of Mathematics has coaxed a lot of science reporters to write about it — in part by comparing it to the human genome project .
To see what was really done , try these :
Computing the Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials for E 8 \mathrm {E}_8 is certainly nowhere nearly as important as the human genome project , nor as hard !
However , the final result involves more data , in a sense .
The answer is a 453,060 × 453,060 matrix of polynomials which takes 60 gigabytes to store .
For comparison , see my webpage on information .
The human genome is a mere 1 gigabyte – a pickup truck full of books .
A good recording of the complete works of Beethoven takes 20 gigabytes .
A library floor of academic journals holds 100 gigabytes .
So , the computation was indeed big .
But what ’s E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 , and what ’s a Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomial ?
You probably wo n’t hear the popular media tackle those questions .
Let me give it a try .
The quickest way to describe E 8 \mathrm {E}_8 may be this .
Take equal - sized balls in 8 dimensions and find the densest possible lattice packing .
If you center one ball at the origin , the centers of the balls form a lattice L ⊂ ℝ 8 , L \subset \mathbb {R}^8 , that is , a discrete set closed under addition and subtraction .
Then , form the quotient ℝ 8 / L \mathbb {R} ^8/L which is an 8 - dimensional torus .
There ’s a way to measure distances on this torus , coming from the usual way to do this in ℝ 8 \ mathbb { R}^8 .
We ’ve just wrapped up 8 - dimensional Euclidean space into a torus !
Next , it ’s a fact that every compact Lie group has a ‘ maximal ’ torus — a subgroup shaped like a torus that ’s as big as possible while having this property .
In fact there are lots of maximal tori , but they ’re all alike , so people usually speak of ‘ the’ maximal torus .
You can measure distances on the maximal torus , since there ’s a unique distance function on the Lie group that ’s invariant under all the symmetries the group has .
( Unique up to an overall scale factor , anyway — let ’s not worry about that . )
The cool part is this : if someone hands you the maximal torus of a compact Lie group , together with how to measure distances on this torus , you can recover the Lie group !
At least , you can if you ’ve taken a course on this stuff .
So , the 8 - dimensional torus I just described comes from a unique compact Lie group , and this group is E 8 \mathrm {
E}_8 !
I said this might be the quickest way to describe E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 .
But , to actually use this description to get your hands on E 8 \mathrm {
E}_8 is not so easy !
The trick for getting compact Lie groups from the distance function on their maximal torus is something kids learn in grad school .
The really hard part is to find the densest lattice packing of balls in 8 dimensions .
Luckily , you can just look it up .
This lattice consists of all vectors ( x 1 , … , x 8 ) ( x_1 , \dots , x_8 ) such that
the numbers x i x_i are either all integers or all half - integers ( a ‘ half - integer ’ being an integer plus 1/2 )
the sum x 1 + ⋯ + x 8 x_1 + \cdots + x_8 is even .
and
Here ’s a picture of the densest lattice packing of balls in 8 dimensions :
Drawn by John Stembridge , this shows the centers of all 240 balls that touch a given one , with the center of each ball connected by a line to the centers of its nearest neighbors .
Of course , the picture has been projected from 8 dimensions down to a mere 2 .
Not very easy to visualize !
If you ’re really interested in this stuff , you may prefer the more precise description using coordinates given here :
John Baez , review of On Quaternions and Octonions , by John Conway and Derek Smith .
Now , what about Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials ?
I do n’t really understand them , but let me give it a try .
Actually , I ’ll just discuss the Kazhdan–Lustzig polynomials for an easier bunch of groups , namely the groups A n \mathrm {A}_n , also known as PSL ( n + 1 ) PSL ( n+1 ) .
This will already be enough to make most of you run away screaming .
But you should n’t : these groups describe the symmetries of n n - dimensional projective geometry .
For n = 2 n = 2 , this is the geometry that governs the use of perspective in paintings !
In n n - dimensional projective geometry we have points , lines , planes , and so on up to the n n th dimension , and all we can talk about is whether a point lies on a line , or a point lies on a plane , or a line lies on a plane , etcetera .
There are some axioms , a bit like the axioms of Euclidean geometry , but simpler , because the concepts of distance and angle are not present !
After all , if you draw a painting of a scene from different perspectives , distances and angles on your painting will change — but the fact that two lines intersect at a given point will not .
As I explained back in week186 , a flag in n n - dimensional projective geometry is a point , lying on a line , lying on a plane , lying on a… and so on , up to the n n th dimension .
The set of all such flags is called the flag variety of A n \mathrm {A}_n .
If you pick one flag and call it your favorite , you can classify other flags by how they ’re related to your favorite flag .
For example , maybe the point of the other flag lies on the line of your favorite flag .
Or maybe the plane of the other flag contains the point of your favorite flag .
Or maybe both these things are true .
There are lots of possibilities .
In fact , there turn out to be exactly ( n + 1 ) ! ( n+1 ) ! possibilities .
I wo n’t explain why , but there are lots of beautiful proofs of this beautiful fact .
So , if we classify flags according to this scheme , the flag variety gets partitioned into ( n + 1 ) ! ( n+1 ) ! subsets .
These are called Schubert cells .
The closure of a Schubert cell is called a Schubert variety .
We can define projective geometry , and thus the flag variety and Schubert varieties , over any field .
Let use the finite field with q q elements .
Then , if we fix two Schubert varieties , we can count the number of points in the intersection of their closures .
This number will be some polynomial in q q .
This is called an R R –polynomial .
Since it depends on a choice of two Schubert cells , there are ( n + 1 ) ! × ( n + 1 ) ! ( n+1 ) !
\times ( n+1 ) ! of these , naturally arranged in a square matrix .
The Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials can be defined as certain linear combinations of R R - polynomials .
They do n’t count the points in the intersection of two Schubert varieties … they do something related , but subtler : they convey information about their intersection cohomology .
Also , by the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjecture , subsequently proved by Brylinski , Kashiwara , Beilinson and Bernstein , they encode facts about the representation theory of the complex form of A n \mathrm {
A}_n .
A bit more precisely , they say stuff about how many times any given Verma module contains any given irreducible representation as a subquotient .
This is a quite deep subject — for some reason that ’s what I always say when something is over my head .
The so - called Weil conjectures ( now theorems ) play a role here , since they relate the number of points in a smooth variety over a finite field to the cohomology of the corresponding smooth variety over the complex numbers .
But Schubert varieties fail to be smooth , so we need a tricky form of cohomology — intersection cohomology — and a generalization of the Weil conjectures .

Whew !
A lot of work , and we ’re still fairly far from the actual calculation that was just done !
First , we need to go from A n \mathrm {A}_n to E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 .
Everything I ’ve discussed for A n \mathrm {A}_n generalizes to other simple Lie groups ; E 8 \mathrm {E}_8 just happens to be the trickiest example of these .
Just as A n \mathrm {A}_n is the symmetry group of n n - dimensional projective geometry , E 8 \mathrm {E}_8 is the symmetry group of a kind of geometry first studied in depth by Hans Freudenthal .
Instead of points , lines , planes and so on , this geometry has 8 kinds of figures following certain rules of their own !
We could define a ‘ flag ’ in this context to consist of one of each of the 8 kinds of figures , all incident to each other .
We can then use this to define a flag variety , and Schubert varieties , and R R - polynomials and Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials for E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 .
Second , the Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials are more subtle than the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials .
They are defined not in terms of intersection cohomology , but directly in terms of representation theory .
I mentioned that Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials give information about Verma modules .
Verma modules are among the easiest to understand of the infinite - dimensional representations of Lie groups .
But there are lots of other infinite - dimensional representations , and the Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials give similar information about these .
The ones that were just computed give information about the infinite - dimensional unitary representations of the ‘ split real form ’ of E 8 \ mathrm {E}_8 .
They say how many times any given ‘ standard ’ representation contains any irreducible representation as a subquotient .
Okay .
I ’ll quit here before I lapse into jargon that I do n’t really understand .
At best I ’ve given you a rough flavor of the ideas leading to what was actually done .
Maybe now you ’re ready to look at this :

Why can't you buy a kidney to save your life ?
A growing legal movement to recognize a new fundamental right -- ' medical self - defense ' -- could bring jarring social changes
( Illustration / Mike Swartz ) GIVEN THE MAKEUP of the Supreme Court , this is supposed to be a time when conservative judges are reining in some of the " rights " established by liberals over the past four decades .
Yet there is a growing push in medical , legislative , and legal circles -- both liberal and conservative -- to recognize an expansive new right that some are describing as " medical self - defense . "
The movement is rooted in a desire to help patients who have run out of options .
Some medical experts , including Dr. Emil Freireich , director of a leukemia research program at the University of Texas , have called on the Food and Drug Administration to let terminally ill patients try unapproved drugs that might offer their last chance at survival .
And Republican Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas is working to introduce legislation that would force the FDA to do just that .
Even more significant is a potential landmark case before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals -- brought by a group called the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs -- that could make access to unapproved drugs a full - blown constitutional right .
Last year , a panel of three judges on the appellate court declared that patients with terminal diseases ought to have access to unapproved drugs , surprising many legal scholars .
The case is now being considered by all 10 members of the court , and a decision is expected this year .
The decision could have sweeping implications .
A right to medical self - defense , some legal scholars argue , implies that there is a right to offer cash for human organs , if one is dying or suffering -- a practice currently banned .
Such a right could even force the courts to overturn any federal ban on stem - cell research because , these scholars argue , the government 's interest in protecting a 10 - cell embryo could not trump the right of a Parkinson 's patient to save himself .
If you can shoot a man who breaks into your house at 1 a.m. , they ask , why can't you try an unproven drug or purchase an organ ?
" There is a longstanding tradition of self - defense " in American law , says Eugene Volokh , a UCLA law professor and well - known blogger .
" This tradition ought to logically entail defending yourself when doing so does not involve killing people . "
We 're a ways off from such far - reaching implications , but interest in the notion of medical self - defense has been building in legal circles for some time .
The concept received an especially clever and much - discussed defense by Volokh in the May issue of the Harvard Law Review .
But even before that , John A. Robertson , a law professor at the University of Texas , and Yvonne Cripps , a bioethics specialist at the Indiana University School of Law , published articles linking the right to unapproved drugs -- and the fruits of stem - cell research -- to legal precedents involving self - defense and personal autonomy .
Robertson also raised the question of whether there is a self - defense - derived right to medical marijuana .
In their decision last year , the circuit court judges , by a two - to - one margin , relied on the notion that Americans cannot be deprived of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . "
They said the right to receive medical care is related to the right of patients to refuse it .
But in his Harvard Law Review article , Volokh plays up two different arguments .
For conservatives , Volokh stresses the you - can - protect - yourself - in - your - home right , one so robust in Anglo - Saxon law that the Supreme Court has hardly bothered to affirm it .
There is ample precedent for the idea that radical steps can be taken when one 's life is at stake .
In an appeal to liberals , Volokh stresses an analogy rooted in the court 's abortion decisions .
Even then - justice William Rehnquist , a dissenter in Roe , conceded that late - term abortions were permissible if the mother was defending her life :
Protecting the life of a fetus is not a strong enough state interest to overrule the right to save one 's life .
But if that is the case , Volokh asks , how could protecting the health of a patient who is terminally ill be an interest strong enough to outweigh the person 's right to try a highly experimental pharmaceutical ?
And why should n't the person be allowed to offer to pay for a kidney , for example , if someone is willing to sell one ?
The inspiration for much of the new legal scholarship , including Volokh's , has been the suit by the Abigail Alliance , which eventually led to the court decision last year .
Abigail Burroughs , who grew up in Arlington and Falls Church , Virginia , was an honors student at the University of Virginia who died of cancer in 2001 , at age 21 .
She had sought access to a drug called Erbitux and never got it .
Four years ago , the Abigail Alliance sued the FDA .
Today , says Frank Burroughs , Abigail 's father and the president of the Abigail Alliance , " There are tens of thousands of people in the same boat . "
A lower court dismissed the case .
But last spring the three - judge appellate panel endorsed the group 's claims .
That one of the judges in the majority was conservative , and one a liberal , " was really quite energizing to me , " says Volokh , a self - described libertarian .
He saw the chance to build a left - right coalition behind the right to medical self - defense .
Debate now rages over where to draw the line on this brand of self - defense .
Some would keep it just where it is .
Ezekiel J. Emanuel , an oncologist and chair of clinical bioethics at the NIH's Warren G. Magnusen Clinical Center , wrote in The New Republic last July that the D.C. Circuit Court 's initial decision would send us " back to the snake - oil days . "
And a right to experimental drugs could undermine the whole drug- evaluation system :
Why join a clinical trial if you could bypass it ?
Burroughs says regulations could easily be drafted to require patients to apply to clinical trials first , before seeking to purchase the drug .
And he stresses that every one of the drugs to which his group has pushed for early access was ultimately approved .
( The suit seeks access to not just any drug , but only those that have passed preliminary tests for safety . )
More scholars draw the line when it comes to organ sales .
Nancy Scheper - Hughes , a Berkeley anthropologist -- now in residence at Harvard 's Radcliffe Institute -- has documented how wealthy organ brokers exploit the impoverished in places like Moldova and South Africa .
She cites a moral parable to which Volokh himself refers in passing , turning it against him :
A starving man adrift with others on a raft does not have the right to eat his fellow passengers .
Scheper - Hughes suggests there is something of the same " predatory " aspect to organ sales -- a creepy assertion " that I have the right to the body of another person , to live . "
Volokh himself is n't troubled by poor people selling their organs , saying that they already work jobs at least as dangerous as selling an organ , like manning fishing boats .
But he says that a law forbidding the extremely poor from taking part in the organ trade could be viewed as a reasonable regulation consistent with organ sales in general being a constitutional right .
The generally conservative Volokh has also taken hits from the right .
Robert F. Nagel , a professor of law at the University of Colorado , decries Volokh 's argument as all too typical of a tendency among legal conservatives to become " simply a reflection of the left . "
No conservative should be building fresh rights on the foundation of Roe , Nagel says .
Judicial overreach is judicial overreach , even if it serves libertarian ends .
Volokh has become not just a commentator but a player .
After reading his Harvard Law Review article in draft form , the Washington Legal Foundation ( WLF ) , which represents the Abigail Alliance , edited its briefs to reflect aspects of his arguments .
But his article 's more provocative sections may also pose a problem for the medical self - defense movement .
The WLF , for example , explicitly disavowed the section about organ transplants , evidently for fear of alarming conservative judges .
" Clearly , " says Richard Samp , chief counsel of the foundation , " that goes a lot farther than the argument we make . "

Newman 's career as an actor has spanned more than five decades
Newman , a nine - time Oscar nominee who has starred in more than 50 films , claimed he was no longer able to perform to the best of his ability .
" I 'm not able to work anymore ... at the level that I would want to , " the actor said in an interview on US television .
Newman 's films include The Sting , Cool Hand Luke and The Color of Money , which earned him a best actor Oscar in 1987 .
Newman announced his decision in an interview with US broadcaster ABC .
" You start to lose your memory , you start to lose your confidence , you start to lose your invention , " he told ABC's Good Morning America .
" So I think that 's pretty much a closed book for me . "
Charity work
Newman 's career on stage and screen has spanned more than five decades .
One of his biggest hits was the 1969 Western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , in which he starred with Robert Redford .
The pair joined forces again in 1973 playing con men in The Sting .
Recent projects have included 2002's Road to Perdition , earning Newman another Oscar nomination , and the TV mini-series Empire Falls , for which he won an Emmy .
In recent years , the Ohio - born star has also set up a successful food business .
Profits from his food production company are donated to charity , while the actor has helped establish a number of camps for critically ill children .
He has been married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States issued a fresh travel warning for Israel and the Palestinian territories on Friday to include American journalists and aid workers after a spate of violence and political instability .
In a notice that superseded a warning issued on January 17 , the State Department urged U.S. citizens to be mindful of security when considering travel to Israel , to defer trips to the West Bank and avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip .
“ American citizens in the Gaza Strip should depart immediately , a recommendation that the State Department has maintained and renewed since the deadly roadside bombing of a U.S. Embassy convoy in Gaza on October 15 , 2003 , ” it said .
“ This recommendation applies to all Americans , including journalists and aid workers . ”
The statement noted “ considerable violence ” in the Gaza Strip in recent months between Palestinian factions and between Israeli security forces and Palestinian militants .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejigged his government on Friday at the end of a state of emergency declared a month ago when the Islamist movement Hamas seized control of Gaza .
Hamas , which has militant and political wings , won an election victory 18 months ago that led to an international embargo of the Palestinian Authority .
The United States , a key ally to Israel , lists Hamas as a terrorist organization .
The travel warning said militant groups in Gaza continue to launch rockets against nearby Israeli towns and urged U.S. citizens to “ exercise a high degree of caution ” when going to restaurants , malls , places of worship and other public places .
“ Israeli authorities are concerned about the continuing threat of suicide bombings , ” it said .
“ The U.S. government has received information indicating that American interests could be the focus of terrorist attacks . ”
The Quartet of international mediators -- the United States , European Union , United Nations and Russia -- is due to meet in Portugal on July 19 to discuss the prospects for Israeli - Palestinian peace .
The conference will be attended by Tony Blair , who stepped down as Britain ’s prime minister in late June and was quickly named as the Quartet ’s new envoy .
PostgreSQL is a fully - featured , robust open - source database with strong SQL standards compliancy .
As with all RDBMS products it has its odd little idiosyncracies , which while documented , are not obvious , counter - intuitive or just head - scratchingly odd .
This is work - in - progress ; gotchas which have been removed are shown greyed out .
Please send your favourite PostgreSQL gotchas and any comments , corrections and criticism to < barwick@gmail.com > .
Note : this document contains many examples as they would appear in the command line client psql .
For convenience , where statements are more than one line , the continuation prompt database -> has been omitted , to enable the statement to be copied directly from this page .
General SQL
SELECT column alias , ... Affects : PostgreSQL <= 7.3 PostgreSQL requires AS when specifying alias names for output columns .
Statements like the following will fail : test=# SELECT id my_id FROM test_table tt ; ERROR : syntax error at or near " my_id " at character 11 Use SELECT id AS my_id FROM test_table tt instead .
In the SQL92 standard , the optional keyword AS is just noise and can be omitted without affecting the meaning .
The PostgreSQL parser requires this keyword when renaming output columns because the type extensibility features lead to parsing ambiguities in this context .
AS is optional in FROM items , however .
-- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.3/sql-select.html
Most other databases ( tested : DB2 8.2 , Firebird 1.5.0 , MySQL in all current versions and Oracle 8.1.7 ) support the SQL - 92 standard .
( The author did not realise for a long time that AS was not mandatory in SQL , but nevertheless prefers to use it because it makes SELECT statements easier to read and potentially less ambiguous . )
Unquoted object names fold to lower case
All unquoted identifiers are assumed by PostgreSQL to be lower case by default .
This means SELECT MY_COLUMN FROM my_table and SELECT my_column FROM MY_Table both refer to my_column and my_table .
SELECT " MY_COLUMN " FROM my_table by contrast refers to a different column .
This can cause problems when converting mixed quoted and unquoted SQL from other databases with the opposite folding behaviour .
For example , in Oracle SELECT " MY_COLUMN " FROM MY_TABLE and SELECT MY_COLUMN FROM " MY_TABLE " are equivalent ; in PostgreSQL they are not .
Affects : PostgreSQL <= 7.3 Prior to version 7.4 PostgreSQL silently swapped month and day values in ISO - style date strings YYYY -MM - DD if the month value was greater than 12 , implicitly assuming the string to be YYYY - DD - MM : database= >
CREATE TABLE datetest ( somedate DATE ) ; CREATE TABLE database= >
INSERT INTO datetest VALUES ( ' 2002-16-12 ' ) ; INSERT 640005 1 database= > INSERT INTO datetest VALUES ( '2002-12-16 ' ) ; INSERT 640006 1 database= >
SELECT * FROM datetest ; somedate ------------ 2002-12-16 2002-12-16 ( 2 rows )
Beginning with version 7.4 PostgreSQL will refuse to insert the first value without an explicit datestyle setting : database= >
INSERT INTO datetest VALUES ( ' 2002-16-12 ' ) ; ERROR : date / time field value out of range : " 2002 -16 - 12 " HINT : Perhaps you need a different " datestyle " setting .
PostgreSQL can't multiply
256 * 256 * 256 * 256 ?!
Affects : All PostgreSQL versions PostgreSQL returns an out - of - range error when attempting this apparently simple multiplication : test= >
SELECT 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 ; ERROR : integer out of range
This is because PostgreSQL assumes non-qualified integers to be of type INT4 , i.e. 32 - bit integers .
To avoid this problem , cast at least one of the integers as INT8 : test= >
SELECT 256:: INT8 * 256 * 256 * 256 ; ? column ?
------------ 4294967296 ( 1 row )
Note that in PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.0 operations on an INT4 integer which produces a maximum result greater than 4294967296 are returned as 0 : test= >
SELECT 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 ; ? column ?
---------- 0 ( 1 row )
Implicit FROM item and unintended cross joins PostgreSQL allows the omission of a FROM - clause in certain contexts .
The most useful application of this is when computing the results of simple expressions ( such as in the gotcha above ) : test= >
SELECT 1+1 , ' Hello World ' ; ? column ? | ?column ?
----------+-------------
2 | Hello World ( 1 row )
Many other databases require a dummy one - row table for such operations , for example Oracle : SQL > SELECT 1+1 , ' Hello World ' FROM DUAL ; 1+1 ' HELLOWORLD
----------
-----------
2 Hello World
In the default setup PostgreSQL will also add an implicit FROM - clause if the table name(s ) are directly referenced in the SELECT : test= >
SELECT table1.id ; id ---- 1 2 3 ( 3 rows )
While this is a useful abbreviation , it can cause unexpected cross-joins : test= >
SELECT table1 . *
FROM table1 t1 ; NOTICE : adding missing FROM - clause entry for table " table1 " id ---- 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 ( 9 rows )
Here , the statement has been expanded by PostgreSQL to SELECT table1 . *
FROM table1 t1 , table1 , resulting in a cartesian join .
PostgreSQL does provide a warning notice , but this is easy to overlook .
To disable this behaviour , set the ADD_MISSING_FROM parameter to FALSE : test= >
SET add_missing_from TO FALSE ; SET test= > SELECT table1 . *
FROM table1 t1 ; ERROR : missing FROM - clause entry for table " table1 "
Note that this will not affect SELECT statements containing simple expressions , as in the first example .
The documentation contains further details .
Note : beginning with PostgreSQL 8.1 , ADD_MISSING_FROM
will be set to FALSE by default .
RANDOM ( ) failures Affects : PostgreSQL <= 8 .? A statement such as the following : SELECT id , is_true FROM ( SELECT id , RANDOM ( ) < 0.5 AS is_true FROM some_table ) AS t_tmp WHERE is_true ; should only return boolean TRUE values in the column is_true .
However is_true will contain ca. 50 % FALSE values .
The cause is PostgreSQL 's query planner flattening the statement into something along the lines of SELECT id , RANDOM ( ) < 0.5 FROM some_table AS t_tmp WHERE RANDOM ( ) < 0.5 ; resulting in two RANDOM ( ) calls producing different results .
A simple workaround is to add OFFSET 0 to the subquery , which prevents it being flattened into the upper query : SELECT id , is_true FROM ( SELECT id , RANDOM ( ) < 0.5 AS is_true FROM some_table OFFSET 0 ) AS t_tmp WHERE is_true ;
COUNT (*) very slow Operations using COUNT (*) tend to be slow , especially on large datasets , and also when compared to some other RDBMS systems .
Generally PostgreSQL will use a sequential rather than an index scan to compute the result .
The basic reason for this is that index entries do not contain transaction information , i.e. whether a particular index entry is visible to the current transaction and thus count towards the total returned .
This means that to obtain an accurate result meaning each index entry must be visited to determine its tuple 's visibility .
For a detailed discussion on the technical reasons for this problem and possible solutions , see the thread " Much Ado About COUNT ( * ) " .
Beginning with PostgreSQL 9.2 , index - only scans have become available which may speed up COUNT (*) queries under certain circumstances .
See the wiki for details .
MAX ( ) / MIN ( ) use sequential scans Affects : PostgreSQL <= 8.0 Another form of aggregate function with poor performance are MAX ( ) and MIN ( ) .
A statement like SELECT MAX ( col ) FROM my_table will generally be very slow , as PostgreSQL will invariably perform a sequential scan .
In contrast to the COUNT (*) above , workarounds are available : use SELECT col FROM table ORDER BY col DESC LIMIT 1 to replace MAX ( ) and SELECT col FROM table ORDER BY col ASC LIMIT 1 to replace MIN ( ) .
See also http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-aggregate.html.
Beginning with PostgreSQL 8.1 , indexes will automatically be used for MAX ( ) and MIN ( ) .
UNICODE means " UTF - 8 " The encoding " UNICODE " provided by PostgreSQL is actually the Unicode encoding UTF - 8 .
This will cause applications expecting for example a stream of 2 - byte UTF - 16 characters to function incorrectly .
Note that PostgreSQL accepts both UTF - 8 and UTF8 as synonyms for UNICODE , for example when creating a database .
See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/multibyte.html for information on PostgreSQL 's character set support .
to_date ( ) thinks February 31st is March 3rd Resolved in PostgreSQL 9.5 ( commit 5c4eb916 )
This one has escaped me for a long time , but I can proudly announce that PostgreSQL has its own little way of implementing MySQL compatibility [* ] , for those moments of madness when you want to coerce February 31st to March 3rd : postgres= # SELECT to_date ( '2014-02-31 ' , ' YYYY - MM - DD ' ) ; to_date ------------ 2014-03-03 ( 1 row )
This is on 9.4devel , not some ancient version from the days when renaming a column involved recreating the entire table .
The whole business of munging arbitrary text strings into valid date and time types is of course a highly tricky area ( and personally I 'd be more than happy if the entire world could unify on ' YYYY - MM - DD HH24 : MI : SS ' format - maybe with an optional identifier to specify the year counting system ) .
Word from on high is that it 's actually there for Oracle compatibilty but that 's certainly not the case in Oracle 12c : SQL > SELECT to_date ( '2014-02-31 ' , ' YYYY - MM-DD ' ) FROM DUAL ; SELECT to_date ( '2014-02-31 ' , ' YYYY - MM-DD ' ) FROM DUAL * ERROR at line 1 : ORA - 01839 : date not valid for month specified Nevertheless it 's still there as something " people are used to " .
So if you are parsing date input from dodgy sources do n't rely on to_date ( ) .
Casting the string literal to the appropriate type is a much more promising approach : postgres= # SELECT '2014/02/31 ':: DATE ; ERROR : date / time field value out of range : " 2014/02/31 " LINE 1 : SELECT '2014/02/31 ':: DATE ; ^ postgres= # SELECT '2014/02/28 ':: DATE ; date ------------ 2014-02-28 ( 1 row ) [*]
Actually a recent - ish 5.5 version silently converts ' 2014 -02-31 ' to ' 0000 - 00 - 00 ' , but let 's not go down that particular rabbit hole of insanity here .
The flower , stem and root of echinacea is used in products
They found it decreased the odds of developing a cold by 58 % and the duration of colds by a day - and - a - half .
The results in The Lancet Infectious Diseases conflict with other studies that show no beneficial effect .
Experts believe echinacea , a collection of nine related plant species indigenous to North America , may work by boosting the body 's immune system .
' Marked effects '
Researchers , led by Dr Craig Coleman from the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy , combined the results of 14 different studies on Echinacea 's anti-cold properties .
In one of the 14 studies the researchers reviewed , echinacea was taken alongside vitamin C . This combination reduced cold incidence by 86 % .
When echinacea was used alone it reduced cold incidence by 65 % .
Echinacea may reduce the duration of illness and decreases the severity of cough , headache , and nasal congestion
Professor Ron Cutler of the University of East London
Even when patients were directly inoculated with a rhinovirus - the most common cold - causing virus - echinacea reduced cold incidence by 35 % .
The researchers ' report said : " With over 200 viruses capable of causing the common cold , echinacea could have modest effect against rhinovirus but marked effects against other viruses . "
Popular product
They found that more than 800 products containing echinacea were available , and that differing parts of the plant - flower , stem and root - were used in different products .
They said more work was needed to check the safety of these different formulations .
Professor Ron Cutler , of the University of East London , said : " The true benefits , and more importantly , how the agents work remains unclear and further better - controlled actual clinical trials still have to be carried out .
THE COMMON COLD Rhinoviruses are responsible for about half of all common colds in children and adults School children usually catch between seven and 10 colds a year , and adults two to five Common colds and flu can be transmitted by hands and contact with commonly - touched surfaces
" Echinacea may reduce the duration of illness and decreases the severity of cough , headache , and nasal congestion . "
He said people with impaired immune function might benefit from taking echinacea during the winter months to prevent colds and flu , but that healthy people did not require long - term preventative use .
" There has also been the suggestion in the past that continuous treatment with echinacea is not recommended - the benefits may only be effective for one or two weeks and after taking the agent for this time people should stop and give the immune system a week without the agent . "
Professor Ronald Eccles , director of the Common Cold Centre at the University of Cardiff , said the work was " a significant step in our battle against the common cold " .
" Harnessing the power of our own immune system to fight common infections with herbal medicines such as echinacea is now given more validity with this interesting scientific evaluation of past clinical trials , " he added .
Jet intended to fight terror being used to ferry FBI director to speeches RAW STORY

Organizations such as the MPAA , RIAA and IFPI spend millions of dollars enforcing copyrights by getting people fined and even jailed for file - sharing .
So when a small developer sees his work pirated on the internet , what can he do about it with his tiny resources ?
Easy .
He emails the warez group , turns on the charm and asks them nicely to leave him alone in the future - and they agree !
Trey Harrison is a 29 year old , living in Los Angeles with his girlfriend and a couple of cats .
He enjoys writing music and creating music videos and has just invested the last 7 years to bring out a PC application called ‘ Salvation ‘ .
“ I imagined it as a tool for creating custom video and lighting controls at music venues ” says Trey .
“ My first customer Denne continues to please crowds with his mixes at club Rai in Moscow , and recently the Inside Us All VJ collective began using it to power some awesome multi-projector HD displays in the UK .
It ’s a rather powerful realtime graphics tool now , and one of my next goals is to make that power accessible within After Effects and Final Cut . ”
Then came the inevitable news – ‘ Salvation ’ had been cracked and made available on the internet by a release group known as BlueBeta3D who actually displayed their email address in the .NFO .
So Trey dropped them a line , to see if they could come to some sort of arrangement …..

Hi , you guys have recently released a pirated version of my software called
“ Salvation ” .
I ’m not very surprised – actually I ’m flattered – but I was
wondering if we could arrange a meeting to discuss the possibility of you
not doing this any more ?
Best ,
Trey Harrison

Trey explains , “ I was pretty sure I ’d never hear from them , so I sent off an email to the company I purchased my anti-piracy protection tool from , as well as an email to the hosting company that is hosting the warezed copy .
Who responded first ?
The pirates . ”

Hi Trey ,
We appreciate your comments and understand the role of developers ,
we only released it so many people who may not have access or
privileges could try this and learn .
Hopefully its given more
global coverage .
Apologies for any grievance it may have caused .
We
also noted your comments and will not release this again .
Good Luck
and best wishes for future developement .
Greets
___________________________________________
As Trey just achieved what the RIAA and MPAA can’t achieve with millions of dollars , we decided to ask him a few questions about this unique moment .
1. Considering the huge amount time and effort you put into this project , it ’s no surprise there were some strong emotions when you realized your work had been pirated .
You mentioned your emotions cycled through being pissed , to vengeful to honored .
Could you tell us a little about the background to those emotions ?
I felt proud and victimized at the same time .
Most of my time is spent implementing features and fixing bugs at the request of paying customers , so when a cracking group puts the program out there free for anyone to download , it has a real impact on the investment that my customers have made , that potential customers might make , and the time that I ’ve put into it .
But at the same time , getting that recognition by the warez groups as being crack - worthy is a milestone that I ’m proud to have reached .
2 . You mentioned that Salvation was protected by a 3rd party anti-piracy tool .
Which tool was it , what were your considerations when choosing it and do you feel that you ’ve received good value for money ?
I wanted to distribute Salvation online as shareware with a 30 day expiration .
I purchased “ Armadillo Software Passport ” hoping it would catch and stop the average person who tries to set their system clock back in time , but I knew it would probably be cracked by a warez group at some point .
There are more expensive anti-piracy tools out there but I think they are all equally useless against a determined cracker .
The Armadillo guys provided great tech support along the way , so up until the day it was pirated I was very satisfied with their product and service .
3 . You emailed the warez release group , anti-piracy company and hosting company to complain about your product being pirated .
When the warez group responded first and in a very polite and positive manner , what were your feelings ?
I was pleasantly surprised !
I always thought warez groups were elusive and impossible to get in touch with .
The fact that they responded was amazing , but the idea of them putting a halt on the release and promising not to do it anymore … it really blew my mind .
I think I may have stumbled across a revolutionary business strategy .
4. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on copy - protection and DRM mechanisms .
Have your anti-piracy company responded yet and if so , what did they say about Salvation now being available on the internet DRM - free , despite your investment ?
I sent the Armadillo guys an email that included the pirated .zip package .
I was hoping they would thank me , offer an apology , and study it to improve their protection scheme , but they did n’t even respond .
I ’m not sure what to expect from them at this point .
Maybe they ’ll have something to say after this interview is published . =)
5 . Without a big marketing budget , it can be very hard indeed to get your product noticed on the internet .
Even big artists such as Kylie Minogue appear to be using internet leaks to gain publicity .
Have you considered that the extra publicity your software will get due to it ’s availability on the internet ( and articles like this ) , might actually improve your exposure and sales figures ?
It ’s an unusual story so it will probably attract attention .
I just hope the attention is from paying customers rather than pirates .
TorrentFreaks pay for all of their software , right ? =)
6 . One school of thought suggests that far from being all bad , pirate software users can be useful , providing a valuable source of knowledge about software products on internet discussion forums , even going as far to offer a kind of free - of - charge product support for paying customers .
What are your general feelings about piracy and have your recent experiences changed the way you feel about it ?
I ’ll admit I ’ve copied an mp3 here and there without giving it much thought .
All the work that goes into creating a good song is easily taken for granted when your computer brings it to you in a matter of seconds .
When Salvation was pirated it really opened my eyes to the fact that piracy has a real impact on real people .
I used to think anti-piracy organizations like the RIAA and MPAA were pure evil but I ’ve realized now that we share the same basic interest in preventing piracy .
I just wish they would wake up and realize that suing grandmas and little girls is n’t going to increase sales .
Maybe they should bring me on as a consultant – I ’m cheaper than a team of lawyers and I have proven success in the field . =)
We contacted BlueBeta3D and they said “ Our release are aimed for purely for people who wish to learn and do not have the benefits / or just help to extend an evaluation . ”
They also made it quite clear that they are against any commercialization of piracy and maybe , just maybe , they ’re also men of their word in respect of leaving Trey alone in the future .
Who said you ca n’t negotiate with pirates ?

Is this how farms will look in the future ?
Downtown Manhattan is hardly a place you would associate with agriculture .
Rather , with its countless restaurants , cafes , shops and supermarkets this is a place of consumption .
And so every morsel , every bite of food New Yorkers munch through every day must be trucked , shipped or flown in , from across the country , and across the world .
Now though , scientists at Columbia University are proposing an alternative .
Their vision of the future is one in which the skyline of New York and other cities include a new kind of skyscaper : the " vertical farm " .
The idea is simple enough .
Imagine a 30 - storey building with glass walls , topped off with a huge solar panel .
On each floor there would be giant planting beds , indoor fields in effect .
There would be a sophisticated irrigation system .
Even if it 's not quite natural ... you 're going to get back the rest of the earth
Professor Dickson Despommier
That means there would be no shipping costs , and no pollution caused by moving produce around the country .
It 's all the brainchild of Columbia University Professor Dickson Despommier .
He and his students took existing greenhouse technology as a starting point and are now convinced that vertical farms are a practical suggestion .
Professor Despommier lists many advantages of this revolutionary kind of agriculture .
They include :
Year round crop production in a controlled environment
All produce would be organic as there would be no exposure to wild parasites and bugs
Elimination of environmentally damaging agricultural runoff
Food being produced locally to where it is consumed
And , says the professor , vertical farming would allow some existing traditional farms to be returned to natural forests .
Good news in a time of global warming .
" Even if it 's not quite natural .... a little bit factory - like in terms of its production , here 's what you 're going to get back : you 're going to get back the rest of the earth .
And I 'll take that any time . "
The plan is to make the whole complex sustainable .
Nurturing high rise crops in the " vertical farm "
Energy would come from a giant solar panel but there would also be incinerators which use the farm 's waste products for fuel .
All of the water in the entire complex would be recycled .
Several hours drive north of the city in upstate New York , Ed Miller 's 18,000 apple trees are in full bloom .
Like farmers across the world he has lived through decades of constant change and innovation .
But he remains , at heart , a man of the soil .
So what does he think of the virtual farm concept ?
He is , perhaps , surprisingly positive : '' It looks like a fancy greenhouse , " he says .
" It 's fabulous , it will be very interesting .
It will be phenomenal . "
For now , vertical farms are a virtual concept .
But the scientists insist that the theory is sound .
All they need now , they say , is the money to make this a reality .

The Wrights ’ daughter , Katie , the mother of Christian , says her parents have not given enough support to the people who believe , as she does , that the environment — specifically a synthetic mercury preservative in vaccines — is to blame .
No major scientific studies have linked pediatric vaccination and autism , but many parents and their advocates persist , and a federal “ vaccine court ” is now reviewing nearly 4,000 such claims .
The Wright feud has played out in cyberspace and spilled into Autism Speaks , where those who disagree with Katie Wright ’s views worry that she is setting its agenda .
And the family intent on healing a fractured community has instead opened its old wounds and is itself riven .
The rift began in April when Katie put herself squarely on the side of “ The Mercurys , ” as that faction is known , on Oprah Winfrey , where she described how her talkative toddler turned unresponsive and out - of - control after his vaccines and only improved with unconventional , and untested , remedies .
In a Web interview with David Kirby , author of the controversial book , “ Evidence of Harm : Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic , ” Ms. Wright lashed out at the “ old guard ” scientists and pioneering autism families .
If the old - timers are unable to let go of “ failed strategies , ” she said , they should “ step aside ” and let a new generation “ have a chance to do something different with this money ” that her parents ’ charity was dispensing .
Complaints poured in from those who said Ms. Wright ’s remarks were denigrating .
So , in early June , Bob and Suzanne Wright repudiated their daughter on the charity ’s Web site .
“ Katie Wright is not a spokesperson ” for the organization , the Wrights said in a brusque statement .
Her “ personal views differ from ours . ”
The Wrights also apologized to “ valued volunteers ” who had been disparaged .
Told by friends how cold the rebuke sounded , Mrs. Wright belatedly added a line saying , “ Katie is our daughter , and we love her very much . ”
THEY ARE TELLING YOU THAT THE WHOLE SHOW IS FAKE !
This show would have already come down if it was n't for the macroeconomic black ops .
Rather than allowing this thing to die , it is being kept in an undead state for as long as possible .
With the debt closing in on $ 9 trillion , we 're already living well within the realm of financial make believe .
Could the debt reach $ 46 trillion or more ?
There 's no purely economic reason why it could n't .
I do n't see any difference between $ 9 trillion and $ 100 trillion .
IT 'S ALL FAKE AT THIS POINT .
Hank Paulson , the market - wise Treasury Secretary who built a $ 700 m fortune at Goldman Sachs , is re-activating the ' plunge protection team ' ( PPT ) , a shadowy body with powers to support stock index , currency , and credit futures in a crash .
Otherwise known as the working group on financial markets , it was created by Ronald Reagan to prevent a repeat of the Wall Street meltdown in October 1987 .
...
Mr Paulson has asked the team to examine " systemic risk posed by hedge funds and derivatives , and the government 's ability to respond to a financial crisis " .
" We need to be vigilant and make sure we are thinking through all of the various risks and that we are being very careful here .
Do we have enough liquidity in the system ? " he said , fretting about the secrecy of the world 's 8,000 unregulated hedge funds with $ 1.3 trillion at their disposal .
The PPT was once the stuff of dark legends , its existence long denied .
But ex-White House strategist George Stephanopoulos admits openly that it was used to support the markets in the Russia / LTCM crisis under Bill Clinton , and almost certainly again after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
" They have an informal agreement among major banks to come in and start to buy stock if there appears to be a problem , " he said .
" In 1998 , there was the Long Term Capital crisis , a global currency crisis .
At the guidance of the Fed , all of the banks got together and propped up the currency markets .
And they have plans in place to consider that if the stock markets start to fall , " he said .
The only question is whether it uses taxpayer money to bail out investors directly , or merely co-ordinates action by Wall Street banks as in 1929 .
The level of moral hazard is subtly different .
Mr Paulson is not the only one preparing for trouble .
Days earlier , the SEC said it aims to slash margin requirements for institutions and hedge funds on stocks , options , and futures to as low as 15 pc , down from a range of 25 pc to 50 pc .
The ostensible reason is to lure back hedge funds from London , but it is odd policy to license extra leverage just as the Dow hits an all - time high and the VIX ' fear ' index nears an all - time low --- signalling a worrying level of risk appetite .
The normal practice across the world is to tighten margins to cool over - heated asset markets .
The move is so odd that conspiracy buffs are already accusing SEC chief Chris Cox of juicing the markets to help stop the implosion of the Bush presidency .

In 2004 the route of the Israeli Apartheid Wall was ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice .
Here the wall is seen in Qalqilya where it nearly completely surrounds the West Bank city , preventing many Palestinians from accessing their lands , 24 May 2007 .
( Khaleel Reash / MaanImages )
QALQILYA
IRIN
ICJ
In the Qalqilya district of the northern West Bank , many Palestinians were separated from their agricultural land and livelihood , because the barrier did not always follow the internationally recognized “ green line ” between Israel and the Palestinian area .
Others found themselves divided from the rest of the West Bank .
Overall , about 15 villages remain in the “ seam zone ” between the serpentine path of the barrier and the border .
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , 50,000 Palestinians will be located in that zone when the barrier is complete .
The ICJ observed that these pockets were created for the benefit of Israeli settlements , which it declared were also illegal under international humanitarian law .
The once successful industrial zone in the village of Mas ’ha is virtually a ghost town .
The barrier , here a mix of concrete slabs eight meters high , fencing and barbed wire , runs right up against the village .
Residents and aid workers say this village , like others in the region , has lost commerce , particularly from Israel , as well as agricultural profit .
“ The majority of the businesses here have shut down since the wall was built , ” said Moad Issa , a labourer working in a furniture shop , one of the few storefronts still open .
“ It ’s now much harder to find work , ” lamented Issa , who is registered with the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees ( UNRWA ) .
His small salary as an unskilled labourer feeds his three younger siblings and two ageing parents .
Israeli security officials say the barrier protects people inside Israel from militant attacks , but admit the route took settlements into consideration .
When complete , the barrier will surround Mas ’ha from three sides .
An enclave : ‘ Azzun ‘ Atma
On the other side of those settlements , to the west , lies ‘ Azzun ‘ Atma , a town with several thousand residents , which has been turned into an enclave by the barrier ’s path .
Access to the village is through a gate run by the military .
About eight families are divided from the rest of the village by an Israeli - controlled road .
“ The lack of guaranteed access to emergency health care through the barrier gate at night is the biggest problem .
Women are left most vulnerable , ” said Rosemary Willey - Asana ’ , from OCHA in Jerusalem , for example , choosing home births or leaving the village during the last stage of pregnancy to avoid the barrier .
Shlomo Dror , a spokesman for Israel ’s Defense Ministry , said the military worked to “ provide solutions to all humanitarian concerns , ” and there was no problem accessing health care .
The gates would be opened at any time if needed , he added .
Many “ seam zone ” Palestinians need permits to stay in their homes and villages .
Friends and family require different permits to visit .
Similarly , farmers must receive permits to access land , which is contingent upon a schedule determined by the Civil Administration .
Dror said there were more than 60 gates in the barrier , for access to agricultural lands .
He said the army was working to improve the gates and ensure farmers got the right permits .
However , a UNRWA official who studied the system , said : “ The gates were never designed to offer a comprehensive humanitarian solution . ”
He noted in certain areas residents ’ needs were not being met , and the gates “ in some cases are in totally arbitrary places . ”

Post written by Leo Babauta .
Recently I posted my new twist on the excellent GTD system , Zen To Done ( ZTD ) : The Ultimate Simple Productivity System .
This is the fifth in a series of posts exploring each of the 10 Habits .
Are you a fan of GTD ?
What ’s your trusted system ?
GTD , and my twist on it , ZTD , recommend that you keep your task in a series of lists based on different contexts .
And while many popular GTD tools ( Kinkless , stikkit , Outlook , Remember the Milk , etc. ) make things a bit complicated , the truth is that all you need are lists .
Many followers of GTD get caught up in fiddling with the tools , with creating complicated systems , changing tools and systems every week or two , instead of actually getting things done .
But ZTD asks you to use the simplest tools possible , and then forget about them .
ZTD is about the doing , not the tools .
ZTD Habit 5 : simple trusted system – keep simple lists , check daily .
GTD asks you to place your tasks ( “ next actions ” ) in a series of context lists , such as @work , @phone , @home , @errands , @waiting , etc .
Basically , you need to ask yourself “ What can I accomplish right now , based on where I am and what tools are in front of me ? ” and then focus only on those tasks .
GTD simplifies that process by breaking down your lists into separate contexts , so you only need to worry about the context you ’re in right now , and not about any other contexts .
There are also a couple of other lists in GTD : the someday / maybe list ( stuff you ca n’t do now but might do someday ) and the waiting - for list ( a great way to remember to follow up on stuff ) .
That ’s the easy part .
Now the question is : which tool to use to keep your lists .
Here are my recommendations — the simplest , most effective GTD tools :
Simple GTD :
This is my favorite , and the one I use right now .
I was using Tracks , which is also simple and very good , but I recently switched because I wanted something a little simpler .
Simple GTD has what you need , with a nice interface , but none of the frills .
Play around with it — the interface is extremely intuitive and does n’t require a manual .
It does n’t have a lot of features , but that ’s its appeal .

Moleskine : Another of my favorites .
Actually , any small notebook that fits in your pocket will do — the easy of use of a notebook ( you do n’t have to power it up or press any buttons ! ) is perfect for this daily GTD habit .
But the Moleskine has a special appeal — it is aesthetically pleasing , and wonderful to use .
I highly recommend it !

Hipster PDA : Popular among the low - fi GTD crowd , the Hipster PDA is as basic as it gets , and extremely portable as well .
Basically , it ’s a stack of index cards attached with a clip .
You can find templates for printing them online , or just simply write your lists on them .
The cool thing : you can toss the cards when they ’re full , and replenish your PDA at any time .

Tadalist :
Perhaps the simplest tool of them all , tadalist is simply a list program .
No frills , although the interface is nice ( it ’s from the same folks as Backpack and Basecamp ) .
Create as many lists as you need , print them if necessary , check only the context you need .
Simplicity at its best .

Todoist : Another simple , slick to - do list manager , this has a few extra features , but nothing complicated .
I do n’t use it simply because I do n’t like the outline interface , but that may appeal to some of you more .
It ’s worth a look , at least .
Once you ’ve selected a tool , set up your lists , and keep them simple !
The next part of this habit , and really the most important part ( more important than the tool you use ) , is checking your lists every day .
This needs to become a habit , and as a such , it will require special focus for about 30 days .
Once you make checking your lists a daily habit , your life will become much more organized and productive .

And they said , Go to , let us build us a city , and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
Zombie Spaniards invaded my webserver last week , so I moved all of my virtual belongings to a new , faster machine and had the plug pulled on the infected one .
As I gathered numerous websites into tar.gz files ( the equivalent of liquor - store boxes when you 're moving ) I felt a genuine melancholy — I was the last one to leave and I was turning out the lights .
I never saw the machine that hosted my sites , because it sat in an office park in Texas , but it was a very real place in my mind — a collection of directories sensibly arranged , some exposed to the world via the Web , others only accessible to someone with proper identification .
As to the server that was hacked , even though I 'd been working with it for three years , I was able to move lodgings and have everything up and running on a new box in about a day .
That 's because much of my data is in XML , with a little bit of it in RDF , and I use boring computer languages and standard , unexciting programs to make things run .
I 've learned in twelve years of building websites that you must be able at any time to pick up all of your files and move , whether to a new server , a new platform , or a new set of ideas .
There 's no use fighting it .
You 're programming along and someone comes along and shouts , Pack up , we 're leaving .
We 've got to get moved over to “ agile ” programming , or Web 2.0 , or Microsoft Vista , or Apple Mac OS X Leopard .
So you leave behind the picked - over land in the hope of richer soil .
I 've been a user of XML for a decade ( SGML before that ) , and for nearly as long I 've been following the development of RDF .
XML is a means of structuring text into a tree , and RDF is a way of drawing a map where each idea is its own city and there are many roads that link the cities together .
In XML you say : “ this is a book , and this is a chapter in the book , and this is a section of that chapter . ”
In RDF you say : “ this chapter is part of a book , and that book is written by a man named Dave who has written another book with a man named John who used to work for a company called Consolidated Undulating Prong before he left there and went to work for a company called Magical Thinking where he wrote a book with his coworker Dave . ”
Of course you can do everything you can do in XML in RDF and vice - versa , which means people fight endlessly about what each technology means .
But what I like about XML and RDF is that , first , they are text - based , and you can you can look at them in the simplest of editors ; and two , you can be somewhat sloppy when you create your data ( or , at least , I can — I'm connecting ideas , not performing bank transactions ) .
This sloppiness is great : I do n't have to anticipate everything I 'm going to do with my XML and my RDF .
I just keep adding and editing and capturing as much data as I can , then , as needs arise , I go back into my text editor to add more structure , and I fiddle with the dials to pull out the information I need .
For as long as I 've been interested in XML I 've been interested in emulation — that is , of running a virtual computer inside of another computer .
At first it was because I could use an Amiga emulator to re-connect with the computer of my childhood .
Then it was a project for a boss , to make WordPerfect 6.2 for DOS run inside a powerful Macintosh .
Over time I realized that emulators have much in common with virtual machines — a virtual machine is software with pretensions to hardware — and so I spent time looking in confusion upon Squeak , and Parrot , and the Java Virtual Machine .
Emulators and virtual machines are built for nomads .
The emulators serve as scrapbooks of the days of our grandfathers ( back to the 1980s ) so that we can learn from their wisdom , or play their chunky video games .
The virtual machines promise immortality : anywhere you go , they say , we virtual machines will be there ; any code you write , we will run .
And now , tremendous energy is being expended on virtualization , where a single computer can run many operating systems , or many instances of a single operating system .
So a virtual Windows machine can run within a Macintosh , or Windows can run Linux while still being Windows .
There are tools that allow these virtual machines to be started , stopped , and passed around between physical machines — stacks of imaginary computers shuffled like a deck of cards .
All of these devices are sops to the nomad 's problem , and provide the illusion of / home .
After I put in a request to have the old server put out to pasture , I found myself wondering when we 'll get beyond our nomadic stage .
At one point in human history , it 's suggested , some hunter - gatherers settled down next to a field of grain , and instead of eating everything and moving on , they planted new grain and irrigated the field .
But we 're not there yet .
The technology industry still equates destruction and disposal with progress — witness as laptops and new all - in - one machines require you to throw away a perfectly good ( and expensive ) LCD screen when you upgrade .
There is no way to realize the value of a computer , to get every last bit of computing out of it , because the upgrades are so hungry for power that you must keep feeding them CPU cycles until the hardware is emaciated and weak .
Software is like the spiders that eat their mother .
There are proponents of Lisp and Scheme , of Haskell , of Smalltalk and Java and Groovy , and of Ruby , who say that they have found the right way to use those cycles — the language to beat all languages .
Paul Graham has written about Arc , a computer language “ for the next 100 years , ” which he promises to build .
And the LORD said , Behold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
Right there you have the eternal promise of the Steve Jobs keynote , the Alan Kay presentation , the Douglas Engelbart demo , the Steve Ballmer pitch , the Google beta launch , and the Nicholas Negroponte showcase .
The image of a product is projected 40 feet tall and luminous behind the man , who points back to the image and repeats God 's words into his lapel mic :
“ Nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do . ”
But God has zero sympathy for this approach :
Go to , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth . . .
That 's why I like emulators , virtual machines , and XML and RDF .
It is the stuff I can carry with me when I am scattered abroad .
Every time the men of Palo Alto or Mountain View , promising a spiritual journey that will end in riches , ask us to believe them and come help build the tower , everyone starts racing to see who can lay the most bricks before God knocks it all down again .
We know that God 's going to knock it down but we can't help ourselves .
It 's pure nerd compulsion .
The man shows us the huge product and we nod and grin .
“ You can touch your music , ” says Steve Jobs , with hippie wonder , of the new iPhone .
Why would I want to touch my music ?
The whole point of MP3s is that I no longer have to touch anything or put anything into a tray .
But maybe if I do n't touch my music I 'll be left behind .
I 'd better look into it .
I am now finishing a website that contains hundreds of thousands of images , and within five years I will need to re-convert all of those images to a higher resolution to match the increased dot pitch of the collective computer screen .
Fair enough ; progress is progress .
But the data that pins those issues together , connects them , is in simple RDF , sliced and sorted inside a Java virtual machine , and all the code beneath my code is open - sourced to its core .
Thus even as servers die or are put to sleep , even as operating systems come and go , I can carry the work forward — despite all of the progress around me .
I doubt I 'll see an end to this nomadic data - lifestyle in the next few decades , or even in my lifetime .
But really , no complaints — it 's fun to wander around in the middle of so much waste and progress , and I 'd rather be here than anywhere .
You just have to keep working out how to travel light and stay portable .

THOSE who keep a close eye on the state of America 's economy might be forgiven for being puzzled : there are reasons aplenty to feel both gloom and cheer .
On Thursday June 28th revised first - quarter GDP figures showed that the economy has not been growing all that briskly ( it expanded at an annualised pace of just 0.7 % ) .
A report from the Federal Reserve noted that price increases have been moderating of late .
Despite this , its main concern remains inflation , rather than stimulating the economy .
There are plenty of ominous signs .
The housing market , long the mainstay of America 's economic boom , is sagging .
Defaults in the subprime lending market grow ever more worrisome .
The core inflation rate , which excludes food and energy , is not exactly subdued : consumer prices were up by 2.2 % in May from a year ago .
Add in the tepid GDP growth and the mix is making consumers nervous .
But the gloom does not penetrate everywhere .
The jobs market , where one usually looks for signs of a flagging economy , looks healthy .
The unemployment rate is 4.5 % , down from last year , and lower than in all but the rosiest days of the Clinton era .
This apparent strength has revived controversy over the discrepancy between the two main sets of employment figures : the payroll survey and household data .
The former monitors employers , asking them how many jobs they have created or destroyed over the past month .
The household survey asks people directly whether they are employed .
Since the 2001 recession , these figures have diverged .
When the payroll figure was significantly lower than the household number , critics of George Bush 's administration gleefully proclaimed that it was the “ correct ” measure .
Mr Bush 's defenders , on the other hand , pointed out that the payroll number left out the self - employed and small businesses that are too tiny to be surveyed .
Most analysts , however , continued to rely more heavily on the payroll numbers , which use a much larger sample size of about a third of American businesses .
The divergence is still there , but strangely is now reversed .
The household figures show total employment unchanged in May , at 145.9 m .
But the payroll survey indicates that the economy added over 150,000 jobs from April to May .
More mysterious still are housing - related jobs .
Over the past few years a buoyant housing sector has contributed enormously to the economy ; its current slowness is casting a pall .
Consumers can no longer tap the piggy bank of their home equity to keep spending and property - development profits have vanished .
The government estimates that the housing slump lopped nearly a percentage point off GDP in the first quarter of 2007 .
If so , that ought to mean fewer construction jobs , as developments dry up .
Yet , on a seasonally adjusted basis , fewer than 50,000 construction jobs have gone since the beginning of the year , less than 1 % of the industry 's total .
Given the devastation in the housing sector , and the transient nature of most construction jobs , this is surprising .
Could it be that the payroll survey simply missed a lot of construction jobs , as it misses small businesses , and that job losses in the construction industry are concentrated among the smaller fry ?
That seems unlikely .
The payroll survey showed an enormous increase in construction employment during the housing bubble ; the number of workers in the industry has swelled by just over 800,000 since 2004 .
One would expect to see many of those people laid off as the housing bubble collapses , but so far it has n't happened .
That may mean there is something wrong with the data , or perhaps the housing market is less parlous than it seems .
As vexing a concern is the effect that a slowing housing market will have on the mountain of debt and debt - related instruments that were issued to finance the boom .
The most frightening aspect of the problems at two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns , both heavily exposed to the subprime - mortgage market , was not that a big bank had been plunging into risky assets ; it was the revelation of how little anyone knew about the risks involved .
The market was so leveraged , and the instruments so complicated , that no one seemed understand what would happen if it all began to unwind .
That is the rather shocking revelation that comes out of a fascinating article in today ’s Washington Post :
Many administrations have sought to maximize their control of the machinery of government for political gain , dispatching Cabinet secretaries bearing government largess to battleground states in the days before elections .
The Clinton White House routinely rewarded big donors with stays in the Lincoln Bedroom and private coffees with senior federal officials , and held some political briefings for top Cabinet officials during the 1996 election .
But Rove , who announced last week that he is resigning from the White House at the end of August , pursued the goal far more systematically than his predecessors , according to interviews and documents reviewed by The Washington Post , enlisting political appointees at every level of government in a permanent campaign that was an integral part of his strategy to establish Republican electoral dominance .
Under Rove ’s direction , this highly coordinated effort to leverage the government for political marketing started as soon as Bush took office in 2001 and continued through last year ’s congressional elections , when it played out in its most quintessential form in the coastal Connecticut district of Rep. Christopher Shays , an endangered Republican incumbent .
Seven times , senior administration officials visited Shays ’s district in the six months before the election — once for an announcement as minor as a single $ 23 government weather alert radio presented to an elementary school .
On Election Day , Shays was the only Republican House member in New England to survive the Democratic victory .
Although Democrats in the House are talking about launching investigations into whether any of these efforts led to violations of the Hatch Act , which prohibits political activity by career government employees acting in their official capacity , on the surface it seems that everything Rove was doing was completely legal :
An invitation to a March 12 , 2001 , political briefing for federal officials — one of the Rove team ’s earliest — framed the mission this way : “ How we can work together . ”
In practical terms , that meant Cabinet officials concentrated their official government travel on the media markets
Rove ’s team chose , rolling out grant decisions made by agencies with red-carpet fanfare in GOP congressional districts , and carefully crafted announcements highlighting the release of federal money in battleground states .
“ We did that from Day One of the administration , strategically utilizing the president ’s appointees to sell his agenda , ” Drew DeBerry , the Agriculture Department ’s liaison to the White House between 2001 and 2005 , recalled in an interview last week .
(…)
To lead the charge , Rove had his “ asset deployment team . ”
It comprised the chief White House liaison official at each Cabinet agency .
The team members met — sometimes as often as once a month — to coordinate the travel of Cabinet secretaries and senior agency officials , the announcement of grant money , and personnel and policy decisions .
Occasionally , the attendees got updates on election strategies .
White House officials say Rove had two basic rules : the first was to avoid meddling with grant and contract decisions made by career government employees ; the second was to make sure they complied with the Hatch Act .
“ What was surprising was how adamant Karl and his whole team was that we involve the lawyers in our discussions to make sure we did n’t come up with things that ran afoul of the law , ” DeBerry said .
In March 2002 , then - White House lawyer Brett Kavanaugh gave such a briefing on the “ do ’s and don’ts regarding your participation in politically related activities , ” according to the invitation .
It may have been legal , but the fact that Rove and the White House were able to do this points out the extent to which spending by the Federal Government has become an exercise in political largess .
Grants are made and money is spent not based on where it is needed , but based on where it would be most politically advantageous .
In an era when the Federal Government as a budget in excess of $ 2 trillion and has its hands in virtually every corner of the economy , the impact of such spending decisions can be enormous , both politically and economically .
An effort like this should n’t be surprising to anyone .
If anything , the Democrats are ( 1 ) kicking themselves for not thinking of stuff like this during the Clinton Administration and ( 2 ) taking notes so that they can do the same thing if , and when , they regain the White House .
As long as we have a Federal Government that is too big and spends too much , we ’ll have guys like Karl Rove finding ways to manipulate its resources for political gain .
We can either continue with the way things are , or fundamentally change the nature of government in the country and return it to what it was intended to be .
The choice is ours .

' Stupid ' computer error messages leave users befuddled

( IDG ) --
You know what ticks off Ben Ezzell ?
Bad error messages .
Messages that " offer no intelligence , do n't tell the user what 's wrong [ and ] frustrate people , " he says .
Ezzell is a veteran programmer and author ( how many books has he written ?
" I think 23 , " he says with uncertainty ) who lives in Guerneville , Calif .
While researching his latest book , " Developing Windows Error Messages , " Ezzell and publisher O'Reilly & Associates held a contest in which they asked people to send in their favorite bad error messages .
Ezzell was the sole judge .
Of course , there are degrees of rottenness .
" Some bad error messages , " Ezzell says , " are just placeholders that slip through .
We 've all been there . "
Ezzell acknowledges he once wrote a message that addressed the user as " Dumbkopf " and was mortified when the dialog made its way into production .
Thus , he sympathized with Orem , Utah - based Viewpoint DataLabs , which managed to include the following in its LiveArt install :
Setup is unable to locate a suitable version of DirectX on your machine .
You will need to install DirectX before you can use LiveArt98 , dumbass !
Sympathy notwithstanding , Ezzell awarded the entry third prize .
Red - faced developers at Viewpoint noted that the message had simply slipped through the quality - assurance cracks and that they 'd fixed the problem " about 4 seconds after we realized it was still there . "
Ezzell hastens to point out that he is n't a Microsoft hater ; some of his favorite error messages are from Unix , including this succinct goody :

I ’ve always thought that continuations are the right answer to many if no all the network - programming problems .
What are continuations ?
A continuation represent the state of execution of a function : all the local variables and the instruction pointer ( the last line executed ) .
( Update : At least : there can be many kind of continuations .
Other than the local variables , it ’s possible to store the state of the entire thread / process / stack )
What are them used for ?
You can interrupt the execution of a function and resume it later .
This can be useful to create “ generators “ : iterators made simple .
A generator looks like this :
function next ( ) { for ( x=0 ; x < arr.lenght ; x++ ) { yield arr[ x ] ; } } [ / js ]
The function < code > next </ code > return the next element in the < code > arr < / code > array every time is called .
When you call the function you resume the continuation , so the execution will resume from the < code > yield < / code > .
If you want to implement an iterator like that without generators you 'll have to explicitly unroll the < code > for < / code > loop .
The resulting code will be surely less readabe .
Like : function next ( ) { if ( this.
current == null ) this .
current = 0 ; this .current ++ ; if ( this.current > arr.lenght ) { this .
current = 0 ; return null ; } retrun arr[ x ] ;
This can get really worse for every non-trivial iterator ( eg : tree traversal ) .
Another nice use of continuations is to generate cooperative threads .
They are different from standard threads because they ca n’t be stopped , they should cooperatively stop .
For example you can do :
function process ( ) { sendConnectRequest ( ) ; yield ; if (! this.connected ) return false ; sendLoginRequest ( ) ; yield ; sendMessage ( ) ; yield ; trace ( " msg received : " + this .response ) ; }
The process function return the control to the calling function every time it has to do an asynchronous operation .
Without continuations you ’ll have to do :
function process ( onComplete ) { connect ( function ( connected ) { sendLoginRequest ( function ( logged ) { sendMessage ( function ( response ) { trace ( " msg received : " + response ) ; onComplete ( ) ; } } } }
As you can see we have used closures in a Continuation Passing Style :
Every time you have to do an asynchronous operation , you ’ll have to pass a function ( a callback ) that will be called when the operation is done .
Without closures the code will look even worst , this is why recently there is a great buzz about closures in the java world .
But , what have in common continuations and threads ?
A continuations - like style of programming ( but without continuations ) is possible only using threads .
However , threads are the heavier and most problematic way to handle the I/O waitings .
( see : 10 Kproblem )
You have not only to deal with concurrency problems with read / write variables , but you have to block an entire thread for every I /O operation .
A better way is to use asynchronous events , like in the last two example .
But of the two , which one do you prefer ?
If your answer is like mine , take a look to :
Jetty servlet engine , it support a limited form of one shot continuations : the function is re-executed from the beginning , what is restored is only the HTTP connection state .
RIFE continuations , it ’s a bytecode - level implementation in Java , these are real continuations
NarrativeJS , a precompiler that create a simple form of continuations in Javascript : using the -> operator the execution can be resumed from that point .
operator the execution can be resumed from that point .
Update : Torsten Curdt suggest Javaflow , a continuation implementation that seems really interesting , he offers some tutorials on his blog too
Jetty scratched only the surface of what is possible with continuations , while with RIFE it ’s possible to develop highly concurrent servers using cooperative sessions instead of threads ( some > 10000 connections instead of 1000 ) .
See : Mina Java- NIO library , Perl POE , Mina - Mule .
A server that uses continuations , will allow the simple and linear programming style of blocking - synchronous operations while using non-blocking ones .
With a huge increment in performance .
In the client side , the most interesting is NarrativeJs , that use an approach that can be adapted to every language :
it unroll loops and transform all local variables in object variables to generate his quasi-continuations .
function boo( ) { alert ( " start " ) ; sleep ->( 30 ) ; alert ( " end " ) ; }
became :
function boo( ) {var njf1=njen ( this , arguments ) ; nj:while (1 ) {switch(njf1.cp ) {case 0 : alert ( " start " ) ; nj f1.
pc( 1, null , sleep , [ 30 ] ) ; case 1 : with ( njf1 ) if ( ( rv1=f.apply ( c , a ) ) ==NJSUS ) {return fh;} alert ( " end " ) ; break nj;}}}
The code looks ugly but it is so to preserve line numbers .
With narrativeJs you can do complex animations in a simple , linear way :
waitForClick ->( theButton ) ; animate ->( theButton , " left " , 200 , 1000 , 20 ) ; the Button .
innerHTML
= " go left " ; // move the button to the left ( again note the blocking operations ) waitForClick ->( theButton ) ; animate ->( theButton , " left " , 0 , 1000 , 20 ) ;
or :
document.getElementById(" myElem " ).innerHTML
= fetch ->( " http://www.url.com/ " ) ;
Really interesting now that Flash and Ajax are pushing asynchronous operations to the masses .
Will we say goodbye to events , and maybe to threads as we know now ?
Measuring the Terrorist Threat Pakistan May Return Detained Islamists to Germany
For the first time since Sept. 11 , 2001 , a government task force responsible for preparing for terrorist threats has met in Berlin .
Indications that terrorists may be planning attacks on Europe are growing following a slew of arrests of Islamists in Pakistan .
They had traveled from Germany .
A gravitational lens is a massive object , such as a cluster of galaxies , that magnifies light from galaxies that are farther away and which would otherwise not be observable .
Astronomers have found evidence for the most distant galaxies ever detected .
The galaxies are seen as they existed just 500 million years after the birth of the universe .
Their light , traversing the cosmos for more than 13 billion years , was seen only because it was distorted in a natural " gravitational lens " created by the gravity - bending mass of a nearer cluster of galaxies .
" Gravitational lensing is the magnification of distant sources by foreground structures , " explained Caltech astronomer Richard Ellis , who led the international team .
" By looking through carefully selected clusters , we have located six star - forming galaxies seen at unprecedented distances , corresponding to a time when the universe was only 500 million years old , or less than 4 percent of its present age . "
The universe is estimated to be 13.7 billion years old , so that puts the newfound galaxies at 13.2 billion light - years away .
A light - year is the distance light travels in a year , about 6 trillion miles ( 10 trillion kilometers ) .
Tricky technique
The team found the galaxies using the 10 - meter Keck II telescope atop Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii .
The finding will be presented tomorrow at a conference of the Geological Society in London .
The light from the half - dozen faraway star - forming galaxies was boosted about 20 times by the magnifying effect of the foreground galaxy cluster , said team member Dan Stark , a Caltech graduate student .
Gravitational lensing is tricky , the researchers admit .
To bolster their case , they point to very ancient galaxies that are just slightly closer , yet which already contain old stars .
" To produce these old stars requires significant earlier activity , most likely in the fainter star - forming galaxies we have now seen , " Stark said .
In 2004 , a separate team claimed discovery of a galaxy 13.23 billion light - years away , " but re-examination of that object by others showed it to be spurious , " Stark told SPACE.com today .
End of the Dark Ages
The galaxies offer a glimpse of an era shortly after the first stars formed .
After the theoretical Big Bang , there were no stars .
Eventually , a thick " fog " was effectively burned off by hot , young stars , ending what 's called the cosmic Dark Ages .
" That we should find so many distant galaxies in our small survey area suggests they are very numerous indeed , " Stark said .
" We estimate the combined radiation output of this population could be sufficient to break apart ( ionize ) the hydrogen atoms in space at that time , thereby ending the Dark Ages . "
Galaxies get bigger and bigger through galactic mergers .
Two small galaxies come together , merge their stars , and you get a bigger galaxy .
But astronomers have always wondered , what happens with the two supermassive black holes that seem to always lurk at the heart of galaxies .
What happens when two compact objects with millions of times the mass of our sun collide ?
Good question .
An international team of physicists have developed a computer simulation designed to answer this very question .
And in a recent article in Science Express , they published the results of the simulation .
It turns out the interaction depends a lot on the amount of hot gas surrounding each black hole .
As they start to interact , this gas exerts a frictional force on the black holes , slowing down their spin rate .
Once they get within the width of our solar system , they should start emitting gravitational waves , which continues to extract energy from the system .
This causes them to continue coming together , and eventually merge .
This simulation is good news for experiments designed to search for gravitational waves .
The mergers should be so energetic , they ’ll generate gravitational waves detectable across space .

Peak Oil CIBC : $ 100 / Barrel Oil by End of 2008 By Ryan McGreal
Published July 19 , 2007
A new report by Jeff Rubin and Peter Buchanan at CIBC World Markets predicts that oil will hit $ 100 per barrel by the end of 2008 .
It echoes a recent report published on The Oil Drum that found oil exporting countries past their production peaks are reducing their exports faster than their depletion rates so they can meet domestic demand .
The authors also note that while rising oil prices have cooled demand in industrialized countries , most of the demand growth is coming from the oil producing countries themselves .
The resilience of world crude demand to the doubling in prices in the last three years has economists scratching their heads about the apparent lack of price sensitivity in world crude demand .
Pointing out that inside oil exporting countries , cheap domestic gasoline prices are " considered a political birthright , " Rubin and Buchanan argue that without price signals , domestic consumption inside OPEC , Russia and Mexico will continue to go up even as national output peaks and goes into decline .
With consumption growth in the Middle East quintuple the advanced economies ' pace , OPEC 's future export capacity must be increasingly called into question .
Particularly now that the cartel no longer seems to be able to raise production .
...
While OPEC production may be close to a peak , domestic demand for oil in OPEC member countries has nowhere to go but up .
At current internal consumption rates , the cartel 's exportable surplus will decline steadily over the balance of the decade - even if new production offsets the mounting toll taken from depletion .
With domestic production more or less constant over the balance of the decade , internal demand growth will reduce exports by about 1 million barrels per day between now and the end of the decade .
The report also notes that opportunities to offset export declines from OPEC are limited .
Mexico is past past its production peak , while Russian production will grow only modestly , even as consumption continues to rise in those countries as well .
Similarly , Iraq is too unstable to maintain reliably , let alone grow , its oil production .

Methane from thawing permafrost could increase global warming .
Methane bubbles trapped in lake ice during the first few days of ice formation on a Siberian thermokarst lake in October 2003 .
Lakes in the permafrost zone of northern Siberia are belching out much more of the greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere than previously thought .
In coming decades this could become a more significant factor in global climate change .
The Siberian lakes , which are formed in melting permafrost as temperatures rise , have long been known to emit methane — a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
But it has been hard to quantify just how much methane was being released .
Rather than being emitted in a constant stream , 95 % of the methane comes from random bubbling in disperse locations .
To get around this problem , an international group of researchers , led by Katey Walter of the University of Alaska Fairbanks , pinpointed methane bubble zones by walking over two frozen lakes near the Northeast Science Station in Cherskii , finding spots where gas could be seen trapped in pockets under the ice .
In some spots the bubbling was so fierce that the warm gas melted the frozen surface .
The team then returned in spring and set up 1 - metre - wide , umbrella - shaped traps to capture and measure the gas : 25 traps were placed in random locations , with 16 more over point sources identified in the winter .
The team also made ground surveys of 35 other lakes , and took aerial photographs of some 60 lakes in northern Siberia , to ensure that the two studied in depth were n't unusual .
Their results , when extrapolated , show that northern Siberia currently emits 3.8 million tonnes of methane this way each year — up to five times higher than previous estimates .
The results , reported in Nature1 , suggest that the total release of methane from wetlands in the Northern Hemisphere may be between 10 % and 63 % higher than previously thought .
Thaw point
This is just a small portion of the total amount of methane released to the atmosphere : some 410 million to 660 million tonnes are thought to be pumped out by industry and natural sources each year .
But the contribution from thawing lakes could increase .
Rising temperatures have increased the area of thawing lake in northern Siberia by 14.7 % from 1974 to 2000 .
Walter 's team estimates this would have bumped up methane release by 58 % .
The Siberian permafrost region has the potential to release billions of tonnes of methane , says Walter .
" It is a ticking time bomb , " she says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Walter notes that the Siberian permafrost region is probably a far more potent source of methane than the permafrost zones of North America and Western Europe .
Before the previous ice age , northern Siberia was a verdant grassland with abundant wildlife , which was frozen into a huge reservoir of carbon during the Pleistocene , some 40,000 years ago .
When this ancient organic matter thaws , it is attacked by methane - producing bacteria .
But a warming world does not necessarily mean more methane from these lakes , notes Gerhard Krinner , a climatologist at the CNRS Laboratory of Glaciology and Geophysics of the Environment near Grenoble , France .
Previous work has suggested that rising temperatures will eventually decrease the lake area in permafrost regions , as the ground beneath pools of water thaws completely and allows the water to drain away .
But it will be a long time , says Walter , before areas with continuous permafrost thaw enough to allow that to happen ; in the meantime , she cautions , we 're in for a large increase in greenhouse gas .

I admit it ... I was slow to join the impeachment bandwagon .
I just foresaw a circus of epic proportions , with the established media connections to the Republican noise machine giving us the disadvantage in public sentiments , perhaps dooming the effort .
But with overwhelming evidence of a complete disregard for the rule of law to the point of near sociopathy , it 's hard not to come to any other conclusion than it 's time to quite seriously put impeachment back on the table .
Lane Hudson at HuffPo has more :
Mack Bedor went to the bathroom one day at school , and was shocked to find a video camera .
He was n’t sure what to do , so he took out the camera , took it home and showed it to his mother , Cindy Champion .
School officials gave him a five - day suspension for “ stealing school property . ’
The school is a building shared by Jasper County Middle School and Jasper County High School , and the high school principal admitted to putting the camera in the bathroom .
“ There was tiles up there and it was cut out in a little circle , ” Mack said .
“ It felt like it was the right thing to do because we were being violated in the bathroom , and I just knew I could trust my mom and she would do something about it . ”
“ That was the interesting part to me that surprised me — Ms. Massengil , the middle school principal , nor the teachers were aware .
No one seemed to be aware besides the principal at the high school , ’ Champion said .
“ I had told the high school principal , Mr. Fore , that he needed to come up with another solution — that this was n’t appropriate .
His response to me was he was going to continue to film . ” ‘ — WXIA
And the district attorney is saying that it ’s perfectly legal to put a camera in the school bathroom because schools have more leeway on privacy issues , according to the news report .
It ’s official : the sanctity of the bathroom as a private place has been breached , and nothing is going to happen to the person who breached it .
This is making me sick .
This is the biggest housing slump in the last 4 or 5 decades : every housing indicator is in free fall , including now housing prices . ”
- Economist Roubini Nouriel , Dow Jones , 23 August 2006
“ The Fed , in effect , has become a serial bubble blower . ” - Stephen Roach , chief economist , Morgan Stanley
The American people appear to be oblivious to the economic hurricane which is expected to touchdown in late 2007 .
That ’s when $ 1 trillion in ARMs ( Adjustable Rate Mortgages ) will “ reset ” triggering a massive increase in foreclosures and plunging the country into a deep recession .
If energy costs continue to rise at the same time or if the dollar loses more ground , we may be rooting around in the backyard garden - plot looking for passed - over spuds and radishes .
The crisis is entirely the work of Fed Chairman , Alan Greenspan , whose “ cheap money ” policy caused a speculative frenzy in the real estate market which sent home prices through the stratosphere .
In fact , the bubble originated in 2001 when Greenspan lowered interest rates to a meager 1 % and ignited a refinancing boom as well as a sudden up - tick in home sales .
Now , after 17 straight interest rate increases , the bubble is quickly losing steam and the effects are being felt from sea to shining sea .
Rest assured , the sudden downturn in the housing market is just the first gust from an impending tornado .
By the end of 2007 , America ’s match - stick economy will look like the rubble strewn landscape of New Orleans 9th Ward .
Greenspan has been the biggest player in this pre-Depression operetta .
He kept the printing presses whirring along at full - tilt while the banks and mortgage lenders devised every scam imaginable to put greenbacks into the hands unqualified borrowers .
ARMs , “ interest - only ” or “ no down payment ” loans etc. were all part of the creative financing boondoggle which the kept the economy sputtering along after the “ dot.com ” crackup in 2000 .
It worked like a charm , too .
Aided by the Fed ’s cheap money policy , the housing market sizzled .
In just 6 years the total value of real estate jumped from $ 11 trillion to $ 21 trillion !
( “ From 2001 through 2005 , outstanding mortgage debt rose 68 % from $ 5293 billion to $ 8888 billion ” )
It ’s the biggest expansion of debt in history and it was all engineered by seductively low interest rates .
Greenspan executed the swindle with the adroitness of a carnival huckster ; luring millions of buyers to the real estate gold rush .
Now , many of those same buyers are stuck with enormous loans that are about to reset at drastically higher rates while their homes have already depreciated 10 % to 20 % in value .
This phenomenon of being shackled to a “ negative equity mortgage ” is what economist Michael Hudson calls the “ New Road to Serfdom ” ; paying off a mortgage that is significantly larger than the current value of the house .
The sheer magnitude of the problem is staggering .
For example , an article in the New York Times last week noted that “ 1 in 5 sub - prime loans will end in foreclosure ” …
“ About 2.2 million borrowers who took out sub - prime loans from 1998 to 2006 are likely to lose their homes ” .
In real terms , that translates into roughly 10 million people !
Greenspan , of course , nodded approvingly while the new regime of shaky lending practices was being put into place .
What really mattered to the Fed - chief was making sure the economy could be kept on life - support while the massive “ unfunded ” tax cuts were provided for his well - healed buddies in corporate America and while the country charged off to war in Iraq .
Greenspan knew that his “ low interest rate bonanza ” was driving the wooden stake into America ’s heart .
In fact , every banker understands the effects of interest rates ; it ’s fundamental to their trade .
Lower the interest rates and the people will swarm to the banks like piranhas to a hambone .
It never fails .
The housing bubble has nothing to do with “ market forces ” or ( Gawd help us ) supply - and - demand .
That ’s all gibberish .
Low interest rates provide a channel for pumping cheap money into the economy which inevitably creates equity bubbles .
When Greenspan lowered rates to 1 % , he knew that he was simply trading a technology bubble for a real estate bubble .
Now , of course , he has retired before the wheels fall off the cartso he can avoid being blamed for the coming catastrophe .
The fallout from the housing explosion will be much more destructive than what most people imagine .
In fact , Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital Inc. believes that the NY Times ’ estimates are too optimistic .
Schiff anticipates that failures in the sub - prime loan market will put greater downward pressure on housing by increasing inventory and lowering prices .
Schiff says : “ The secondary effects of the “ 1 out of 5 ” sub - prime default rate will be a chain reaction of rising interest rates and falling home prices engendering still more defaults , with the added foreclosures causing the cycle to repeat .
In my opinion , when the cycle is fully played out we are more likely to see an 80 % default rate rather than 20 % ” .
80 % !?!
40 million Americans headed towards foreclosure ?
Better pick out a comfy spot in the local park to set up the lean - to .
Schiff ’s calculations may be overly pessimistic , but his reasoning is sound .
Once mortgage - holders realize that their homes are worth tens of thousands less than the amount of their loan they are likely to “ mail in their house keys rather than make the additional mortgage payments . ”
As Schiff says , “ Why would anyone stretch to spend 40 % of his monthly income to service a $ 700,000 mortgage on a condo valued at $ 500,000 , especially when there are plenty of comparable rentals that are far more affordable ? ”
Why indeed ?
There ’s simply no incentive to hang on to a home or condo that ’s losing value every day .
“ Lobster Potted ” ?
Economist Nigel Maund describes what over - leveraged homeowners can expect as real estate values continue to plummet : “ For the majority of homeowners , they are now ‘ lobster potted ’ for the rest of their lives in the 21st Century ’s version of the Victorian treadmill .
Welcome to modern debt - controlled serfdom , where if you lose your job , either through retrenchment or illness , you lose your home .
It has become a veritable Sword of Damocles , or a stick with which to beat recalcitrant labor into a bloody pulp , should they ever prove restless or disobedient .
The ruthless and faceless plutocrats who benefit vastly from this dreadful scheme must be laughing on their return to a status of demagogic power which is the modern equivalent of Roman or Medieval Aristocracy at its exploitative worst … .
The mortgage weapon forms an integral part of the armory of the so - called New World Order ( NWO ) as it seeks to accumulate wealth and power to control people by stealth . ”
Maund nails it ; the “ mortgage weapon ” has been used effectively to thrust millions into debt - servitude and shift the nations ’ wealth to the upper 1 % .
Meanwhile the Decider - in - Chief has been busy rewriting the nation ’s laws so they meet the requirements of an economically polarized society .
( The erosion of civil liberties is the unavoidable consequence of the greater divisions in wealth )
The first wave in the tsunami is timed to hit in late 2007 when $ 1 trillion in ARMs reset ; wreaking havoc across the country .
That means that millions of borrowers will see dramatic increases in loans on homes that are of steadily - diminishing value .
( Many monthly payments will nearly double ! )
The number of foreclosures will skyrocket , unemployment will soar , and America ’s consumer economy will swoon .
How bad will it be ?
According to statistical analyst , Jim Willie , “ One third of job creation has come from the housing industry in the last 5 years . ”
How will we make up those losses in employment ?
Equally worrisome , is the amount of money which will stop flowing into the economy because of the declining home values .
In 2005 , Americans pulled $ 732 billion out of their home equity to spend on consumer items .
By the 2nd quarter of 2006 that number was down to $ 327 ( annualized ) a loss of more than half .
In an economy where 90 % of growth has depended of the housing boom , these are ominous signs of impending disaster .
( Current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the slowdown in housing has been a “ major drag ” on the economy which has already caused a 1 % decrease in GDP in 2006 .
What effects will it have in 2007 when the real storm hits !?!)
If homeowners can’t tap into their equity to augment their stagnant wages , GDP will shrink and investment will flee to foreign markets .
That ’s when we ’re likely to see the lines at the neighborhood shelter winding around the block and whole families camping - out in the backs of their Suburbans .
The Sub - prime “ Time Bomb ”
It looks like the meltdown in sub - prime loan business will trigger a steady downturn in the entire housing industry .
The Center for Responsible Lending ( CRL ) issued a report which says that they anticipate a “ humanitarian disaster worse than Katrina ” .
The report states :
“ The sub - prime market was designed with a built - in time bomb .
In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee in September , Michael Calhoun , the President of the CRL , showed an example of the most typical sub - prime loan , known as a 2/28 , with an " exploding ARM " ( adjustable rate mortgage ) .
Buyers can qualify for this type of loan if the original ( " teaser " ) monthly payment is not higher than 61 % of their after - tax income .
At the end of two years , even without a rise in interest rates , the payment will typically rise to 96 % of the purchaser ’s monthly income .
No wonder then , that the study conservatively forecasts that one - third of families who received a sub - prime loan in 2005 and 2006 will ultimately lose their homes ! ”
A “ 96 % of the purchaser ’s monthly income ” ?!?
That leaves a measly 4 % of one ’s earnings to pay for clothes , food and other essentials !
The disaster in sub - prime loans is leading the housing market into a waterfall - type decline .
It ’s the first indication that a real catastrophe is just around the corner .
The inability of over - leveraged borrowers ( many with a poor credit history ) to meet their obligations is spreading to other areas of the market .
This is called “ contagion ” .
The defaults are symptomatic of a larger problem which could quickly affect the entire system .
Realtor Don Stacey describes the phenomenon this way : “ The fact of the matter is that sub - prime lenders are closing shop and dropping like flies … .
What does this signal ?
To me it suggests that the sub - prime lending cycle is history .
And , if it is history , then a very large chunk of the nonconforming borrowing seen in 2004 , 2005 and most of 2006 , will not be repeated in 2007 . ”
Why should this matter to the average homeowner ?
Because in 2003 , 35 % of all mortgages were “ nonconforming ” loans .
In 2004 , it went up to 59 % ; and in 2005 , nonconforming loans were a mammoth 65 % of all mortgages !
As the lenders return to more conventional practices the pool of potential customers will dry up accordingly and housing prizes will fall precipitously .
Once again , we need to remind ourselves that the housing boom was not created by market forces , “ real demand ” or increases in wages .
It is entirely the outcome of Greenspan ’s “ cheap money ” policy ( low interest rates ) as well as the widespread shabby lending practices .
( “ Creative financing ” , ARMs etc. )
These factors have caused the largest expansion of personal debt in history and are creating a real risk of a complete financial collapse .
So , why would the banks commit to such a risky scam when the standard criterion for loaning money has been understood for hundreds of years ?
For the banks to ignore the rules for prudent lending ( 20 % Down - payment , fixed interest rate , sufficient collateral and income ) is like a scientist saying that the rules of gravity no longer apply or that the chemical composition of water has changed .
It simply makes no sense , does it ?
It ’s different for the Federal Reserve .
The Fed knows that the US consumer is already over - extended and mired in debt .
They ’ve decided to increase our ( collective ) obligations while their corporate colleagues load the boats for more promising markets in Asia and Europe .
They cling to the notion that they can preserve the greenback as the “ reserve currency ” even after it has been deflated to the value of the Peso .
( The actual face - value of the dollar makes no difference to the Fed as long as they continue to produce the “ international currency ” .
That preserves their power - base and control of the global system . )
“ Cheapening ” the dollar by doubling the money supply paves the way for hyperinflation and ( the Fed believes ) a more competitive American workforce going nose - to - nose with competitors in China and India .
It ’s a plan that globalization ’s foremost champion , Tom Friedman , would probably greatly admire .
By pulverizing the dollar , the Fed can crush the middle class and lay the foundation for a “ class - based ” , police state ; Bush ’s nascent Valhalla .
The first step to “ reordering ” society is destroying the currency .
Famed economist , John Maynard Keynes , showed a keen grasp of this when he said : “ Lenin was right .
There ’s no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency .
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose . ”
This suggests that the greatest threat to “ democratic institutions ” is not repressive legislation ( as most believe ) but monetary policy .
The manipulation of currency can precipitate economic divisions in society which make democracy impossible .
That ’s why Thomas Jefferson said :
“ I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies .
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of our currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and the corporations that will grow up around ( the banks ) will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered .
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs . ”
Jefferson understood that monetary policy is central to the maintenance of personal freedom and should not be ceded to a few “ unelected ” and unaccountable men whose interests diverge from the public good .
The Fed ’s ability to “ inflate and deflate ” the currency allows privately - owned banks to decide the country ’s future and remake society according to their own inclinations .
America ’s political transformation is being engineered by the Federal Reserve .
But , what about the banks ?
What would compel the banks break with traditional lending practices and put themselves at risk of millions of foreclosures ?
The banks eke out their survival in an extremely competitive environment where short term profit determines their behavior .
Not only have they loaned out zillions of dollars to people with poor credit , they ’ve also played a major role in repackaging substandard loans and selling them off to Wall Street as “ mortgage backed securities ” ( MBS )
These MBS are high - yield debt instruments that evolved through “ deregulation ” .
They ’re sold to hedge funds as securities and are rarely ( if ever ) checked for the reliability of the borrower .
This has created a great opportunity for the banks to loan as much money as possible using funky ARMs and nontraditional loans knowing that they ’ll be rubber - stamped on their way to Wall Street .
( The practice of shipping B grade loans to fund managers is like gift - wrapping dog poop and selling it as Belgium chocolates .
Nevertheless , it has fattened the bottom line for nearly all the major lending institutions )
Unfortunately , the terms of the MBS allow non performing loans to be sold back to the lender that originated the loan .
Now that the number of “ non-performing ” loans is on the rise , ( through defaults ) the banks are scrambling to avoid liability .
( In fact , according to National Mortgage News , Fifth Third Bank is “ selling $ 11.4 billion in securities ( almost all MBS ) before year - end 2006 and is taking a loss of approximately $ 500 million . )
This reflects the new mood in steering away from shaky loans .
As the great housing Hindenburg continues its downward trajectory , the banks will undoubtedly do their best to prevent the deluge of foreclosures ( and failing MBS ’ ) from dragging them under .
Perhaps , they will offer more flexible terms to over - leveraged homeowners as a way of recouping their losses ; it ’s impossible to know .
It ’s also hard to gage how many struggling homeowners will be able to hang on even with a more flexible payment schedule .
Unfortunately , the present trend - lines offer little reason to be hopeful .
These are grim times for the mortgage industry and we should n’t be too surprised if one or two major banks hobble into receivership before the storm is over .
Housing Hullabaloo : “ the worst is yet to come ”
Reports in the mainstream media tend to obscure the severity of the housing bubble .
Typically , the articles are full of “ Sunny - Jim ” claptrap about a “ rebounding market ” that is suddenly “ correcting ” after an explosive decade of growth .
For example , over 250 articles appeared in US newspapers this week celebrating ; “ New Home Sales Rise in November ” .
Readers should not be taken in by this type of hype .
A careful reading of the facts indicates that , “ rather than foreshadowing a quick rebound , the news high - lighted how fragile the residential construction remained and suggested that the downturn rattling the housing market has not run its course . ”
( NY Times )
Translation :
The worst is yet to come .
The number of homes sold in November was the LOWEST IN ALMOST 4 YEARS ” causing inventories to swell to a “ 7.7 month supply , the highest since December 1995 ” .
These are very bad numbers .
So , why is the media cheering ?
The news reports draw attention to a slight 3.4 % increase in sales in November from a thoroughly dreadful October !
If , however , we compare the figures from November 2005 to November 2006 , we find that housing sales are actually down 12.4 % from a year earlier .
( and , this , of course , is how one normally evaluates a downturn in the market )
The media is no more dependable in their coverage of the housing bubble than they are about Iraq .
The reader must do his own research and draw his own conclusions .
But one thing is certain , house prices are way beyond any historical relationship to rents or salaries .
They are bound to come down … and fast .
We can also assume that the number of foreclosures will skyrocket in 2007 from defaults on sub- prime loans and the “ resetting ” of Adjustable Rate Mortgages .
( The monthly payments on these loans will go up significantly whether the Fed raises interest rates or not )
Business
Week summarized our current predicament saying : “ Today ’s housing prices are predicated on an impossible combination : the strong growth in income and asset values of a strong economy , plus the ultra - low rates of a weak economy .
Either the economy ’s long - term prospects will get worse or rates will rise .
In either scenario , housing will weaken . ”
The real estate slump will seriously dampen consumer spending and further shrink the already miniscule US GDP ( 1.9 % )
This will undoubtedly have the added effect of curtailing foreign investment ; putting more downward pressure on the floundering dollar and triggering a round of hyperinflation .
Ultimately , the Fed will be forced to make one of two choices ; either lower interest rates and forgo foreign investment ( $ 2.5 billion a day ) or keep interest rates where they are and accelerate the collapse of the housing market .
There is no “ third ” option .
Most analysts and traders believe that Fed Chief Bernanke will follow the well - worn path of Dr. Weimar and begin “ hurling bundles of greenbacks from helicopters ” rather than allow the economy to grind to a halt .
Hence , we are likely to see the further “ debauching the currency ” sometime in the very near future .
As Stephen Jen , the chief currency economist at Morgan Stanley , said recently in an article in the New York Times , “ All the policy makers still believe in the possibility of a dollar crash .
It ’s still lingering out there . ”
No doubt , Fed - master Bernanke will work towards that goal by keeping the printing presses humming - along while praying for the elusive “ soft landing ” .
The Fed ’s plan to reshape American Democracy : " One bubble after another "
As a privately owned organization the Federal Reserve cannot be expected to operate in the public interest .
The Fed ’s views on policy are primarily shaped by elite opinion which favors a small group of power brokers at the top of the economic food - chain .
The Fed ’s power to manipulate interest rates and increase the money supply , allows it to engage in “ social engineering ” which merely reinforces its own class interests .
This , in fact , is what Jefferson intimated when he warned that if “ private banks ” were allowed to control the issuance of currency , than they would inevitably “ deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . ”
That shift in wealth is underway even as we speak .
These massive equities bubbles , ( stock market and housing ) which have had such a devastating effect on working class people are the predictable result of a class - based orthodoxy .
They inevitably widen the chasm between rich and poor and strengthen the power of the ruling elite .
It is crazy to think that they are merely “ accidental ” .
The upcoming recession is the direct result of policies which originated at the Federal Reserve and which were intended to create a crisis .
It is a clear attempt to change American society on a structural level by exacerbating the divisions in wealth .
The expansion of debt invariably strengthens private ownership and enhances corporate profits .
It also weakens democratic institutions and national sovereignty .
Democracy cannot long endure where the money supply and interest rates are controlled by privately owned banks .
Their behavior is guided by self interest and profit and is hostile to liberty and the equitable distribution of wealth .
The policies of the Federal Reserve are transforming the country in a way that will eventually make democracy in America unworkable .
We are becoming a de facto aristocracy and will continue along that path until the “ issuing power of currency is taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properly belongs . ”
The Federal Reserve System was established by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913 .
Wilson bitterly regretted his foolishness from the very onset and said in his book “ The New Freedom ” : “ I am a most unhappy man .
I have unwittingly ruined my country .
A great industrial country is controlled by its system of credit .
Our system of credit is concentrated .
The growth of the nation , therefore , and all of our activities are in the hands of a few men .
We have come to be the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world .
No longer a government of free opinion , no longer a government of conviction and the vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and the duress of a small group of dominant men . ”
As millions of people lose their homes and life savings from the crashing of Greenspan ’s Housing Bubble , we should reconsider Wilson ’s words and make a concerted effort to dump the Federal Reserve .

A blood test could be used to detect dangerous hidden belly fat , – even if it is buried so deep within the abdomen that a person outwardly appears lean .
Scientists say new research indicates that a diagnostic test could be developed to help identify these individuals , who have a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes .
For most people , a simple tape measure can indicate if they are winning the battle of the bulge .
But while doctors acknowledge that waist circumference generally correlates with fitness , some seek more sophisticated methods of assessing patients ’ health .
“ Waist circumference correlates to some extent , but it ’s really a crude measure , ” explains Barbara Kahn at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , Massachusetts , US .
Kahn notes that people who look healthy sometimes have hidden fat surrounding their abdominal organs :
“ It ’s especially possible in certain groups , such as Asians . ”
And she stresses that such intra-abdominal fat is closely linked to a host of cardiovascular illnesses .

Costly scans
It is possible , but not easy , to get a detailed picture of much abdominal fat you have .
Computed tomography ( CT ) , a body - imaging technique that uses X - ray technology , can provide a stomach scan revealing the quantity and distribution of fat around the organs .
Kahn believes that a blood test could serve as a suitable substitute for this cumbersome method of body fat imaging .
“ It ’s very costly to get people in for a CT scan , whereas you could possibly get a blood test done at a screening desk in a shopping centre , ” she says .
Her team recruited 196 volunteers to compare blood protein levels in people with various amounts of abdominal fat .
Sixty - six of the subjects in the trial were classified as lean , which according to World Health Organization standards means they had a body - mass index ( BMI ) of 25 or less .
The remaining 130 subjects had a BMI above 30 , meaning they were clinically obese .
The participants gave blood samples and also underwent CT scanning , which helped researchers calculate how much fat each subject had within their abdominal area and under the skin .
Kahn and her colleagues noticed that blood levels of a molecule called “ retinol - binding ” protein ( RBP4 ) correlated with the amount of belly fat .
Lean test possible
Obese subjects without diabetes whose fat was mostly distributed throughout the abdominal cavity had an average of 75 micrograms of RBP4 per millilitre of blood .
By contrast , obese individuals with a preponderance of subcutaneous fat ( below the skin ) had significantly less , with 50 micrograms per millilitre .
Lean subjects had only about 25 micrograms of RBP4 per millilitre of blood .
This study did not identify lean people with risky levels of hidden fat , but the researchers now believe they can develop a cheap and accurate test based on RBP4 levels to do this .
Previous research has linked RBP4 to a higher risk of pre-diabetes .
The protein is known to bind to vitamin A , but exactly how it plays a role in obesity and diabetes remains unclear .

This week a Wall Street Journal article entitled PowerPoint Turns 20 , As Its Creators Ponder A Dark Side to Success is getting a bit of attention .
The article has a few good comments from the two creators of PowerPoint , Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin , who produced PowerPoint 1.0 in 1987 and then sold it later that year to Microsoft ( and oy vey !
the world has n’t been the same since ) .
Do n’t blame Microsoft
We all agree that the majority of presentations given with PowerPoint “ suck rotten eggs ” as Seth Godin says in his e-book .
But this is largely so because people do not know ( or do n’t care about ) the difference between a well - written document and well - designed supporting visuals .
PowerPoint users usually shoot for the middle and create a slideument , a “ document ” that would make your third - grade English teacher apoplectic with disgust and shame that you ever attended her class , and draw scowls of disapproval from anyone who makes a living as a designer or visual communicator .
PowerPoint is not the cause of bad business presentations , but laziness and poor writing skills may be .
The point is not to place more text within tiny slides intended for images and visual displays of data .
The point is to first ( usually ) create a well - written , detailed document .
Do business people still know how to write ?
“ A lot of people in business have given up writing the documents .
They just write the presentations , which are summaries without the detail , without the backup .
A lot of people do n't like the intellectual rigor of actually doing the work . " — Robert Gaskins in an interview with the Wall Street Journal
Visual literacy and design literacy have never been more important , and these subjects should be taught in schools .
However , this does not mean that the ability to write well is any less important than it used to be , in fact good writing skills are also more important than ever .
The future may belong to the designers , but it will also belong to those who can write insanely well .
Sadly , I ’m afraid that solid writing skills will become increasingly rare .
Can reading and writing make you a better speaker ?
I became a better speaker and presenter after college in part because I majored in Philosophy , a degree that required loads and loads of reading , writing , and arguing … daily .
All this reading and writing , oddly enough , made me a more articulate speaker as I learned better how to think critically , listen to opposing views , and spell out my ideas or position clearly and succinctly .
I ’m not against young children using PowerPoint in schools , but I hope the presentations they are making are verbal reports which are coming at the end of rigorous research and well - reasoned , detailed written reports .
I fear that the “ PowerPoint presentations ” are often a replacement for written papers rather than an extension or augmentation of the research and written work .
“ Now grade - school children turn in book reports via PowerPoint .
[ The PowerPoint inventors ] call that an abomination .
Children , they emphatically agree , need to think and write in complete paragraphs . ”
— Lee Gomes , Wall Street Journal article on PowerPoint
Adults do silly things with PowerPoint too
We ca n’t blame the kids for making really bad PowerPoint .
They learn bad habits from us .
It ’s all around them , and they do n’t have to look far .
Even ( especially ? ) prominent U.S. politicians can produce some really bad PowerPoint .
Leave it to a U.S. politician , then , to this week proudly display a PowerPoint deck that exemplifies everything that ’s wrong with the way PowerPoint is used today .
It 's odd that anyone can look at these slides by Mitt Romney and then label the creator of such obfuscation and bad design as “ Multimedia Mitt ” .
( Is the PowerPoint bar really set that low ? )
No words are necessary from me .

the momenternity that never started & never really ended - although my relationship with the partner who granted it to me did .
that all does not matter now , the mundanities - inanities - insanities that diverged our two paths .
i found a better path & a better someone to walk it with .
and that soul and i are deeply meshed , and we have taken some fine trips .
but i digress ... we must speak of a fascinating combination of 3 three letter words ...
in 1986 , acid and psychedelia in general were my life 's central joy .
it was halloween of 1986 , and i was about to do something i had not ever heard about anyone experiencing , and to this day , i have still not ever heard of anyone having done this besides myself .
i was going to engage in an act of sexual intercourse while on acid and at the peak moment i was going to take a very large lungful of DMT .
when night fell everything looked to be in order .
i was globulating on my usual lysergica for three - or - so hours prior at the house in Oakland belonging to my ex-boyfriend , J. and a close female friend K. who had also been involved in some sex things with me and a few other people for a short while lived there as well .
we all frequently took acid and mushrooms together as we were psychedelically compatible .
things were working well ... i was sitting with K for about an hour beforehand and mostly what we did was laughing and hallucinating silly pee- wee 's playhouse - type things .
so it was decided that the evening would go on as planned .....
as the time grew close to visit the nth level ... i got so keyed up and excited that i thought the adrenaline was going to cause my innards to be tickled so much i would not be able to ingest the dimethyltryptamine properly .
it takes skill to smoke DMT right .
you really have to breathe at just the right rate and hold the stuff in .as long as possible .
part of you really instinctively wants to not do this because of the chemical - lab taste of the stuff .
i think part of it is also that it is such an almost - exact analogue of your neurotransmission fluid that your real neurotransmitters get jealous . :-)
i remember earlier that day , i had been reading ' the bachman books ' by stephen king under a pseudonym he once used ... the story called ' the long walk ' was in my head ... a terribly chilling tale , that ... it gave me a tincture of death - fear , but i shrugged this off as being entirely appropriate considering it was the eve of all saint 's day ... the day of the dead .
i had the image in my mind , relating to the story , an image of being the finalist in a great contest after which everyone else had already passed away to their next - worlds ... and i was about to pass onto mine .
J. and i got into bed & turned all the lights off ... except for the blacklite ... and a single black candle .
the music we put on the stereo was throbbing gristle , the album called _third & final report_ i was a dedicated industrial music officionado ... a daughter of chaos , a grim little apocalypse / epoch - collapse girl .
everything was very solemn , our happiness wore the blackmask of flat affect .
some understand this sort of thing , some do n't .... i have had people wonder how in hell i could even consider taking acid and tripping to such chaos - inducing harsh noise as throbbing gristle .
i just shrugged at them and smiled .
it was just something i did .
something i would do again ... many times .
i still do sometimes even now , though as much as it discomfits me at times to know this , in my old age i have mellowed .
( shiver )
well , we were peaking on the acid and getting really into it .
we started to move our slithery limbs glittery - trailingly over each other 's bodies .
i was aware of the grid - lines of orgone energy we were emanating ... they were deep purple , which was good .
when we are unwell or depressed the purple fades to greyed - outedness ... when we are alarmed they flare red with that scary - for - real fight / flight stuff .
he entered me and we fucked on acid for a few hundred centuries ... which is always extremely good for me , in and of itself .
i saw images of great power and control which is a common thing for me , a theme that frequently repeats ... as i found these things to be very sexy and arousing ... and i was really getting off on my hallucinations of machines and missiles and phallocentric tools of doom .
this probably sounds sick and twisted , but you have to keep in mind that it was the mid-eighties , and we lived in a subculture of this time - and that this kind of thing was very ' hip ' in that particular culture matrix .
it symbolized a sort of resignation , an acceptance of what we'd all once believed was impending near - to - come nuclear war death by merging apocalyptic ambience with orgasmicity .
i do n't get off on pain or seeing people get hurt , or get into using power for coercion , or anything like that .
i always did believe real power was persuasion - that leads to true mind control and it can be used for good or evil or just for it 's own sake .
i mostly got off on the latter sort of moral alignment : i was , and am - a chaotic neutral , you might say .
on the level i was experiencing all this imagery , it was metaphorical in nature .
essentially i was getting off on the concept of power , control , and how it goes up against chaos , and chaos goes up against control .
i now consider these things to be akin to gods : the highest recognizable forces in the multiverse .
as the tape reached side two it was ... time for the experiment .
i felt flushed with anticipation .
i had done about 5 DMT trips by this time so i was plenty in the know about how to deal with its intensities .
my partner also knew what to expect from me after doing it several times himself .
i took the glass blown pipe , fitted with VERY thin screens , which he held , while being inside of me in the missionary position .
i have always found most favourable position for sex , with me underneath the male , as in this configuration , gravity is doing the most advantageous things for me . :-)
i inhaled deeply .
i closed my lips and
held my breathhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

that sound !
i am not hearing it i AM it .
??? sound ???
not EVEN as this is ' ear - unheard - by - brain - sound ' heard by pre-nerve connecting to ear , that hears by funneling sounds into this nerve and from this nerve into BLACK HOLE of the brainpan .
i am impossible geometry being schlanged by impossible geometry .
i am the hypercube - 4D - tesseract being fucked by a klein bottle inside of a sideways figure eight i am ZERO divided by infinity i am INFINITY multiplied by zero then it ended and i was ---
- ] ] ] snapped [ [ [ -
suddenly back into regular acid - space -
which - though this is something i still find hard to believe -
felt like mundanity (!!!)
try to imagine what it would take to cause that !
and i could hear ( with regular ears , now ) the last song on the album was playing and genesis p. orridge was singing :
'is that blood ... blood on the floor ...? is that blood ... blood on the floor ...? is that blood ... blood on the floor ...?'
i lay on the floor feeling my body and all its fluids returning to me - or me to it
J. told me that when it started i had dropped totally out of consciousness and it was like fucking a corpse - of course he knew that was n't what was going on .
but still .
despite it being halloween and despite our proclivities for that ' sicko ' noise - music , it sort of did n't seem like he had a very good experience .
this was my experiment though .
we thought of trying it with him doing the DMT but it would n't have worked .
he'd not be able to sustain an erection .
tough luck , boys .
this is one for the girls to do ..... unless you like or do n't mind being a backdoor man : to put it bluntly , that 's the only way it could work .
you have to be on the receiving end because you 're just not at all inside your body while this is happening .
the great experiment of 1986 was a success .
for years afterward though , i became o b s e s s e d c o m p l e t e l y with this experience .
i could write or paint nothing without it as the subject matter .
true power is my greatest turn - on - there is nothing - NOTHING - more erotic to me than the twistyturvy warfucklove between CHAOS and CONTROL
i got closer to it than i ever got in my life with the LSD / DMT / SEX thing .
like i pointed out , i have never ever heard of anyone else taking this combination and doing this particular thing while doing it .
i find it strange to be the only one ( in my knowledge ) who 's ever gotten that far , and been that high up / out .
some day maybe i would like to do it again , but with my current lover , who i have much better physical and mental rapport with .
that very rapport has caused me to finally let this heavy psychedelic thing become a wonderful memory and not an obsession , though .
i mean , given the chance i would do it again , but he 's just so on - turned i do n't need the acid to get off with him .
it 's like he is a hallucination .
five years i have been living and loving with him and sometimes i still wonder how he could be real .
he certainly improved the real world for me .
there 's not much in it i find interesting other than him and the internet and digital art .
i never thought that i'd go years without tripping and not care that much and it's all because of him .
maybe the experiment was just an experiment , a story to tell .
weird thing , my relationship with j. pretty much began to collapse in 1987 .
i do n't know if it hasd anything to do with the lsdmt but it put a kind of pall on the memory .
maybe i had just gone so far some part of me was under the illusion that there was no where else to go with that individual .
that 's a retrospective thought though , i did n't think this at the time .
there were other unrelated problems probably more important to the collapse .
it was , as i said , all for the better .
J. is still a friend and i will never forget halloween night 1986 .

Another Day , Another 17,000 Lies By Condoleezza Rice
Here 's just one from her interview today on NPR :
The United States was very involved in encouraging the Palestinians to move to democracy and to have free and fair elections , which brought to power Mahmoud Abbas .... the Palestinians have elected a man in Mahmoud Abbas and a prime minister , now , in Salam Fayad ...
Abbas was elected , but Fayad , of course , was not .
He was appointed by Abbas , which Abbas had the right to do when declaring a state of emergency under Article 101 of the Palestinian Basic Law .
But any state of emergency could not exceed thirty days without the approval of the Palestinian parliament , where Hamas holds a majority .
Wonderfully enough , those thirty days are over today , making Fayad 's appointment illegal at exactly the moment Rice was lying about him being elected .

Thanks for visiting !
This review was written several weeks ago , but I shelved it for fear of making anyone cranky .
Things have changed .
The Law of Attraction cultists are out in force , and they 're gunking up my site with comment spam .
Now I 'm having my say — I 'm fighting back .
The Secret is a best - selling motivational book ( and DVD ) published last fall .
I did n't hear about it for a long time because I live in an intentional media vacuum .
After a couple people recommended it , I read it .
Twice .
Not because I liked it , but because I can't believe that people still fall for this crap .
What is the “ Secret ” of The Secret ?
The “ secret ” is the Law of Attraction , which is not actually a law of anything .
The Law of Attraction states that your life is a result of the things you think about .
From a psychological perspective , this notion has some merit , and if the book explored the existing literature and research on the subject , I might not be writing this review .
But the book does nothing of the sort .
The Secret offers no evidence of any kind : no scientific discussion , no experimentation , but only scattered cherry - picked anecdotes .
It 's the worst kind of pseudo - scientific baloney .
Die - hard believers , such as Rhonda Byrne , the book 's author , have elevated the Law of Attraction to a whole new metaphysical realm .
They 've stretched valid psychological ideas to cover everything in life , and it just does n't make sense .
Here 's how Byrne claims the Law of Attraction works :
Thoughts are magnetic , and thoughts have a frequency .
As you think , those thoughts are sent out into the Universe , and they magnetically attract all like things that are on the same frequency .
Everything sent out returns to its source .
And that source is You . [ … ]
Asking the Universe for what you want is your opportunity to get clear about what you want .
As you get clear in your mind , you have asked .
Believing involves acting , speaking , and thinking as though you have already received what you 've asked for .
When you emit the frequency of having received it , the law of attraction moves people , events , and circumstances for you to receive .
Receiving involves feeling the way you will feel once your desire has manifested .
Feeling good now puts you on the frequency of what you want .
To lose weight , do n't focus on “ losing weight ” .
Instead , focus on your perfect weight .
Feel the feelings of your perfect weight , and you will summon it to you .
It takes no time for the Universe to manifest what you want .
It is as easy to manifest one dollar as it is to manifest one million dollars .
Do n't worry if that did n't make sense .
It does n't make any more sense in book form .
The Secret to Money
In each chapter , Byrne and her team of “ experts ” offer advice on how to apply the secret to some aspect of life .
For example , in “ The Secret to Health ” , we learn that germ theory is bunk :
You cannot “ catch ” anything unless you think you can , and thinking you can is inviting it to you with your thought .
You are also inviting illness if you are listening to people talk about their illnesses .
Do n't worry about the avian flu .
If you do n't think it can affect you , you 're safe !
I 'm sure medical researchers are taking notes .
Since this is a personal finance blog , let 's look at the book 's advice about money :
To attract money , focus on wealth .
It is impossible to bring more money into your life when you focus on the lack of it .
It is helpful to use your imagination and make - believe you already have the money you want .
Play games of having wealth and you will feel better about money ; as you feel better about it , more will flow into your life .
Feeling happy now is the fastest way to bring money into your life .
Make it your intention to look at everything you like and say to yourself , “ I can afford that .
I can buy that . ”
You will shift your thinking and begin to feel better about money .
better about money .
Give money in order to bring more of it into your life .
When you are generous with money and feel good about sharing it , you are saying , “ I have plenty . ”
Visualize checks in the mail .
Tip the balance of your thoughts to wealth .
Think wealth .
There you have it .
Those are the secrets to money .
You do not have to avoid debt .
You do not have to spend less than you earn .
You do not have to be frugal , or obtain a college degree , or start a Roth IRA .
All you have to do is “ think wealth ” .
The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts .
Every negative thought , feeling , or emotion is blocking your good from coming to you , and that includes money .
It is not that the money is being kept from you by the Universe , because all the money you require exists right now in the invisible .
This kind of crap is dangerous .
It 's get - rich - quick drivel of the worst sort .
It does n't help people address their money issues .
It puts them into a pattern of wishful thinking .
Just as the “ Think Method ” could not turn Harold Hill 's music students into virtuosos , this advice will not help you achieve prosperity .
These may be useful exercises to change your mindset about money , but they 're not going to make you rich .
It can be comforting to embrace ideas like these .
I know .
When I was at financial rock - bottom a decade ago , books like this brought me solace .
But they also led me to more debt .
Wealth requires more than just thought — it requires action .
And not the sort advocated by David Schirmer in The Secret :
I thought , “ What if I just visualized checks coming in the mail ? ”
So I just visualized a bunch of checks coming in the mail .
Within just one month , things started to change .
It is amazing ; today I just get checks in the mail .
I get a few bills , but I get more checks than bills .
Visualizing checks in the mail will not make them magically appear .
When I say “ money is more about mind than it is about math “ , this is not what I mean .
I 'm talking about mental toughness , about self - discipline , about changing beliefs and thought patterns .
I 'm not talking about “ manifesting ” checks in your mailbox .
You Are What You Think
The Secret is a motivational book .
It can inspire you to set goals , and to visualize the life you 'd like to lead .
A lot of its techniques are time - tested psychological tricks to help keep you motivated .
I like this .
The book loses me , though , when it claims that the Law of Attraction is a “ universal law ” such as the law of gravity .
The Secret attempts to combine Christianity ( Jesus followed the Law of Attraction , do n't you know ? ) , quantum physics , and more in an effort to convince readers that our minds are some sort of universal force governed by frequencies and wavelengths and so on .
This is bullshit of the highest order , and it makes me angry .
To quote Han Solo , “ There 's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny . ”
What 's more , its proponents want you to believe that everything that happens on the Earth ( and in the rest of the universe ) is a result of the Law of Attraction .
This sort of absolutism is absurd .
Everything that happens to us is a result of our thinking ?
Do tell .
Six million Jews ?
Tsunami victims ?
What , they 're all collectively wishing the ocean would wash them away ?
Here 's how Byrne rationalizes tragedy :
Often [ people ] recall events in history where masses of lives were lost , and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event .
By the law of attraction , they had to be on the same frequency as the event .
It does n't necessarily mean they thought of that exact event , but the frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event .
If people believe they can be in the wrong place at the wrong time , and they have no control over outside circumstances , those thoughts of fear , separation , and powerlessness , if persistent , can attract them to being in the wrong place at the wrong time .
If you can buy into a philosophy that says six million Jews were killed because on some level they willed it , The Secret may be for you .
If you are attracted to a mindset that says thousands of people can summon a tsunami to destroy themseleves , The Secret may be for you .
If you think that 32 people at Virginia Tech somehow willed their deaths with thought vibrations , then The Secret may be for you .
The Secret is not for me .
The Law of Attraction in action ?
Other Complaints
Byrne does n't offer a single piece of evidence to support her claims .
She and her experts provide anecdotal accounts of The Law of Attraction at work , but these accounts are meaningless .
Some can be explained by coincidence .
Others are a result of the real psychological effects of believing in yourself and maintaining a ready mind .
None of them have anything to do with your thoughts “ manifesting ” themselves to the Universe .
It also bugs me when Byrne tries to imply that great thinkers throughout history were believers in The Law of Attraction .
( She cites Einstein over and over in an attempt to bolster her credibility through association . )
These thinkers may indeed have believed in the importance of goals , positive thinking , and mental toughness , but most of them — especially the scientists — would probably disapprove of being associated with this pseudo - scientific nonsense .
Do n't get me wrong : the psychological ideas at the heart of The Secret are excellent .
There is true power in positive thinking .
Believing in yourself is a great way to to develop confidence .
But The Secret promises too much ; it goes too far in declaring that the Universe will grant all of your desires if you simply wish hard enough .
Have n't we outgrown that ?
Go ahead and follow Byrne 's general advice .
But back up your goals and your visualizations with action and hard work .
Make your dreams come true — do n't just dream them .

Here are some other articles critical of The Secret and the Law of Attraction .
The first twenty minutes of the film version of The Secret are available on YouTube .
I would embed the video here , but the copyright holders have added some extra verbiage to their post .
I do n't think this actually negates the YouTube terms of service , but I 'm not going to take a chance .
I do feel safe republishing the following “ visualization tools ” .
The first one , “ The Secret to You ” is good .
I like it .
It 's filled with uplifting affirmations , and I think it would be an excellent thing to watch every day :
“ The Secret to Riches ” visualization tool , on the other hand , is plain silly :
I 'd love to hear your comments if you read and enjoyed the The Secret .
Convince me that I 'm wrong .
Convince me that there 's something to the Law of Attraction .

平川くんの『株式会社という病』（ＮＴＴ出版）のゲラが届いたので、東京へ向かう新幹線の車中で読み始める。
平川くんはブログ日記で、この本を書くのにずいぶん苦労したと書いていた。
彼が 「苦労する」というのはどういうことだろう。
言いたいことをはやばやと書ききってしまったので、残りの紙数を埋めるのに苦労するということは学生のレポートのような場合にはよくあることである。
だが、平川くんのような書き手の場合に「書くネタが尽きる」ということはありえない。
ということは、彼がこの本で「手馴れた道具」では論じることの困難な種類の主題を扱っているということである。
平川くんをして困惑せしめる主題とは何であろう。
一読して、その困惑が少しだけわかったような気がしたので、そのことについて書きたい。
彼は久が原の町工場の長男として育った。
その少年時代の親たちの働きぶりや、彼のまわりにいた工員たちの姿を活写するときの彼の筆致はのびやかで、ほとんどパセティックでさえある。
例えばこんなふうだ 。
「 当時、わが零細工場労働者たちは、自らの賃金を大企業のそれと比較して、羨訴の感情に訴えるということはあまりなかったように思う。妙な言い方かも知れないが、ここには『安定した格差』があった。
かれらにとってあちらはあちらであった。こちらの世界（＝零細企業）はあちらの世界（＝大企業）は、別の原理で働いており、それらを繋ぐようなものは何処にも見出すことはできなかった。
町工場の工員たちは、働き場所を中心とした半径１キロメートルの世界の中で、家計を営み、映画を見、パチンコをして遊んでいたように見える。この頃、わが家の近隣の町工場には、何故かどこにも卓球台があった。工員たちは暇さえあればよく、ピンポンをして歓声を上げていた。確かに、生活は貧しいが、則を越えずといった安定的な貧しさの中に、多くのひとたちが安住していたのである。
もちろん、これを今風に、因習的な旧弊だとか、格差の固定化などと批判することはできる。しかし、当時の零細企業の経営者や労働者たちが、奴隷のような負け犬根性で、隷属意識から抜け出せなかったなどと言って批判するとすれば、それはまったく的外れな批判になるだろう。かれらは、今日のような自己実現の夢を育もうとはしなかったかもしれないし、格差社会を意識するといったことはなかったかもしれないが、それ以上に、かれらの世界には安定した倫理観と、生活上の慰安があったというべきだろう。」（７５－７６頁）
よい文章である 。
平川君が 「平川精密」の人々を回顧的に描くときの文章がぼくは好きだ。
「 労働者」というのはヒラカワ少年にとって概念ではなく、実際にその体温と手触りと歓声を含んで身体化されたものだからである。
いまの日本の書き手の中で 「零細企業の工場労働者のエートス」について、実感の裏づけのある文章を書ける人はほとんどいないだろう。
けれども、彼の文章が「いい文章」であるのは、単に彼が自分の書いている対象を熟知しているからだけではない。
彼 が１９５０年代の大田区の町工場の経営者や労働者の風貌を描くときの筆づかいは「ややパセティック」になる。
それは、彼が少年時代においてすでに「社長の坊ちゃん」として、高等教育を受けて、この圏域から脱出することを期待され、義務づけられていからだとぼくは思う。
十歳のヒラカワ少年は彼が愛するその町工場を後にして、「あちらの世界」に進まねばならないことをもう感じ取っていた。
彼が工場のグラインダーや裁断機を使って遊ぶことを好んだのは、やがてそれを扱うことが彼自身の職業になるだろうと思っていたからではなく、それとは無縁の世界にいずれ押し出されてゆくだろうということを予感していたからである。
町工場から出て行き 「あちらの世界」に参入することは、彼の選択ではなく、「彼らの希望」であったから、それに「ノー」ということは考えられないことだった。
それが彼が「下町」や零細企業労働者や、総じて『芝浜』的なるものを記述するときに、決して平板で浮薄な「貧乏自慢」に堕すことのない理由であるとぼくは思う。
彼は心のどこかであの労働者たちを「安定した格差」の中に取り残して「国際派ビジネスマン」になってしまった自分自身に「疚しさ」を感じている。
もちろん、彼は少しも 「 疚しいこと」などしてはいない。
けれども 、「疚しさ」を感じることは止められない。
だから、この本で彼はグローバリズムの時代の経営者の視野狭窄を論難し、「未来はバラ色」的なビジネス進化論を一蹴するけれど、「逝きし日の労働者の生活倫理へ還れ」というような対案を提示することはしない。
そんなことは彼にはできない。
問題はもっと複雑なのだ。
ぼく自身はパートナーとして零細企業経営者としての平川君を身近に見る機会に恵まれていたので、彼の経営者としての野心を知っている。
それは 「町工場のおやじ」的なスタンスがどれほどビジネスシーンで有効であるかを、文字通り身体を張って論証しようとしていたことにある。
ぼくたちの作った会社には間違いなく濃密に「町工場」的雰囲気が漂っていた。
ぼくたち は 「精度の高い廉価な商品」をてきぱきと提供することで大企業のシステムの末端にビルトインされていたけれど、生活上の慰安は売り上げの増加や賃金の上昇以外のところにあった。
ぼくたちは革ジャンにバイクで商品のデリバリーにでかけ、終業後には連れ立って映画やコンサートに行き、休日には多摩川で野球をしたり、ツーリングに行ったり、麻雀をした。
会社というのは、休み時間に人々が「ピンポンで歓声を上げる」ような場所でなければならない、というのがヒラカワ社長の変わることのない信念であった。
けれども 、「町工場」的エートスは会社がある程度の規模になり、ある程度の売り上げに達すると、いつのまにか消えた。
一流大学を出て、一流のキャリアをもつ人々が入ってきて、てきぱきと仕事を片付けて、売り上げを立てて、シビアな人事考課をしているうちに会社は誰も「歓声」を上げない場所になった。
それはぼくも見てきたからよく知っている。
平川君は自分の作った会社が「歓声の上がらない場所」になると、急速に「やる気」をなくして、新しい会社を興して、そこに「理想の町工場」を実現しようとして・・・ということをこれまでに何度か繰り返してきた。
それは 「何度か繰り返した」という歴史的事実が示すように、成功することの困難な企てであった。
この本を書くことに彼が困難を感じたのは、そのせいだろうとぼくは思う。
彼は 「平川精密的なもの」が国際的なスケールのビジネスにおいても汎通的に実現可能であることをこれまでも望んできたし、たぶんこれからもそれは変わらないだろう。
それがどれほどむずかしいことか彼はもちろん熟知している。
ぼくがこの本には 「パセティック」なところがある、と書いたのはそういう意味である。

Creating Smoke In Photoshop From Scratch
Using Photoshop and a specific technique , it ’s rather easy to create something that looks like smoke or fog — from scratch .
It ’s not as good as actual smoke photographed on a black background , but it ’s much easier to come by .
Here ’s the trick …
Doodle
Draw a doodle .
Preferrably keep the doodle in its own layer with a black background beneath .
Distort
Use the Liquify tool to distort the doodle .
Liquify resides in the Filter > Liquify ... menu .
Using the various “ forward warp ” , “ twirl ” and “ pucker ” tools residing in the menu to the left , you distort the doodle as if you were fingerpainting .
Once you ’ve applied the liquify transformation , select Edit > Fade Liquify ... .
In the dialog box that appears , set the opacity to 50 % and apply .
Repeat
Now repeat the process until you ’re satisfied :
Liquify Fade Liquify to 50 %

Ever since the dawn of technology , new ideas have spawned legal squabbles .
The history of such battles is as long as the history of the law itself ; no doubt there were arguments over who invented the wheel .
Back then such disputes were probably solved with fists , but things became more civilised a long time ago .
Even Johannes Gutenberg , inventor of movable type , faced the wrath of the courts after being accused by his partner , Johann Fust , of embezzling funds .
The case , heard in 1455 , left Gutenberg massively in debt - but it did n't stop his ideas changing the world .
Since then , we have become used to a constant roundabout of hi-tech legal wrangling .
Barely a month goes by without the threat of legal action against one tech giant or another .
The gigantic – and often monopolistic - nature of the telecommunications , computing and internet industries has meant that there is always somebody ready to take a shot in the courts ( and that there is often plenty of money to pay for an army of lawyers ) .
Of course , it 's always easy to get sidetracked by the legal battle that 's big news right now , despite the fact that few people will remember it in a year 's time .
The current case between the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and the people behind the ConnectU website is one example : it 's being hyped up because of a strange combination of the buzz around the social networking site and the appearance of the vaguely unsettling twin litigants Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss ( a pair of chisel - jawed American brat packers and budding Olympic rowers ) .
There are plenty more cases that did n't make our list .
Apple 's recent attempts to unmask bloggers ' sources ; the imprisonment of any number of political dissidents for views expressed on the internet ; the ongoing saga of the alleged Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon , who is fighting extradition to the US .
All of these are important in their own way .
But although viewing the legal process through a long lens is difficult , it is hard to deny that the arrival of the PC and the internet has thrown up a series of new challenges to technology , software and media companies – and to society in general .
The net features heavily in our list of the most important cases in tech history , as it has brought a slew of system - changing decisions to the forefront and is likely to continue in such a vein .
So our list is unashamedly weighted towards recent years , and as such is far from comprehensive – but it's a start .
Greatest legal battles in technology

Bell v Western Union
Marconi and the invention of radio
Apple v Franklin
The Betamax case

I 've always said that you need to keep it on the table , and you need to look at these things , because now people are dying because of this administration .
That 's the truth .
And they wo n't change course .
They are ignoring the Congress .
They keep signing these signing statements which mean that he 's decided not to enforce the law .
This is as close as we 've ever come to a dictatorship .
When you have a situation where Congress is stepped on , that means the American people are stepped on .
So I do n't think you can take anything off the table .
Because in fact the Constitution does n't permit us to take these things off the table ...( trancscript below the fold ) read on
BOXER : Yeah .
I mean , you left out a bunch of things -- spying on citizens without a warrant , going around FISA , on and on .
Look , I have always said it should be on the table .
Ed , I 've always said it .
I was on a book tour and I ran into John Dean of Watergate fame .
He was on the book tour that I was on , for his book .
And it was right after we discovered that the administration was spying on our people without a warrant .
And he just said , he looked at me and basically just said , as far as he could see , unless there was some explanation for this , this was impeachable .
SCHULTZ : They 're throwing down the gauntlet .
They 're just declaring that they 're not going to change anything -- the President in Cleveland yesterday saying , we 're just getting started .
So in the meantime , the frustration of the American people continues to build , and I have to tell you Senator , I 'm not trying to rope you into a conversation one way or another or where you 're at on this , but I want to say this for our listeners : they want impeachment put back on the table .
They want impeachment on the table as a bargaining chip .
Because for instance , Scooter Libby , commuting the sentence , what happened today with Sarah Taylor saying she 'd been instructed by the president not to say anything , Alberto Gonzales , the story today about how he was briefed over the Patriot Act and then lied a week later in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
I mean , when is enough is enough ?
BOXER : Yeah .
I mean , you left out a bunch of things -- spying on citizens without a warrant , going around FISA , on and on .
Look , I have always said it should be on the table .
Ed , I 've always said it .
I was on a book tour and I ran into John Dean of Watergate fame .
He was on the book tour that I was on , for his book .
And it was right after we discovered that the administration was spying on our people without a warrant .
And he just said , he looked at me and basically just said , as far as he could see , unless there was some explanation for this , this was impeachable .
I 've always said that you need to keep it on the table , and you need to look at these things , because now people are dying because of this administration .
That 's the truth .
And they wo n't change course .
They are ignoring the Congress .
They keep signing these signing statements which mean that he 's decided not to enforce the law .
This is as close as we 've ever come to a dictatorship .
When you have a situation where Congress is stepped on , that means the American people are stepped on .
So I do n't think you can take anything off the table .
Because in fact the Constitution does n't permit us to take these things off the table .
SCHULTZ : Would you counsel Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to put it on the table and make a statement before everybody goes home in August .
Because they 're going to get an earful from the American people when they go home .
BOXER : Well , I do n't presume to tell people what to do .
I have made my statements .
And of course if asked I will say .
I 've been out there , I 'm out here again today .
I think , John Conyers is -- this is where impeachment starts .
When Alberto Gonzales , when it came out that he fired these U.S. attorneys , that it was politics being played with it , I thought then that we should look into impeachment hearings .
So I do n't think it should be taken off the table .
On the other hand , we 've got a war to end .
We 've got things that we 've got to keep on doing .
So if we do this right , we should give it to the appropriate committees , let them do the hard work that it entails , but we have to do something about health insurance .
We have to do something about global warming .
We have to end this war .
We have to do something about education .
And all these other things .
About the budget deficit .
You have to walk and chew gum at the same .
And I know Nancy 's point was , we have to reverse about seven years of this horrific administration 's policies , and she 's fearful of losing steam on that , in that regard .

Most commuters to Area 51 travel on unmarked Boeing 737s or 727s .
Planes depart from a terminal at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas .
Defense contractor EG&G owns the terminal .
Each plane uses the word " Janet " followed by three digits as a call sign to the airport 's control tower .
The airspace above Area 51 is known as R - 4808N and is restricted to all commercial and military flights not originating from the base itself ( except the Janet commuters , of course ) .
Area 51 is believed to be part of either Edwards Air Force Base in California or the Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada , even though pilots from those bases are forbidden to fly in Area 51's airspace .
In fact , pilots who fly into one of the buffer zones surrounding R- 4808N reportedly face punishment from their commanders , though it 's fairly lenient .
Whenever a pilot flies through a buffer zone , the training exercise immediately ends and the pilot is ordered back to base .
Knowingly flying into R-4808N is a much more serious offense , and pilots can face a court martial , dishonorable discharge and time in prison as a result .

The military classifies Area 51 as a Military Operating Area ( MOA ) .
The borders of Area 51 are not fenced , but are marked with orange poles and warning signs .
The signs tell you that photography is n't allowed and that trespassing on the property will result in a fine .
The signs also warn that security is authorized to use deadly force on people who insist on trespassing .
Rumors circulate among conspiracy theorists over how many unfortunate truth seekers have died as a result of tromping around the grounds of Area 51 , though most believe that trespassers are dealt with in a much less violent manner .
Pairs of men who do n't appear to be in the military patrol the perimeter .
These guards are likely civilians hired from firms like Wackenhut or EG&G .
Observers call them " cammo dudes , " because they often wear desert camouflage .
The cammo dudes usually drive around in four - wheel - drive vehicles , keeping an eye on anyone near the borders of Area 51 .
Supposedly , their instructions are to avoid contact with intruders , if possible , and act merely as both an observer and deterrent .
If someone seems suspicious , the cammo dudes will call in the local sheriff to deal with him .
Once in a while , they have confronted trespassers , allegedly seizing any film or other recording devices and intimidating the trespassers .
Sometimes , helicopters provide additional support .
There are rumors that the helicopter pilots occasionally use illegal tactics like hovering very low over trespassers to harass them .
Other security measures include sensors planted around the perimeter of the base .
These sensors detect movement , and some believe they can even discern the difference between an animal and a human being .
Since Area 51 is effectively a wildlife preserve , it was important to create warning devices that could not easily be tripped by a passing animal .
One theory held by observers is that the sensors can detect the scent of the passing creature ( the sensors detect an ammonia signature ) .
While that has yet to be substantiated , it 's certain that there are buried sensors all around Area 51 .
One Rachel resident named Chuck Clark discovered several of the sensors , and at one point the FBI accused him of interfering with signal devices and ordered him to either return a missing sensor or pay a fine .
Clark denied taking one but agreed to stop his investigations [ source : Braverman ] .
In the next section , we 'll look at why all the secrecy and security measures are necessary as we examine some of the aircraft tested at Area 51 .
Left Behind Games has sunk more than $ 27 million and four years into the development and marketing of a game that has been critically panned by gamer blogs , who sneer at its bugginess and built - in spyware , and was boycotted by members of its target audience .
Although game sales have brought in some revenue , the stock has yet to earn a dime of profit , according to the latest quarterly report of Left Behind Games , filed on February 20 , 2007 .
And , according to the quarterly report , " As of December 31 , 2006 ... we had $ 698,763 ... of deferred salaries due to our officers . "
Moreover , in December 2006 and January 2007 , a corporate officer made two interest - free loans , totaling $ 23,000 , to help the enterprise with " working capital . "
And the road ahead looks even bumpier .
For example , the firm is obligated to pay Bible publisher Tyndale House , by March 31 , 2007 , a hefty $ 750,000 royalty payment for licensing the game , which is based on the best - selling and profoundly bigoted Left Behind novels co-authored by Southern Baptist minister Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins .
These concerns are summarized , in wonky accounting language , in the firm 's Going Concern statement , found on page 21 of its quarterly report :
As of the three months ended December 31 , 2006 , we have started to generate revenue , and through December 31 , 2006 have incurred net losses of $ 31,157,019 and had negative cash flows from operations of $ 6,383,394 since our inception through December 31 , 2006 .
Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon out ability to generate profitable operations in the future and / or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due .
We plan to continue to provide for our capital requirements by issuing additional equity .
No assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us .
We also cannot give assurance that we will achieve significant revenues in the future .
The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved , we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan or to generate positive operating results .
Our independent registered public accounting firm has previously indicated in its report included with the Form 10 - KSB filed in June 2006 that these matters , among others , raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern .
How have the mighty fallen ?
One thing 's for sure , spouts Left Behind Games CEO Troy Lyndon :
It was n't the fault of Talk to Action for breaking the story of the convert - or - die theology behind this videogame .
Mr. Lyndon has publicly proclaimed that the controversy has spurred sales of the game .
The controversy , Mr. Lyndon boasted to the Los Angeles Times , " has been great for the product . "
So , if Mr. Lyndon is to be believed , if it had n't been for the consumer boycott first called for by Talk to Action , and organized by CrossWalk America , the Beatitudes Society , Christian Alliance for Progress , The Center for Progressive Christianity , and Campaign to Defend the Constitution ( DefCon ) , then the company would have sold far fewer copies of its sole product .
Yet Mr. Lyndon has not expressed gratitude ( not a crumb ) to these bloggers and faith communities , to whom he claims to owe so much .
While Talk to Action was the first to call for a consumer boycott of the product -- not because of the level of violence , but because it makes a children 's game of hate literature -- no one has called for the game to be censored .
Rather , this blog and others , joined by both progressive and conservative faith communities , have asked consumers to reflect on whether they really want to buy a buggy , spyware - laden videogame that teaches mass killing in the name of Christ , and that also lets children switch sides and command the armies of the AntiChrist , unleashing demons that feast on the bones of conservative Christians .
( Wait : before you say , That sounds like fun ! , just know that the game is programmed so that the AntiChrist can never win . )
If Left Behind Games fails , it wo n't be because the stock price got blogged down .
It will be because they made a crappy , hate - filled product that managed to offend its two target audiences : Rapture - ready Moms and hardcore gamers .
As SapphireGrl wrote on RaptureReady.com , " " Where in the Word does it say to ' kill the infidels ' ?
Where are we told to kill anyone that wo n't convert ?
Jesus said to shake the dust from your feet , not to mow them down with automatic weapons ! "
And as Gameinatrix Cori wrote in a smash - mouth review by a gamer who had really wanted to like the game but found that it stank out loud : " Let 's just leave this behind us and never speak of it again . "
So it ’s come to this : a bill passed by the legislature and awaiting Governor Pawlenty ’s signature in Minnesota reads as follows :
[ 325E.65 ] SALE OF AMERICAN FLAGS .
No person may sell or offer for sale in this state an American flag or a novelty or other item containing a representation of the American flag unless the flag or item was manufactured in the United States of America .
That ’s right , in a few days , barring an unlikely veto , it will be illegal to sell a US flag in Minnesota unless it was made in America .
But wait … the bill does n’t limit itself to traditional cloth flags .
As worded , every “ item containing a representation of the American flag ” and sold in the state must be American - made .
Does this count for electronic items ?
Are n’t digital images “ representations ” ?
I think so !
How stupid .
I tell you what : let ’s test it out .
I got one of my Canadian friends to draw a picture of the American flag .
I will sell you the Canadian - manufactured representation ( digital image ) of an American flag for the low price of $ 1 .
What a bargain !
Daily Show : Rove subpoenaed after Leahy 's balls grow three sizes David Edwards and Adam Doster
Published : Tuesday July 31 , 2007
Print This Email This After issuing a subpoena of President George W. Bush 's Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove last Thursday , Jon Stewart thinks that Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy may have to buy some new pants .
The host of The Daily Show reminded viewers of the likely consequence of his action .
" Well in D.C. , they say Pat Leahys balls grew threes sizes that day , " he said , assuring the audience that " we have a machine that does that . "
White House Press Secretary Tony
Snow denied the need for such maneuvers , claiming the White House " actually made Karl Rove available to that committee under conditions where he is going to tell the truth . "
Stewart clarified exactly what those conditions were .
 The room must be pitch black and festooned with lilies and beeswax candles , " he said .
" It must be a full moon but not too full !
And his inquisitors must stand before him , naked , holding a bowl of Craisins , which are like raisins , but with cranberries .
And then , and only then , can the truth be heard !
"
Snow also shot back at the House Judiciary Committee for citing White House Aides Josh Bolton and Harriet Miers , both of whom refused to appear when they were subpoenaed for contempt of Congress .
" What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults , insinuations , inquisitions and investigations , " he said .
Stewart valiantly attempted to match Snow 's alliterative condescension , but had a difficult time .
" That s quite a quotient of quotidian , " he stammered .
" Why did I pick Q ?!?
Damn you Q ! "

REUTERS / Hamad I. Mohammed
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has told a German magazine that the United States has too many problems in Iraq to become involved in armed conflict with Iran .
Military action is sometimes discussed in Washington as an option in trying to derail what it sees as Iran ’s drive to develop nuclear weapons .
The United States “ is not in a position to get into a new military conflict ” , Mottaki was quoted as saying in an excerpt of an interview to be published in Focus magazine .
“ 170,000 American soldiers can guarantee neither their own safety nor the security of Iraq , ” he said .
The United States and its allies say Iran ’s nuclear fuel enrichment program is aimed at developing nuclear weapons .
Iran insists it is purely for peaceful power generation .
The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran for failing to stop enrichment , but Mottaki reiterated that Iran had no intention of curtailing the program .
Mottaki has dismissed the U.N. sanctions already imposed and said that tougher penalties would not change Iran ’s mind .
There was no mention of plans for further talks between Iran and the United States on Iraq .

There are many reasons to believe that housing is in a bubble in many countries , and that in the US , residential real - estate in certain markets peaked in late 2005 , and is now on the brink of a multi - year decline .
This is a vast subject , but to summarize the main reasons to think this is a bubble are :
1 ) Interest Rates were at 46 - year lows in 2002 - 04 , which reduces mortgage payments for a given house , but inflates home values .
This causes the ratio of home prices to salaries and home prices to rent to rise far above the trendline .
At the same time , when interest rates rise ( as they have since early 2005 ) , home prices fall a couple years later as payments for a given home price rise and buyers are forced to adjust downwards .
2 ) Speculation is rampant , because the low interest rates from 2002 - 04 caused price increases of 15 % a year to occur , and lead people to believe this is the normal trajectory of the trendline .
This has tempted people to buy additional homes for investment , and happily accept the fact that rent income is much less than the mortgage payment , under the expectation that equity gains will offset the negative monthly cash flow .
Now , the bubble of the last 3 - 4 years was due to low interest rates at the front of the yield curve , which is something that the Federal Reserve controls , and which has given rise to new types of adjustable - rate mortgages that are advantageous only when short - term rates are very low .
The rise of the Fed Funds Rate back to moderate levels guarantees a correction of the recent bubble , and is easily predictable .
However , there is another unrepeatable phenomenon residing beneath the first bubble , at the other end of the yield curve - the decline in long - term rates over the last 25 years .
The yield of the 10 - year bond , which somewhat corelates to 30 - year mortgage rates , peaked in the early 1980s and bottomed out in 2003 .
This long downward drift in mortgage rates generated upward movement on housing , and permitted housing to rise at a rate greater than nominal per capita GDP over this period .
Even if someone purchased a house in the early 1990s , their mortgage rate was 10 % , vs. just 6 % in 2001 ( before the recent bubble ) .
This is the reason why the old rule of thumb of prospective homeowners being wise not the purchase a house priced more than 2.5 times their annual income was applicable in the 1970s and 1980s , but somehow gave way to home prices of 5 - 7 times income being considered normal .
The hypothetical example below may help illustrate this phenomenon .
Now , the 10 - year note yields ( and mortgage rates ) have begun to rise .
While the rise has merely been by 1 % so far , and even if rates never get that much higher than they are is now , it is impossible for the drop in yield from 1981 to 2001 to be repeated .
When the 10 - year yield is 5 % and mortage rates are 6.5 % , there is no room for them to drop another 3 % .
Theoretical 3 % mortgage rates would result in homes being priced at 10 times average salaries nationwide , and even then have no further room for appreciation from that point .
The floor has been hit , and there is nowhere else to go for further rate declines .
Thus , while the bubble created by low short - term rates from 2002 - 04 may dissipate in the next two years , after that , the next 20 years will additionally no longer have a tailwind of declining long - term rates behind housing , and the trendline of housing prices will be forced to converge towards mere increases in inflation and per-capita real GDP , or about 5 % a year in the US .
This is after the short - term bubble corrects .
While I do believe that economic growth rates are exponential and accelerating , housing , being a product without a knowledge - based component , is less likely to participate in this accelerating curve .
Increasingly greater returns will be seen in the stock market , and stocks , particularly those of knowledge - based businesses , will continue to draw capital away from real - estate , over the next 20 years .
WASHINGTON  Alberto Gonzales , in his first public account of a late - night hospital visit to then - attorney general John Ashcroft , denied pressuring the ailing Ashcroft to approve a warrantless surveillance program .
Several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Tuesday that they did n't believe him .
" I do not find your testimony credible , " Sen .
Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , told the embattled attorney general .
" It 's hard to see anything but a pattern of intentionally misleading Congress again and again , " Sen . Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , told Gonzales .
Gonzales has been under fire for dismissing nine U.S. attorneys and filling career jobs at the Justice Department with Republican loyalists .
On Tuesday , senators grilled Gonzales about whether Bush administration officials had questioned the legality of the intelligence - gathering operation , known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
TSP , publicly acknowledged by President Bush in December 2005 , allows wiretapping of international phone calls to or from the USA when one of the parties is a suspected member of a terrorist group .
Gonzales said the hospital visit on May 10 , 2004 , came after an emergency meeting at the White House with eight members of Congress authorized to hear intelligence and national security matters .
The lawmakers urged Gonzales , then the White House counsel , to do what he could to continue the program , which was due to expire the next day , he said .
Gonzales said he and then - White House chief of staff Andrew Card visited Ashcroft , who was critically ill with pancreatitis , at George Washington University Hospital .
" When we got there , Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking , " Gonzales told the committee .
He said Ashcroft was lucid but emphasized that he had transferred his authority to make decisions to his deputy , James Comey , who had objected to the program .
" Comey told us he would not approve the continuation of a specific intelligence activity .
He thought the president did not have the authority , " Gonzales said .
Gonzales ' account conflicts with the version Comey told the committee in May .
Comey said Card and Gonzales had tried to " take advantage of a very sick man . "
Comey testified that he and other top Justice Department officials considered resigning after the White House renewed the program over their objections .
Comey said he changed his mind only after President Bush met with FBI Director Robert Mueller and instructed Mueller to modify the program to address the Justice Department 's concerns about its legality .
" You said categorically there has n't been any serious disagreement about the program , " Leahy told Gonzales on Tuesday .
" Comey says the opposite is true . "
Gonzales had repeatedly told Congress that the program was not controversial within the administration .
In a May 17 letter to Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , Gonzales reaffirmed his testimony and said " there had not been serious disagreement about the lawfulness " of the TSP .
" The disagreement was not about the terrorist surveillance program the president announced to the American people , " Gonzales said Tuesday .
" It was another intelligence matter . "
He said the matter was classified and would not discuss it .
Gonzales , in his appearance Tuesday , also sought more power for terrorism investigations by asking Congress to broaden the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
However , the hearing quickly turned hostile , and several committee members , among them Specter and Leahy , again suggested that Gonzales should resign .
" The attorney general has lost the confidence of the Congress and the American people , " Leahy said .
" The Justice Department has been reduced to the role of enabler for this administration .
What we need instead is genuine accountability and real independence . "
Gonzales said he would not resign .
" I 've decided to stay and fix the problems , and that 's what I have been doing , . "
Enlarge By Dennis Cook , AP Alberto Gonzales said within the Justice Department " there had not been serious disagreement about the lawfulness " of warrantless surveillance program .
Panel Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , on right , said the Justice Department under Alberto Gonzales " has been reduced to the role of enabler " for the Bush administration .

Implement a continuous function f:R3 →R3 such that for all non -zero x , f(x ) is also non-zero and is perpendicular to x .
I have to admit , I have a tendency to write about abstract nonsense here .
But I do so for entirely practical reasons - I do n't want to run afoul of my employer by mentioning anything that could be construed as a trade secret .
But today I thought I 'd mention a small application of topology to computer graphics .
The reason I can safely mention it is that I wo n't be revealing a technique or algorithm .
Instead , I want to point out the opposite : a proof that a certain algorithm cannot possibly exist .
From time to time , anyone who works in computer graphics is likely to want to implement a function with this specification :
This kind of function is ubiquitous in graphics and most math libraries geared towards graphics that I have seen have some kind of implementation of this .
A typical application is as follows : suppose you 're animating shoals of fish .
Using a variety of methods its easy to generate nice paths that guide the motion of thousands of fish .
For example you could assume that the motion of the fish is approximately described by a divergence - free vector field ( so that the fish do n't ' pile up ' anywhere ) and then integrate these fields to give streamlines that the fish can follow .
Unfortunately there is a slight catch with this .
If you have some 3D geometry representing the fish 's shape , knowing the position of the fish is n't enough to specify how it looks .
You also need to give its orientation .
An obvious choice is to orient the fish so that the line from tail to nose points along the flow .
But you still need to be able to describe its orientation around this axis .
To do this , we need to complete this orientation vector along the fish to an orthogonal basis ie .
find a set of mutually orthogonal unit vectors , e , e , and esuch that epoints from tail to nose .
We can easily define eto be e×e , so if we had the function f above we could write e=f ( e ) .
The function f appears in a multitude of other contexts too .
It 's useful when orienting ' virtual ' cameras .
For example the user might want to specify that the camera points at a target and have the graphics system select an orientation with this property .
However , anyone who 's met these problems immediately hits an issue .
Try writing code to do this for yourself if you have n't already .
Chances are you 'll end up with a conditional branch in your code , and when you flip from one branch to another you 'll see it clearly causing ugly flips in the animation .
So the above spec needs to be revised to :
And here 's the rub : the Hairy Ball Theorem says there is no such function .
So if you 're having trouble writing one , it 's not because you 're not being ingenious enough .
It just can't be done !
( Though there are lots of other solutions to the animation problems I mention above . )
See , topology is useful after all , it can save you wasting your time on impossible tasks .
( Funnily enough though , the best way to see that this is true is using a suitable functor ... )
Actually , I think anyone who works in graphics ought to read up on the Hairy Ball Theorem , the Ham Sandwich Theorem and the Borsuk - Ulam theorem as well as learning about the double cover of SO ( 3 ) ( which I 'll write about here in the near future ) .
That was a public service announcement .

Run on banks in LA amid crisis ; Wal - Mart CEO says customers are ' running out of money '
John Byrne
Published : Friday August 17 , 2007
Print This Email This Wal - Mart CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. says customers are " running out of money . "
Earlier this week , consumer juggernauts Home Depot and Wal - Mart reported softer than expected earnings .
Penned the New York Times , " the sober forecasts reverberated across Wall Street , sending the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poors 500 - stock index down by nearly 2 percent , with the Dow dropping more than 200 points .
Shares of both Wal - Mart and Home Depot fell around 5 percent .
" Economists said the sluggish performance of the chains  Wal - Mart missed its profit forecast and Home Depots earnings dropped  could signal broader troubles in the economy . "
Buried in the article was a sobering remark indeed :  Many customers are running out of money at the end of the month ,  said H. Lee Scott Jr. , the chief executive of Wal - Mart .
In Los Angeles , economic concerns hit close to home .
Anxious customers of Countrywide Bank jammed its phone lines , branches and website after the nation 's largest mortgage lender -- which owns the bank -- announced it was facing problems from a credit meltdown .
" Countrywide Financial Corp. , the biggest home - loan company in the nation , sought Thursday to assure depositors and the financial industry that both it and its bank were fiscally stable , " wrote the LA Times Friday .
" And federal regulators said they were n't alarmed by the volume of withdrawals from the bank . "
" The rush to withdraw money -- by depositors that included a former Los Angeles Kings star hockey player and an executive of a rival home - loan company -- came a day after fears arose that Countrywide Financial could file for bankruptcy protection because of a worsening credit crunch stemming from the sub - prime mortgage meltdown , " the paper continued .
" At Countrywide Bank offices , in a scene rare since the U.S. savings - and - loan crisis ended in the early '90s , so many people showed up to take out some or all of their money that in some cases they had to leave their names , " the Times added .
" Bill Ashmore drove his Porsche Cayenne to Countrywide 's Laguna Niguel office and waited half an hour to cash out $ 500,000 , which he then wired to an account at Bank of America . "
" It 's because of the fear of the bankruptcy , " Ashmore , president of Irvine 's Impac Mortgage Holdings , which escaped bankruptcy itself recently by shutting down virtually all its lending and laying off hundreds of employees told the paper .
" It 's got my wife totally freaked out .
I just do n't want to deal with it .
I do n't care about losing 90 days ' interest , I do n't care if it 's FDIC - insured -- I just want it out . "
Last week I gave Bryan Caplan a gift .
Not being much of an egalitarian , I explained the gift on the grounds that he is extremely meritorious .
What if we generally gave gifts on the basis of sheer personal merit ?
Most gifts are for " occasions , " such as birthdays and Christmas .
The value of the gift may be correlated with how the giver perceives the merit of the recipient , but rarely is merit the pretext for the gift .
Perhaps a general practice of explicit merit - based gift - giving would create too many perceived slights .
In contrast , when a holiday is the pretext and the value of the gift is ( possibly ) linked to merit , we can self - deceive and believe that a small - valued gift simply represents a cheap gift - giver , or a friendship of uncertain strength , rather than our own lack of merit .
But every now and then it is important to stand up to social convention and do what is right .
Please give a merit - based gift — to someone who deserves it — sometime this month .

We 've no idea whether it 's fact or fiction , but according to the nice people putting this one - of - a - kind up for sale on eBay , here 's the " lore " on this here ' 93 Lincoln one - off :
" Lincoln executives were concerned about the heavy and wide doors on the Mark VIII in the early 1990 's especially in large cities with tight parking spots .
They were toying with the idea of a Mark VIII that had doors that disappeared beneath the car which would require no additional space for the doors to swing open in order to allow the occupant to exit or enter .
Back in the day , the major auto makers would sub -contract their concept designs to other engineering firms who specialiazed in auto concepts and executions .
In this particular case , this Lincoln Mark VIII was shipped over to Joalto Design Inc. near Detroit ... who created this amazing , one of a kind concept car and shipped it back to Lincoln for executive approval ...
Unfortunately , the Ford Motor Company executives did not like the design and ordered the car ( and the concept ) to be sent to the junkyard and destroyed .
The current owner had been tracking this car for nearly 20 years and finally convinced the previous owner to part with it . "

The Endless War

The death last Sunday of six Canadian soldiers in southern Afghanistan reminds us of Santayana ’s famous maxim that those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it .
The soldiers were killed near Maiwand , a name meaning nothing to most westerners .
But there , on 27 July , 1880 , during the bloody Second Afghan War , the British Empire suffered one of the worst defeats in its colonial history .
Two years earlier the Raj ( Britain ’s Indian Empire ) had invaded Afghanistan for a second time .
The British put Afghan puppet rulers into power in Kabul and Kandahar .
Ayub Khan , son of Afghanistan ’s former emir , rallied 12,000 Pashtun ( or Pathan ) tribal warriors to fight an advancing British force whose mission , was , in London ’s words , to " liberate " Afghan tribes and bring them " the light of Christian civilization . "
Today , the slogan is " promoting democracy . "
The fierce Afghan tribal warriors routed the imperial force , composed of British regulars , including the vaunted Grenadier Guards , and Indian Sepoy troops , after a ferocious battle .
The British army doctor Conan Doyle used as his model for Sherlock Homes ’ companion , Dr. Watson , fought at Maiwand .
I recall this epic Afghan victory against British colonialism because understanding today ’s war in Afghanistan requires proper historical context .
A century and a quarter after Maiwand , Pashtun warriors of southern Afghanistan continue to resist another mighty world power and its allies , who have been faithfully following the imperial strategy of the old British Raj .
The invasion of Afghanistan was marketed to Americans as an " anti-terrorist " mission and effort to implant democracy .
It was sold to Canadians as a noble campaign of " nation - building , reconstruction , and defending women ’s rights . "
All nice - sounding , but mostly untrue .
What we are really seeing is a war by western powers seeking to dominate the strategic oil corridor of Afghanistan , directed against the Pashtun people who comprise half that nation ’s population .
Another 15 million live just across the border in Pakistan .
What we call " Taliban " is actually a loose alliance of Pashtun tribes and clans , joined by nationalist forces and former mujahidin from the 1980 ’s anti-Soviet struggle .
Last year , a leading authority on Afghanistan , the Brussels - based Senlis Institute , found Taliban and its allies control or influence half of the nation — roughly equivalent to Pashtun tribal territory .
Its study flatly contradicted rosy reports of military success and " nation - building " from Washington and NATO HQ .
This week , the same think tank issued a shocking new survey based on 17,000 interviews .
" Afghanis in southern Afghanistan are increasingly prepared to admit their support for Taliban , and belief that the government and international community will not be able to defeat the Taliban is widespread . "
Senlis ’ study concurs with my own findings in South Asia that Pakistan and India have independently concluded NATO will eventually be defeated in Afghanistan and withdraw .
The US , however , may stay on and reinforce its 30,000 troops there because it cannot admit a second defeat after the Iraq debacle .
US and NATO are not fighting " terrorists " in Afghanistan and they are certainly not wining hearts and minds .
They are fighting the world ’s largest tribal people .
The longer the westerners stay and bomb villages , the more resistance will grow .
Such is the inevitable pattern of every guerilla war I have ever covered .
Western troops stuck in this nasty , $ 2 billion daily guerrilla conflict will become increasingly brutalized , demoralized and violent .
This is precisely what happened to Afghanistan ’s second to latest invader , the Soviet Union .
Afghanistan ’s figurehead Karzai regime controls only the capital .
The rest of the country is under Taliban , or warlords who run the surging narcotics trade that has made NATO the main defender of the world ’s leading narco state .
If 160,000 Soviet troops and 240,000 Afghan Communist soldiers could not defeat the Pashtuns in ten years , how can 50,000 US and NATO troops do better ?
Those generals and politicians who claim this war will be won in a few short years ought to study Maiwand .

High - tech dental lasers used mainly to prepare cavities for restoration now can help eliminate bacteria in root canals , according to research published in the July issue of The Journal of the American Dental Association ( JADA ) .
The study , conducted by researchers in Austria , credits the development of miniaturized , flexible fiber tips for allowing the laser to be used in endodontic ( root canal ) treatment .
Dr. Ulrich Schoop and a team of researchers in the dental school at the University of Vienna used 60 extracted human teeth with one root each to test the effects of laser irradiation on root canals using an erbium , chromium : yttrium - scandium - gallium - garnet ( Er , Cr: YSGG ) laser .
Dr. Schoop and colleagues inoculated the root canals with one of two types of bacteria ( Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli ) and then irradiated the canals using either a 1 - or 1.5 - watt power setting .
The team found that the laser reduced the amount of E. coli at the lower power setting and reduced it to below the detection level at the higher setting .
It also was effective in eliminating E. faecalis .
Researchers found , too , that the laser removed the smear layer and debris from the root canal walls and that the temperature rise during irradiation was within safe borders .
The authors concluded that the Er , Cr: YSGG laser may be suitable for cleaning and disinfecting root canals and that it can be used safely if the common precautions for using lasers are observed and the energy levels and irradiation times are within the proposed range .
They also suggested that clinical studies are needed to confirm their laboratory findings .
In a related article in July JADA , Dr. Roy H. Stevens and colleagues at the Kornberg School of Dentistry , Temple University , describe their study of an Er , Cr: YSGG laser with a new tip that emits radiation radially .
Dr. Stevens and colleagues examined the efficiency of this new laser tip in disinfecting root canal dentin walls infected with E. faecalis .
They found that it significantly reduced the amount of E. faecalis in contaminated root canals .

If you are an entrepreneur ( or plan on being one ) , then it is likely that sometime in your entrepreneurial career , you will have to work on creating brand recognition and advertising .
For the most bang for the buck – think outside the bag ( you ’ll see what I mean ) .
Here are some innovative ads that really amused me – hopefully they will inspire you in your quest for creating the most captivating ad as well .
Note :
These images have been floating around for a while and you might have seen some of them already .
So , I categorized them into three sections so you can skip over the sections that you have already seen .
How thoughtful , huh ? 🙂

Advertising on shopping bags ( “ bagvertising ” ) can have a similar effect as advertising on bill boards .
At a much lower cost , though .
Compared to billboards , the advantage of using bagvertising is that shopping bags are mobile ads , whereas bill boards are stationary .
So , bagvertising can reach all sorts of places that bill board advertising just could n’t .
The key here is to be innovative .
Have an “ oomph ” design that will make a lasting impression to not only help with brand recognition , but also tempt the audience into going and making a purchase themselves .
Here are some examples .

He then goes on to take a call from a Republican who thinks it would be a good idea to offer to have illegal immigrants serve in Iraq as a path to citizenship .
Continetti says it 's not necessary and claims we 're meeting our recruiting goals without it , which is a lie .
The only reason we 've met our recruting goals is because they 've been lowered .
Our soldiers have been stop - lossed and forced to serve for longer terms to make up the difference to the point where the military is being broken .
Continetti then gets another " reasonable " caller who says that the Iraq war was based on lies and on how the troops who are having their tours of duty being extended are being lied to .
Continetti replies by trying to say that the war was n't based on lies , ignores the question about the extended tours , and then says we should ignore how we got to Iraq and focus on what we do next , and then talks about the dilemma of the Democrats who voted for Bush 's authority to begin with who are running for office .
Given that this guy is a Bill Kristol underling at the Weekly Standard , none of this is surprising out of him .

Minus Zero
Most computers today use two 's complement representation for negative integer numbers .
The UNIVAC ® 1100 family , however , used one 's complement .
In this page we 'll look at the differences between the different representations and the most eccentric aspect of one 's complement : minus zero , a number dearly cherished by clever 1100 series programmers .
When discussing binary numbers , we 'll use octal notation , as was the practice on the 1100 series .
Each digit between 0 and 7 represents three binary bits , and hence a 36 - bit word is written as 12 octal digits .
Signed Magnitude
The most obvious way to represent positive and negative numbers in a binary computer is signed magnitude , a direct analogue to how numbers are written in decimal notation .
A sign bit is dedicated to indicating whether the number is positive or negative , with the rest of the bits giving the magnitude of the number .
On almost all computers the most significant bit is used for the sign bit , zero signifying positive and one negative .
( There 's no reason you could n't use some other bit as the sign or have one mean positive , but that would complicate the electronics and render impossible several programming tricks we 'll get into later on . )
Let 's consider , then , how we'd store the number 11 , both positive and negative , on a 36 - bit signed magnitude binary computer .
The binary representation of 11 is 1011 , or 013 in octal , so positive 11 becomes :
+11 = 000000000013
Since we 're using the most significant ( 235 ) bit of the word to denote the sign , with one denoting negative , it is evident that the 36 - bit signed magnitude representation of − 11 is :
− 11 = 400000000013
( Remember , octal digit 4 corresponds to bit pattern 100 , so a leading 4 indicates the sign bit is set , informing us that the value in the rest of the word is negative . )
Signed magnitude is straightforward , easy to understand since it parallels the notation we 're used to , and easy to decode by hand while debugging .
So naturally , you 'd expect there to be an excellent engineering reason why it should n't be used , and indeed there is .
The fly lands in your Pepsi glass at the point where you move on from storing numbers to doing arithmetic with them .
Consider : when the computer adds two numbers , with signed magnitude it first has to look at the signs of both numbers , then decide , based upon the signs , whether to add them or subtract one from the other , and what sign the result will bear .
This does n't seem like such a difficult problem today , when hardware is , by the standards of the 1950's when the 1100 series was designed , free , but when you put yourself in the place of designers who knew that each logic gate cost several dollars and , in the vacuum tube era , took up substantial space and gave off more heat than an entire computer does today , the need to simplify was compelling .
Would n't it be great if the computer 's arithmetic unit never needed to know if a number was positive or negative ?
This turns out to be possible , and led to the wide adoption of other representations of negative numbers , which we 'll now examine .
( As hardware prices have plummeted , the relative advantages of various ways of doing arithmetic have become less significant .
IEEE Std 754 floating point , used by virtually all contemporary computers , employs signed magnitude for negative numbers . )
Two 's Complement
Designers of mechanical calculators confronted the problem of representing negative numbers decades before the first electronic computers .
With only gears and levers at their disposal , simplicity was essential , and they developed an ingenious way to represent negative numbers called ten 's complement .
Suppose we have a four digit decimal calculator .
The number 11 will then be represented as 0011 .
What if we want to put in − 11 ?
In ten 's complement , if the number is negative we subtract its magnitude from the number one greater than our register size and enter the result .
The largest number our four - digit calculator can handle is 9999 ; to get the ten 's complement of − 11 , we compute 10000 − 11 = 9989 .
The point of all this is now we have a way to compute with positive and negative numbers without ever worrying about their signs .
To see how it works , let 's add 0011 and 9989 , the ten 's complement of − 11 .
Crank , grind , crunch , and our calculator prints 0000 on the tape .
Wait a minute , you exclaim , when I add 0011 and 9989 , I get 10000 !
That 's right , but remember we 're using a four digit calculator , so the carry into the fifth digit just disappears , leaving the result of 0000 .
Since adding 0011 and the ten 's complement of − 11 , 9989 , yielded zero ( as long as we forget about the carry , as the calculator does ) , we seem to have found a way that the calculator can work without worrying about the sign and , as a little experimentation will show , we have indeed .
Nicer still , we can leave to the user whether the calculator is considered to work on positive numbers from 0 to 9999 or signed numbers in the range from − 5000 to +4999 ; all it takes is a little “ user interface ” , a few more gears to convert numbers back and forth to ten 's complement , and we 're in business .
The range of numbers looks a little odd , does n't it ?
Let 's see where that crept in .
Taking the rules for forming the ten 's complement , − 1 becomes 9999 , − 2 9998 , and so on , with the largest possible negative value being − 5000 , 5000 .
But since 5000 is the most negative number , we can't have positive numbers greater than 4999 because otherwise they 'd overflow into the negative range .
Irritating , but I suppose we 'll learn to live with it .
More serious is discovering you can't divide a negative ten 's complement number by 10 by shifting it right one place , as we do so easily with positive numbers .
Consider 11 : if we want to divide 0011 by 10 , we just shift it to the right one place yielding the quotient of 0001 ( the remainder is discarded ) .
If you want to make a calculator multiply , this is extremely nice since you can rig the gear wheels to shift left and right and do everything with addition .
But it does n't work for negative numbers .
Consider − 11 , which we represent as 9989 .
If we shift that right one position ( understanding that we shift in 9 at the left when the number was negative to start with , in order to preserve the ten 's complement of the top digit ) , we end up with 9998 , which is − 2 .
Bzzzzzt …wrong , we should have gotten − 1 , or 9999 .
The culprit in the divide - by - shifting caper turns out to be the same asymmetry around zero which caused us to end up with a negative number with no positive counterpart .
We 've been discussing decimal computation so far .
For binary computers there is a precise counterpart to ten 's complement : two 's complement .
( The technique works in any number base ; if you were computing in hexadecimal , you could use “ sixteen 's complement ” for negative numbers . )
Suppose that instead of a four digit decimal calculator we have a 12 - bit binary computer .
( I choose 12 bits since that 's four octal digits ) .
Taking the number 11 again , in binary that 's 000000001011 or , in octal 0013 .
To form the two 's complement for − 11 , we subtract the magnitude from binary 1000000000000 ( octal 10000 ) , which gives binary 111111110101 , or octal 7765 .
Adding this back to 0013 yields 0000 , confirming that the scheme works as well in base two as it did for ten .
Now that we 've made the transition to binary , the problem with shifting two 's complement numbers is even more nettlesome .
Dividing by a power of two is something you do all the time in software for a binary computer and , while it 's OK for positive numbers , you can't do it if the dividend might be negative .
A compiler generating code for a FORTRAN program , for example , generally does n't know when compiling :
J = I / 256
whether I might contain a negative value .
Not knowing , it has no alternative but to generate a divide by 256 rather than a shift by 8 bits which , on computers like the 1100 series , is about ten times faster .
Further , once in the binary world you start doing lots of logical operations on bits .
But , you quickly discover , logical negation ( changing all the ones into zeroes and vice versa ) is not the same as calculating the two 's complement for a negative number : the values will always differ by one .
Since logical and arithmetic negation are both things you do all the time , that means you have to put in separate instructions for each — more expensive hardware , and the programmer has to be careful to choose the right one , depending on how the value in a word is being used … messy .
It was these shortcomings , especially apparent in a binary architecture , which motivated the engineers designing the 1100 series to look beyond two 's complement for an even better solution .
In the the next section we 'll see what they found .
If their choice seems odd , it 's because in the intervening years the computer industry has pretty much settled on two 's complement notation for negative integers , deciding , as it were , that the shortcomings we 've discussed above can be lived with , that the merits of other notations are outweighed by disadvantages of their own as least as serious as the drawbacks of two 's complement .
So , when you examine the instruction set of a present day microprocessor such as the Intel x86 , you 'll find separate instructions for negating logical values ( NOT ) and integers ( NEG ) and , in many programming primers , an explanation of what each does and when to use which .
One 's Complement
Since it appears most of the problems we encountered with ten's and two 's complement are due to the asymmetry around zero , what if we eliminate it by making all the negative numbers one less ?
It turns out this is equivalent ( for the decimal case ) to subtracting each individual digit of the magnitude of the number from the number nine , yielding a nine 's complement representation .
Turning to the familiar case of 11 , +11 is written as 0011 and to get − 11 , we subtract each digit from 9 , resulting in 9988 .
Recalling that the two 's complement for − 11 was 9989 , you 'll see indeed we have moved all the negative values down and eliminated the asymmetry at zero .
It 's also evident that since subtracting a decimal digit from 9 is its own inverse , we can invert the sign of any number , positive or negative , by taking its nine 's complement .
Subtracting each digit of 9988 gives us back 0011 .
So far , so good ; this is looking better and better .
Now let 's try some arithmetic , for example adding −1 and 10 .
The one 's complement of − 1 is 9998 , and adding that to 0010 , the calculator prints 0008 .
Uh oh , wrong answer .
Examining more closely shows that in nine 's complement the carry we so blithely discarded in ten 's complement now has to be accounted for .
Adding 9998 and 0010 on a piece of paper rather than our busted calculator gives a sum of 10008 , with a carry out of the fourth digit .
To compute correctly in nine 's complement , this carry has to be added back in to the least significant ( rightmost ) digit of the sum , a process UNIVAC engineers referred to as an “ end- around carry ” .
Adding additional gears to our calculator to handle this carry adds the one carried out to the four low digits of 0008 , and now the correct sum , 0009 appears on the tape .
Excellent !
The problem of shifting negative numbers has also been fixed .
Shifting − 11 ( 9988 ) right one place ( again , shifting in a nine if negative ) yields 9998 , for which the nine 's complement ( subtracting each digit from 9 , remember ) is 0001 .
In fact , this works in all circumstances .
The oddity of a negative number with no positive counterpart is also gone ; the nine 's complement of the largest positive number , 4999 is 5000 , which represents − 4999 just as you 'd expect .
From a hardware standpoint , the need for the end - around carry looks bothersome , especially when you consider that it might result in propagating a carry all the way back through a number you 've just finished adding .
On the other hand , the process of negating a number is simplified .
Now we 'll move on to binary to see how it works with bits instead of decimal digits .
As you 'd expect , the binary counterpart of nine 's complement is one 's complement , and we form the one 's complement of a binary number by subtracting each digit from 1 .
But with binary numbers , that is precisely the same as just replacing all the one bits with zeroes and vice versa !
One 's complement has eliminated the distinction between logical and arithmetic negation and the need for separate instructions for each operation .
In summary , by admitting the added complexity of end - around carry , we have obtained a way of representing negative numbers which is symmetric , in which power - of - two division can be done by shifting for all numbers , and where negating a number and inverting all its bits are one and the same thing .
But we 've also gotten something else as well :
Minus Zero !
If the one 's complement of 1 , binary 000000000001 , is 111111111110 , then what is the one 's complement of zero , binary 000000000000 ?
Well , of course that works out to be 111111111111 : minus zero !
Let 's explore the consequences of this , shifting back to the decimal equivalent of nine 's complement since that 's easier to follow .
The nine 's complement of 0000 is 9999 , decimal minus zero .
What happens , for example , when we add minus zero to , say , ten ( 0010 ) ?
The sum of 10 and 9999 is 10009 , and performing the end - around carry gets us back to 0010 , so minus zero is well behaved in addition and , it turns out , all other arithmetic operations as well .
If we add +0 ( 0000 ) and −0 ( 9999 ) we get 9999 , −0 , which is still zero , so that 's okay as well , if a bit odd at first glance .
Maybe if we never start out with minus zero , we can ignore it ?
Unfortunately , no : consider the case of adding +11 ( 0011 ) and − 11 ( 9988 ) .
We get zero , sure enough , but it 's minus zero , 9999 .
Now suppose we want to test whether a number is zero , something any program needs to do frequently .
That seems to have gotten a bit sticky , since we 've seen that minus zero can pop out of an innocuous calculation ( due to the way the adder in the 1100 series operated , minus zero was generated under different circumstances than in this simplified example , but it was generated nonetheless ) .
It appears that every time we want to test for zero , we have to see if it 's +0 or −0 : a real drag .
We could always modify the hardware to do this automatically , so that all zero test instructions considered either +0 or −0 to be zero , and this is precisely what the UNIVAC 1100 series ( and most other one 's complement architectures ) did .
On a two 's complement machine , there 's one and only one zero made up of all zero bits , all ones denoting −1 , so there is no problem testing for zero .
As Prof. William C. Lynch remarked in the heyday of minus zero , “ give a programmer a glitch and he 'll try to drive a truck through it ” , and minus zero was a glitch big enough to roll a whole convoy through , good buddy .
Consider the following UNIVAC assembly code ( consult the instruction set reference if you 're hazy on the op codes ) , and remember that UNIVAC 1100 test instructions skipped the next instruction in line if the condition was true .
LA A0 , VALUE1 Load first number LA A1 , VALUE2 Load second number TNE A0 , A1 Are they equal ?
J ARE$EQUAL
Yes , they are ANA A0 , A1 Not equal , huh ?
Subtract them TNZ A0 Is the result zero ?
J HOW$DID$THIS$HAPPEN
Huh ?
Unequal but difference is zero ?
In order to be useful when comparing arbitrary bit patterns , the Test Equal ( TE ) and Test Not Equal ( TNE ) and related instructions only consider two values equal if they contain precisely the same bit pattern .
Suppose VALUE1 is −0 ( 777777777777 octal ) and VALUE2 is +0 ( 000000000000 octal ) .
You can't get more different than that , can you ?
Every bit is different , so clearly these values are not equal .
But when we subtract the second from the first , since we 're subtracting zero from zero we end up with ( as it happens , minus , see below for details ) zero , and the Test Nonzero ( TNZ ) instruction , which considers both +0 and −0 to be zero , fails to skip since the difference in A0 is ( minus ) zero .
This example may seem a bit contrived , but consider the following trap which many a novice 1100 programmer stepped into , especially those who first learned on a two 's complement machine .
( Enclosing a value in parentheses made a reference to a memory cell containing that value .
[ Grognards : yes , I remember , and would have coded “ , U ” , but I do n't want to explain that here ] ) .
. < Do some computation >
TNE A0 , (0 ) Was the result zero ?
J GOT$ZERO
Yes .
We 're done
If the calculation happens to end up with −0 , gotcha !… that 's not zero according to the bit - by - bit test performed by TNE .
Another trap which frequently snared those used to two 's complement was confusing “ positive ” and “ negative ” , which on a one 's complement machine are properties shared by all numbers , including zero .
The various instructions which tested positive and negative simply tested whether the most significant bit was zero ( positive ) or one ( negative ) .
This could lead to the puzzle :
TP VALUE Is it positive ?
J IS$ NEGATIVE
Nope , it 's negative TNZ VALUE
Is the result zero ?
J HOW$DID$THIS$HAPPEN
Huh ?
Positive but equal to zero ?
If you really needed to know if a value was greater than zero , you wrote instead :
LA A0 , VALUE Load value from memory TLE A0 , (0 ) Less than or equal to zero ?
J IS$ POSITIVE
No , then it must be greater than zero
But even this had a little added twist : if you compared the two , +0 was greater than −0 , leading to the conundrum :
LA A0 , VALUE1 Load first number LA A1 , VALUE2 Load second number ANU A1,A0 Are they equal ?
( Difference stored in A2 ) JNZ A2 , NOT$EQUAL
No , they 're not TG A0 , A1 Ahhhh , equal .
Is A1 > A0 , perchance ?
J YES$ BUT$HOW Easy , A1 = +0 , A0 = - 0 .
Neat , huh ?
I could go on and on .
In practice , once you learned the fundamental tricks for testing numbers , you could ignore minus zero in most situations .
The 1100 architecture helped by being based upon what was called a “ subtractive adder ” ; the fundamental arithmetic operation was subtraction , not addition , which meant that subtracting a number from itself yielded +0 , not −0 , which greatly reduced the probability −0 would appear in typical computations .
Still , any code which , for example , extracted bits from an integer by logical operations or shifting had to be wary of the possibility its “ zero argument ” might be , in fact , made up of all one bits .
It was not uncommon , for example , to see code which wanted to extract the low - order 6 bits of what purported to be an unsigned integer do the following :
LA A0 , VALUE Load the value AA A0 , (0 ) Add zero ( hee hee hee ) AND A0 , ( 077 ) Extract low - order 6 bits
Add zero ?
Welcome to Minus Zero Logic ( MZL ) which , based on the fine details of the 1100 arithmetic unit , obeyed the following rules when adding zero and zero .
Minus Zero Logic +0 + +0 = +0
+0 + −0 = +0
−0 + +0 = +0
− 0 + −0 = −0 +0 − +0 = +0
+0 − −0 = +0
− 0 − +0 = −0
− 0 − −0 = +0
Adding zero guarantees that even if we started out with −0 , we 'll have +0 by the time of the AND , averting confusion between −0 and 63 in the least significant 6 bits .
This elementary introduction to the wonders of minus zero takes us only to the loading dock where inspired ( and totally daft ) UNIVAC programmers departed , applying minus zero to return additional status from subroutines ( if the result is zero , an error has occurred ; if minus zero , a really awful error ) , or observing that , assuming +0 means TRUE and −0 FALSE , the result of the subtraction :
LA A0 , B Load B ANA A0 , A Subtract ( Add Negative ) A
gives , in register A0 , the result of the logical implication ( conditional ) function with A as the antecedent and B the consequent .

Forget Star
Trek , where the " aliens " are just humans with some kind of ridges on their foreheads .
And even forget the traditional view of alien life ; that it needs liquid water to survive .
According to a new study by the National Academies called The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems , life could be completely and totally alien .
Just how alien ?
Well , first , let ’s define life on Earth .
Wherever researchers find liquid water , they find microbial life too .
It does n’t matter if the water is nearly freezing , hotter than boiling , deep underground , or mixed in with toxic chemicals .
Water serves as a solvent , allowing organic molecules to come in contact with one another in solution .
Life also needs carbon , and several other elements to build up structures , store energy , and facilitate chemical reactions .
And finally , life needs some kind of energy source , whether it ’s the Sun , hydrothermal , or energy from a chemical .
The multidisciplinary team of researchers threw those assumptions out the window , and brainstormed alternative elements and compounds that could serve the same functions as water and carbon here on Earth .
It turns out water , is n’t the only solvent life could use .
In fact , it ’s a pretty mediocre solvent , chemists prefer other solvents in the lab – often ammonia is used to prepare organic molecules .
On another planet , life could use liquid ammonia or methane , or even liquid hydrogen if it gets cold enough .
And other chemicals could stand in for carbon , fulfilling similar functions for building structure , energy storage and facilitating chemical reactions .
The result is that you could end up with life that does n’t need water , and does n’t put out the kinds of chemicals that scientists would be expecting to see .
And that ’s the point .
The hope with this research is to give biologists new environments to explore here on Earth which were previously considered totally off limits for life .
They might be lucky enough to find variants of life here on Earth which have no connection to carbon - based life – the aliens among us .
This will also give space mission designers new chemical signatures to look for when they ’re designing spacecraft and rover experiments designed to detect the presence of life .
Now they ’ll even be able to detect life as we do n’t know it .

「 幸せなお産」というコラムを見つけた。「有機野菜・無添加の素材をつかったオーガニック料理」を配達するお店のサイトのコンテンツ*1で、「人生マクロビオティック」「オーガニック生活のすすめ」といったコラムの中の一つである。たまたまうまくいった例を紹介して自然分娩を賛美するのはよく見かける。このコラムも「病院での人工的な分娩ではなく、自然な分娩を行いうまくいったハッピー」という内容だろうなと読者諸君は想像されるかもしれない。しかし、このコラムはその想像の斜め上をいく。
■幸せなお産 ( ■魚拓 ) （オーガニックエッセイ たけまつばなし一覧）
多少長いので、要約する。両親ともに「お肉も食べない無添加のバリバリオーガニック生活」を送っていた。妊娠が判明し、近所にマクロビオティックの助産院があったが、「逆子は法律上、助産院では産めない」。大阪の病院では「あなたの骨盤ではこの大きな頭の赤ちゃんの自然分娩は無理だ」と言われた。「お灸、ホメオパシー、逆子体操と思いつく事をいろいろためしたが、結局逆子は直らなかった」。しかし、「100％自然分娩のお産の極意」をもつ吉村先生は「バリバリの安産です」と言って受け入れてくれた。吉村医院*2で、まき割りやスクワットをしながら陣痛を待った。出産予定日から1ヵ月が過ぎようとしていたころに陣痛がきたがなかなか生まれず、陣痛が来てから3日目に「吉村先生の苦渋の選択で、転院を決めた」。近代医療で、児は生まれた。
自然な出産を希望する妊婦がいる以上、自然分娩を行う施設があってもよいと思う。しかしながら、リスクがあることを知らされ、安全に十分な配慮がなされている限りにおいての話だ。母体のみならず児の安全にも関わることである。成人が自らの愚かな選択で命を落とすことがあっても自己責任であるが、児には何の責任もない。さて、このコラムの著者は、自然分娩を行う吉村先生を高く評価し、一方で安全なお産を行う他の産科医療を批判している。
吉村医院へ来る前、かかっていた産科の病院では出産が11月9日と決まっていた。もうすぐ、それから１ヵ月にもなろうとしているのに・・・なんとも、大人の都合、医学の都合というのはおそろしい。お母さんと赤ちゃんの体のリズムの最高の瞬間に、赤ちゃんはきっと生まれてくるのだ。それを科学の力で無理やりにその日に生ませてしまうとは何という罪悪・・・（これは泥棒より悪い。知らないとはいえ悪徳の極みだ！だから、幸せに生きれる訳がない。）
出産日が決まっているのは、児頭が産道と比較して大きく経膣分娩に耐えられないと判断され、帝王切開を要するためであろう。帝王切開を行うとなれば、安全のためにスタッフの充実している平日の昼間に予定して行うのは当然である。また、経膣分娩の可否について産科の病院の医師の判断が正しく、吉村先生の判断が間違っていたのは経過から明らかである。にも関わらず、このコラムの筆者は、予定帝王切開を泥棒より悪い悪徳だと批判している。なぜそんなに帝王切開が悪いのか？
吉村医院で産まれた赤ちゃんは、顔立ちがちがう。目の輝きがちがう。心の安定がちがうらしい。生まれてすぐ、バッチリとまぶたをひらいてこの世界を見つめる。へそのおをつけたままの赤ちゃんは、さっきまでお腹の中にいたお母さんの胸の中でずっと時間をすごす・・・生まれたての赤ちゃんをみて、お母さんや周りの人たちがそろってその神秘に満ちた光景に驚きと感動をいだくという。お母さんは、よそでは味わえないその出産の感動にまたすぐにでも子供を産みたいと、心から幸せを感じるらしい。
児や母体の安全のために帝王切開を選択せざるを得なかった母親が読んだらどう思うだろう？帝王切開で生まれた子供たちは、吉村医院で生まれた子と比較して、目の輝きが劣るのか。心が不安定なのか。帝王切開での出産では、心から幸せを感じることができないのか。百歩譲って、自分の子が自然分娩で問題なく生まれたのであれば、無知ゆえにそう言ってしまうのも分からないでもない。しかし、コラムの筆者の場合は、吉村医院で3日間ねばったあげく、結局は「近代医療」に頼ることになったのではないか。「近代医療」を行う病院へ転送されなければ、児どころか母体の生命も失われたと思われるが、その母体を救ってくれた病院をどのように書いているか。
大病院でゆきは、手首にバーコードをつけられ、工場のベルトコンベアーで流されるように手術室へ入っていった。マニュアルのように繰り返される看護婦さんの一見、やさしげな言葉もゆきの心には届かず、時間どおりに手術は終わった。
何もかもがピカピカであらゆる設備が整った最先端の病院のなかで、時間どおりに無表情な看護婦さんが忙しそうに診察をくり返していく。
目が死んでいる。心が死んでいる。
この世界をつつむ東洋の宇宙観（易ともいう）に比べれば、科学や医学といった形而下学的事象というのは、ほんのつめの先ほどの幼稚な認識でしかないのに。そんな世界でしか生きていない人たちは、きっと本当の幸せを知らないのであろう。
「 世界をつつむ東洋の宇宙観」とやらは、母体の命を救うのになんら貢献しなかった。一方で、「ほんのつめの先ほどの幼稚な認識」が母体の命を救ったのだ。現代の日本で、マクロビオティックやらオーガニック料理やらの贅沢が許されているのは、科学や医学の発展のおかげである。幼稚な認識とはいったいどちらなのか。もうこのぐらいにしておきたいのだが、続きがある。このコラムを最後まで読んで、私は何とも言えない感情に襲われた。現代医学や科学の不当な評価・無理解に対する怒りではない。強いて言えば、恐怖である。
2005 年 12月11 日 ゆきまつはうまれた。
2005 年 12月13 日 ゆきまつが死んだ。ゆきが降っていた。
「 さよなら・・・」と僕たちに語りかけているようだった。
僕たちにとって、この上なく幸せなお産だった・・・ゆきまつが3日間、僕たちのところへやって来てくれた。いつもの古屋の見える吉村医院の心地よい部屋の中で、僕は、おだやかに眠るゆきとゆきまつをみていた・・・幸せを感じていた。
ゆきまつは、僕たちの最高の幸せの瞬間に、何も言わずにひとりで静かに遠い空へ旅立ってしまった。
吉村先生は、僕たちに幸せな3日間をくれた。陣痛の間、２万人の赤ちゃんをとりあげた吉村先生には、ゆきまつの声がきっと聞こえていたのだろう。己の運命を知りつつ、ゆきまつは僕とゆきのあいだにうまれて来てくれた。最後の瞬間でさえ、ゆきまつは吉村先生の手の中で、生きようとしていた。命の火が、きえた・・・
児は出生後3日目に亡くなった。その3日間を与えたのは吉村先生ではない。現代医療である。現代医療がなければその3日間どころか、母体も死亡していた。そもそも、自然分娩にこだわらず、初めから帝王切開を選択していれば、児が死ぬことはなかったろう。我が子の犠牲を目の当たりにし、選択の過ちを悔い自然分娩はときに危険なものであることに気が付いたというのなら、まだ理解できる。しかし、コラムの筆者は我が子が亡くなってもなお、吉村先生に感謝している。我が子の命よりも、「本当の幸せ」とやらのほうが大事であるらしい。私は、我が子イサクを殺していけにえとして神にささげようとしたアブラハムの逸話を思い出した。死んだ児は「幸せなお産」のために、いけにえになったのだ。ただ、見方を変えれば、コラムの筆者が吉村先生に感謝し続けるのも当然なのかもしれない。吉村先生を批判する気持ちが生じた瞬間、我が子の死にもっとも責任があるのは誰か？我が子を殺したのは誰か？という問いに対峙しなければならないからである。その問いに答えるのは絶え難いものであろう。
私はこの話が吉村医院を中傷するために誰かがでっちあげた捏造であることを切に願う。しかし、そのためだけに、お店のサイトをまるまる作り上げるだろうか。細部はともかくとして大筋は事実であると考えざるを得ない。少なくとも、このコラムの筆者が「オーガニック料理やマクロビオティックに好意的な顧客は、他院で帝王切開の適応ありと診断された初産の骨盤位の妊婦を経膣分娩にこだわって3日間もねばって結局は出生児は死亡したが幸せなお産であったという話に共感するだろう」と考えているのは事実であり、もうそれだけで私は恐怖を感じる。
SORRY -- some of the links below lead to COMING SOON -- they should be up relatively soon .
Now that Super Tuesday 's Over . . .
This page outlines how to get a Fair Count for
Ron Paul for President in 2008
The last time a Presidential candidate emerged on the national stage who was threatening to overturn the planned outcome -- was 1996 .
The candidate was Pat Buchanan .
Now , in 2008 , another candidate has emerged who is threatening to overturn the planned outcome .
That candidate is Congressman Ron Paul .
This page looks simple -- and is not flashy .
But it is probably the only place you can find out about how the Ruling Elite runs a votefraud syndicate in the USA -- and how we , the people , can stop this criminal syndicate from votefrauding Ron Paul in 2008 .

The Heart of this page are the Open Letters to Hon. Congressman Ron Paul , His Presidential Campaign Staff , and His Supporters .
As this page is updated on December 11 , 2007 -- part one was already unheeded , and resulted in disaster .
Part II has not been followed .
Part III is an attempt to avert what the NeoCons have planned after January 1 , 2008 .
The reader can watch events unfold , but we still have hope that the decks will be cleared in at Ron Paul headquarters , and people with the " fire " of the grassroots supporters will replace the quizzical people now running the campaign .
A corollary to the Open Letters is :

" Must Read " Quotes : the Collier Brothers on computerized votefraud , -- and the one - time Dan Rather CBS News Report ( Nov. 7 , 1988 ) on computerized votefraud
Sometime rather alarmingly late in the Mathematica 6 release cycle it started to emerge that Stephen had a bunch of people working on an insane idea : including in Version 6 an entirely new set of features never before considered and definitely not on the release plan .
Somehow this did n’t surprise anyone .
It was to be a system whereby people could access large amounts of useful data by way of simple function calls inside Mathematica , with those calls automatically going off to our servers to get updated information , or even real - time feeds like current stock prices .
Needless to say , none of the server - or client - side technology to make this possible existed , but hey , it sounded like a good idea .
It turned out to be a very good idea .
As discussed in my previous blog post about building interfaces in five minutes , Mathematica is a great system for building interfaces in five minutes ( or less ) .
An example like this is marvelously simple :
But there ’s no depth to it , and frankly once you ’ve seen one interactive trig function , you ’ve seen ’em all .
It ’s a great technology demonstration , and you can clearly see where you might go with it to make something really useful , but it is not , in and of itself , really all that great .
The problem is that to add richness and real - world texture to an example generally requires a lot of stuff — either a lot of code or a lot of data — and how can you do that in five minutes ?
This is one of the problems that data functions solve .
( Data functions are also very useful for more serious work , but I ’m concentrating here on what you can do in five minutes or less . )
Suppose that instead of having the slider move a sine function around , you want to have it flip through the historical charts of GDP for all the NATO countries .
How many lines of code would that take ?
The answer is two :
Manipulate[DateListPlot[CountryData[c , { {" GDP " } , { 1970 , 2005}} ] , PlotLabel -> c ] ,
{c , CountryData [ " NATO " ] , ControlType -> Slider} ]
That ’s a lot of richness and depth for two lines of code .
You might even learn something .
This example is possible because we have a data function , called CountryData , that lets you get a large fraction of the available quantitative data about all the world ’s countries , instantly .
The key idea — the brilliance of it — is to stop thinking about this data as something in a table , or a database , and start thinking about it just like any other mathematical function .
Instead of “ sine of x , ” it ’s “ GDP of country . ”
CountryData [ " France " , " GDP " ]
2.12658x1012
CountryData [ " France " , " GDP " , " Units " ]
USDollarsPerYear
You can , if you like , think of this as a call into a database , with the arguments being the equivalent of the query language .
But many of the problems inherent in things like SQL go away when you have a powerful symbolic language , rather than a rigidly structured query syntax , to use inside the queries .
And even more so when you have a powerful symbolic language to wrap around the queries to arrange and refine the data .
It ’s really more productive to forget about the database aspect of things and just think of data functions like any other Mathematica functions that return answers , and that can be used just like Table , Integrate or Factor .
In particular , do n’t worry about calling the data functions many times : they cache cleverly and are very fast after the initial download or update .
Another example :
We ’ve got a data function for chemical compounds .
Here ’s the call you need to get the names of all the compounds we know about that contain the strings “ chloro ” followed by “ hex ” in their name :
ChemicalData [ " * chloro*hex * " ]
{ Hexachlorocyclohexane ( MixedIsomers ) , Dichlorobis( 2 - Chlorocyclohexyl )
Selenium ,
Dichlorobis( 2 - Ethoxycyclohexyl )
Selenium , Trichloro [ 2-( 3 - Cyclohexen - 1 - yl )
Ethyl ] silane ,
Trichloro( Cyclohexylmethyl )
Silane , Alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane , Beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane ,
Delta-Hexachlorocyclohexane , 1,6 - Dichlorohexane , 1,5 - Dichlorohexamethyltrisiloxane ,
Trans-1,2-Dichlorocyclohexane , 2,2,6,6-Tetrachlorocyclohexanol ,
2,3,4,5,6,6-Hexachloro-2,4-Cyclohexadienone , 2,2-Dichlorohexanal , 1,2-Dichlorohexafluorocyclopentene}
And here ’s the single line of code you need to display all their 3D structural plots ( minus a few that are missing for whatever reason ) :
Map [ ChemicalData[ # , " MoleculePlot " ] & , ChemicalData [ " * chloro*hex * " ] ]
I ’m sorry , but if that is n’t amazing , I do n’t know what is .
Keep in mind that Mathematica is not a system focused on dealing with chemistry or molecular modeling , or anything like that .
If it were , this example would n’t be amazing .
Any chemical structure database program that ca n’t do this pretty easily should be ashamed of itself .
But Mathematica is n’t such a program , it ’s a general system with this being just a bit of top - level code .
In other words , this is n’t a special case : there are a million other things in most any field you care to name that you can do just as easily .
( Did I mention that in Mathematica you can click and rotate any of those molecules in real time ? )
Another example : GraphPlot is an amazing function , able to automatically lay out networks of connected nodes and edges .
Here ’s a lovely collection of connected graphs generated using the Mod function to determine connectivity :
GraphPlot [ Table [i -> Mod [ i^2 , 234 ] , {i , 300} ] ]
Pretty , but abstract .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with purely mathematical structure , but in my mind this Mod graph example does not even begin to compare with the next example , which uses a data function ( the graph is very large ; click the small image to blow it up to a size where you can see individual nodes , and scroll around to study the whole thing ) :
GraphPlot [ Flatten [ Map [ Function [{n} ,
Map[n -> # & ,
Select [ IsotopeData[n , " DaughterNuclides " ] , StringQ ] ] ] , IsotopeData [ ] ] ] ]
What is this , DNA or something ?
No , it ’s a complete map of every radioactive decay chain of every isotope that ’s ever been measured , showing how all the elements and isotopes are linked to each other .
It represents what must be hundreds of billions of dollars in government nuclear research over decades : 3,150 isotopes , thousands of decay modes , all read into Mathematica and plotted , in two lines of code .
It also represents a profound image of astonishing richness and complexity that reveals something poetic about the structure of the chemical elements .
It is deep , it rewards study .
It is a moving testimony to how far we have come as a civilization , to know this much about a subject that did n’t even exist when people alive today were born .
You just do n’t do that in two lines of code .
I forgive you for thinking these are just special cases , lucky accidents and hand - picked examples .
All I can say is , learn the language , and you will see why they are not flukes .
This is a rendering of the sculpture Soliton by Bathsheba Grossman , as output by the CandyFab 4000 ; it ’s a three - dimensional form made out of pure sugar .
Seeing Bathsheba ’s sculptures at the 2006 Maker Faire was the inspiration for us to build the machine in the first place , so it ’s quite exciting to be able to print this .
( The design is used by her kind permission– please buy some of her sculptures ! )
This is our second try at fabbing this difficult shape .
Our first attempt was at a somewhat smaller size and ran into trouble with the thin beams when * one * of our thin horizontal layers turned out to be too weakly bonded .
To avoid a second failure , we enlarged the model but also ran the heater element very hot and for an extended period of time to make the pixels srong , but also larger , more rounded , and richer in color– a darker caramel .
In this view we ’re looking right down at the printed layers of sugar ; we think that the grain of the layers makes this look a lot like a wood carving .
Of course , that ’s not all that we ’ve been printing this week .
Here is one more large - scale object that we made :
The auto industry is bracing itself for its biggest shift since Henry Ford used an assembly line to roll out Model Ts .
The race to develop and implement a new kind of fuel – both environmentally - conscious and affordable – has been going on for years now , but we ’re still a while away from a full - scale gasoline overhaul .
Ethanol , biodiesel , hydrogen , and lithium batteries are all vying for the title of gas killer , but there ’s a new contender making a lot of noise – and that contender is …air ?
Well , compressed air .
Moteur Development International ( MDI ) is a research and development firm that has tinkered with the concept of an Air Car for nearly fifteen years .
Based in Nice , France , engineers at MDI now say their latest design , the MiniCAT – CAT stands for Compressed Air Technologies – is ready for production .
More importantly , Tata Motors ( India ’s largest automotive manufacturer ) seems to concur , and have agreed to initially build several thousand of these vehicles , with plans for expansion in the next couple years for production both in India and Europe .
How it Works
In a MiniCAT , compressed air is stored in a tank underneath the vehicle and funnels into pistons where it expands to about 15 times the compressed level .
The decrompression of the air creates pressure to push the pistons which propels the car .
The expansion of the air also creates a by - product of cold air that can be used to run the air - conditioning .
The end result is an efficient engine generating plenty of power and having zero emissions .
The biggest hurdle for any new fuel is in its availability and distribution .
Here air has an obvious advantage .
Compressed - air “ pumps ” are inexpensive to manufacture and implement on a large scale , and as a renewable and abundant resource , air fill - ups would be far cheaper than gasoline is today .
Some estimate that a full tank of air – which for a MiniCAT is about 200 miles of driving – could be as little as $ 3 .
Also in development is the CityCAT , which uses a dual - function engine to generate higher speeds and a longer range .
The compressed air system is still central to propulsion , but a second system is added that takes over at speeds over 35 mph .
This system is similar to General Motors ’ Flex Fuel technology , meaning it can run on gasoline , biodiesel , ethanol , or other sources .
When the second system is running it generates air that can be compressed and stored for later use by the central system .
Introducing it to the Populace
MDI has built compressed air engines with 2 , 4 , and 6 cylinders and is looking for the best way to introduce their vehicles to the market .
One goal is a taxi fleet – after all , taxis drive a lot more than the rest of us and are a good way to generate buzz .
MiniCATS seem built for the city , and with several urban hubs in Europe considering a ban on gasoline - powered vehicles , the air - powered vehicle could be a popular choice indeed .
CityCATs , despite their name , are made more for the suburban commuter .
The Tata Motors agreement is a major first step in a very long walk .
The Indian manufacturer has quickly become one of the world ’s largest automakers , specializing in large trucks and buses .
MDI has already built concept versions of pick - up trucks and vans for their fuel systems , and even larger vehicles are likely in the works .
No final figures on pricing have been determined , but Tata and MDI estimate that MiniCATs would be around the equivalent of $ 10,000 in euros .
Both vehicles are quick and nimble on city streets , with comparable acceleration to other economy - class cars .
The higher - cylinder versions can provide more boost , but the MiniCAT tops out at around 68 mph , so it can get out on the freeway if it must .
This flexibility would be more important in the U.S. should MDI expand production to our shores .
For more on these vehicles , check out MDI ’s website .
Already some are beginning to eulogize gasoline as a thing of the past – ethanol and other resources are certainly gunning for it .
But in this race for the future , a late entrant might have what it takes to win it all .
Compressed air systems are easy to manufacture , distribute , and replenish .
Time will tell if running on air will have an entirely new meaning .

For a few weeks now I ’ve been tinkering with , learning about , and falling in love with Erlang .
I ’ve been noticing the buzz about Erlang over the past few months , but two things won me over : the Erlang video and how amazingly simple and elegant concurrency and message passing is .
For the past few weeks I ’ve been reading the Erlang documentation , Joe Armstrong ’s new book , reading the trapexit wiki , and lurking in #erlang on irc.freenode .
net .
If you ’re wading in the erlang waters , I highly suggest just about every link in this wonderful roundup of beginners erlang links .
After a few weeks of reading and tinkering in the shell I decided that it was time to come up with a quick project to hone my Erlang skills .
I had tinkered with ISBN validation and conversion while writing a small django application to catalog the books on the bookshelf , so I thought that was a good place to start .
The Wikipedia page and my collection of ISBN links provided me with more than enough guidance on validation , check digit generation , and conversion .
I found it very easy to build this module from the ground up : start with ISBN - 10 check digit generation , then use that to build an ISBN - 10 validator .
I did a similar thing with ISBN - 13 , writing the check digit generator and then the ISBN - 13 validator .
From there I was able to build on all four public functions to write an ISBN - 10 to ISBN - 13 converter as well as an ISBN - 13 to ISBN - 10 converter ( when that is a possibility ) .
In the process of this very simple module I ended up learning about and applying accumulators , guards , the use of case , and lots of general Erlang knowledge .
Here ’s a peek at how the module works .
After downloading it via google code or checking out the latest version via Subversion , the module needs to be compiled .
This is easily accomplished from the Erlang shell ( once you have Erlang installed of course ) :
mcroydon $ erl Erlang ( BEAM ) emulator version 5.5.4 [ source ] [ async - threads:0 ] [ kernel - poll:false ] Eshell V5.5.4 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > c( 'isbn.erl ' ) .
{ok , isbn}
After that we can use any of the exported functions :
2> isbn:validate_13 ( [ 9,7,8,1,9, 3,4,3,5,6,0,0,5 ] ) .
true
Let ’s trace the execution of a simple function , check_digit_ 10/ 1 .
The function expects a list of 9 numbers ( the first 9 numbers of an ISBN - 10 ) and returns the check digit as either an integer or the character ' X ' .
The first thing that the function does is check to see if we ’ve actually passed it a 9 - item list :
check_digit_10 ( Isbn ) when length ( Isbn ) /= 9 -> throw ( wrongLength ) ;
This is accomplished with a simple guard ( when length ( Isbn ) /- 9 ) .
If that guard is n’t triggered we move on to the next function :
check_digit_10 ( Isbn ) -> check_digit_10 ( Isbn , 0 ) .
This forwards our list of 9 numbers on to check_digit_ 10 / 2 ( a function with the same name that takes two arguments .
We ’ll see in a minute that the 0 I ’m passing in will be used as an accumulator .
The next function does most of the heavy lifting for us :
check_digit_10 ( [ H|T ] , Total ) -> check_digit_10 ( T , Total + ( H * ( length ( T ) + 2 ) ) ) ;
This function takes the list , splits it in to the first item ( H ) and the rest of the list ( T ) .
We add to the total as specified in ISBN - 10 and then call check_digit_ 10 / 2 again with the rest of the list .
This tail - recursive approach seems odd at first if you ’re coming from most any object oriented language , but Erlang ’s function nature , strong list handling , and tail - recursive ways feel natural very quickly .
After we ’ve recursed through the entire list , it ’s time to return the check digit ( or 11 minus the total modulus 11 ) .
There ’s a special case if we get a result of 10 to use the character ‘ X ’ instead :
check_digit_10 ([ ] , Total ) when 11 - ( Total rem 11 ) =:= 10 -> ' X ' ;
Finally we return the result for the common case given an empty list :
check_digit_10 ([ ] , Total ) -> 11 - ( Total rem 11 ) .
Feel free to browse around the rest of the module and use it if you feel it might be useful to you .
I ’ve posted the full source to my isbn module at my isbnerl Google Code project , including the module itself and the module ’s EDoc documentation .
It is released under the new BSD license in hopes that it might be useful to you .
I learned quite a bit creating this simple module , and if you ’re learning Erlang I suggest you pick something not too big , not too small , and something that you are interested in to get your feet wet .
Now that I have the basics of sequential Erlang programming down , I think the next step is to make the same move from tinkering to doing something useful with concurrent Erlang .
I have more to say about the long - term budget situation , but I think Andrew 's right that we should move on .
So on another topic , I was reading Paul Krugman this morning and he was complaining about the lack of substance in the Republican campaign so far .
He compares the situation to 2000 when the Republicans nominated George W. Bush without really knowing what he thought about the issues .
Actually , with the benefit of hindsight it was pretty clear that Bush was no Reaganite , small - government kind of guy .
He gave plenty of speeches on the need to expand government for all kinds of things .
My friend Ed Crane of the Cato Institute is always reminding me that he wrote an article in the New York Times back in 1999 that fingered Bush 's big government proclivities pretty accurately .
It was also pretty clear that he was a foreign policy neocon .
In short , it was all there for those who knew what to look for .
My own excuse for not predicting the disaster that Bush 's presidency has been is that I simply did n't believe a word he said during the 2000 campaign .
I assumed that every word out of his mouth had been put there by Karl Rove and it was all based on polling and focus groups .
I knew that Bush is a bit of a dim bulb , so it never occurred to me that he actually had any ideas of his own .
I just assumed that he would be a rerun of his father .
I was never a big fan of George H.W. , even though I worked for him at the Treasury Department , but looking back I can appreciate that he had his virtues .
Bush 41 was at least a serious , responsible person -- exactly the opposite of his oldest son .
My point is that it is very easy to get cynical about politics and think it is all a game .
That was the mistake I made in 2000 , along with lots of other people .
If we do n't want to make the same mistake again , all of us who comment on politics need to pay closer attention to what these guys are saying and make some allowance for the possibility that they actually believe it .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
People complain about social conservatives needing to stay out of their bedrooms .
But globwarming greens are fooling around in every damned room in my house .
First of all it was the 1.6 gallon Al Gore toilet ( last item ) , introduced by Federal compulsion , which accomplished in two or three flushes what the ol ’ three - gallon Bemis could do in one .
And even if Sheryl Crow says she was joking about the infamous “ one square ” advice , the family of rich green wackos in Manhattan was n’t joking about not using any TP for a year .
And now , it ’s light bulbs .
I hate fluorescent lights .
They make everything look skeevy and bloodless and washed out .
I ca n’t avoid them at work , but I like to read and live by halogens and incandescents at home .
it ’s a luxury , I know , but a surprisingly affordable one–especially since they ’re cheaper than the fluorescent bulbs .
Where I can get away with fluorescent bulbs to save energy , I do .
The market sees to that .
But now the Democratic congress is going to try to mandate fluorescent bulbs everywhere .
( Link requires subscription . )
I guess the Obamessiah family ’s ongoing light switchover that Mark Steyn wrote about is just too slow , and so Congress had to do something .
Thing is , almost every business I have entered in the last decade or so has already switched over to fluorescent lights wherever they can .
It ’s the standard in warehouses , factories , and cubicle farms across the country .
When was the last time you saw an office lit by a table lamp ?
No , this one is aimed at the home consumer , who ca n’t be trusted to light his house in a pretty way .
Whatever rule is proposed by the groups would likely be incorporated into energy legislation passed last week by the Senate Energy Committee that the full chamber is set to debate by the end of the month , committee aides say .
This bill , the Democrats ’ first major energy initiative since taking control of Congress in January , calls for new efficiency standards for appliances and motor vehicles and mandates the use of more alternative fuels , such as ethanol , by 2022 .
While the move could face resistance from some consumer groups and from low - and fixed - income constituencies , Energy Committee aides say there is bipartisan support in Congress for a new lighting standard .
I ’m not certain why the market wo n’t take care of this .
It could n’t be that someone is making a profit , could it ?
Manufacturers expect over the next decade to provide consumers with other choices as well , since CFLs do n’t work as well in applications such as reading lamps .
“ It ’s the right thing to do , ” says Randall B. Moorhead , vice president for the North American affiliate of Royal Phillips Electronics NV of the Netherlands .
“ But we ’re also hoping we ’ll make some money .
It ’s not entirely altruistic . ”
No ?
Knock me over with a feather .
BUMPED : You guys in the comments are awesome .
I like the term “ Gore - bulbs ” and the suggestion we use Coleman lanterns instead .
I ’m bumping this because I hope it will be discussed more in the upcoming campaign .
For all the perceived busybodiness ( is that a word ? ) of the Christian right , there is an even more overwhelming busybodiness practiced by the Greenie Left who claim jurisdiction over any activity of your life that affects the environment .
It is a rights issue .
As commenter Buzzy observed :
It has little to do with CFLs and much more to do with individual freedoms .
When government tells me what bulbs I can use to light my house I draw the line and resume stocking the bunker .
It ’s one thing to convince me that CFLs are a better choice for intelligent energy consumption and quite another to take my choices away by government decree .
It is a rights issue , and this is just the first step .
Here ’s where it ’s going , under Euro / Blairite IngSoc :
Pressed to meet European Union targets for reducing landfill volume , many local councils now collect refuse only once every two weeks .
As flies and vermin gather while food scraps achieve a fine perfume , residents have grown so enraged that bin-men are under repeated physical attack .
The logic of fortnightly collections — if you can follow it — is to encourage recycling .
Lest widespread consternation over garbage seem petty , fortnightly collections now emblemize a broader source of indignation : the U.K. government ’s self - righteous “ green ” justifications for reduced services on the one hand , and thievery on the other .
Halving the frequency of waste removal conveniently saves money .
A host of other new “ green ” measures in the U.K. will make money : $ 200 fines for poorly separated recycling , or microchips implanted in wheelie bins to weigh residential refuse — dragging Britain ’s surveillance culture to a new low , and facilitating charges for waste disposal by the kilo .
Furious that they are already paying once for this service through local taxes , some householders have ripped the microchips from their bins . ….
Environmentalism has become the fashionable fig leaf to cover for extortion .
If a tax is “ green ” it is “ for the sake of the planet , ” and fairness does n’t come into it .
Neither , apparently , does greed .
Hence Britain ’s petrol duty — the fourth highest in the world at over $ 4 a gallon plus 17.5 % VAT levied on both the fuel and the duty ( in the U.K. , even taxes are taxed ) — has nothing to do with sticky fingers ; it ’s to confront the all - purpose bogeyman of global warming .
That ’s Lionel Shriver in the Wall Street Journal ; the piece is still behind the subscription wall but I hope it pops out on opinionjournal pretty soon .
People with libertarian instincts need to hear this–even if social conservatives might want to stop drugs , gay marriage , and abortion , the pseudo - religious zeal of the globwarmers knows no bounds and their coercive agenda is targeted at things that everybody does and uses : cars , light bulbs , garbage pickup .
And , as I said above , toilets .
Meanwhile , the people who do this live in energy - guzzling mansions , travelling on private jets , perhaps salving their conscience with expensive carbon offsets , while they figure out what kind of light bulb you will be able to buy .
Now that is an inconvenient truth .
Need something cooler to protect your garden than a stupid gnome , well if you have the room you could go with a Full - Size Camarasaurus Dinosaur Replica .
Yes that 's right , a lifelike and lifesize dinosaur right in your very own backyard .
The Camarasaurus is n't a tiny dino either , this majestic ancient lizard creature is nearly 20 feet tall and an incredible 55 feet in length .
Sure it 's an ultra-luxury item that will set you back around 50 grand , but think how crazy it will drive your annoying neighbors .
I ’ve seen a lot of photos of USA or Japan trucks looking very stylish after some big work of decorating .
But this one looks different .
And it can be met on roads of Russia – it ’s not from some art gallery .

Jon Stewart : How a ' tiny distinction ' between Obama and Clinton became a ' slugfest '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 3 , 2007
Print This Email This
On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart suggested that Barack Obama 's recent tough statement on taking direct action in Pakistan " was perhaps meant to counter a remark Obama made concerning talks that he would have with hostile foreign leaders . "
Stewart then played a clip of Obama saying , " The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous , "
" That 's how disputes are handled in middle school , " commented Stewart .
" Should n't countries operate like sixth graders ? "
Stewart then showed Hillary Clinton answering the same question by saying , " I will not promise to meet with the leaders of these countries during my first year . "
" Whoa ! ' exclaimed Stewart .
" Obama would be willing to meet with these leaders , and so would Hillary -- but no promise .
Although he did n't really promise it either .
How could Hillary take this tiny policy distinction to highlight her campaign 's narrative that Obama lacks experience ? "
Stewart then played clips of Clinton saying , " I thought that was irresponsible and frankly naive " and Obama coming back with , " I do n't want a continuation of Bush - Cheney .
I do n't want Bush - Cheney Lite . "
" Here 's a strange thing about Bush - Cheney Lite , " remarked Stewart .
" It actually has twice the calories .
You know why ?
Nothing they do makes sense . "
" I wonder what the media 's narrative of this will be ? " continued Stewart , playing clips of news hosts saying " Heavyweight boxing match ... slugfest ... clash of the titans ... battle of goliaths ... ugly ... ripping into each other . "

A space rock may have exploded in the air over North America
The blast may have wiped out one of America 's first Stone Age cultures as well as the continent 's big mammals such as the mammoth and the mastodon .
The blast , from a comet or asteroid , caused a major bout of climatic cooling which may also have affected human cultures emerging in Europe and Asia .
Scientists will outline their evidence this week at a meeting in Mexico .
Their impact theory should n't be dismissed ; it deserves further investigation
Jeff Severinghaus , Scripps Institution of Oceanography
These sediments contain exotic materials : tiny spheres of glass and carbon , ultra - small specks of diamond - called nanodiamond - and amounts of the rare element iridium that are too high to have come from Earth .
All , they argue , point to the explosion 12,900 years ago of an extraterrestrial object up to 5 km across .
No crater remains , possibly because the Laurentide Ice Sheet , which blanketed thousands of sq km of North America during the last Ice Age , was thick enough to mask the impact .
Another possibility is that it exploded in the air .
Climate cooling
The rocks studied by the researchers have a black layer which , they argue , is the charcoal deposited by wildfires which swept the continent after the explosion .
The Clovis people developed an advanced stone tool technology
Professor James Kennett , from the University of California in Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) , said the explosion could be to blame for the extinction of several large North American mammals at the end of the last Ice Age .
" All the elephants , including the mastodon and the mammoth , all the ground sloths , including the giant ground sloth - which , when standing on its hind legs , would have been as big as a mammoth , " he told the BBC .
" All the horses went out , all the North American camels went out .
There were large carnivores like the sabre - toothed cat and an enormous bear called the short - faced bear . "
Professor Kennett said this could have had an enormous impact on human populations .
Population decline
According to the traditional view , humans crossed from north - east Asia to America at the end of the last Ice Age , across a land bridge which - at the time - connected Siberia to Alaska .
The extinction of large North American beasts is a puzzle
Archaeologists have found evidence from the Topper site in South Carolina , US , that Clovis populations here went through a population collapse .
But there is no evidence of a similar decline in other parts of the continent .
The Clovis culture does vanish from the archaeological record abruptly , but it is replaced by a myriad of different local hunter - gatherer cultures .
The Tunguska event devastated parts of Siberia in 1908
According to the new idea , the comet would have caused widespread melting of the North American ice sheet .
The waters would have poured into the Atlantic , disrupting its currents .
This , they say , could have caused the 1,000 year - long Younger Dryas cold spell , which also affected Asia and Europe .
The Younger Dryas has been linked by some researchers to changes in the living patterns of people living in the Middle East which led to the beginning of farming .
A massive explosion near the Tunguska river , Siberia , in 1908 , is also thought to have been caused by a space rock exploding in the atmosphere .
It felled 80 million trees over an area of 2,000 sq km .
The new theory will be presented and debated at the American Geophysical Union 's Joint Meeting in Acapulco , Mexico , this week .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - For anyone waiting for a rebound in the slumping U.S. housing market , the industry ’s top executives have a piece of advice :
Do n’t hold your breath .
Robert Toll , chairman and chief executive officer of Toll Brothers Inc. , speaks at the Reuters Real Estate Summit in New York , June 27 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid ( UNITED STATES )
Home builders at the Reuters Real Estate Summit in New York this week said they did n’t expect any improvement until 2008 at the earliest .
And even then , their expectations are modest .
" '08 is probably not going to be a year of strong recovery , " said Larry Sorsby , executive vice president and chief financial officer at No. 6 U.S. home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. HOV.N
“ Our hope is that it stays no worse than we are today , ” Sorsby said .
“ We ’re not predicting any significant recovery . ”
After several years of torrid growth and rising prices , the U.S. home market has stalled , with rising interest rates now deterring prospective buyers .
New home sales in May fell 1.6 percent , a sharper - than - expected drop , according to data released on Tuesday .
Robert Toll , chairman and chief executive of luxury U.S. home builder Toll Brothers Inc. TOL.N , said he expected no pickup this year .
“ I see no reason to expect a change in confidence until probably April ‘ 08 , when the candidates will fairly well be settled for the presidential election , and we ’ll start to listen to speeches about how we ’ll get better , ” Toll said .
Reinforcing this grim view were quarterly losses reported this week by No. 2 U.S. home builder Lennar Corp. LEN.N and fifth - ranked KB Home .
KBH.N
The financial woes have weighed on home builder shares .
The Dow Jones U.S. home builder index .
DJUSHB is down about 25 percent so far this year .
The index is has lost about half its value since its July 2005 peak .
FLORIDA GONE SOUTH
Within the United States , the markets hit hardest by the downturn have been the ones where investors speculated heavily on properties where they did not plan to live .
Home builder executives cited Florida , which saw a flurry of building in 2004 and 2005 , as the worst housing market in the United States .
Even with discounts of $ 100,000 on some homes , builders said they had realized that some developments simply would not sell and were opting to just hold onto the land for a few years in hopes of a market pickup .
Toll had one word to sum up the Florida market : “ Bad . ”
“ There was a tremendous rocket ride up in Florida during the boom times , ” said Toll .
“ You had tremendous speculation in Florida , tremendous numbers of condo purchasers who had no intention of moving in , but just flipping the contract or flipping the real estate . ”
Hovnanian bought into Fort Myers , Florida , in August 2005 , just as the market crashed .
“ We were the perfect timing in terms of how not to do it , ” Sorsby said .
While Florida stands out as the darkest spot in a troubled market , New York City and particularly the borough of Manhattan , is the highlight , executives said .
Manhattan island property prices have benefited from a limited supply , a pickup in foreign buyers motivated by the weak dollar and a renewed desire for urban living , particularly among aging baby boomers , said Dottie Herman , president and CEO at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate .
Executives also said the District of Columbia was holding up well and noted that San Diego , one of the first markets to cool , has started to pick up .
SUBPRIME SHAKE-UP
The crisis in subprime lending -- loans to the least - creditworthy buyers -- further dampened the market by blocking some of the poorest buyers from it .
Subprime borrowers last year accounted for about 14 percent of U.S. home buyers .
But the crisis , which has commanded headlines with stories of layoffs at lenders and foreclosures on homes , has had a ripple effect .
“ Someone that is highly qualified is saying : ‘ Wait a second , maybe now is not the best time to buy a house .
Maybe there ’s another shoe to drop .
And therefore , rather than buy , I ’m going to wait a little bit longer , ’ ” said Hovnanian ’s Sorsby .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com , said that rising interest rates and tightening lending standards were making it all the harder for Americans to afford homes .
That suggests , he said , that sales will not rebound until people trying to sell their homes start cutting prices .
NOBODY marched to impeach Bill Clinton .
Angry citizens DIDN'T fill the streets , carry signs and beg a non-responsive Congress to do its Constitutional duty and remove Bill Clinton from his job .
Panels WEREN'T held across the nation , moderated by Constitutional scholars who loved their country so much that they traversed its full span to inform packed audiences of the high crimes Bill Clinton had done .
Nope .
That DIDN 'T happen .
In 1998 , thousands upon thousands of Americans DIDN'T call , write , fax and visit their elected leaders every day imploring them to impeach Bill Clinton .
Millions of citizens DIDN'T believe that the rest of the world wanted Bill Clinton impeached .
Groups of citizen activists DIDN'T band together to camp out at their Representatives ' homes and District Offices for days , sometimes weeks , holding " Impeach Bill Clinton " signs and wearing " Impeach Bill Clinton " T - shirts .
Thousands of cars DIDN'T bear " Impeach Bill Clinton " bumper stickers .
Nope .
That DIDN 'T happen .
Average citizens DIDN'T travel to Washington , DC to walk the Halls of Congress and seek audiences with their elected officials demanding to have Bill Clinton impeached .
Nuh-uh !
" Impeachment Centers " WEREN'T opened dedicated to impeaching Bill Clinton like the one in Los Angeles that opened on the Fourth of July , dedicated to impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney .
Hundreds of people DIDN'T join together in a park on a national holiday for an impeach - Bill - Clinton - rally the way they joined together in a park in Los Angeles on Wednesday for an impeach - Bush - and - Cheney - rally .
( http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-impeach5jul05,0,3983892.story?coll=la-home-center)
In 1998 , the people DIDN'T need to inspire Congress to impeach Bill Clinton .
The 105th Congress could n't wait to throw the popular President out of his job .
In fact they impeached Bill Clinton even though we - the - people implored them not to .
Of course , there were some Americans in 1998 who bought the smear and destroy campaign by the rabid Republican spin-machine and rabid Republican legislators to impeach Bill Clinton under the guise of restoring the Presidency .
These duped citizens were conned by mainstream media 's daily theatrics , directed by then - adulterer Congressman Henry Hyde , then - adulterer Speaker Newt Gingrich , then drug - addict Rush Limbaugh , future - indicted Congressman Tom Delay , and Special Pornographer Kenneth Starr .
( My apologies to Larry Flynt ) .
How ironic for Gingrich and Hyde that Clinton was caught with his pants down just as they were dropping theirs .
How further ironic that the lynchpin asserting the case for Clinton 's impeachment was Ken Starr 's obsessively compiled pornographic tome , whereas Americans today have a virtual library of scholarly books on the Constitutional merits of impeaching Bush and Cheney .
Thanks to Mr. Starr 's salacious expose , it is likely his lurid accounting of a private consensual affair will be his singular most powerful climax .
The fact is , during the 105th Congress 's impeachment of Bill Clinton , Clinton 's public APPROVAL rating was a positive 73 % .
Conversely , as the current 110th Congress takes NO action to impeach George W. Bush , Bush 's public APPROVAL ratings range between 28 and 36 % .
http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm.
This means that the people 's well - liked President Clinton was penalized , while the people 's despised President Bush is allowed to stay on .
If this is n't a failure of democracy of , for , and by the people , then what is ?
The 105th Congress 's impeachment of Bill Clinton was an elitist backlash to pummel an Arkansas poor - boy for dethroning the patriarch of the ruling class .
Unfortunately , the 110th Congress conforms to the same eliticism , refusing to impugn the progeny of that same ruling class .
The collapse of our democracy is in no small part due to the ideological similarities between the Republican and Democratic parties , fueled by cronyism and mutual corporate ties .
Sadly , Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Congress will rue the day they took impeachment off the table .
By disregarding the wishes of The People and making no effort to impeach Bush and Cheney , Speaker Pelosi will go down in history as the Speaker who permitted the most corrupt Administration in American history to perpetrate its crimes .
She has secured her legacy as the spineless leader of a spineless Congress that defied the Constitution and sanctioned Bush and Cheney 's lies .
The 110th Congress and its Speaker have become enablers , accomplices and accessories to the crimes .
The bottom line ...
Bush and Cheney have eighteen months left to their term .
During this time they are capable of many more egregious crimes .
Congress 's failure to initiate articles of impeachment for Bush and Cheney 's criminal acts is a breach of Congress 's Oath " to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign or domestic . "
If Pelosi and the 110th Congress do not uphold this Oath , they have secured their rightful places alongside Bush and Cheney as enemies of the state .
One final note : Members of both the House and the Senate have stated that impeachment is certain to fail .
Let it be known that if the current Legislative Branch does n't make an honest attempt at impeachment , they have already failed .
But
If they make an honest , heart - felt and diligent try , even if they fail , at least they have done their job .

Why dads should read to their children
If you enjoy this post , make sure you subscribe to Be A Good Dad to receive new posts in your email or feed reader
It seems that in a lot of houses things like reading to the kids , art projects and other of gentler interests default to the mom .
Give the kids a basketball and dad is all over it .
Ask him to read anything mentioning a sparkly pony and dad can not be found .
It is a stereotype and if the reading to the kids role is reversed in your house , then just change the dad to mom in the title .
In reality , both parents should read to the kids .
In fact , any adult or sibling that you can find should read to the kids for several reasons .
Variety of voice
When I studied Arabic at the Defense Language Institute , each class was taught by a group of native speakers ; people from Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Iraq , Syria , etc .
They tried to mix each teaching team to have each teacher for a class be from a different country and to have both male and female teachers .
The reason was to force the students to get used to hearing the language spoken with different accents , tones and paces .
It is very easy to get used to understanding the way almost any one person talks .
If you do n’t believe me , ask yourself why you always have to explain what your two year old said when your neighbor is around .
We all get used to certain tones and accents .
Having as many people as possible reading to your kids will broaden their ear and increase their comprehension .
Double reinforcement
If mom thinks reading is cool , the kids might decide it is worthwhile .
When dad also jumps on the bandwagon , the kids start to really think there must be something to this reading thing .
The more people that seem interested in reading will keep reinforcing that reading is something important and enjoyable .
Keeps dad involved
Literature is hugely important to kids .
They love nursery rhymes and silly lines in Dr. Seuss stories .
They also like to use those lines during the day .
If you are not reading those stories with the kids , you are not going to know why it is so funny to growl the word “ Rrrrrusty ” and you will be delegated to an outside observer of an important part of your kids ’ language development .
Bonding moment
In addition to just knowing what your kids are talking about , reading stories is a bonding moment .
The physical closeness of story time and the cuddling are going to bring you closer to your kids .
You will end up tickling them more often .
You will end up hugging them more often .
You will stroke their hair more often .
That ’s called bonding and your kids will love you for it .
Teach kids how to be calm
I read an article a while back about one of the important roles that dads teach their children .
Dads are the one who normally wrestle with the kids and tickle them until they beg for mercy and toss them in the air .
Dads get kids riled up .
When the playtime is over , dads show their kids how to calm back down .
Ask any kindergarten teacher how important and how difficult of a lesson this is to teach to a young boy or girl .
Reading is a very sedentary , calm event .
If the guy that just had them giggling and gasping for breath can now sit still with a book on his lap , your kids are going to learn how to do that , also .

Shelby Sendelbach , a sixth - grader in the Katy Independent School District , was read her rights , ticketed and punished with a mandatory four - month assignment to an alternative school because she wrote " I love Alex " on a gymnasium wall with a baby blue Sharpie .
The graffiti offense is a Level 4 infraction in the district 's discipline plan , along with making terroristic threats , possessing dangerous drugs , and assaulting with bodily injury .
Only a Level 5 — for murder , possessing firearms , committing aggravated or sexual assault , arson or other felonies — is more severe .
Shelby 's parents , Lisa and Stu Sendelbach , say they do not condone what their daughter did .
Nevertheless , they are fighting to get her punishment reduced because they believe it is too harsh .
The Sendelbachs said they expected a lesser punishment such as an in - school suspension and community service .
Shelby is assigned to alternative school from Aug. 27 through Dec. 21 .
A district - level appeal hearing is scheduled later this month .
" We are shocked that the school district rules as they are written make no distinction between what Shelby is accused of and what a gang member does with a can of black spray paint , " Stu Sendelbach said .
The 12 - year - old Mayde Creek Junior High student said she regrets the May 21 incident for which school police cited her for criminal mischief and the making of graffiti .
The graffiti offense is punishable as a felony because the marking was made in permanent ink .
Removal mandated
The Harris County district attorney 's office declined to prosecute the case as a felony .
But school district spokesman Steve Stanford said the district is following a state law that requires mandatory removal to a disciplinary alternative education school for such an offense .
The district 's discipline plan complies with the Texas Education Code .
Under it , a district can remove a student who commits a crime that is punishable as a felony .
An alternative school in Katy ISD is for students who have been suspended , expelled , committed crimes or who persistently misbehave .
Sendelbach said his daughter , who suffers from attention deficit disorder , does not have a history of misbehavior .
He said he was angered further when he saw the proliferation of graffiti in the bleacher area and accused the principal of " encouraging this activity by not removing these inscriptions . "
Another parent at the school , Patrick Prebo , agreed with Sendelbach , saying the punishment violates common sense .
His 12 - year - old daughter , Kaitlyn Inscore , was a participant in the graffiti incident and received the same punishment as Shelby .
" I think the school gave students explicit permission to write in that area when they left the graffiti on the bleachers , " he said .
The school 's principal , Rick Hull , declined to comment by phone on the graffiti .
The district is gathering information on previous incidents related to graffiti at the school .
Punishment defended
Shelby said she admitted to writing the graffiti when she was questioned by school district officials and police .
She signed a confession saying she wrote " I love Alex . "
She claimed another girl drew a heart around it .
Stanford , who said he could not discuss the specifics of the case because of privacy laws , defended the punishment , saying the district had no choice .
But Rep. Rob Eissler , R - The Woodlands , disagreed .
Eissler co-authored House Bill 603 in 2005 , which gives administrators more latitude to consider disciplinary history , intent , whether a student has a disability that would impair judgment or acted in self - defense in deciding punishment .
" They have all the leeway they want , " he said .
" They did n't have to hammer this young lady the way they did .
That 's why I wrote HB 603 — to give school districts authority to back off the black - and - white justice . "
Stanford said he is confident the district is following the law .
To critics such as Fred Hink , co-director of a parent advocacy group called Texas Zero Tolerance , incidents such as this are examples of rigid and absolute standards that school districts across the state use to impose excessive punishment for minor infractions .
" Equating a child that writes a simple line on an obscure area is not the same as a kid who brought marijuana to school — but in the eyes of some districts , especially Katy ISD , these children are equal , " Hink said .

Jay Leno : Hollywood ’s Biggest Car Collector
Featured

12/15/2006
Many people know the late night host of The Tonight Show as a first rate comedian who is the crown jewel in the NBC comedy crown .
But what many people do n’t know is that Jay is an avid car collector and an expert , as well .
Jay writes a frequent column in Popular Mechanics about cars and he ’s one of the magazines most popular contributors .
As for Jay ’s car collection , it ’s bordering on ridiculous .
He has approximately 85 cars and over 70 motorcycles in his collection .
Where does he park all these cars ?
On a football field - sized spread of warehouses in an industrial park in Burbank , California .
Jay is famous for driving a different car or bike from his collection every day to work .
His collection spans the entire life of the automobile , including a 1914 Auto Car , a 1909 Baker Electric and a 1915 Franklin featuring a Harley Earl build body .
But the collection is n’t just oldies .
Jay also sports an incredible array of speed machines , as well .
The collection boasts a host of Bughattis and Lamborghinis , as well as an actual F1 racing car from McLaren that is valued at well over a million dollars .
Jay ’s collection has brought him his fare share of fame , as well .
He ’s the first person ever to drive the pace car at every major NASCAR event , as well as the Indy 500 .
He even inspired an entire line of Hot Wheels based on his collection .
The cars are made with extra care and have become a bit of a collectors item on their own .
The Hot Wheels collection features miniatures of his Jaguar E - Type , as well as his Shelby Cobra and his Lamborghini Miura .
The cars sell for around $ 15 each , a bit more than a regular Hot Wheels car .
It should n’t be a surprise that Jay ’s love of cars started early .
His first ever job was working at an auto dealer in 1967 .
The first car he ever owned ?
A simple 1934 Ford pickup truck .
Jay ’s car collection has gotten to be such a popular topic for conversation that NBC has actually given Jay a separate website , found at www.jaylenosgarage.com, which offers live , streaming video of Jay ’s collection , commentary on his favorite cars and tons of information about the collection , in general .
Many of the articles that Jay pens for Popular Mechanics also appear on this website .
Jay has also made a habit of exhibiting his collection when he gets a chance .
At a recent Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tournament , Jay showed off some of his collection next to some other amazing cars .
One of the favorites ?
Jay ’s 1934 Duesenberg J Murphy convertible coupe in a beautiful pea green with enough polished chrome to make anyone jealous .
Jay also brings his cars onto
The Tonight Show when he can and they have become so popular he is considered the most famous ( or at least the most popular ) classic car collector in the U.S .
When it is all said and done , Jay will be known as the man who replaced Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show and brought the decades - old program to new heights .
But he ’ll also be known as one of the most famous and popular car collectors who has taught millions of people about restoration , collecting and respecting the world ’s amazing automotive past .

Your Comments
The Democrats should not have caved in to the president .
They should have continued to send him bills with a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
So he vetoes them .
Eventually the president himself would cut off funds for the troops .
As an alternative , Congress could inform the president that unless he accepts a timetable for withdrawal , Congress will stop funding the war .
If the Democrats are sincere in their claimed desire to end the war , this is the way to do it .
The power of the purse rests firmly in the hands of Congress .
No matter what the president desires to do , if Congress refuses to fund it , the president is helpless .
He cannot spend a dime that Congress has not authorized and appropriated .
The American people should realize this and understand it clearly .
The power to end the war in Iraq rests entirely in the hands of Congress .
No president can force Congress to authorize and appropriate any money at all , for any purpose .
Thus , a majority in the House and Senate , if they truly desire to end the war , have the power to do so right this very moment .
The president can only veto a bill he receives ; he can not veto a bill that does n’t exist .
Therefore , Congress can simply ignore his requests for war funding and go about its business as if it had never received any .
When the ammunition , petrol and other supplies run out , the president and the Pentagon will have no choice but to withdraw from Iraq .
Democrats , of course , are afraid of being accused of “ not supporting the troops . ”
This is a contradiction .
You ca n’t end a war and continue to support troops who are fighting it at the same time .
The only way to end the war is to pull the plug .
Wars can not be fought without money .
Once a president realizes that no more money is coming , he will have no choice but to begin a withdrawal .
The war party in this country , which consists mainly of Republicans but also includes some Democrats , are as fond of slogans as Hitler ’s Third Reich .
One such slogan is that if we pull out of Iraq , the “ enemy ” will follow us home .
That ’s propaganda and devoid of truth .
Those enemies in Iraq who just want us out of their country will not follow us home .
They have no reason to do so .
Lord knows they will have enough to do just trying to salvage their country .
As for al - Qaeda , it does n’t have to follow us home ; it ’s already here .
Al - Qaeda is neither a nation nor an army ; it ’s a movement , and it maneuvers through the Internet .
Bush ’s slogan implies that our forces are tying al - Qaeda ’s forces down in Iraq .
Most of al - Qaeda ’s people are not even in Iraq .
What the war is doing is assisting al - Qaeda in recruiting individuals .
Starting with the first Gulf War and continuing with the sanctions , the United States has visited upon Iraq immense destruction , pain and suffering .
The Iraqi people never did anything to deserve that .
I seriously doubt the Iraqi people will ever forgive us .
If I were an Iraqi , I would n’t .
The only way to put an end to terrorism is for the United States to begin to undo some of the evil it has done .
We have wronged the Iraqi people .
We have wronged the Palestinian people .
Whenever anyone decides to kill Palestinians , we always side with their killers , as the U.S. does with Israel and now with the Lebanese Army , so busy shelling a Palestinian refugee camp .
Where was this Lebanese Army when Israel invaded Lebanon ?
It was hiding .
I do n’t see how any of the Lebanese Army can stand to look in a mirror .
CHEBARKUL , Russia ( Reuters ) -- President Vladimir Putin said on Friday security threats had forced Russia to revive the Soviet - era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders .
A Russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside Moscow during an air show .
Putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across Russia in the early hours of Friday on long - range missions .
" We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis , " Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia 's Ural mountains .
" Today , August 17 at 00:00 hours , 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country , along with support and refueling aircraft ...
From today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis .
" We hope our partners will treat this with understanding . "
At U.S. President George W. Bush 's Texas ranch , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the United States .
" Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities , so this is not entirely surprising , " he said .
But the sorties are likely to add to Western concern about Russia 's growing assertiveness .
That trend has prompted some U.S. policymakers to draw parallels with the Cold War .
Do n't Miss Russia resumes nuke bomber sorties
Putin caused a stir this year by saying Russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in Europe if Washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern Europe .
Russian diplomats have clashed with the United States and European governments on issues such as Kosovo , energy , and Moscow 's treatment of its ex-Soviet neighbors .
Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period .
One Western defense official called the flights " a little bit of chest - pounding , trying to let people know Russia is back in the game " .
Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992 , other military powers had not reciprocated .
" Flights by other countries ' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation , " Putin said .
That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO , whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long - range missions .
As Putin spoke to reporters and television cameras , four Russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while Russian tanks trundled behind him , even though the exercises had ended long before .
During the Cold War , Russian long - range bombers , which can carry strategic nuclear weapons , played elaborate games of cat - and - mouse with Western air forces .
Earlier this month Russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the Pacific island of Guam , where the U.S. military has a base , and " exchanged smiles " with U.S. pilots scrambled to track them .
The Pentagon said the Russian aircraft had not come close enough to U.S. ships to prompt American aircraft to react .
In July , two Russian Tu-95 " Bear " bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea , leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them .
Russia 's air force said later it was a routine flight .

Waterfront protesters decry cost of war
Peace vigils will be held weekly on parkway
By NIKIE MAYO - News Editor
With beach music playing in the distance , a handful of protesters gathered on Stewart Parkway Friday night to say the war in Iraq is costing too much — in lives and in dollars .
“ This is a deadly war and an expensive war , ” said Washington resident Susan Scherer .
“ This is n’t something that ’s just happening over there ; it ’s happening here .
And people , even people here in eastern North Carolina , need to be concerned . ”
[…]
Seibert said she obtained city permits to be able to set up near the waterfront .
That setup includes an “ Impeach Bush ”  petition that had garnered about 20 signatures Friday night .
The group will gather on the parkway every Friday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. through the end of August .
After that , Seibert and the people gathered with her will regroup if necessary .
( Original Article )
The corporate media are disgracing themselves even further , if that is possible , on the impeachment story .
On Thursday , three more members of Congress signed on to Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s bill to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney ( H Res 333 ) , bringing the total number of co-sponsors of the bill to 10 .
That in itself would be national news , but there is more to it than simple numbers .
The new sponsors include two freshman , Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison , who ran for office calling for impeachment , and Hank Johnson , who took over the seat of pro-impeachment Rep. Cynthia McKinney ( McKinney filed her own bill of impeachment against President Bush in the waning days of the last Congress ) , but the group also includes Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) .
What makes McDermott significant is that he is a senior member of the Washington state delegation to Congress , a 9th - term legislator with considerable clout in Congress who sits on the House Ways and Means and Judiciary Committees , who chairs the subcommittee on income security and family support , and who has , in the past , said he was opposed to impeachment .
While most of the other nine co-sponsors of H Res 333 were also among the group of 39 representatives who last year had signed on to Rep.
John Conyers ’ bill in the last Congress calling for creation of a special committee to investigate possible impeachable crimes by the administration , McDermott was never a backer .
In a related development , Kucinich ’s bill , which was filed back on April 24 , amid an almost complete news blackout , and which has languished for over two months , with the House Judiciary Committee , headed by Conyers ( D - MI ) taking no action on it , suddenly was referred this week to a Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties , chaired by US Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) — a sign that it will be taken up by the full Judiciary Committee .

BANANA REPUBLICANISM , CONT’D…. Quote of the day , from Thomas Sowell :
When I see the worsening degeneracy in our politicians , our media , our educators , and our intelligentsia , I ca n’t help wondering if the day may yet come when the only thing that can save this country is a military coup .
Now that ’s a comforting , conservative thought , is n’t it ?
I wonder what Buckley thinks of NRO publishing stuff like this ?

Fears of US attacks on Iran grow as media campaign heats up Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 10 , 2007
Print This Email This Cheney continues to urge Iran strike
At a press conference on Thursday , President Bush delivered an apparent threat against Iran , stating , " One of the main reasons that I asked Ambassador Crocker to meet with Iranians inside Iraq was to send the message that there will be consequences for people transporting , delivering EFPs , highly sophisticated IEDs , that kill Americans in Iraq . "
Neither Bush nor the State Department would elaborate on the meaning of " consequences . "
However , McClatchy Newspapers reports that " the president 's top aides have been engaged in an intensive internal debate over how to respond to Iran 's support for Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq and its nuclear program .
Vice President Dick Cheney several weeks ago proposed launching airstrikes at suspected training camps in Iraq run by the Quds force , a special unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , according to two U.S. officials who are involved in Iran policy . "
The Guardian reported in July that Cheney has been continuing to press for military action against Iran .
When Larry King asked Cheney in an interview on July 31 , " " Would you make an overt move on Iran ? "
Cheney said with a grin , " For what reason ? "
He then added , " I 'm not going to speculate about prospective operations . "
Media campaign against Iran accelerates
The degree of responsibility than can be placed on Iran and the Shiite groups it supports for current attacks in Iraq is not clear .
Until recently the US tended to blame most Iraqi violence on Sunni insurgents and al Qaeda .
However , what McClatchy describes as a " growing drumbeat of allegations about Iranian meddling in Iraq " appearing in US media is beginning to remind observers of the media campaign in 2002 that led up to the invasion of Iraq .
For example , in Wednesday 's New York Times , Michael Gordon reported that " attacks on American - led forces using a lethal type of roadside bomb said to be supplied by Iran reached a new high in July , according to the American military .
...
Such bombs , which fire a semi-molten copper slug that can penetrate the armor on a Humvee and are among the deadliest weapons used against American forces , are used almost exclusively by Shiite militants .
American intelligence officials have presented evidence that the weapons come from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran , although Tehran has repeatedly denied providing lethal assistance to Iraqi groups . "
The bombs Gordon described are the " EFPs , highly sophisticated IEDs " that Bush referred to at his press conference the next day .
According to Editor & Publisher , Bush 's statement " was reminiscent of the day in September 2002 when Cheney and other officials went on Sunday talk shows and touted the now - infamous Gordon - Judith Miller front - pager in the Times on the ' aluminum tubes ' in Iraq and the possible ' mushroom cloud ' on the horizon .
The Times , and Gordon specifically , have been giving the unproven Iranian IED charges far more prominent play than any other major news outlet . "
Since last February , Gordon has written a series of articles promoting the administration charges against Iran , claims that , as blogger Glenn Greenwald points out , " amount to an accusation that the Iranian Government , at its highest levels , is directing fatal attacks on American troops in Iraq , which constitutes , of course , an act of war . "
RAW STORY reported in February that Gordon 's article appeared to violate the Times ' own policy against using unidentified sources .
Gordon 's July 2 article was sourced solely to statements by Brig .
Gen. Kevin J. Bergner , formerly a special assistant to the president , who had left the White House to become the spokesman for the US military in Iraq only three weeks previously .

2019 Wine storage
How and why to build a wine cellar ?
Wines can be stored in cellars or racks .
Herebelow are the proper conditions .
A wine closet
Look around your home for a dark , quiet place with a constant temperature and no vibration .
If you choose a closet , it is preferable to choose one that is north of the room ( if you are in the northern hemisphere ) .
A north wall rarely receives direct sunlight , thus the heating of the storage space in the summer is reduced .
Such a wine closet may ruin a few bottles after some months of storage .
You can also purchase one of the wine cooler cabinets that are on the market .
Building a wine cellar
To establish your collection in the basement , find a location that is far away from any heat source , vibration ( subway ) or strong odours ( like fuel ) .
Insulation and humidity are primary considerations for custom wine cellar design .
The drier the cave , the faster the corks will dry out .
If the stopper lets too much air pass , it will ultimately spoil the wine .
Aging wines for ten years requires a minimum of 60 percent humidity .
Wine racks
Bottles must be stored on their sides to keep the corks moist .
You have three solutions :
You build a few shelves yourself ;
You take advantage of the many professional companies that design wine racks to suit any space ;
You go to your hardware store and purchase square clay pipes ( used for chimneys ) and build instant racks with them .
Stackable and cheap !
In any case you can plan for the design of these racks .
Wine storage temperatures
Temperature variations must very gradual over the course of the day .
This is a priority which imposes that the cellar be insulated .
A big red wine may pass a summer at 25 °C ( 77 °F ) highest but this is bad aging conditions .
The ambient temperature for your cellar can be anything between 50 °F and 60 °F ( between 10 °C and 15 °C ) .
This is ideal for long - term aging for all types of wines .
Note that wine generally matures better and more slowly at the lower temperatures than it does at the higher temperatures .
Passively cooled wine cellars take advantage of naturally cool and damp areas ( such as basements with uninsulated outside walls in cool or temperate climates ) .
This implies that you tolerate minor seasonal and diurnal temperature variations .
Passive wine cellars may be less predictable , but cost nothing to operate and are not affected by power outages .

Under this process , the procedure for holding a person in contempt involves only the chamber concerned .
Following a contempt citation , the person cited for contempt is arrested by the Sergeant - at - Arms for the House or Senate , brought to the floor of the chamber , held to answer charges by the presiding officer , and then subject to punishment that the House may dictate ( usually imprisonment for punishment reasons , imprisonment for coercive effect , or release from the contempt citation . )

UPDATE :
There is some talk about Congress invoking the concept of " inherent contempt " in the cases of Harriet Miers and the RNC emails .
From Wikipedia :
The last time this occurred was in 1934 , when the Senate brought inherent contempt charges against a former U.S. Postmaster .
The upshot ?
The President filed a Habeas Corpus claim on the Postmaster 's behalf , but the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had acted legally .
I doubt that the present Supreme Court would be so objective .
Nevertheless , it would be cute to seePresident rely on Habeas Corpus .
In the 1934 case , the Vice President presided over a trial in the Senate .
I wonder what would happen if the Senate invoked inherent contempt against a Vice President ?
Fortunately , the House may act independently of the Senate .
Which means that the Sergeant - at - Arms for the House of Representatives could , conceivably , arrest the President of the United States during the State of the Union address to face charges of inherent contempt .
On what grounds , you ask ?
These grounds
The current Sergeant - at - Arms for the House is a man named Wilson Livingood , a name that no novelist would dare to make up .
He is a Secret Service veteran .
What would his former colleagues do if Livingood were asked to arrest Bush ?
Of course , the President 's lawyers would file a Habeas Corpus claim , the Supremes would immediately decide in Bush 's favor ( though on God - knows - what grounds ) , and Dubya would be free to wreak more mischief .
Still , the experiment would be justifiable .
Do n't you justany scenario in which Bush relies on Habeas Corpus ?
A commenter at Democratic Underground , where part of this story was reposted , insisted that the man cited for inherent contempt in 1934 , William MacCacken , was never Postmaster General .
That 's true .
In my ( poor ) defense , I can only say that a lot of other sources -- including Senator Boxer -- made the same mistake .
MacCracken was the first head of the Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce , and his job , in large part , was to institute a safe and reliable nationwide system of air mail delivery .
The former Postmaster General who got into trouble in 1934 was Walter Folger Brown , who was accused of showing favoritism to certain airlines which received fat air mail contracts .
( Those airlines favored by Brown went on to become the well - known giants of the industry : TWA , United , and Eastern . )
MacCracken was asked to produce documents relevant to the Senate 's investigation of Brown .
He did n't .
The Senate charged MacCracken with inherent contempt and he did ten days in the slammer .
I apologize for the error in history , although I do n't think it impacts the larger case made here .
Serifovic 's powerful ballad Molitva had been second - favourite with bookmakers in the run-up to the competition .
She scored 268 points , beating Ukrainian drag queen Verka Serdyuchka into second place .
Russia was third , with Turkey fourth and Bulgaria fifth .
British act Scooch managed only 19 points with their song Flying the Flag .
EUROVISION TOP FIVE 1 . Serbia ( 268 points ) 2 . Ukraine ( 235 ) 3 . Russia ( 207 ) 4 . Turkey ( 163 ) 5 . Bulgaria ( 157 )
Twelve of these came from Malta , which placed the UK entry top in its voting , but there was little recognition from other countries .
The UK tied with France one position above the bottom in the results table , with Irish folk group Dervish scoring only five points and coming last overall .
It meant that Scooch narrowly avoided finishing 24th out of 24 , as British act Gemini had in 2003 - famously scoring " nul points " - with the song Cry Baby .
But Scooch were characteristically undeterred by the result .
" To be honest , this experience has been one in a million , " said singer Caroline Barnes .
" But I have to say I laughed so much I cried at the voting .
I 'm not gutted .
I do n't want to say it was expected , but you know what Eurovision is like . "
' So proud '
Serbia took first place with its first entry as a solo state at the Eurovision , having declared its union with Montenegro defunct last year .
The Eastern European state will now be charged with hosting the event in 2008 .
Following her win , Ms Serifovic told reporters " a new chapter has opened for Serbia " .
EUROVISION BOTTOM FIVE 20 .
Spain ( 43 points ) 21 . Lithuania ( 28 ) 22 = . France ( 19 ) 22=. UK ( 19 , pictured ) 24 .
Ireland ( 5 )
" I am so proud .
All my success is made by singing . "
The competition had been embraced by people in the Finnish capital , which earned the right to stage the event when rock group Lordi won in 2006 .
Lordi's song Hard Rock Hallelujah was reprised as the opening number of the show , at Helsinki 's largest ice hockey stadium .
Big -screen
TVs were erected in the city centre , where fans gathered to watch the ceremony .
Some 350 spin - off events had also been organised as part of Eurovision " fever " .
The contest - held since 1956 - had a record 42 entries this year , but 18 were eliminated in qualifying rounds before Saturday 's final .
It was broadcast to an estimated global TV audience of 100 million , with the winner selected after a poll in each country involving telephone votes and text messages .
Stasi Methods Used to Track G8 Opponents The Scent of Terror
In a reminder of methods used by the East German Stasi secret police , German authorities are collecting human scents to trace activists they believe may try to violently disrupt the G8 summit in June .
It 's proving highly controversial , and there 's no scientific evidence that the method is infallible .

# 1 Anshul Samar : Elementeo CEO
Anshul Samar is a 13 year old student at Lawson Middle School in Cupertino .
He ’s also the articulate CEO of his gaming startup , Elementeo .
His company is aiming to inject fun into learning with the creation of a fantasy role playing board game that teaches chemistry .
This is how his game works ( from Venture Beat ) :
You command an army of chemical elements , compounds and catalysts — represented within a 66 - card deck ( the fire and brimstone card at left is for “ Sulfur , ” for example ) .
Your opponent has his own deck with the same number of cards .
Your goal is to battle your competitor and reduce his IQ down to zero .
Pit your oxygen card against your opponent ’s iron card , for example , and you learn that you create rust .
Score one for oxygen .
Kind of like rock - paper - scissors , but with chemicals , dice and 66 impressively illustrated cards featuring monster - themed caricatures of chemicals .
So far , his goal is to reach $ 1 million in revenues by the end of his first year on the job , which is by summer of 2008 .
He ’s seeking funding to mass produce his idea and has been attending entrepreneurship technology conferences to gain some visibility .
Impressive , how he ’s put together a sharp team which includes his 11 year old sister as the VP of Sales .

# 2 Ben Casnocha : Comcate Founder
This ai n’t your regular kid at 19 years old .
He ’s the 6 ′ 4 ″ founder of Comcate , a software company that provides customer support tools for local governments .
He started the company based on a sixth grade technology class project when he was just 12 years of age while he attended the Town School for Boys , a popular school in San Francisco .
Since then , several dozen clients from small to mid-sized cities are ringing up annual revenue of around $ 750,000 for his company .
And while teens his age are focusing on college , he ’s schmoozing with famed Silicon Valley high tech executives and VCs .
As if that were n’t enough , he just wrote a book as well called “ My Startup Life : What a ( Very ) Young CEO Learned on His Journey Through Silicon Valley ” , which I ’m tempted to pick up .
Last I checked , he does n’t look anything like a geek either .
If you want to keep tabs on this whiz kid , check out his blog at Ben Casnocha : The Blog .

# 5 Suhas Gopinath : Founder , CEO and President of Globals , Inc
According to Wikipedia , Suhas is now 21 years old .
When he was just 14 , this guy from Bangalore , India founded a company called Globals , Inc in San Jose , California .
The reason for trying his luck in the United States rather than his native country was because there are laws in India that prevented him — then as a minor — to start a company legally .
Starting with only 4 employees , he now employs around 400 students between India and the U.S.A .
He jokingly shares that he wants to retire at the age of 24 .
Right now , he ’s a workaholic and national icon who ’s listed in India ’s record books as “ The World ’s Youngest Chief Executive ” .
He ’s also terribly frugal and has shockingly turned down a $ 100 million investment from a VC firm .
So far , he ’s doing very well on his own , with 200 clients throughout the world , offices in 11 countries and software products that address market niches such as software for schools akin to an electronic class register that tracks the grades and attendance of students .
Another product his company has developed ( and is a candidate for a patent ) , is a data management tool that would help IT companies decrease their workforce and lower their costs .

WASHINGTON , Feb . 11 — One figure has dominated the trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr. without even showing up in the courtroom .
Day after day , the jury has heard accounts of the actions of Vice President Dick Cheney , watched as his handwritten notes were displayed on a giant screen , heard how he directed leaks to the news media and ordered the White House to publicly defend Mr. Libby , his top aide and close confidante .
Now , as the defense phase of the perjury trial begins , Mr. Cheney is expected to make a historic appearance on the witness stand .
It is an act of loyalty that carries considerable risk for Mr. Cheney , a powerful figure in the administration who has in recent months suffered a series of major political and policy setbacks .
If he testifies , Mr. Cheney will bring to the jurors the awesome authority of his office and could attest to Mr. Libby ’s character as policy adviser and family man , and to his crushing workload and dedication to keeping the country safe .
That could give extra heft to Mr. Libby ’s defense against the charge that he lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the grand jury : that he was so occupied with important matters of state , he did not accurately remember conversations from July 2003 .
But the first 10 days of testimony have already exposed some of the long - hidden workings of Mr. Cheney ’s extraordinary vice presidency , revealing how deeply Mr. Cheney himself was engaged during 2003 in managing public relations as the administration ’s case for war came under attack .
What is sushi grade fish and where do I buy it ?
The question of what is sushi grade fish comes up a lot and no one seems to accurately answer that question .
After some research I am now able to provide information as to the guidelines and regulations that are followed in the seafood industry in terms of serving raw seafood .
As for micro standards for sushi or sashimi grade seafood , I have spoken with many in the seafood industry who supply ‘ sushi grade ’ fish for sushi and sashimi served at restaurants and they all give me the same answer … they do not know of any regulations from either the FDA or any other agencies regarding ‘ sushi grade ’ seafood , which is why suppliers have set up their own micro and chemical parameters for their products .
A personal search of FDA documents turns up the same results , no clear standards as to what makes fish ‘ sushi grade ’ or ‘ sashimi grade ’ and no definition of the term .
The only concern any inspectors have is referred to as the parasite destruction guarantee , which is accomplished by ‘ freezing and storing seafood at - 4 °F ( - 20 °C ) or below for 7 days ( total time ) , or freezing at - 31 °F ( - 35 °C ) or below until solid and storing at - 31 °F ( - 35 °C ) or below for 15 hours , or freezing at - 31 °F ( - 35 °C ) or below until solid and storing at - 4 °F ( - 20 °C ) or below for 24 hours ’ which is sufficient to kill parasites .
The FDA ’s Food Code recommends these freezing conditions to retailers who provide fish intended for raw consumption ( for further information , please visit the FDA website ) .
Some exceptions to that rule are bluefin tuna , yellowfin tuna , and farmed salmon .
I know that is a mouthful , but it ’s the facts .
Other than a few specific organisms of concern for some seafood , sashimi standards are set as any other ready - to - eat item , e.g. sushi .
This means that , aside from the FDA recommendations and local Health Department requirements , there are no laws or recommendations for “ sushi/ sashimi grade ” fish .
It is no more than a marketing term .
As for those on the serving side , their main concern seems to be with the seafood vendors .
Many of them will declare that the products they provide are “ sushi/ sashimi ” grade but with no standards to back up those claims .
In the U.S. parasite destruction is required for those species where that hazard is identified but you ’ll find that most chefs will claim that they use “ fresh ” salmon and other products .
This may be because they do not know , perhaps it is delivered thawed by the local supplier ( who may or may not have frozen it according to the requirements ) , or they may even use fresh , never frozen , salmon .
The term “ fresh ” for sushi quality fish has been linked to higher quality in the minds of many consumers and therefore the restaurants use this as a selling point even though the product may have been previously frozen ( usually aboard the fishing vessel ) and serving certain species without proper freezing is against regulations .
Sushi rice is another critical part of sushi preparation , for many reasons .
Many sushi restaurants use acidification for bacterial control but the final sushi products must be cooled to below 40 F before put onto display in a self - service case ( in the case of supermarkets , et. al. ) .
However , sushi restaurants do not cool the items before serving to customers since such a short time lapses between preparation and consumption .
Once the rice is acidified , time is not used as a control and therefore it can be stored at room temperature where the quality is best and it is also easiest with which to work .
As you can see , there are many issues that affect the quality of the sushi served in restaurants or as ‘ ready - to - eat ’ meals .
But with no federal regulations , it ’s all about practical standards and health code restrictions .
When you eat sushi from a quality establishment , you may expect that the FDA requirements for parasitic destruction have been followed , however you are at the mercy of the preparer to make sure that subsequent to being frozen and thawed , your food has been handled properly .
On the whole , I do n’t worry .
But I also do n’t eat anywhere that seems like they may not be devoted to proper sanitary standards .
Good sushi is , in my opinion , well worth the minimal risk .

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states can force unions not to compel their members to contribute fees that are used for purely political purposes :
WASHINGTON — States may force public sector labor unions to get consent from workers before using their fees for political activities , the Supreme Court said Thursday .
The court unanimously upheld a Washington state law that applied to public employees who choose not to join the union that represents them in contract talks with state and local governments .
The workers are compelled to pay the equivalent of union dues , a portion of which the union uses for political activities .
Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the court , said the law does not violate the union ’s First Amendment rights .
But the state ’s Democratic governor and Democratic - controlled legislature recently changed the law to eliminate the provision that was upheld Thursday , blunting the impact of the court ruling .
The narrow issue before the justices was whether , as the law formerly prescribed , employees must opt in , or affirmatively consent , to having some of their money used in election campaigns .
The justices said that a state could indeed require such consent .
But there also is nothing to bar the state from putting the onus on nonmember workers to opt out , or seek a refund of a portion of their fees .
That , in effect , is what Washington law now requires after the recent change .
Intakes of lactose , calcium , phosphorus , and vitamin D were unrelated to anovulatory infertility , the researchers reported .
It had been thought that dairy fat and lactose might impair fertility by affecting ovulatory function , they said .
However , few studies have been conducted in humans , and the results are inconsistent .
I love news days like this .
The two top health stories on news .
google.com are about studies that throw into question the legitimacy of two major tenets of mainstream nutritional advice : avoid saturated fat and get lots of antioxidants .
The first study shows that women who ate the most high fat dairy foods were protected from fertility problems whereas women who ate lots of low fat dairy products were as much as 85 % more likely to have fertility problems .
The second study showed that using the antioxidant supplements Vitamin A , Vitamin E and Beta Carotene certainly does not increase longevity and might actually increase your risk of dying .
Whoops !
Here 's the most interesting paragraph in the first article :
In other words , even though there 's no supporting evidence , the prevailing wisdom is that dairy fat is bad for fertility because saturated fat is always bad and lactose is bad because everyone is scared of the dreaded lactose intolerance .
Never mind that there 's essentially no lactose in yogurt or cheese and that people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate quite a bit of lactose before experiencing any major health problems like flatulence .
Turns out the prevailing wisdom is wrong on both counts .
That 's hardly surprising because , like I said , the prevailing wisdom is n't based on scientific evidence .
In nutrition , it seems , even the scientists tend to be more swayed by emotional arguments that they are by hard data .
These papers highlight several of the prevailing fallacies of modern nutritional advice .
Let 's take a look .
Preferential Citation .
The dominant belief that saturated fat is bad is inevitably tied to the Seven Countries Study , a study that the late Dr. George V. Mann referred to as " a classroom demonstration in naivete " in his scathing 1977 New England Journal of Medicine review , " Diet - Heart : end of an era " .
There have been many more modern , better controlled studies that have contradicted these findings but yet the seven countries study world view remains the dominant paradigm despite all of its methodological issues ( ie , Dr. Ancel Keys hand picked the seven populations .
Why did n't he choose any populations in France , Switzerland or Poland ? ) .
My current favorite study that refutes the seven countries study findings is Low - carbohydrate - diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease in women .
Incidentally , this one is very insidious , because before too long a preferentially cited paper becomes common knowledge .
At this point it is VERY hard to fight , no matter WHAT the data says .
Foods are the sum of their component parts .
The supplement article is more guilty of this , but they 're both guilty .
No one has ever sat down to a meal of saturated fat .
The fallacy works like this .
A study comes out showing that people who eat lots of green leafy vegetables have lower rates of heart disease .
Scientists say , " Ooh !
Look at that !
It must be because of the antioxidants / vitamin E/beta carotene / whatever . "
Experiments are done with supplemental antioxidants / vitamin E/beta carotene / whatever .
They fail .
It never seems to dawn on American scientists that perhaps the beneficial heart effects lie in the food itself and not some extract of it .
For instance , maybe the leafy vegetables are replacing a starchy baked potato or french fries .
Maybe the key is the specific proportions of nutrients in the vegetable .
Or even more radically , maybe people who eat green leafy vegetables tend to sit down with their families and enjoy an unhurried meal .
Additionally , there are lots of components in vegetables that scientists do n't even know about - what if the " magic bullet " is one of them .
Do n't worry , though , scientists wo n't stop looking for the magic bullet .
Incidentally , if our health officials want us to eat more vegetables , they really need to get off the avoid saturated fat thing .
The reason they eat so many vegetables is France is that they cook them with pork fat or butter .
Delicious !
Last week I hate a cabbage braised in pork fat for dinner .
The entire cabbage !
How many vegetable servings is that ?
The recommendations that we should a ) eat more veggies and b ) steam or boil them are mutually exclusive .
Hypothesis Creep .
The Seven Countries Study led to the hypothesis that saturated fat was a causal agent in heart disease .
Then everybody just started applying it to other areas .
So the original assumption creeps into the arena of female fertility , " Well , if saturated fat causes heart disease , maybe it also causes infertility . "
Even if saturated fat did cause heart disease in old men why does it logically follow that it would also cause fertility problems in young women ?
You might think that 's a bizarre assumption , and you 're right .
But from the perspective of a researcher , it 's a very easy hypothesis to test , your study will get some press because it's about saturated fat , which everyone is interested in , and it might get you a job .
And you do n't even have know anything about fertility !
The End Result
When scientists and doctors put all of these fallacies together , as they so frequently do , you end up with non-sensical crap like this quote from the first article .
I 'll leave it to you to find the fallacies from here on out .
Dr Chavarro 's advice to women trying to conceive is to change their diet for a while .
He said " They should consider changing low - fat dairy foods for high - fat dairy foods ; for instance , by swapping skimmed milk for whole milk and eating ice cream , not low fat yoghurt . "
Once they have become pregnant , then they should probably switch back to low - fat dairy foods as it is easier to limit intake of saturated fat by consuming low - fat dairy foods , " said Dr Chavarro .
Can you imagine ?
Ok , a young woman , we 'll call her Sue , goes to the doctor with a fertility problem : I can't conceive You should eat more full fat dairy products .
But I thought saturated fat was bad for me .
It is .
So you should stop eating it after you 've conceived .
So you want me to eat something that 's bad for me ?
Yes .
But do n't worry , it will make you more fertile .
Does n't that suggest that saturated fat is good for young women ?
No , it just helps you conceive .
Um ... Well ..... OK ?
Exactly .
US Politics Mandatory Voting Toward a Healthy Democracy Now is the time for one bold constitutional amendment that can grab public attention and move the nation forward .
By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published March 19 , 2007
American :
So you mean that if you Australians do n't vote , you get a fine ?
Australian : Yeah , and when you Americans do n't vote you get George W. Bush .
As surely as politicians lie , citizen apathy produces democracy atrophy .
Much more than a right – in a democracy voting is an irrevocable civic duty .
No mental gymnastics can help you jump over this ugly reality : Voter turnout over all American elections averages markedly less than half of eligible voters .
This disgrace must be fixed .
These are my proposed solutions :
We should make voting mandatory , give voters the option of " none of the above , " make Election Day a national holiday , provide same day registration everywhere , and lower the voting age to 16 .
No one reform is a panacea .
But together these five reforms can dramatically re-energize voting in America .
They could be placed in one constitutional amendment and ratified by the states in time for the 2008 presidential election .
Limiting public support , however , is an elitist mindset among people with political power , wealth and intellectual arrogance .
They wrongly dismiss large numbers of citizens for their lack of education or political involvement .
Electoral reforms can create a culture of voting that ultimately produces a more informed public .
Mandatory Voting
This is not a crazy , radical idea .
Hold your reaction on what probably is a new idea for you .
Over 30 countries have compulsory voting .
Violating the law usually merits something akin to a parking fine , but it still works .
When Australia adopted it in 1924 turnouts increased from under 50 percent to a consistent 90 - plus percent .
Conversely , when the Netherlands eliminated compulsory voting in 1970 voting turnouts plunged from 90 percent to less than 50 percent .
Polls regularly show 70 percent to 80 percent of Australians support mandatory voting .
Research found that people living in countries with compulsory voting are roughly twice as likely to believe that their government is responsive to the public 's needs and 2.8 times as likely to vote as compared to citizens in countries without compulsory voting .
Is compulsory voting inconsistent with personal freedom ?
No !
We have compulsory education , jury duty , and taxes that are more onerous than voting periodically .
And all people have to do is turn out to vote .
What they do with their secret ballot is up to them .
Counting Dissatisfaction
When people can officially say with their ballot that none of the candidates is acceptable , it makes compulsory voting more palatable .
In turn , it can increase voting for ballot initiatives and measures .
And it is better than lesser - evil voting that has become all too common , because of the two - party duopoly 's stranglehold on our political system .
It is beats so - called " Mickey Mouse " voting , whereby people write in frivolous names .
Nevada offers the None of the Above option , though the candidate with the greatest number of votes wins .
Yet protest votes are counted , sending a message to parties and politicians .
Election Day Holiday
Standing in a long line to vote often loses out to being at work or doing other things typical of work and school days .
Long commute times add to peoples ' time poverty .
On a holiday , voting would be more evenly spread out throughout the day and could be held at more places .
It would be easier to recruit the best qualified poll workers and government costs would be reduced because of shorter hours .
A national holiday also sends an important message : Voting is critically important and something to be celebrated .
Opinion surveys have found that 60 percent or more favor making Election Day a holiday .
The National Commission on Federal Election Reform made a strong case for this action .
Like others , the commission backed moving Veterans ' Day to coincide with Election Day .
The holiday might be called Veterans ' Democracy Election Day .
Most Western democracies hold elections on either holidays or weekends .
In Puerto Rico people are given the day off and voter turnouts are typically over 80 percent .
Early and absentee voting attack some problems .
But a national holiday that celebrates the sacred duty of voting by all eligible voters makes more sense .
Voting should become more of a social , community activity , bringing Americans together , rather than something done as quickly as possible to get it over with .
Same Day Registration
At least 30 percent of eligible voters do not vote because they are not registered .
It makes no sense to make registration onerous .
It should be done automatically once voter rolls are established and once citizens show up the first time to vote and present residence and citizenship qualifications , as required .
Same day registration has been used successfully in some states for about 30 years .
Minnesota , Maine , New Hampshire , Idaho , Wisconsin , Montana , Connecticut , and Wyoming use this approach .
North Dakota abandoned registration entirely in 1951 .
Five of these states have the highest voter turnout in the country .
When Montana used it for the first time in 2006 , voter turnout jumped from the usual 50 percent to 70 percent .
With more same day registration it is appropriate to have more safeguards against all forms of voter fraud , especially registering non-citizens .
Youthful Citizens
We place no upper age restriction on voting , even though some elderly people have reduced mental capabilities , and are often taken advantage of by get - out - the - vote efforts of the two major parties .
Our political system is deciding the future for our younger citizens .
On fairness alone , balancing a large over - 50 voting bloc with younger citizens is justified .
Youths age 16 to 18 pay substantial taxes , are often treated as adults in criminal cases , have definite interests impacted by public policy , and in some states can marry and obtain a driver 's license .
Being in high school is an advantage , because there is more stability and time to build a habit of voting .
Considering our Information
Age , lowering the age to 16 makes perfect sense .
What happens between ages 16 and 18 to make younger citizens more qualified to vote ?
Nothing .
There is a movement to register 16 year olds , but making them wait until 18 to vote is plain silly .
New , younger voters can help make voting a patriotic family activity on the new national holiday .
Countries using this lower age include Brazil , Cuba , Nicaragua , and the Isle of Man , and movements for doing so are strong in Britain , Canada and many more .
In Germany , a greater proportion of 16 and 17 year - olds voted than those aged 18 to 35 – and twice as many as those in their later 20s – in municipal elections in Hanover .
In local elections in Vienna , Austria , 59 percent of 16 - to 18 - year - olds cast a ballot about the same as other age groups .
Rather than starting wars to spread democracy , America could lead a global surge in voter entitlement .
This is what populism is all about .
A Constitutional Necessity
Voting is the heart of a healthy democracy .
With our persistent low voter turnout , the heart of American democracy is barely beating .
The decline of American democracy is both a cause and consequence of low voter turnout .
Low voter turnout makes a mockery of representative democracy .
Most politicians get elected with – at best – not much more than 25 percent of eligible voters .
This may explain why bought - and - paid - for politicians mostly represent corporate and other special interests .
Hefty political contributions by less than 1 percent of adults trump voting .
Face facts .
Incremental and piecemeal attempts at electoral reforms have failed .
Why ?
Because those in power do not want across - the - board high voter turnout .
Shame on them .
And shame on us for letting Democrats and Republicans get away with using costly means to get out their base supporters .
This perpetuates divisive partisan politics that entertain and anger Americans rather than serve them – 70 percent of whom are centrists .
Now is the time for one bold constitutional amendment that can grab public attention and move the nation forward .
If Congress is too cowardly to propose the amendment , then we need two - thirds of state legislatures to request an Article V Convention for this purpose ; to learn more about this never - used constitutional right go to www.foavc.org.
Let us begin by urging members of Congress and 2008 presidential candidates to take a public stand on electoral reforms .
Will Democrats and Republicans walk the talk of cooperation for the good of the nation ?
Abraham Lincoln spoke of government " of the people , by the people and for the people . "
If you really believe in these words , then speak out to increase voter turnout to resuscitate America 's half - dead democracy .

The iPhone came out yesterday .
I did n't feel it warranted waiting for hours in line , and I was n't sure I wanted one yet .
But I called the Apple Store ( Barton Creek ) today and was told that iPhones were still in stock ( ha ha to all you suckers that waited in line for hours yesterday ! ) and I just could n't resist .
So now I 've played with it for about three hours .
Here are my thoughts .
Ways the iPhone beats the Treo 650 :
The user interface is beautiful .
The screen 's resolution is apparently slightly lower than my Treo 650's ( 165 dpi vs. 178 dpi ) , but Apple 's interface looks so much better .
It always annoyed me that the Treo does n't use anti-aliased text .
The iPhone does .
This makes a huge difference .
It appears to sync perfectly with my Mac OS X Address Book and iCal .
My Treo ( with Missing Sync ) did an acceptable job of this , but not perfect , since its Contacts and Calendar schemata are a little different from those of Address Book and iCal .
The iPhone was presumably designed to work perfectly with these apps .
Safari works great .
It 's no faster at loading pages over the cellular network than the Treo 650 , but the browser does a much better job rendering pages than Blazer ( the Treo browser ) .
better job rendering pages than Blazer ( the Treo browser ) .
My iPhone plan is cheaper than my Treo plan .
I paid Verizon $ 105 / month for the Treo ( including unlimited data and no SMS messages ) .
I 'm only paying $ 60 / month with the iPhone , including 200 SMS messages .
( If I could get a plan with fewer airtime minutes for less money , I would .
I only use about 50 - 100 minutes per month .
This was a problem with the Treo too .
Nobody sells a plan with as few minutes as I need , apparently . )
I can't search the iPhone 's address book by typing .
On the Treo , I just start typing a first name , or last name , or first initial plus last name , and it filters the contact list .
It usually takes no more than 2 or 3 keystrokes to isolate the person I want to find .
On the iPhone , I have to scroll and look .
Scrolling is smooth and fast , but not as fast as the Treo 's keyboard search .
As a bonus , the Treo magically figures out when I 'm typing a phone number instead of searching by name .
On the iPhone I have to press the keyboard button to dial a number .
You might think this is nit-picking , and I should just use the iPhone 's " Favorites " list to store my commonly - dialed numbers .
But the Treo keyboard search was so efficient that I never needed a separate mechanism for accessing my oft - dialed numbers .
I can't install my own ring tones on the iPhone .
The Treo can sync over Bluetooth .
The iPhone can't .
( Nor can it sync over WiFi . )
Neither works with the Mac OS X Address Book .
The Address Book has a Bluetooth button , , right in the toolbar .
Supposedly , if you pair your Mac with a cell phone , you can dial numbers on the cell phone just by clicking Address Book entries .
It does n't work with either the Treo or the iPhone .
In the case of the Treo , it 's annoying but understandable .
In the case of the iPhone , it 's just stupid .

Neither has a 3G radio .
( Newer Treos do . )
The iPhone can't access the iTunes store .
It seems to have trouble remembering my home WiFi password , so when I leave the WiFi network and come back later , I have to re-enter it .
This does n't happen every time .
A few days ago , Google enhanced Google Maps .
Now you can change its driving directions just by dragging the route with your mouse .
It 's terrific - totally intuitive , and lightning - fast .
Want to do that on your iPhone ?
You can't .
The built - in Maps application does n't support it .
And if you go to maps.google.com in the iPhone web browser , you still can't .
As soon as you click the " Search Maps " button in the web page , the iPhone takes you to the built - in Maps application .
I feel like Apple might as well have just displayed " fuck you " in inch - tall letters .
So far , it 's been much easier for me to type with two thumbs in the sideways orientation , but only Safari offers it .
Phone , Calendar , Maps , Notes , etc. , only offer the cramped , clumsy portrait - mode keyboard .
Also , once you bring up the keyboard in Safari , you can't then rotate the iPhone and have the keyboard change its orientation .
You have to back out of the keyboard screen and re-enter it to make it rotate .
Ways the Treo 650 beats the iPhone : Ways that the iPhone and the Treo 650 both suck :
Ways in which the iPhone sucks that have nothing comparable on the Treo :
SAN FRANCISCO , May 21  Google filed a proposal on Monday with the Federal Communications Commission calling on the agency to let companies allocate radio spectrum using the same kind of real - time auction that the search engine company now uses to sell advertisements .
Executives at Google , based in the Mountain View , Calif. , said that the company had no plans to bid in the closely watched sale of a swath of broadcast spectrum scheduled for February 2009 as part of the nation ’s transition to digital broadcast television .
The company , the world ’s dominant search engine , has , however , become an active participant in the debate over the control of access to broadband digital networks because it wants to create more competition among digital network providers like cable companies and Internet service providers .
The Google filing comes two days before a deadline for public comments set in an F.C.C. rule - making procedure for the sale of spectrum in the 700 MHz band , now largely used by UHF television broadcasters .
XML Parser Benchmarks : Part 1
May 10 , 2007
Matthias Farwick and Michael Hafner
Five years after the introduction of SOAP 1.0 , XML parsing is still the main bottleneck in web service performance .
In search of components for a high performance web service security solution , we have executed benchmarks for various XML parsers in Java and C .
These benchmarks cover event - driven parser models like SAX and StAX , object model parsers like DOM , and also new breeds of XML parsers like Apache 's AXIOM , which only builds parts of the document tree in the memory .
Our intention was to find the right components for our high performance web service security gateway , so that it could be run on a small dedicated appliance .
The limited resources of such a device brought the C tests into the game , since the Java virtual machine already needs a lot of memory .
Object model parsers are the most important parser types in the context of web service security because they can be used to alter a XML document in memory .
In this first part of a two - part series , we will present our benchmark results for the event - driven parsers like SAX and StAX , because those are used by the object model parsers , and therefore determine the performance of object model parsers by a large amount .
First , we will give you a quick overview in the XML parser jungle .
Recap of XML Parser Types
Generally , there are two types of XML parsers .
First are the push - and pull - parsers that simply read a XML document and return the data and structure of the document ( e.g. , SAX and StAX ) .
Both are event - driven parsers because they return events that the developer has to handle .
Push parsers implementations like SAX ( Simple API for XML ) return the data of the whole document in one stream and cannot be stopped ( you could throw an exception in Java ) .
Pull - parsers , on the other hand , only return data when they are asked to read the next node in a document .
StAX ( Streaming API for XML ) is a pull - parser specification for Java defined in JSR 173 .
The second type of XML parsers are object model parsers ( e.g. , DOM and Apache AXIOM ) , which not only read the data but also construct an in -memory representation of the document , which can be altered .
Since DOM parsers mostly use SAX parsers to read in the documents , it is clear that the object model of a document is always built completely .
This is a performance limitation if only data at the beginning of a document needs to be read and altered .
New approaches like Apache 's AXIOM make use of StAX pull - parser implementations to overcome this limitation .
AXIOM only builds the tree representation of a document until the last node that was requested .
Therefore , it does not need to read the complete document .
In this first part of the series we will talk about the performance of the reading parsers .
Since these parsers are used by the object model parsers to read in the data , we can already make assumptions about the performance of the corresponding object model parsers .
The Tested Event - Driven Parsers
LIBXML2 Stream Pull - Parser + SAX - like 2.6.27 ( C ) : LIBXML2 is a C library that provides several APIs for XML processing and manipulation .
Besides a DOM - like implementation it also provides a streaming pull - parser and a SAX - like interface .
The latter is used to read in the data for the DOM - like parser .
Java 1.5 Default SAX ( Java ) :
This parser is the default SAX parser in Java 1.5 .
Woodstox StAX Pull - Parser 3.1.0 ( Java ) : Woodstox is a JSR173 conforming StAX parser implementation .
It was created by the open source community Codehaus and is tightly coupled with its SOAP engine , XFire .
Sun SJSXP StAX Pull - Parser 1.0 - b26 ( Java ) : The SJSXP is Sun 's implementation of the JSR173 StAX specification .
It is shipped with the Java 6 SDK .
BEA StAX implementation 1.1.2 ( Java ) : This is a JSR173 implementation by BEA .
Javolution StAX - like implementation 4.0 ( Java ) : Javolution is an open source project that aims on enhancing the performance of the Java base library .
It provides a StAX - like XML parser that does not fully comply to JSR 173 .
Oracle StAX implementation XDK 10.1.0.1 ( Java ) : A JSR 173 implementation by Oracle .
The Test Environment
The main benchmark tool that we used is a modified version of Sun's XMLTest .
It lets you define test suites that describe which parsers are tested with which documents .
On execution , it measures how many documents a parser processed in a specified period of time , and calculates the throughput per second for it .
The most modification involved the inclusion of the external C benchmarks into the tests .
Those benchmarks were inspired by the xmlbench benchmark tool , which is under the GNU public license .
All C tests in the benchmarks of this part of the series used the GNU GCC compiler .
Each Java benchmark was executed with the - server option to reserve more resources for the JVM .
All tests were run on a Fujitsu Siemens S Series notebook , with a 1.70 GHz Intel processor and 1 GB RAM .
The Benchmark Execution
The aim of our benchmarks was to measure how many documents a parser can process in a given time .
Processing means that the parser walks through the whole document and counts the number of elements , attributes , and the length of the text elements .
This way we were able to see if each parser performs the same walk through the document .
We measured the throughput for 15 seconds with a 5 second warm - up phase for each parser .
XMLTest presents the results as bar charts with the throughput per second on the Y axis , and the different parsers on the X axis .
The XML documents which we used are purchase order XML files that are provided with XMLTest .
These documents have a maximum depth of 6 , and an almost equal amount of elements and attributes .
The Event Parser Benchmarks
First , we will show you the benchmark results for the push - parsers and one StAX implementation .
Figure 1 : Benchmark results for event - driven XML parsers and small documents
Figure 2 : Benchmark results for event - driven XML parsers and large documents
In Figures 1 and 2 you can see that the LIBXML2 SAX - like parser ( red ) does much better than all other implementations .
This implies that the LIBXML2 object model parser has an advantage over the other implementations because it uses the LIBXML2 SAX parser to read in the documents .
Unfortunately the LIBXML2 SAX - like parser has a very complex interface .
And also , as in most C XML parsers a great amount of focus has to be laid on the memory management .
In second place is the Woodstox StAX implementation ( yellow ) .
The LIBXML2 stream pull - parser ( blue ) and the Java 1.5 default SAX implementation ( green ) show almost even results .
StAX Parser Benchmark
You can choose the StAX implementation ( for example Apache 's AXIOM ) in many recent Java XML applications .
Since there are already a handful of StAX implementations out there , we compared their reading performance in the following benchmarks .
Figure 3 : Benchmark results the StAX parsers and small documents
Figure 4 : Benchmark results for the StAX parsers and medium - sized documents
Figure 5 : Benchmark results for the StAX parsers and large documents
Figures 3 - 5 show the benchmarks of the five different StAX implementations .
In all but the last benchmark the Javolution and the Woodstox parser perform the best results .
The SUN SJSXP lags behind for small documents but outperforms all other parsers for the very large 4 MB XML file .
The BEA implementation is slightly better for small documents than the SJSXP , but for XML files bigger than 10 KB it is overtaken by the SJSXP .
Oracles StAX implementation ranks last on the two biggest documents where it performs equal to the BEA implementation .
Conclusions
From the results of the benchmarks we can see that there are big performance differences between the parser implementations .
Overall the SAX - like implementation of LIBXML2 in C performs best in all benchmarks .
For most document sizes it had one - third to twice as much throughput as its competitors .
This is interesting because as we will see in the next part of this series , the LIBXML2 DOM implementation in C uses this parser to read in data and therefore already has a performance advantage over the other object model parsers in Java .
A negative point of this parser is definitely the complexity of its interface .
With the need to handle void , and double pointers in the callback interface , it is a great difference to the rather intuitive use of the Java StAX interfaces .
Javolution and Woodstox are the winners of the StAX parsers .
Woodstox has the advantage of being JSR 173 conforming StAX parser , which makes it usable for more applications .
In the next part of this series we will look at the results of the object model parser benchmarks , and will see if any Java parser can beat the performance of the LIBXML2 object model parser in C .
This will lead to our final conclusion which XML parser to use for our high - performance web service gateway .

Polish gay rights groups claim thousands of homosexuals have fled the country to escape increasing persecution .
Robert Biedron , 27 , the head of the Polish Foundation Against Homophobia , said that ' huge numbers ' of Polish gays had left the country following the rise to power of the right - wing government .
He said : ' It is incredible .
The Polish gay community has just left because of the climate of fear and persecution .
' Most of the people I know are now in England because of the current political situation .
Not for economic reasons , but because of the persecution of homosexuals going on here .
It 's impossible for gays to be themselves in Poland . '
He added : ' Around two million Poles have left the country seeking work and thousands of gays are among them .
Many gays are approaching our foundation for help in emigrating to the UK . '
Kamil Zapasnik , 22 , a gay student who moved to London because he wanted to marry , said : ' It 's very important to me that I am able to have a civil partnership and adopt children .
In the UK I have that freedom . '
Poland 's Roman Catholic right - wing government has openly homophobic members and Polish media recently announced that the Health Ministry had created a special committee responsible for ' curing ' gays .
The Deputy Health Minister , Marek Grafowski , said that the ministry was also planning to identify how many people in Poland were gay and work out a set of behavioural guides to assist parents and teachers so that they can recognise any warning signs of potential ' gay behaviour ' .
Polish police have also been compiling a database on gays and the gay community in Poland which , although illegal under EU law , is apparently being done as part of a police investigation into a bomb threat two years ago by a gay man .
He had reportedly identified himself as a member of the gay community who was angry when a gay rights march was banned in Warsaw .
' The police are not allowed to catalogue " homosexual data " , but it 's enough to look into the police investigation associated with the bomb in order to establish a list of names and addresses , ' said Ewa Kulesza , a former personal data protection general inspector .
It is not just the police who are openly homophobic .
Lech Wojtewski , 23 , from Warsaw , said his doctor had referred him to a vet when he went to for a check - up .
' He told me there was a specialist for people like me and gave me an address .
When I got there it was a vet .
' I called him and he said , " What did you expect ?
You are an animal " .'
When Krystian Legierski , 29 , opened a gay club , Le Madame , it was shut down by Warsaw local authorities who hired private security guards to break down the doors , despite an appearance there by John Malkovich a day earlier .
' I understand why people emigrate , but injustice can only be rectified by resistance , not emigration , ' Legierski said .
MSNBC : Rudy ' urban legend ' Giuliani vs NYC firefighters
" The image Rudy Giuliani would like voters to have is of Giuliani vs. the terrorists , but ... for tonight anyway the story is Giuliani vs. the firefighters . "
So opened Wednesday night 's broadcast of MSNBC's Countdown , reporting on a scathing video released by New York City firefighters attacking what they call the " urban legend " Giuliani has built around himself in the wake of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks .
Washington Post writer Chris Cillizza , appearing on the program , noted that Giuliani responded very quickly to the attack from the International Association of Firefighters because he cannot politically afford to have his 9/11 mystique tainted .
" The question is twofold , " Cillizza said .
" One , how much does this video catch on ?
And two , do people believe the messenger ?
Do they believe Rudy Giuliani , or do they believe the IAFF ?
And does this tarnish what is the central tenant of Rudy Giuliani 's campaign for president . "
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on July 11 .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Drivers in Winnipeg , Manitoba , one of Canada ’s worst cities for auto thefts , will have to install electronic immobilizers on new or “ high - risk ” cars in order to qualify for auto insurance , the province said on Wednesday .
“ We have all seen the devastation that gets caused by reckless auto thieves who have a complete disregard for public safety , ” Manitoba Attorney General Dave Chomiak said in a statement announcing the plan to stymie joy - riders , a first for
Canada .
Chomiak said cars are stolen twice as often in Winnipeg as in other Manitoba cities , while a 2005 report from Statistics Canada said the city had a higher per-capita car theft rate than larger cities like Vancouver , Montreal and Toronto .
The province , where cars are insured through Manitoba Public Insurance , will fork over C$ 15 million ( $ 14 million ) so that owners without immobilizers can have them installed .
Most “ high - risk ” vehicles will include those on the top of the province ’s most - stolen list .
For the last few months , Ms. Doane and a few colleagues , along with volunteers from the Amateur Telescope Makers of Boston , have been setting the stage for a mammoth attempt to bring the entire collection into the digital age .
The result , if money can be found , will be more than just an archive .
Digitized with a custom - crafted scanner already in operation , the searchable online atlas will ultimately show any spot in the heavens as it appeared from the late 19th century to the mid-1980s — an astronomical Wayback Machine .
“ Nobody has ever systematically looked at the sky on 100 - year time scales , ” said Josh Grindlay , the Harvard astronomer in charge of the project .
“ There is this whole dimension that has n’t been explored . ”
Walking into the plate stacks , housed in a brick annex on the observatory grounds , is itself like a trip back in time : the dimly lighted rows of green metal cabinets separated by little more than a shoulder ’s breadth , the light tables on which the plates are mounted for inspection with a magnifying loupe , the shelves of old ledgers in which astronomical observations were recorded with fountain pens .
All of this is housed in a repository resting on a slab of concrete extending down toward bedrock , with the interior of the building , a cage inside a cage , structurally decoupled from the exterior walls .
“ The thought was that in an earthquake the two would shake independently , ” Ms. Doane explained .
“ As data goes the plates are pretty sturdy and the collection in good shape .
But they are glass and if not used gently , of course they can crack .
Murphy ’s
Law will guarantee that your star will be on the crack when you go to look at it . ”
For years it was rumored that the base of the building rested on leaf springs like those in an old pickup truck .
In search of the truth , Ms. Doane crawled , flashlight in hand , down through a trapdoor and into the foundation .
No springs in sight , just spiders .
Authenticity and subordination are totally incompatible .

How much time do you spend each day furthering the business objectives of other people ?
Which days of the year are you allowed to be away from the office ?
How far in advance do you have to ask for permission ?
At what time of the day are you allowed to eat lunch ?
When are you permitted to go home ?
How much money are you allowed to make ?
Who has control over your financial fate ?
Working for The Man is one of the biggest compromises to your personal happiness you will ever make .
And it ’s not just the reduced income , schedule restrictions , or soul - crushing decisions made by middle management .
Those are the residual downsides of a much deeper issue .
For the typical full - time employee , your career will constitute at least half of your waking life , or more , once you factor in commuting time , end - of - day exhaustion , and bitter dinner conversations with your spouse about how much your job sucks .
Spending more than half your life living under someone else ’s command is incompatible with living every moment as the full expression of who you are .
Authenticity and the Workplace
This is the true joy of life , the being used up for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one ; being a force of nature instead of a feverish , selfish little clod of ailments and grievances , complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy .
I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community and as long as I live , it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can .
I want to be thoroughly used up when I die , for the harder I work , the more I live .
Life is no “ brief candle ” to me .
It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for a moment , and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations .
— George Bernard Shaw
Have you ever been part of a project that you cared deeply about , but felt like you had no real say in the final result ?
Ever come up with a creative new feature to add to your product , gotten really excited about it , and had it shot down by management before you even had a chance to begin explaining it ?
Ever had a really cool idea that gained traction with the higher - ups , only to be dragged into a meeting about it and have it smoothed over and mediocritized into something completely different than what you intended ?
Me frickin’ too .
There ’s nothing more frustrating than being passionate about your work , in a position to apply your unique perspective to building something that could help change the world , and ending up thoroughly subordinated into the equivalent of a data entry clerk for your bosses ideas .
To feel fulfilled in our careers we do n’t need an amazing salary , several weeks holidays , and a very flexible schedule ( though these do n’t hurt . :)
Personally , I ’ve had all of those at once , and still felt like my work was draining my life force .
What we really need is for our jobs and careers to act as vehicles for self - expression .
We need to be allowed to bring authenticity to the workplace , and get paid to be unique .
A good manager is more than just someone who delegates tasks .
A good manager will figure out how to ignite and inspire their employees to apply their own unique perspective to coming up with a creative solution to the problem at hand .
Of course , in the Real World ( TM ) most managers are the boss they would hate to work for .
Though there are a lot of job adverts looking for people who have an entrepreneurial spirit , your creativity and originality is often discarded , unless it happens to match what the boss already had in mind .
Fortunately , the only person who can claim responsibility for you working at a job you hate is you .
Though you may feel helpless and unhappy at work , you can condition yourself to a higher standard .
Career = Passion + Income
If you find yourself wanting more from your career , try changing the way you define it .
Think of a career as what you do to monetize the pursuit of happiness .
It sounds simple , and perhaps naively ambitious , but ask yourself :
How many hours of each day do you spend taking action to live your ideal life ?
For most people the answer is either “ None ” , or a list of excuses about why now is not the right time .
No action = no output = no results .
For example , I ’m really interested in personal growth .
I consume an enormous amount of material on the subject , participate in some online discussions related to personal growth , and am constantly applying interesting ideas to my own life , measuring the results , and writing about the experiences I ’ve had .
I often find myself directing conversations I have with people towards understanding what the other person really wants in life , and what action they ’ve been taking lately to get it .
I recently helped a friend of mine land a consulting contract at a rate that is much more worthy of his talents than what he currently makes .
A few weeks ago , I convinced my little brother to come visit me in Montreal to experience life at a higher frequency .
When he got here , I helped him develop the habit of talking to strangers .
He had the time of his life , and now spends a lot of his time aching to return . :)
Making the Leap
The natural next step for me was to create 30 sleeps which is both a blog and a companion website to help dream chasers unite .
I wanted to create an online community of people who need help finding their purpose and / or are driven to realize their full potential .
30 zzz was my own 30 - day challenge , to go from thinking about starting a company to actually starting a company .
I had such a difficult time taking action at first that I literally had to sit down at my computer and force myself to start writing code .
The initial cut was ugly and painful — so bad that I started over a couple times .
But now it ’s real .
It ’s still full of uncertainty and risk , and if I do fail , a lot of people will know about it , but the only way to live is dangerously .
You will likely spend over half your waking hours earning your living , and unless you make a concerted effort otherwise , you ’ll probably spend that time forwarding someone else ’s goals and living by someone else ’s rules .
The biggest downside to working for others is that it holds you back from living an authentic life .
By thinking of your career as a way to “ monetize the pursuit of happiness ” , you will condition yourself to recognize and create opportunities that allow you to follow your bliss and get paid at the same time .

Any hopes that this attitude might have changed were dashed two weeks ago , when Prime Minister John Howard announced a new crusade .
Following a report calling for action on child abuse in Aboriginal communities , he announced a six - month ban on alcohol and pornography within the homelands , compulsory medical checks for indigenous children and restrictions on welfare payments .
As commander - in - chief of an army of police , the Australian Defence Force and hordes of doctors and nurses , he will storm the 70 or so autonomous Aboriginal settlements in the Northern Territory .
He can do this because the Northern Territory , having failed in a recent , rather half - hearted bid for statehood , is directly administered by the Australian government .
For Aboriginal people , Howard 's edict is just another sudden and draconian shift in the law as it relates to them ; just another pillar in a lifetime of being shoved from pillar to post .
It is hard not to view this as yet another attack on native title by the white establishment .
No sooner had Aboriginal peoples achieved , after a tremendous expenditure of time , effort , expertise and money , freehold title to bits and pieces of country under the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights
Act , than there was an attempt to redefine freehold as it applied to Aboriginal areas , so that they could be reclaimed if there should be a need - for minerals , fossil fuels , foreign bases , tracking stations , whatever .
New laws in 1993 and 1998 sealed this flagrant violation .
Now , having had such resounding success in rescuing Iraq from tyranny , fanaticism and madness , Howard claims to be riding to the rescue of Aboriginal children in distress .
The prime minister of Australia should know , however , that most of the areas under Aboriginal control in the Northern Territory are already dry .
The elders would have greater success in keeping them that way if Howard and his Myrmidons would do the job they have been elected to do .
Rather than wresting nominal control of Aboriginal homelands to himself and so undermining the authority of the elders still further , Howard could bring the full force of the law to bear on the white bootleggers who bring grog into dry Aboriginal communities by night and sell it at exorbitant prices .
Even in apparently successful communities such as Utopia , homeland of the great painter Emily Kngwarreye , the bootleggers turn up almost every night .
I was staying there in 2000 when drunken hoodlums smashed up the health centre in the small hours .
The next day the senior law women sent the offenders into the bush to live off the land for six months , as punishment .
My car had been searched when I arrived to make sure that I had brought no alcohol with me ; but next morning all the men I saw were either staggering drunk or lying unconscious in the scrub .
Though the bootleggers drive unmistakable four - wheel - drive trucks with giant balloon tyres that carry them over the roadless expanse , leaving a mile - long dust plume easily visible from the sky , the federal authorities remain curiously unable to intercept the traffic , even though the government is missing out on significant revenue .
Anyone who really cared about what alcohol was doing to Aboriginal communities would surely have done something to curb the illicit trade .
Perhaps they would also have done something about the fact that , in Alice Springs , as in most other frontier towns , there are dozens of liquor outlets and hardly any shops selling fresh foodstuffs , which , if you can find them , are crushingly expensive .
If your feet are bare , you are not allowed in the Alice Springs food mall at all .
The name of the game , as usual , is bad faith .
Everything Howard does is calculated to win him votes .
The suffering of Aboriginal women and children at the hands of their deranged menfolk has been going on all Howard 's life .
For most of that time whitefellas made a joke of it .
At this late hour , on the eve of a general election , he is suddenly taking it seriously .
It is of no consequence that what he is doing is illegal .
His treatment of asylum seekers and boat people is just as illegal , and it is widely admired by Australians and people who should know better .
Not for nothing did Howard single out the best - known Aboriginal community in Australia , Mutitjulu , home of the traditional owners of Uluru , visited by 500,000 tourists a year , to begin his campaign against child abuse in Aboriginal communities .
The papers call it paedophilia ; to someone standing closer it looks less like a sexual perversion than a hideous extension of demented self - destructiveness .
It is part of a continuum that includes the tragically high rates of suicide in Aboriginal communities .
In 2005 , suicide accounted for 4.3 % of Aboriginal deaths , compared with 1.6 % of other Australians .
As whitefellas tear their country apart , blackfellas are tearing themselves apart .
For years , the extinction of the Australian Aborigine has been eagerly looked forward to and repeatedly described as imminent .
In fact , there are probably more Aboriginal people alive in Australia today than there were when Captain Cook planted the British flag at Botany Bay in 1770 .
But while their numbers are growing , so is their unending suffering .
Aboriginal people are tough , and it is the fate of the toughest to suffer longest and hardest .
A year ago , the government stripped Mutitjulu of its annual funding of A$ 3 m ( £ 1 m ) and installed a white man from Perth as adminstrator to the council .
Two weeks ago the federal court ruled the appointment invalid .
The elders rejoiced .
Then Howard announced his coup d'etat .
Until then tourists could n't get to see Mutitjulu , because no one could get in without a permit .
Simply walking in could get you a fine of A$ 1,000 .
Now Howard has swept away the right of Aboriginal freeholders to keep interlopers off their land ; the permit system is to be abolished and tourists will be able to add Aboriginal dysfunction to the sights they go to see .
Boundaries are important to Aboriginal peoples , who have always respected each other 's space and have suffered acutely whenever disparate groups have been forced to occupy the same space .
Land confers identity ; failing to protect the integrity of one 's land is tantamount to annihilation .
The police , who are even now marching towards Aboriginal settlements under Howard 's banner , have had so little success in dealing with urban Aboriginal people that there were anti-police riots in Sydney 's inner suburb of Redfern in January 2004 .
The unfortunates who are sent to enforce Howard 's bans will have no special training in dealing with rural tribal peoples and will probably find themselves in real danger .
The situation is complex .
Lately , British newspapers have been hearing about Wadeye ( pronounced Wa - de - ye ) , otherwise known as Port Keats .
Like many Aboriginal communities , Wadeye had its beginnings as a mission , in this case a Catholic mission founded in 1935 at the request of the federal government .
The Bishop of Darwin appointed a missionary of the Sacred Heart , West Australian Richard Docherty , to set up the suggested mission at a place called Werntek Nganayi , where he was to establish a garden and teach the Aborigines to grow their food rather than gathering it .
The mission also ran a cattle station in the Daly River reserve .
In 1975 , however , the federal government recognised Aboriginal claims to the reserve and it therefore became inalienable freehold land vested in the Daly River / Port Keats Aboriginal Trust .
Aborigines were happier working with a stock whip than a hoe , but even so , when they managed to redeem the land from the pastoralists who had employed them , they usually ate the cattle and allowed the land to recover .
There being no game to hunt any more , they now usually live on rotisserie chicken and frozen mutton chops from the local store .
Though they see no point in working nine - to - five , Aboriginal people find as little satisfaction in doing nothing as anyone else .
Their lives used to be full of activity - not only finding food , preparing and eating it , but interpreting the places they were travelling through and the time they were in , and how all things came to be as they are .
If I take a four - wheel - drive to visit friends at the Anmatyerre women 's camp at Atangkere , on what used to be Utopia Station , further south in the Northern Territory , the women will grab their crowbars and axes and pile in , making me drive 50 miles into the bush so we can go hunting for goanna ( monitor lizards ) .
People who seem too idle and dispirited to do anything will walk for whole days in search of bush tucker .
Nothing is brought back from such a foray ; the hunter - gatherer way is to make a fire , cook the food , and eat it on the spot .
Father Docherty 's first choice of site was mistaken .
The sea encroached in the rainy season and turned the surface water to salt , so the mission moved south to Port Keats .
The indigenous people who were driven off their land to end up at Wadeye came from 23 clans who would normally have hunted and gathered on their own traditional lands ; between them they spoke seven languages .
The land at Wadeye belonged to the Kardu Diminin , who spoke Murrinh - Patha ; no one asked them how they felt about having to accommodate outsiders and no one asked the outsiders how they felt about having Murrinh - Patha taught to their children along with Catholic doctrine .
Officialdom has never made any attempt to cope with the multiplicity and complexity of Aboriginal culture .
For groups who have jealously guarded their distinctness and carefully managed their intercommunal negotiations for 40,000 years , enforced togetherness brings intense psychological stress .
For six months of the year the disparate clans of Wadeye cannot get out of each other 's way , as they are hemmed in by the wet , with neither roads nor runways usable .
Like most of its ilk , the Wadeye mission combined indoctrination with forced labour .
The natives lived in dormitories and had no choice but to attend school every day or put in the hours working .
There are now 800 children of school age in Wadeye but only 57 of them can be relied on to turn up at school every day .
That is partly because in 2004 , after a tremendous drive to force parents to get their children to school under threat of withdrawal of welfare , the school facilities were found to be hopelessly inadequate , with neither teachers nor space for the number of children .
In 2005 , the Thamarrur regional council , which now governs Wadeye , took legal advice on their chances of suing the federal government for violation of their civil rights by not providing basic education ; the complaint was finally lodged a month ago .
As there are no employment opportunities , education has no obvious point .
All but about 50 of Wadeye 's indigenous population of 2,700 live on " sit - down " money , as welfare payments are known .
For years , some of the elders at Wadeye have dreamed of returning to their homelands , or " outstations " , but depression and stress have sapped their energy .
Catholic education replaced the discipline of " learning country " and preparing for initiation , so young men are now incapable of living off the land .
Men who know how to bag magpie geese , track and bring down introduced feral pigs and native kangaroos , find barramundi , catfish , dugong and turtles , may still command respect , but too many of the senior men with the necessary skills are no longer living in Wadeye .
Why ?
Because Wadeye is dry .
The missing men have moved to Darwin , where they can drink .
Howard 's latest spasm of concern for the people of the Northern Territory could result in a double irony .
Already , areas where the liquor ban has been effective are suffering because adult men are moving to urban areas where they can drink ; a more effective imposition of the ban by non-Aboriginal authorities is likely to intensify this trend .
Behaviour that is now shame - faced could soon be seen as defiant and assertive .
Petrol - sniffing used to be a problem , but now petrol has been rendered unsniffable .
The drug of choice for young men in Wadeye is marijuana , known to them as gunja .
Meanwhile , Wadeye has grown to be the sixth biggest town in the Northern Territory , yet it has only 154 houses , 33 of which are derelict and should be demolished .
In the others , occupancy stands at between five and six people per bedroom , a common state of affairs in the homelands .
Dislocation , dispersion , rounding up and regimentation were followed , as usual , by neglect .
In 2001 , a vast gas field , christened Blacktip , was discovered 70 miles offshore from Wadeye .
Development of this priceless resource is now well under way .
The gas from the Blacktip field will be piped to Yeltherr beach , just south of Wadeye , where an onshore gas plant will be constructed and the gas piped east to Ban Ban Springs on the Adelaide River to supply Darwin .
Work on the pipeline began a few weeks ago and is expected to be complete by next August ; 130 Northern Territory companies will be involved in the works , including the construction of the pipelines , the oil wells , the offshore platform and the onshore gas plant , but not one word has been said about the involvement of the inhabitants of Wadeye .
As most of them have not completed primary education , and can neither read nor write nor speak English , it is hard to see how they could be involved .
An earlier deal that would have provided Aboriginal groups with equity of $ 250 m in recognition of the pipeline crossing their land was abandoned , when the client , the aluminium giant Alcan , found a cheaper supplier in Papua New Guinea .
Perhaps it was the increasing attention paid to Wadeye by the international community during the negotiations for the development of the gasfield that prompted the arrival of a GP for Wadeye , where for years there had been no doctor .
When Pat Rebgetz arrived at the beginning of 2006 , he was horrified by what he found and by the inadequacy of the resources .
He had been in place only six months when gang warfare exploded , which occasioned an earlier threat from Howard to deploy the army against his own citizens .
In the immediate aftermath of the mayhem , Mal Brough , minister for families , communities and indigenous affairs , came to town .
Instead of being appalled at the evidence of criminal neglect on the part of the authorities whom he represented , he laid into the inhabitants , ordering them to clean the graffiti off their walls , collect the rubbish littering the streets , and get their kids to the school that was n't big enough to hold them , on pain of having their funding frozen .
The people responded badly , saying they were not " going to bloody fall down in a heap just because some clown like Brough comes along and wants to bounce us " .
As one citizen told a reporter , " I wo n't do it , because of him asking me . "
Brough just did n't get it .
He thought the Wadeye people recognised his authority , but they did n't .
The people of Wadeye will take government money as part payment for what the whitefellas took away from them , namely , everything , including their natural gas , but they simply do n't see that that gives the whitefellas the right to tell them what to do .
Their recalcitrance is not stupidity or wickedness but resistance - eternal , implacable , self - destructive resistance .
When Howard takes over the policing of the Aboriginal communities he can expect more of the same .
He will never defeat the Aboriginal peoples , but he will surely increase the bitterness of their suffering .
White settlers have never truly understood the Aborigines .
By the time the newcomers registered the fact that the Aboriginal peoples belonged to something like 700 language groups , many of those groups consisted of only a handful of people .
What had not been thought of even as a nation was a ramified commonwealth with an elaborate diplomacy , in which envoys were dispatched to negotiate terms for crossing disparate territories , sharing particular resources , righting wrongs .
The Aboriginal peoples reacted to contact in different ways .
Some were used to foreigners visiting their land .
Most assumed that the newcomers would adapt to their way of life , and offered to help them find food and show them how to survive by studying and venerating country .
Even when diseases brought by the Europeans reduced thriving communities to a handful of traumatised survivors , there was no concerted attempt to drive the interlopers away .
By the time the Aboriginal peoples realised that the newcomers had laid claim to the whole country and everything in it , it was too late .
It did not occur to Aboriginal Australians that the newcomers did not consider them fully human ; they were outraged when they saw men whipped for insubordination .
A man who offended against tribal law was to be speared ; whether he was speared in a vital organ or not was a measure of the gravity of the offence , but he was not to be beaten like a dog .
The crushing blow that destroyed Aboriginal self - esteem was the gradual realisation that the strangers they had accepted as human like themselves did not reciprocate their respect .
Because Aboriginal people had few visible possessions , their culture seemed simple .
In terms of invisible possessions such as language , spirituality and relationships , it was actually astonishingly complex , and this complexity still hampers interaction with the de facto rulers of Australia .
Rebgetz told Barbara McMahon of the Observer : " There 's a lot of cultural stuff about kinship that means you are obliged to feed a family member if he comes in and says he 's hungry or give him somewhere to stay ... "
This " cultural stuff " , a problem for white administrators ever since welfare began , will not go away .
Whether whitey likes it or not , this is what matters to many Aboriginal people ; it is why two days after they have collected their " kid money " they are broke .
Likewise , when white administrators have offered Aboriginal people " decent housing " they have seen it wrecked and even burned down , yet it does not occur to them that the three - bedroom brick veneer is not what Aboriginal people can use .
Many live in segregated camps , or would if they could .
Indeed , the problem of child abuse would be mitigated if they went back to the tradition of men's camps and camps for women and children .
My Yolngu friends at Yirrkala tend to live on the verandahs of their houses , where they lie in heaps on bare mattresses for most of the day .
They are more likely to light a fire in the front garden than grow flowers in it .
If people have been hunting on the foreshore , there will be oysters roasted on the fire , and the shells thrown in a heap .
Some of the shell middens in Australia are thousands of years old .
Aboriginal people could decide to clean up their oyster shells , but as things stand it is far more important that they do n't .
The insignia of consumer society can be found in heaps around every Aboriginal settlement : discarded clothes , rotting bedding , broken ghetto - blasters , burned - out cars .
You will find versions of this behaviour wherever you find self - regulating Aboriginal people .
Hunter - gatherer morality does not permit the accumulation of possessions and the hunter - gatherer lifestyle does not recognise the ( utterly notional ) value of money .
Emily Kngwarreye once asked one of her patrons for a car for her nephew in payment for one of her paintings .
The car was supplied , Kngwarreye gave it to her nephew and a few weeks later her patron was annoyed to learn that the nephew had sold the new car for A$ 300 .
" Why did he sell the car , a new car , for just A$ 300 ? " he asked .
" Because he only needed A$ 300 , " said Kngwarreye .
Capitalism simply does n't know how to deal with people like this , except perhaps to make money out of them .
Nowadays you 'd need more than the price of a car if you wanted to buy an Emily painting , but she chose to live out her last months of life on her iron bedstead under a tarpaulin , far from the comforts of consumer society , in her own country .

The awful bridge collapse in Minneapolis is a tragedy , but it is also , as Rick Perlstein comments , a " teachable moment . "
Rick has been writing for months about the costs of conservatism , both in terms of crumbling infrastructure and the crumbling regulatory safety net ( his e. coli conservatives ) .
It is not hyperbole to call the bridge collapse , as Rick does , part of the " tax cut death toll . "
The bridge - collapse tragedy is a teachable moment :
This is your government on conservatism .
This year two Democratic Minnesotan legislatures passed a $ 4.18 billion transportation package .
Minnesota 's Republican governor vetoed it because he had taken a no - new - taxes pledge , Grover Norquist - style .
That 's just what conservative politicians do .
The original bill would have put over $ 8 billion toward highways , city , and county roads , and transit over the next decade .
The bill he let passed spent much less .
Now four people are dead , and counting .
Infrastructure collapse is easy to understand , but what about the e. coli conservatives , the ones who have gutted our regulatory system to pad their portfolios ?
Here 's David Goldstein from The Nation :
For decades our government has been dominated by a conservative ideology that claims to despise big government , abhor regulation and adhere to an unswerving faith in the infinite wisdom of the market .
Rick Perlstein dubs this philosophy " E. Coli Conservatism , " and in practice it is not only flawed but corrupt : a calculated conservative project intended to gut our regulatory systems in the interest of sheer corporate greed .
We eat adulterated food not because we cannot adequately regulate the industry but because to do so would eat into the profits of the corporations our regulators serve .
In the six years since 9/11 , food - borne pathogens and toxins have quietly killed ten times the number of Americans who died in the terrorist attacks .
How many more Americans must conservatism kill before our leaders embrace a more responsible ideology ?
So as we contemplate the costs of the Iraq War and what it has cost each of our communities , keep in mind that this is all by design .
A key part of the Bush / Cheney / Rove project is not just to redistribute wealth , but to make Americans mistrust the ability of their government to solve real problems and improve their lives , because that will undermine the Democrats ' key appeal , their ability to actually govern more or less in the public interest .
Not only have Bush / Cheney spent our money and our children 's money on their mendacious and ill - conceived war , they are robbing us of the means and the collective will to rebuild our own country , our crumbling infrastructure and our regulatory safety net , let alone address problems like global climate collapse .
Ironically , these are all areas where we could put millions of Americans to work in decent jobs here at home , rebuilding our social capital , developing new technologies and binding us together as a nation , thus reinvigorating our economy .
Instead , we may see any " peace dividend " from ending the Iraq War , like the last " peace dividend " under Bush 's father , going to bail out financial institutions , in this case those who bought excessively risky loans made by greedy mortgage brokers .
That 's conservatism , folks !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday moved to block President George W. Bush from developing a new generation of atomic warheads , as Democratic and Republican opponents said the administration had not developed an adequate post - Cold War nuclear strategy .
A fiscal 2008 bill funding Department of Energy weapons programs that is moving through the House provided none of Bush ’s nearly $ 89 million request for continuing to develop the new warheads over the next few decades at a multibillion - dollar cost .
A vote on passing the overall bill was delayed until sometime after a July 4 holiday recess so lawmakers can review a series of unrelated projects that will be attached to the legislation .
The bill , which faces a White House veto threat because it would spend $ 1.1 billion more than Bush requested , still must be debated by the Senate .
“ I do n’t think it is asking too much for a comprehensive nuclear strategy before we build a new nuclear weapon , ” said Rep.
Peter Visclosky , the Indiana Democrat steering the money bill through the House .
Rep. David Hobson , an Ohio Republican , also voiced opposition , saying that while “ The concept of RRW ( Reliable Replacement Warhead ) has merit if it allows us to have a smaller stockpile of more reliable weapons ... all we have right now is a vague promise . ”
The proposed warheads would replace some that are 30 years old and could deteriorate if not properly maintained .
Some supporters of the new warhead argue that small changes might be needed to extend the life of the existing ones and that could lead to nuclear testing for the first time in more than a decade .
They also say the large existing stockpile could be replaced with fewer , more efficient warheads .
But opponents challenge assertions that testing would not be needed for the new warhead .
They also say the existing stockpile could be maintained indefinitely and there is no military need for a new , costly weapon .
DIPLOMATIC PROBLEMS
A House Appropriations Committee report said that going ahead with the program also would present diplomatic problems because “ of the U.S. policy position of demanding other nations give up their nuclear ambitions while the U.S. aggressively pursues a program to build new nuclear warheads . ”
The Bush administration has been trying to pressure Iran to abandon a nuclear program that Tehran insists is aimed at energy production and not producing weapons .
For a long time , the United States also has been cajoling North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program .
In a statement last week , the White House said it “ strongly opposes the committee ’s decision to eliminate funding for the Reliable Replacement Warhead . ”
But it did not say Bush would veto the bill over this issue .
Rep . Heather Wilson , a New Mexico Republican whose district includes the Sandia National Laboratories that works on nuclear weapons projects , called the House provision “ devastating to American nuclear weapons capabilities ” and said it was “ rubbish ” that the United States had not developed a post - Cold War strategy for nuclear weapons .
The House bill would spend $ 5.9 billion on Energy Department weapons programs , $ 632 million below Bush ’s request and $ 396 million below this year ’s level .
It would cut 37 weapons program accounts .
The legislation would significantly increase nuclear nonproliferation activities , including money to secure nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union and to increase efforts to keep them from entering the United States .
Devoid of Stars
It ’s Saturday night and Café Machiavelli is packed .
There are so many customers in the dining room that the mass of their collective bodies forms a swirling vortex of need and want , collapsing perspective and time into an emotional black hole .
As I walk across the restaurant ’s stone floor , I skirt the edge of the maelstrom ’s event horizon , loop around the hostess stand , and park myself in a safe orbit behind the dessert station .
It ’s only when my legs come to a complete halt that I realize my heart is racing .
Breaking out in a cold sweat , my vision tunnels and darkness starts to overtake me .
I ’m going down .
Instinctively I drop to one knee , grab the edge of a Formica counter for support , and point my head towards the floor .
As I start driving air in and out of my lungs , the blackness makes a frenzied attempt to finish me off .
Like a fighter pilot struggling though a nine gee turn , I clench the muscles in my thighs and buttocks , forcing blood from my lower extremities into my oxygen starved brain .
In the background , the restaurant clatters and roars as it gorges itself on money , decency , and sweat .
For a moment I think of letting myself faint .
At least I ’d get to go home .
A hand falls on my shoulder .
“ Are you all right ? ” the person it ’s attached to asks .
Instead of answering , I concentrate on my breathing .
If I open my mouth I ’ll throw up .
The friendly hand on my shoulder provides a steady warm pressure , helping me throttle my heart back into a normal rhythm .
After a minute the blackness slips away and I stand up straight .
When I open my eyes I see Jimmy , Café Machiavelli ’s youngest busboy , looking at me with concern .
“ I ’m okay , ” I say , suddenly feeling very thirsty .
“ I just felt faint . ”
“ You were white as a sheet there for a minute , ” Jimmy says .
“ Too much running around , ” I say , pouring myself a glass of water .
“ You need any help ? ”
“ I ’ve got to make nine cappuccinos and plate eight desserts .
Think you can give me a hand ? ”
“ Sure , ” Jimmy replies .
“ I ’ll do the desserts . ”
“ Thanks , man . ”
I finish my water and get to work .
My table ordered four regular and five decaf cappuccinos .
The only way I can avoid going into the weeds is to cut corners .
I whip a plastic soda pitcher full of milk into foam , brew a pot of decaf espresso , line up nine glasses , and start assembling my coffees assembly line style .
Everyone ’s getting decaf tonight .
Suddenly Willem , the restaurant ’s manager , makes an appearance .
“ What the fuck are you doing ? ” he asks Jimmy .
“ I ’m helping him make desserts , ” Jimmy replies .
“ Get back on the floor , ” Willem yelps .
“ Making desserts is n’t your job . ”
“ But … … ”
“ Back on the floor ! ” Willem barks .
“ It ’s okay Jimmy , ” I interject gently .
“ I can handle it from here . ”
After Jimmy exits the dessert station Willem sticks his face two inches from mine .
His breath stinks and his chubby face is beaded with desperate perspiration .
“ Why the fuck ca n’t you handle your tables ? ” he asks me .
“ There ’s only four servers on tonight , ” I reply .
“ What did you expect ? ”
“ Do n’t give me that shit , ” Willem says , shaking his head disgustedly .
“ You walk around here like super waiter but go in the weeds over a few desserts .
I do n’t know where you learned to wait tables , but you need to work faster . ”
“ Gimme a break ” I groan .
“ We ’re all busting our ass tonight . ”
“ Shut up and get your ass in gear . ”
Anger detonates in my chest .
I ’m sick and tired of being treated like a fourth grader by a bunch of kindergartners .
“ There ’s a difference between fine dining and working in a diner Willem , ” I retort hotly .
“ And if you were n’t such a jerk to work for , then maybe everyone would n’t be quitting . ”
“ Wha…… . ”
“ How many bus people have we lost this week ? ” I ask .
“ Three ? ”
“ The bus people are not your concern . ”
“ It is when I ca n’t get my tables cleared . ”
“ I ’m gonna talk to the owner about you , ” Willem gloats .
“ He ’s gonna fire you . ”
“ Get the fuck out of my face Willem , ” I reply , my voice compact with menace , “ Or I ’ll run right over you . ”
Surprised , Willem whitens with shock and slinks away .
I finish assembling my cappuccinos , place them on a large tray , and deliver them to my table .
“ I ’ll be right back with your desserts , ” I say , setting the last coffee on the table .
“ Waiter , ” the table ’s host says icily , “ Everything ’s been slow tonight – the service , the kitchen , and now dessert .
What ’s going on here ? ”
“ My apologies , sir .
We ’re short staffed . ”
“ And where ’s Gwendolyn ? ” the man asks .
“ She always used to wait on us . ”
“ She no longer works here I ’m afraid . ”
The man shakes his head .
“ Everyone here is new , ” he mutters .
“ No one knows what they ’re doing . ”
There ’s nothing to say so I say nothing .
I return to the dessert station to finish plating my desserts .
When I get there Willem ’s waiting with the owner .
“ What ’s going on ? ” the owner asks .
“ Your manager does n’t know how to handle people , ” I reply evenly .
“ He ’s rude , arrogant , and socially inept .
If I hear another word out of his mouth I ’ll quit right now . ”
“ I do n’t want you to do that , ” the owner says .
“ Then tell him to get off my back . ”
“ Okay . ”
Willem ’s face registers betrayal , shocked that the owner threw him under the bus .
Since we ’re down so many staff , I knew the owner ’s reaction would break my way .
That Willem could n’t predict this outcome means that his days are numbered .
He storms off , furious .
Undaunted , I finish delivering my desserts , grab another table ’s coffee order , and head back to the espresso machine .
As I garnish my demitasse cups with lemon rinds I look at the dining room .
It ’s a nightmare .
The customers are angry that everything ’s taking so long .
No one is smiling , everyone looks miserable , and the restaurant ’s atmosphere is light years from being hospitable .
Café Machiavelli seems to be sucking the life out of everyone tonight , including me .
Maybe that ’s why I felt faint earlier .
Then , out of the corner of my eye , I see Willem struggling .
He ’s got a tray laden with drinks in one hand , a plate of food in another , and an impatient customer trying to get his attention by tugging on his apron .
I consider going to help him but decide against it .
I want to watch Willem get sucked into the center of the restaurant ’s black hole and be annihilated .
I shake my head .
I ’m at a point in my life where I can no longer deal with people who suck the life out of me .
I ’m know I ’m being self protective , but sometimes defending yourself involves being ruthless and cruel .
I do n’t like that part of myself .
Without lifting a finger to help him , I watch as Willem falls into the restaurant ’s whirling center and gets crushed inside its ravenous core .
“ Better him than me , ” I say to myself , adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars .
BEIJING : A mystery virus that is killing millions of pigs in southern China is responsible for soaring pork prices that have the senior leadership worried about inflation and social unrest .
The Premier , Wen Jiabao , took the unusual step of visiting supermarkets and pig farms in Shaanxi province at the weekend to show the central Government 's concern about the price of one of China 's staple foods and its most affordable source of protein .
At the weekend , shoppers lined up for more than a kilometre at a Guangzhou supermarket to buy pork on special for 15.8 yuan ( $ 2.50 ) a kilogram .
The parents of 24,000 children in northern Pakistan refused to allow health workers to administer polio vaccinations last month , mostly due to rumours that the harmless vaccine was an American plot to sterilise innocent Muslim children .
The disinformation - spread by extremist clerics using mosque loudspeakers and illegal radio stations , and by word of mouth - has caused a sharp jump in polio cases in Pakistan and hit global efforts to eradicate the debilitating disease .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) recorded 39 cases of polio in Pakistan in 2006 , up from 28 in 2005 .
The disease is concentrated in North - West Frontier Province , where 60 % of the refusals were attributed to " religious reasons " .
" It was very striking .
There was a lot of anti-American propaganda as well as some misconceptions about sterilisation , " said Dr Sarfaraz Afridi , a campaign manager with the WHO in Peshawar .
The scaremongering and appeals to Islam echoed a similar campaign in the Nigerian state of Kano in 2003 , where the disease then spread to 12 polio - free countries over the following 18 months .
Pakistan is one of just four countries where polio remains endemic .
The others are Nigeria , India and Afghanistan .
The North - West Frontier Province government made strenuous efforts to counter talk of an " infidel vaccine " .
Health workers fanning across the province last month were equipped with copies of a fatwa , or religious order , endorsing the vaccinations and signed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Qazi Hussain Ahmed , the leaders of Pakistan 's most powerful religious parties .
The move reassured many doubters .
More than 5.7 million children were vaccinated in January , with another 3 million targeted in a second round due to start next Tuesday .
" The elephant is over .
We are left with just the tail , " said Dr Afridi .
But the tail has a deadly sting .
Even though only 24,000 children missed the vaccine , the WHO officials said failure to vaccinate in small pockets of the country gave the virus a fresh toehold to spread .
The vaccination struggle is entangled with the confrontation between the government and powerful militants in the tribal areas .
Refusals were highest in areas where conservative clerics and self - styled " Pakistani Taliban " fighters hold sway , flouting government authority and making their own strict laws .
Almost 2,000 children were not vaccinated in Bajaur , a tribal agency on the Afghan border where US warplanes bombed a house last year in the hope of killing al - Qaida 's No2 , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The jets missed their target but inflamed extremist sentiment .
Recently militants ordered Bajaur 's barbers to stop shaving beards on the grounds that it was " un-Islamic " .
The barbers complied .
In nearby Swat Valley , a young firebrand cleric , Maulana Fazlullah , denounced the polio campaign through a local FM radio station .
His brother was killed in a Pakistani army attack on a madrasa , or Islamic school , late last year .
Almost 4,000 children were not vaccinated in Swat .
Imran Khan , of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , said : " Some people feel they are under attack here ...
That is clouding their attitudes . "
Demands for " assistance " from local officials and elders was the other major factor behind the refusals .
In the Mohmand tribal agency , policemen demanded their salaries before allowing vaccination to proceed .
Other villagers asked for money or the release of criminals from jail .
" Demand " refusals accounted for about one - third of cases , the WHO said .
But some brave women were uncowed by the extortion or demagoguery .
Up to 200 babies a day are vaccinated at the Khyber teaching hospital in Peshawar , where burka - clad women arrive with children in their arms .
Some arrive in secret , slipping into the clinic in defiance of male relatives who oppose vaccination .
" One woman told me , ' My husband is illiterate .
He has no idea how important this vaccine is , ' " said Muhammad Islam , a male nurse .
Aid workers fear they are being pushed into the frontline of the struggle between the government and tribal militants , some linked to the Taliban and al - Qaida .
Last weekend a grenade was lobbed into a Red Crescent compound in Peshawar , damaging vehicles but killing nobody .
Some linked the attack to a fatwa issued in Dara Adam Khel , a lawless town famous for its gunsmiths , just before Christmas .
A cleric named Mufti Khalid Shah declared a fatwa on employees of the UN , WHO and all other foreign organisations .
" Killing their employees is in line with the teachings of jihad in Islam , " said a notice .
" We are very worried , " said Mr Khan , of the Human Rights Commission .
" You have to be very careful about admitting to working for an NGO these days . "
Recently aid workers in Bannu , near North Waziristan , were sent a letter and a 500 rupee ( £ 4.50 ) note , he said .
" The letter said they had a choice .
They could either stop work or buy their own coffin . "
Backstory
Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection of the nervous system .
Worldwide more than half of infections are in children under five .
One in two hundred infections leads to permanent paralysis , usually in the legs .
In 5 - 10 % of these cases the victims die when the breathing muscles are paralysed .
Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988 the number of reported cases worldwide has fallen from 350,000 to 1,968 - a decrease of over 99 % .
Today it remains endemic in four countries : Nigeria , India , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In 1988 affected countries numbered 125 .
While there remains no cure for polio the progress towards its eradication is due to widespread use of polio vaccines .
By 2002 the WHO had certified 124 countries polio - free .
More than 2 billion children have been immunised against the disease since 1988 .
The WHO estimates that because of the initiative five million fewer people have been paralysed by the disease .

Why , build a level three Menger Sponge , of course !
What the heck is a Menger Sponge ?
Glad you asked .
It 's a three - dimensional fractcal cube of sorts , first described by Austrian mathematician Karl Menger in 1926 .
When , some seventy years later , Dr. Jeannine Mosely found herself confronted with a gargantuan pile of business cards , rendered useless after the company she worked for changed addresses , she knew what she had to do with them : hand - make a real , live Menger Sponge -- creating an actual object from something that had previously been merely a mathematical abstraction -- a ( sorta nerdy ) feat of Guinness Book proportions .
Before we show you how she made one in reality , a quickie guide to making them in the abstract :
1. Begin with a cube .
2. Divide every face of the cube into 9 squares .
This will sub - divide the cube into 27 smaller cubes , like a Rubik's Cube
3 . Remove the cube at the middle of every face , and remove the cube in the center , leaving 20 cubes ( second image ) .
This is a Level 1 Menger sponge .
4. Repeat steps 1 - 3 for each of the remaining smaller cubes .
66,048 business cards , 8,000 business card cubes ( Menger subunits ) and 150 pounds of cube later , it was finished .
Figuring the whole project required about 600 hours to build , she recruited volunteers from around the country to build parts of it and then ship them to her .
Construction photos after the jump !
First , you 've got to make a cube from six business cards -- without staples , tape or glue -- which Dr. Mosely describes how to do :
To make a cube out of six business cards , first take two cards and place them across each other at right angles , centering them as nearly as possible .
Fold the flaps of the bottom card down over the top card .
Turn them over and repeat .
Pull the two cards apart .
Six of them can be assembled as shown below to make a cube .
All flaps must be on the outside of the finished cube .
For a super - detailed ( and kinda math -y ) description of how Mosely accomplished the rest of her fractal feat , check out this page at the aptly - named Institute for Figuring .
Meanwhile , we 'll skip right to the pictures :

62 years ago , on August 9th , 1945 , the second of the only two atomic bombs ( a plutonium bomb ) ever used as instruments of aggressive war ( against essentially defenseless civilian populations ) was dropped on Nagasaki , Japan , by an all - Christian bomb crew .
The well - trained American soldiers were only " doing their job , " and they did it efficiently .
It had been only 3 days since the first bomb , a uranium bomb , had decimated Hiroshima on August 6 , with chaos and confusion in Tokyo , where the fascist military government and the Emperor had been searching for months for a way to an honorable end of the war which had exhausted the Japanese to virtually moribund status .
( The only obstacle to surrender had been the Truman administration 's insistence on unconditional surrender , which meant that the Emperor Hirohito , whom the Japanese regarded as a deity , would be removed from his figurehead position in Japan — an intolerable demand for the Japanese . )
The Russian army was advancing across Manchuria with the stated aim of entering the war against Japan on August 8 , so there was an extra incentive to end the war quickly : the US military command did not want to divide any spoils or share power after Japan sued for peace .
The US bomber command had spared Hiroshima , Nagasaki and Kokura from the conventional bombing that had burned to the ground 60 + other major Japanese cities during the first half of 1945 .
One of the reasons for targeting relatively undamaged cities with these new weapons of mass destruction was scientific : to see what would happen to intact buildings — and their living inhabitants — when atomic weapons were exploded overhead .
Early in the morning of August 9 , 1945 , a B - 29 Superfortress called Bock 's Car , took off from Tinian Island , with the prayers and blessings of its Lutheran and Catholic chaplains , and headed for Kokura , the primary target .
( Its bomb was code - named " Fat Man , " after Winston Churchill . )
The only field test of a nuclear weapon , blasphemously named " Trinity , " had occurred just three weeks earlier , on July 16 , 1945 at Alamogordo , New Mexico .
The molten lavarock that resulted , still found at the site today , is called trinitite .
With instructions to drop the bomb only on visual sighting , Bock 's Car arrived at Kokura , which was clouded over .
So after circling three times , looking for a break in the clouds , and using up a tremendous amount of valuable fuel in the process , it headed for its secondary target , Nagasaki .
Nagasaki is famous in the history of Japanese Christianity .
Not only was it the site of the largest Christian church in the Orient , St. Mary 's Cathedral , but it also had the largest concentration of baptized Christians in all of Japan .
It was the city where the legendary Jesuit missionary , Francis Xavier , established a mission church in 1549 , a Christian community which survived and prospered for several generations .
However , soon after Xavier 's planting of Christianity in Japan , Portuguese and Spanish commercial interests began to be accurately perceived by the Japanese rulers as exploitive , and therefore the religion of the Europeans ( Christianity ) and their new Japanese converts became the target of brutal persecutions .
Within 60 years of the start of Xavier 's mission church , it was a capital crime to be a Christian .
The Japanese Christians who refused to recant of their beliefs suffered ostracism , torture and even crucifixions similar to the Roman persecutions in the first three centuries of Christianity .
After the reign of terror was over , it appeared to all observers that Japanese Christianity had been stamped out .
However , 250 years later , in the 1850s , after the coercive gunboat diplomacy of Commodore Perry forced open an offshore island for American trade purposes , it was discovered that there were thousands of baptized Christians in Nagasaki , living their faith in a catacomb existence , completely unknown to the government  which immediately started another purge .
But because of international pressure , the persecutions were soon stopped , and Nagasaki Christianity came up from the underground .
And by 1917 , with no help from the government , the Japanese Christian community built the massive St. Mary 's Cathedral , in the Urakami River district of Nagasaki .
Now it turned out , in the mystery of good and evil , that St. Mary 's Cathedral was one of the landmarks that the Bock 's Car bombardier had been briefed on , and looking through his bomb site over Nagasaki that day , he identified the cathedral and ordered the drop .
At 11:02 am , Nagasaki Christianity was boiled , evaporated and carbonized in a scorching , radioactive fireball .
The persecuted , vibrant , faithful , surviving center of Japanese Christianity had become ground zero .
And what the Japanese Imperial government could not do in over 200 years of persecution , American Christians did in 9 seconds .
The entire worshipping community of Nagasaki was wiped out .
The above true ( and unwelcome ) story should stimulate discussion among those who claim to be disciples of Jesus .
The Catholic chaplain for the 509th Composite Group ( the 1500 - man Army Air Force group , whose only job was to successfully deliver the atomic bombs to their targets ) was Father George Zabelka .
Several decades after the war ended , he saw his grave theological error in religiously legitimating the mass slaughter that is modern land and air war .
He finally recognized that the enemies of his nation were not the enemies of God , but rather children of God whom God loved , and whom the followers of Jesus are to also love .
Father Zabelka 's conversion to Christian nonviolence led him to devote the remaining decades of his life speaking out against violence in all its forms , especially the violence of militarism .
The Lutheran chaplain , William Downey , in his counseling of soldiers who had become troubled by their participation in making murder for the state , later denounced all killing , whether by a single bullet or by a weapon of mass destruction .
In Daniel Hallock ’s important book , Hell , Healing and Resistance , he talks about a 1997 Buddhist retreat led by Thich Nhat Hanh that attempted to deal with the hellish post - war existence of combat - traumatized Vietnam War veterans .
Hallock said , " Clearly , Buddhism offers something that cannot be found in institutional Christianity .
But then why should veterans embrace a religion that has blessed the wars that ruined their souls ?
It is no wonder they turn to a gentle Buddhist monk to hear what are , in large part , the truths of Christ . "
As a lifelong Christian , that comment stung , but it was the sting of a sad and sobering truth .
And as a physician who deals with psychologically traumatized patients every day , I know that it is violence , in all its myriad of forms , that bruises the human psyche and soul , and that that trauma is deadly and contagious , and it spreads through the families and on through the 3rd and 4th generations — until somebody stops continuing the domestic violence that military violence breeds .
One of the most difficult " mental illnesses " to treat is combat - induced posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
In its most virulent form , PTSD is virtually incurable .
It is also a fact that whereas most Vietnam War recruits came from churches where they actively practiced their faith , if they came home with PTSD , the percentage returning to the faith community approached zero .
This is a serious spiritual problem for any church that ( either by the active support of its nation 's " glorious " wars or by its silence on such issues ) fails to teach its young people about what the earliest form of Christianity taught about violence : that it was forbidden to those who wished to follow Jesus .
If a Christian community fails to thoroughly inform its confirmands about the gruesome realities of the war zone before they are forced to register for potential conscription into the military , it invites the condemnation that Jesus warned about in Matthew 18:5 –6 : " And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me .
But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea . "
The purpose of this essay is to stimulate open and honest discussion ( at least among the followers of Jesus ) about the ethics of killing by and for one ’s government , not from the perspective of national security ethics , not from the perspective of the military , not from the perspective of ( the pre-Christian ) eye - for - an - eye retaliation that Jesus rejected , but from the perspective of the Sermon on the Mount , the core ethical teachings of Jesus in Matthew 5 , 6 and 7 .
Out of that discussion ( if any are willing to engage in it ) should come answers to those horrible realities that seem to immobilize decent Bible - believing Christians everywhere :
Why are some of us Christians so willing to commit ( or support and / or pay for others to commit ) homicidal violence against other fellow children of a loving , merciful , forgiving God , the God whom Jesus clearly calls us to imitate ?
And what can we Christians do , starting now , to prevent the next war and the next epidemic of combat - induced posttraumatic stress disorder ?
What can we do to prevent the next round of these atrocities , all of which have been perpetrated by professed Christians : the My Lai Massacre , Auschwitz and the other Nazi death camps , Dresden , El Mozote , Rwanda , Jonestown , the black church bombings , the execution of innocent death row inmates , the sanctions against Iraq ( that killed 500,000 children during the 1990s ) , the military annihilation of Fallujah and much of the rest of Iraq and Afghanistan , the torturing of innocents at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay plus the many other international war crimes ( albeit un- indicted to date ) perpetrated by the current " Christian " administration of the United States .
And what is to be done to prevent the next Nagasaki ?
A large portion of the responsibility for the prevention of military atrocities like Nagasaki lies within the organized Christian churches and whether or not they soon start teaching and living what the radical nonviolent Jesus taught and lived .
The next Nagasaki can be prevented if the churches finally heed Jesus ' call to nonviolence and refuse their government 's call for the bodies and souls of their sons and daughters .

The Best of Gary G. Kohls , MD
The full scale 10,000 Year Clock is now under construction .
While there is no completion date scheduled , we do plan to open it to the public once it is ready .
The essay below by Long Now board member Kevin Kelly discusses what we hope the Clock will be once complete .
This is one of several projects by Long Now to foster long - term thinking in the context of the next 10,000 years .
Clock in the Mountain by Kevin Kelly
There is a Clock ringing deep inside a mountain .
It is a huge Clock , hundreds of feet tall , designed to tick for 10,000 years .
Every once in a while the bells of this buried Clock play a melody .
Each time the chimes ring , it ’s a melody the Clock has never played before .
The Clock ’s chimes have been programmed to not repeat themselves for 10,000 years .
Most times the Clock rings when a visitor has wound it , but the Clock hoards energy from a different source and occasionally it will ring itself when no one is around to hear it .
It ’s anyone ’s guess how many beautiful songs will never be heard over the Clock ’s 10 millennial lifespan .
The Clock is real .
It is now being built inside a mountain in western Texas .
This Clock is the first of many millennial Clocks the designers hope will be built around the world and throughout time .
There is a second site for another Clock already purchased at the top of a mountain in eastern Nevada , a site surrounded by a very large grove of 5,000 - year - old bristlecone pines .
Appropriately , bristlecone pines are among the longest - lived organisms on the planet .
The designers of the Clock in Texas expect its chimes will keep ringing twice as long as the oldest 5 millennia - old bristlecone pine .
Ten thousand years is about the age of civilization , so a 10 K - year Clock would measure out a future of civilization equal to its past .
That assumes we are in the middle of whatever journey we are on – an implicit statement of optimism .
The Clock is now being machined and assembled in California and Seattle .
Meantime the mountain in Texas is being readied .
Why would anyone build a Clock inside a mountain with the hope that it will ring for 10,000 years ?
Part of the answer : just so people will ask this question , and having asked it , prompt themselves to conjure with notions of generations and millennia .
If you have a Clock ticking for 10,000 years what kinds of generational - scale questions and projects will it suggest ?
If a Clock can keep going for ten millennia , should n’t we make sure our civilization does as well ?
If the Clock keeps going after we are personally long dead , why not attempt other projects that require future generations to finish ?
The larger question is , as virologist Jonas Salk once asked , “ Are we being good ancestors ? ”
The Clock ’s inventor introduced the idea of the Clock ( in 01995 ) with this context :
I cannot imagine the future , but I care about it .
I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me .
I sense that I am alive at a time of important change , and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well .
I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks .
I want to build a clock that ticks once a year .
The century hand advances once every 100 years , and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium .
I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years .
That ’s Danny Hillis , a polymath inventor , computer engineer , and designer , inventor and prime genius of the Clock .
He and Stewart Brand , a cultural pioneer and trained biologist , launched a non-profit foundation to build at least the first Clock .
Fellow traveler and rock musician Brian Eno named the organization The Long Now Foundation to indicate the expanded sense of time the Clock provokes – not the short now of next quarter , next week , or the next five minutes , but the “ long now ” of centuries .
Eno also composed the never - repeating melody generator that rings the Clock ’s chimes inside the mountain .
Other people unhappy with our society ’s short - attention span are part of this group , including me , one of its charter officers .
This Clock in the Mountain is being funded and built on property owned by Jeff Bezos , the founder and CEO of Amazon.com .
Bezos is also active in designing the full experience of the Clock .
The first step in this multi-decade project was to construct a working 8 - foot - tall prototype .
This test version was finished ( just in time ) on New Year ’s Eve 1999 .
At the stroke of midnight , the prototype 10,000 - year Clock bonged twice to usher in the new millennia , the year 2000 , in front of a small crowd at its temporary home in the Presidio , San Francisco .
The Clock now resides in the London Science Museum .
Somewhat worrisome , there have been moments when it was not wound .
In contrast to the human - scale of the prototype , the Clock in the mountain will be monumental , almost architectural in scale .
It will be roughly 200 feet tall .
Located under a remote limestone mountain near Van Horn , Texas , it will require a day ’s hike to reach its interior gears .
Just reaching the entrance tunnel situated 1500 feet above the high scrub desert will leave some visitors out of breath , nicked by thorns , and wondering what they got themselves into .
To see the Clock you need to start at dawn , like any pilgrimage .
Once you arrive at its hidden entrance in an opening in the rock face , you will find a stainless steel door , and then a second door beyond it .
These act as a kind of crude airlock , keeping out dust and wild animals .
You rotate its round handles to let yourself in , and then seal the doors behind you .
It is totally black .
You head into the darkness of a tunnel a few hundred feet long .
At the end there ’s the mildest hint of light on the floor .
You look up .
There is a tiny dot of light far away , at the top of top of a 500 foot long vertical tunnel about 12 feet in diameter .
There is stuff hanging in the shaft .
The dot of light beckons you .
You begin the ascent .
You start climbing a continuous spiral staircase , winding up the outer rim of the tunnel , rising toward the very faint light overhead .
The stairs are carved out of the rock .
The material above each step has been removed from the tunnel leaving astoundingly precise rock stairs .
To cut the spiral staircase Stuart Kendall of Seattle Solstice invented a special stone slicing robot to continuously grind out the stairs at the rate of a few stairs per day .
His robot incrementally creeps downward while the debris falls into the central shaft out of the way .
Round the tunnel and up the tube toward the light you head .
The first part of the Clock you encounter on the ascent up the spiral staircase is the counterweights of the Clock ’s drive system .
This is a huge stack of stone disks , about the size of a small car , and weighing 10,000 pounds .
Depending on when the clock was last wound , you may have to climb 75 feet before you reach the weights .
After you pass the weights , you arrive at the winding station .
It is a horizontal windlass , or a capstan like the turnstile on an old sailing vessel that winds up an anchor .
It takes two or three visitors to push around the capstan of the clock and to lift its 10,000 - pound stones .
You rotate around until you can no further .
Now the clock is wound .
You keep climbing .
For the next 70 - 80 feet of ascent you pass 20 huge horizontal gears ( called Geneva wheels ) , 8 feet in diameter , each weighing 1,000 pounds .
This is the mechanical computer that calculates the over 3.5 million different melodies that the chimes will ring inside the mountain over the centuries .
The chimes never repeat so that every visitor ’s experience is unique , and the calculated variety creates a sense of progressive time , rather than endless recycling .
And “ calculate ” is the correct word , because cut into the gears is an elaborate system of slots and sliding pins , which , much like a Babbage Difference Engine , will perform digital calculations , generating the next sequence of the ten bells .
Only the Clock calculates without electricity , using your stored energy to moving its physical logic gates and bits .
This is the world ’s slowest computer .
On days when visitors are there to wind it , the calculated melody is transmitted to the chimes , and if you are there at noon , the bells start ringing their unique one - time - only tune .
The 10 chimes are optimized for the acoustics of the shaft space , and they are big .
Finally , way out of breath , you arrive at the primary chamber .
Here is the face of the Clock .
A disk about 8 feet in diameter artfully displays the natural cycles of astronomical time , the pace of the stars and the planets , and the galactic time of the Earth ’s procession .
If you peer deep into the Clock ’s workings you can also see the time of day .
But in order to get the correct time , you need to “ ask ” the clock .
When you first come upon the dials the time it displays is an older time given to the last person to visit .
If no one has visited in a while , say , since 8 months and 3 days ago , it will show the time it was then .
To save energy , the Clock will not move its dials unless they are turned , that is , powered , by a visitor .
The Clock calculates the correct time , but will only display the correct time if you wind up its display wheel .
So yet another hand - turned wheel awaits your effort to update the face of time .
This one is much easier to wind because the dial motion consumes less power than ringing bells .
You start winding and the calendar wheels whirr until BING , it stops and it shows the current date and time .
So how does the Clock keep going if no one visits it for months , or years , or perhaps decades ?
If it is let to run down between visits , who would keep resetting it ?
The Clock is designed to run for 10,000 years even if no one ever visits ( although it would not display the correct time till someone visited ) .
If there is no attention for long periods of time the Clock uses the energy captured by changes in the temperature between day and night on the mountain top above to power its time - keeping apparatus .
In a place like a top of a mountain , this diurnal difference of tens of degrees in temperature is significant and thus powerful .
Thermal power has been used for small mantel clocks before , but it has not been done before at this scale .
The differential power is transmitted to the interior of the Clock by long metal rods .
As long as the sun shines and night comes , the Clock can keep time itself , without human help .
But it ca n’t ring its chimes for long by itself , or show the time it knows , so it needs human visitors .
If the sun shines through the clouds more often than expected , and if the nights are colder than usual , the extra power generated by this difference ( beyond what is ordinarily needed to nudge the pendulum ) will bleed over into the Clock weights .
That means that over time , in ideal conditions , the sun will actually wind up the chimes , and wind them up sufficiently for them to ring when no one is there .
The rotating dials , gears , spinning governor , and internal slips of pins and slots within the Clock will be visible only if you bring your own light .
The meager dot of light above is not sufficient to see much otherwise .
Lights off , the Clock sits in near total darkness , talking to itself in slow clicks , for perhaps years at a time .
In the darkness you can hear things moving , crisp non-random pings , like a crude thought trying to form inside a dim unlit brain .
Shining your light around the rest of the chamber you ’ll see the pendulum and escapement encased in a shield of quartz glass – to keep out dust , air movements , and critters .
The pendulum , which governs the timing of the Clock , is a 6 - feet - long titanium assembly terminating with football - sized titanium weights .
It swings at a satisfyingly slow 10 - second period .
The slight clicks of its escapement echo loudly in the silence of the mountain .
Building something to last 10,000 years requires both a large dose of optimism and a lot of knowledge .
There ’s a huge geek - out factor in the Clock because the engineering challenges are formidable .
What do you build with that wo n’t corrode in 100 centuries ?
How do you keep it accurate when no one is around ?
The Clock ’s technical solutions are often ingenious .
Almost any kind of artifact can last 10 millennia if stored and cared for properly .
We have examples of 5,000 - year - old wood staffs , papyrus , or leather sandals .
On the other hand , even metal can corrode in a few years of rain .
For longevity a 10 K year environment is more important than the artifact ’s material .
The mountain top in Texas ( and Nevada ) is a high dry desert , and below , in the interior tunnel , the temperature is very even over seasons and by the day ( 55 degrees F ) – another huge plus for longevity since freeze - thaw cycles are as corrosive as water .
Dry , dark and stable temperatures are what archivists love .
It ’s an ideal world for a ceaseless Clock .
Still , the Clock is a machine with moving parts , and parts wear down and lubricants evaporate or corrode .
Most of the Clock will be made in a marine grade 316 stainless steel .
Because the engineering tolerances of the huge Clock are in fractions of an inch , rather than thousandths , the microscopic expansion by a film of rust wo n’t hurt the time keeping .
The main worry of the Clockmakers is that elements of a 10 K - year Clock — by definition — will move slowly .
The millennial dial creeps so slowly it can be said to not move at all during your lifetime .
Metals in contact with each other over those time scales can fuse – defeating the whole purpose of an ongoing timepiece .
Dissimilar metals in contact can eat each other in galvanic corrosion .
To counteract these tendencies some of the key moving parts of the Clock are non-metal — they are stone and hi-tech ceramics .
Ceramics will outlast most metals .
We have found shards of clay pots 17,000 years old .
And modern ceramics can be as hard as diamonds .
All the bearings in the Clock will be engineered ceramic .
Because these bearings are so hard , and rotate at very low speed , they require no lubrication – which normally attracts grit and eventually cause wear .
There is more than just technology in the mountain .
The ticks of time are a very human invention .
Astronomical calendars are among the first pieces of culture , and often the mark of civilizations .
The cave holds culture .
The Clock in the mountain not only plays the music of an ever - changing slow melody , but it will collect cultural expressions of time , ticks to mark the passage of decades and centuries .
Off to the side of the main cavern of the Clock are a series of small grottos to explore and collect these notices of time .
Their contents will be a surprise .
Behind the main chamber ’s dials the stairs continue up to the outside summit of the mountain .
The shaft above Clock continues to the surface , where its opening to the daylight is capped with a cupola of sapphire glass .
This is the only part of the clock visible from outside , on the mountain peak .
In this outdoor cupola sits the thermal - difference device to power the timekeeping , and also a solar synchronizer .
Every sunny noon , a prism directs sunlight down the shaft and slightly heats up this ingenious mechanical device .
That synchronizing signal is transmitted by rods further down to the Clock ’s innards , where the imperceptible variations in the length of the day as the earth wobbles on its axis will be compensated so that the Clock can keep its noon on true solar noon .
In that way the Clock is self - adjusting , and keeps good time over the centuries .
The journey to the Clock in the mountain ends on the summit in light .
It is the sun that powers its ringing below .
Like a heart beating while we sleep , the Clock in the mountain keeps time even when we pretend the past did not happen and the future will not come .
The biggest problem for the beating Clock will be the effects of its human visitors .
Over the span of centuries , valuable stuff of any type tends to be stolen , kids climb everywhere , and hackers naturally try to see how things work or break .
But it is humans that keep the Clock ’s bells wound up , and humans who ask it the time .
The Clock needs us .
It will be an out of the way , long journey to get inside the Clock ringing inside a mountain .
But as long as the Clock ticks , it keeps asking us , in whispers of buried bells , “ Are we being good ancestors ? ”
How do you become one of those time - conscious beings who visit and wind the Clock ?

PARACATU , Brazil ( Reuters ) - Moacir de Mello ’s small farm is squeezed on one side by bulldozers belonging to a Canadian mining firm and on the other by a rancher trying to make him leave .
“ We ’re locked up like a pig in a sty , ” his wife says .

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to grant land titles to descendants of slaves .
But , as the squeeze on Mello and his wife shows , Lula ’s efforts face deeply entrenched racism , red tape , and big business interests .
Brazil brought an estimated 4 million slaves from Africa to work its fields and mines , more than any other country .
After abolition in 1888 , many slaves settled in Paracatu in the central state of Minas Gerais , where they had been digging gold for white owners .
“ My great - great grandfather bought his freedom and this land with the sweat of a slave , ” said Candida Pereira de Mello of the land she occupies with her husband .
Today , many slave descendants , known as Quilombolas , are just as excluded from economic and political life in this colonial town as their ancestors were under slavery .
Blacks make up 70 percent of the town ’s population , compared with 48 percent in Brazil , but it never had a black mayor or even a black representative in the town assembly .
Blacks hold the worst - paying jobs , if any at all .
Since taking office in 2003 , Lula ’s government has improved health , education and the power supply in several communities of Quilombolas .
But state and federal governments have granted only 23 land titles of more than 400 requests .
“ Not enough personnel and too many law suits hold up the process , ” said Maria Bernadete Lopes , the official in Brasilia in charge of protecting black heritage nationally .
Eliane Guimaraes , 35 , said her family and others were forced to leave their ancestral lands for the town decades ago by white settlers with incorrect land titles .
“ Slavery may be over but the racism that sustained it continues the same , ” she said , sifting through a pile of rubbish with her 2 - year - old son on her breast .
“ I ’ve gotten jobs by phone and when they see I ’m black , they say the post is taken , ” said Guimares , who struggles to feed five children making $ 150 a month recycling trash .

TROUBLE AT MINES
In recent years , Kinross Gold Corp. subsidiary RPM has bought up more than 100 properties to expand its gold mine and build a new dam .
Quilombolas said the mine is encroaching on them and said roads they rely on have been cut .
“ We ’re running out of space to live , ” said Cristina Coutrin dos Reis , head of Sao Domingos , one of three Quilombola communities surrounding Paracatu .
RPM dried up a waterfall that was used for recreation and drinking water , she said .
RPM said it is unaware of the claim but installed a well as an alternate water supply .
On the other side of the mine , Ana Lopes de Moraes said two of her sons were shot by company guards several years ago and died of their injuries .
“ I ’ve lived on a mountain of gold all my life but it ’s brought more sadness than happiness , ” said Moraes , 70 .
RPM said it did not know Moraes but said security guards in 1998 and 2000 returned fire against clandestine prospectors .
The company also said it negotiated land directly with the owners , with deeds registered in the registry office in Paracatu .
Another factor that may work against the Quilombolas is that the registry is owned by the sister of a lawyer who represents RPM .
As many as 2,000 Quilombolas in the three communities are fighting for their land in claims that could hold up part of RPM ’s $ 470 million expansion plan and even force the city mayor to move off a disputed plot .
“ The question is not if but how much land they will get , ” said federal prosecutor Jose Sergio Pinto .
But he said the already drawn - out process could end up in court for years .
Anthropologists are determining the extent of the ancestral land , Pinto said .
“ If anybody is on Quilombola land , we either buy or expropriate that area , ” Pinto said .
RPM said it would respect ownership rights if Quilombolas were granted property deeds .
In a city where RPM created numerous jobs , Quilombolas are accused of stifling progress and stirring racial tension .
“ Many people despise us but we did n’t start this conflict , it began when we were brought from Africa against our will , ” says Dario Alegria , head of a local black advocacy group .
Some of the ruling white class side with Alegria .
“ The blacks built this country , shaped our history , culture and food , they have a right to that land , ” said Graca Caetano Jales , Paracatu ’s secretary of culture .
“ We need to find a solution for them because things cannot always end in impunity in Brazil . ”

On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart lampooned former US Iraq consul Paul Bremer -- who somehow managed to lose $ 22 billion in cash .
Said Democrat Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) of the US effort to send so much money to Iraq , " To do that , the Federal Reserve Bank had to pack 281 million individual bills ...
This money , mainly $ 200 bills was packed into bricks and each brick was worth $ 400,000 each ...
The cash weighed more than 363 tons . "
Stewart jokes that the US must have flown " dipped in gold " cargo planes into the sun .
It ’s time !
ImpeachForPeace.org is traveling to Washington DC at the end of this month to deliver thousands of Do - It - Yourself Impeachment Memorials to key representatives in the House !
Currently , we ’ve arranged meetings through the offices of Representatives Robert Wexler , Maxine Waters , and Adam Schiff .
We are still awaiting arrangements with other Representatives .
Support for impeachment is building .
As of this writing , 14 reps are supporting Dennis Kucinich ’s resolution to impeach Dick Cheney ( H. Res. 333 ) .
Even if you ’ve sent them to your congressperson before , Click here to send us your DIY Memorials before we go .
You may not realize that the only thing standing between where we are today and a nationally televised impeachment investigation is the House Judiciary passing this resolution , which is currently awaiting consideration in their
committee .
The head of this committee , John Conyers , has said recently that he supports the national impeachment movement .
All we need to push it over the edge is public support , and that ’s where we come in .
Video of our trip will be posted on our website shortly upon our return .

Here ’s a funny video about this unique strategy
You know what I hate ?
When people who call themselves feminists tell me that I ’m degrading myself or messing myself up by being a stripper ( “ if only she knew what she ’s doing to herself , ” they whisper ) .
After over a decade of dancing , I ’ve got a pretty good idea of exactly what I ’m doing , and I ’m feminist enough not to let them define my experience .
Sometimes men even do it , “ I know it all seems fun and exciting now , but soon you ’ll be passed out on heroin getting raped for ten bucks , trust me , I know these things . ”
They think this does something for their manly image .
I love stripping .
I love getting naked and dancing under red lights .
I love crawling around in peoples laps and bringing them into themselves .
It ’s one of the most sacred things I have ever done .
Sometimes I resent the context of it all .
I resent having to deal with a bunch of drunk young guys who are looking for something so different from what I offer , and I wish I could cloister myself away in a sacred temple convent of holy whores .
But most of the time I appreciate the way a strip club is a tiny replica of the whole world .
I love that I dance with law students and coke heads and we are all just women .
I love that I ’ve learned more about the patriarchy from drunken assholes than is even possible to learn sitting in a feminist theory class listening to abstract concepts .
I also love that I can pretty much work where and whenever I want , and that when I do work I make enough money that I do n’t really have to work very often , if I do n’t want to .
I think it ’s disgusting and fucked up that the dominant culture forces people to go do what they ’re told for forty hours a week in order to have a place to live and food to eat .
Forty hours a week of slavery , in exchange for food and a bed .
If your a good slave , you can have a nice big house , health insurance , and a fancy car , and you ’ll probably identify with the slave - makers .
It ’s an awful system that I like to think I ’m completely seperate from .
Except .
You know what ’s bothering me today ?
That if I ’m going to stay here in my beloved Alaska for the winter , and stay in a warm place , I ’m gonna have to go work for a couple months straight to make the money .
Even worse , if I ’m going to buy land and build my own warm little place to live I ’m gonna have to go work really hard all summer .
Tromping through a Massachusetts state forest , Brad Smith spots an old stump with dead shoots and one lone , green sprout – a sad but not uncommon remnant of a once - proud species – the American chestnut tree .
Except for a few mature trees , the species has struggled for 50 years to survive .
It does that in the same way : Stumps send up sprouts that are quickly attacked by the same invasive blight that wiped out about 3.5 billion chestnut trees between 1904 and 1950 .
" What you 're seeing is the former king of the forest reduced to surviving as a mere shrub , " says Mr. Smith , president of the Massachusetts chapter of the American Chestnut Foundation ( ACF ) .
Now , however , an American chestnut revival may be imminent .
Scientists using traditional plant breeding techniques are on the verge of a breakthrough .
In fact , Smith smiles and shares a little secret : the " holy grail " of American chestnut trees – a hybrid supertree fully resistant to the blight – is alive and growing down south .
Hidden on a country road that winds through rural Meadowview , Va. , is a 93 - acre plot of ground that holds the future of the American chestnut : about 120 hybrid saplings .
The trees – going on two years old and four feet tall – are considered " fully blight resistant " and are thriving .
At this rate , by 2010 there should be enough " holy grail " nuts to begin planting in selected test sites in national forests .
By 2015 , production from such plots is expected to grow exponentially – yielding enough nuts to allow for full - blown replanting – if everything goes well .
Cross - breeding American chestnut trees is a challenge because they do not produce fruit until their sixth year .
Researchers have spent 25 years breeding resistant Chinese varieties of chestnut with nonresistant American versions – then " back - crossing " or breeding resistant American chestnuts with one another .
It 's a difficult project that the US government attempted but dropped long ago .
Restoring the species to its former glory has been the life 's work of Fred Hebard , whom some regard as the American chestnut tree 's Johnny Appleseed .
What he 's growing on his research farm in Meadowview is a tree now 15/16ths American chestnut that will grow tall and true , with 1/16 Chinese chestnut resistance .
" We 're starting to produce the critical generation of fully resistant chestnut , the one we intend to release into the woods , " he says .
" Within three to five years we hope to begin putting out large numbers of trees , maybe 10,000 of them . "
Known as the " sequoia of the East , " the American chestnut was once dominant in forests from Maine to Florida , a majestic giant that easily grew four feet across , 120 feet high and lived for centuries .
Its nuts were an important source of food for animals and humans and its rot-resistant wood prized by timber and furniture companies .
It 's taken Dr. Hebard 18 years of painstaking hybridization to get to this point of having several hundred fully blight - resistant trees .
Before him , predecessor Charles Burnham began the work in 1983 .
Earlier this year , about 2,000 partially blight - resistant American chestnuts were planted on reclaimed mine land .
Those trees may not survive beyond about six or seven years because they are not blight resistant .
Even so , the effort will enable researchers to better understand growing conditions on such land .
Trials of the fully resistant American chestnut are expected within three years , when the ACF and the US Forest Service expect to plant thousands of the best of the " holy grail " seeds in two forests – in Kentucky and West Virginia – the heart of the chestnut 's domain .
About that same time , members of the ACF will also begin receiving seeds for planting .
Indeed , 13 state ACF chapters , whose orchards maintain about 40,000 partially resistant chestnut trees , will play a vital role in the chestnut restoration .
Smith 's Massachusetts chapter , like the others , is growing small orchards of the trees , slowly doing their own hybridization programs .
Pollen from the best trees will be sent from Virginia to ACF chapters to accelerate development of varieties well - suited to regional weather and soil .
One new problem the foundation is facing is n't blight , but keeping the seeds from being sold on eBay for fat profits .
" Everybody and his cousin wants these seeds , but we 've got to be real careful about naming it and what we 're going to claim about [ the trees ' capabilities ] , " says Paul Sisco , a co-architect of the recovery plan with Hebard .
" We wo n't really know how good it 's going to be until about five years from now . "
In fact , a tree labeled " fully blight resistant " may still contract the blight , but it should be able to ward off the fungus altogether .
Other groups , such as the American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation , are taking different approaches to breeding .
Some hold out hope for a direct genetic - engineering fix , although that task is daunting because the tree 's genes have not been sequenced .
" We are planting the hope , and making a commitment , that this noble hardwood will be restored to the American landscape and its vital ecological role in our nation 's forests , " Dirk Kempthorne , US Secretary of the Interior , said on July 26 .
Today when consumers buy chestnuts for " roasting by an open fire " during the holiday season , they come from the Asian chestnut and other varieties that resist blight .
But now it looks as if the American version could return one day .
" I 'm looking forward to growing a really big one in my backyard , " Smith says .

Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Street Gangs ( But Did n’t Know Whom to Ask )
We recently solicited your questions about street gangs for Sudhir Venkatesh , the then - grad student we wrote about in Freakonomics who is now a professor of sociology at Columbia .
His answers are , IMHO , fascinating .
Your questions were really good , too ; thanks .
Venkatesh will publish a book , Gang Leader for a Day , in early 2008 .
Q : Do you think the HBO series The Wire gives an accurate portrayal of gang life ?
It is clear from the show ( if it is as real as it seems ) that traditional policing strategies are very ineffective .
A : I am a huge fan of The Wire .
I actually watched Season Two with a group of high ranking gang leaders / drug dealers in Chicago , who desperately wished that the series producers would make a separate show about Chicago !
Everyone in the room agreed that the writers did well to show the nuances in the underground economy .
Q : A lot of rappers , particularly Jay - Z and 50 Cent , claim to have been successful crack dealers .
Any thoughts on this ?
Were they just low - level dealers barely making a profit , or did they really have something to pay for their future studio time ?
Did any of the gang members you knew claim to be on the dealer - to - rapper fast track program ?
A : In all my years of studying gangs , I have met only a handful of individuals who have actually participated in the dealer - to - rapper fast track program .
Alas , they end up going to jail before they get successful , and most of the ones I ’ve seen ca n’t sing worth a lick .
I ’m deeply skeptical about rappers who proclaim experience with drug sales .
Sure , there are a few exceptions , but for the most part I would be very careful about the claims that are made in songs .
Many rappers are highly trained musicians who have spent little time on the streets , as it were — think of Mos Def .
Q : How do you define a gang ?
A : Great question .
There are a few important legal cases where prosecutors tried to prosecute college fraternities as “ gangs . ”
They suggested that the fraternity was an organization that existed to promote criminal behavior , such as the abuse of women and underage drinking .
Most judges threw these cases out because they thought that fraternities were not , by definition , “ gangs . ”
But judges rarely gave a logical reason for excluding ( typically white ) fraternities from the “ gang category . ”
Indeed , by any valid social scientific definition of a gang – “ an established organization whose members come together for solidarity reasons and who engage in delinquent and / or criminal activities ” – a fraternity most certainly qualifies .
But race , as we know , can be a factor in shaping judicial outcomes .
Q : Yakima , WA , just passed a law that makes it illegal for anyone to be a gang member , with penalties of up to one year in prison .
Also , fines can be imposed on parents for failing to prevent their kids from joining .
Do you think laws like this help ?
Are they effective in any way , shape or form ?
A : The problem with these municipal ordinances is that police do not always have a foolproof way of determining gang membership .
In Chicago , for example , police department officials told me that 4 out of 5 youths are mistakenly believed to be gang members .
In smaller cities — like Yakima — I am almost positive that the rate is much lower .
However , police often do not have an effective way of figuring out whether someone is in a gang , so they round up many young people who have never had any involvement in gang activity .
You can imagine that the ACLU typically challenges these ordinances , although they are not always successful in their efforts to overturn them .
A modified version of this initiative is used informally in many poor communities .
Police will use a “ scared straight ” approach by taking young people to the station where they frighten them with information about jail conditions , the possibility of being beaten up by imprisoned gang members , and so on .
I know many parents who love it when police “ scare ” their children into getting off the corner and back into school .
Q : What role do women play in gangs ?
Are they just for sex ?
Do they ever get to be in charge ?
Are they low - level peons ?
A : In the 1970s and 1980s , female gangs were independent organizations in places like New York , Chicago , Cleveland , and Milwaukee .
They tended to be non-criminal , and usually distributed common funds to their members for day care , rent , groceries , and other needs of single mothers .
On occasion , they might have engaged in petty fighting , but not often .
They were largely political outfits and functioned like social service agencies in ghetto communities that lacked services .
But toward the end of the ’ 80s , they became wrapped up in drug trafficking — and , just like gender subordination in corporate America , they were under the thumbs of males in the gang who controlled the economy .
They were indeed “ peons ” who were given the lowest level jobs by men — e.g. , watching out for cops , holding drugs , cleaning up after gang parties , prostitution — and they had no power at all .
No surprise that the female gangs dissolved over time .
Q : Is there a correlation between illegal drug consumption and gangs ?
If so , do you support drug legalization ?
A : To answer the first question , gang members actually have a fairly low rate of hard drug consumption .
Certainly they consume alcohol and marijuana ( some may call these hard drugs , of course ) , but they usually do n’t have high rates of heroin , crack , and synthetic drug use .
This will change as the gang members get older .
Those in their late twenties can be users on occasion , particularly if they are unemployed and looking to the gang for earnings .
I am not sure if I support legalization .
I support control by the government , but not necessarily legalization .
The former would be immensely helpful from the point of crime control and limiting the secondary effects of drug use , such as hardships on families and devastating impacts on communities .
The reason I do n’t support legalization is that , whenever an illegal substance becomes legalized ( think of alcohol ) , minorities get the short end of the stick ; usually , white ethnic groups have the capital to control the market .
This was the story for gambling in the ghetto .
Q : My impression is that increasing police presence in a neighborhood where a gang is operating just moves the problem .
I lived for four months in such a neighborhood in Portland , OR , and that seemed to be the case there .
The police in my community tell me that … moving the problem is like taking care of a lawn : you have to keep after it all the time or the weeds will take over .
What do you think ?
A : This is a tough question to answer , because drug trafficking has really changed the behavior of urban gangs .
In general , entrepreneur - oriented gangs care about making money , so they will certainly move to new locations when their current place of business proves inhospitable .
That is , they differ from gangs in the old days ( i.e. , before the 1980s when drug - related commerce arrived in force ) .
The earlier gangs protected “ turf ” and took great pride in being a neighborhood outfit .
All forms of illegal commercial activity were a rarity for them .
Having said this , a gang is limited in terms of places where it can go .
Gangs have to have some relationship with local residents , store owners , etc. — even if the tie is only that of intimidation .
So police usually find that gangs who deal drugs tend to maintain several locations , shifting their movements among different street corners , alleys , apartment buildings , abandoned structures , and so on .
Q : What effect has the rise in crystal methamphetamine ( meth ) had on gang structures ?
Following Levitt ’s “ corporate ” description , did the gangs develop different departments , split up completely , or merge ?
Is meth really that major an issue , or is it simply the new crack ?
A : Levitt and I worked on the corporate description in the context of African - American urban street gangs .
Meth tends to be rural / suburban and most users are white .
The meth economy seems to be controlled by individuals or teams who distribute in a highly localized area .
They usually come together only to sell the product , and then they disband until a new sales initiative is put into place .
They are not really gangs in the traditional sense of the term , but independent mercenary producers / distributors .
Q : How do gang members see themselves as fitting in with society at large ?
Do gang members have a real comprehension that the things they do – dealing drugs , engaging in violence , destroying property , scaring people – are widely perceived as not only illegal but also morally wrong ?
A : Many gang members who attain leadership status are deeply conscious of their perception by wider society .
They tend to make two arguments when discussing their behavior : first , that whites also work in the underground economy but are not prosecuted ( or stigmatized ) to the same degree ( just look at the differential rates of punishment for powder cocaine and crack cocaine — the former is distributed by whites to a far greater degree ) ; and second , that corporations also engage in criminal activity , but are rarely viewed as outlaws — not just Enron , but oil and other companies that have established histories of supporting anti-democratic regimes in developing counties to secure their own profits .
Now , you could say that these analogies are bogus and bold - face rationalizations , and I would agree to some degree .
But it is important to look at the world from the perspective of the gang member — who sees everyone as a hustler .
Q : Did you go to all four [ Grateful Dead ] Alpine Valley shows in 1988 ( June 19 , 20 , 22 , 23 ) ?
Which one did you think was best ?
A : Funny you ask .
That year , I made it to the Chicago , Irvine , Oakland , and Stanford shows , most of which were worth remembering .
And I was getting ready for a mini-summer tour before grad school began — Minnesota , Alpine Valley and Maine — when my girlfriend told me I needed to make a choice : Jerry Garcia or her .
So the answer is , “ No , I never made it to Alpine Valley . ”
And , to this day , I have great regrets : I heard they played Blackbird , which I always wanted to hear …
108 House Democrats co-sponsor Gonzales ' no confidence ' motion Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
The number of Congress members co-sponsoring a vote of no confidence for the Attorney General mushroomed to 108 within 48 hours of the introduction of the resolution by Reps.
Adam Schiff ( CA ) and Artur Davis ( AL ) on Monday .
Several prominent Democratic leaders are included on the list of Representatives who are seeking the legislative rebuke and subsequent resignation of Alberto Gonzales .
" The extraordinary support for this House resolution so soon after introduction reflects an emerging consensus in Congress and across the country : Mr. Gonzales should step down , " said Rep.
Schiff in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" The Justice Department needs a strong and independent voice , and someone of unimpeachable credibility .
We must reluctantly conclude that the current Attorney General does not fit the bill . "
" I am encouraged that a steadily rising number of our colleagues want the House to assert itself in this debate , and I am pleased that they recognize that the institutional crisis at the Department of Justice demands a no confidence resolution , " added Rep .
Davis in the statement .
Schiff and Davis 's release indicated that 108 House members had sponsored the bill .
The current list on the Library of Congress 's Thomas database only included 107 at press time .
But some major Democratic leaders were included on the list : Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , who helped shape the strategy to return the Democrats to the majority in November 2006 ; Rep. Charles Rangel , Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee ; Rep. David Obey , Chairman of the Appropriations Committee ; Rep. Louise Slaughter , Chairwoman of the Rules Committee ; Rep. Henry Waxman , Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ; Rep. Ellen Tauscher , Chair of the New Democrat Coalition ; and , Reps. Barbara Lee and Lynn Woolsey , Co-Chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .
However , no Republican Members of Congress are accounted for within the list of co-sponsors at this time .

A life that added up to something
by Charles Krauthammer
Washington Post Writers Group
WASHINGTON - One of the most extraordinary minds of our time has " left . " " Left " is the word Paul Erdos , a prodigiously gifted and productive mathematician , used for " died . " " Died " is the word he used to signify " stopped doing math . "
Erdos never died .
He continued doing math , notoriously a young person 's field , right until the day he died Friday , Sept. 20 .
He was 83 .
It was n't just his vocabulary that was eccentric .
Erdos ' whole life was so improbable no novelist could have invented him ( though he was chronicled beautifully by Paul Hoffman in the November 1987 Atlantic Monthly ) .
He had no home , no family , no possessions , no address .
He went from math conference to math conference , from university to university , knocking on the doors of mathematicians throughout the world , declaring " My brain is open " and moving in .
His colleagues , grateful for a few days collaboration with Erdos - his mathematical breadth was as impressive as his depth - took him in .
Erdos traveled with two suitcases , each half - full .
One had a few clothes ; the other , mathematical papers .
He owned nothing else .
Nothing .
His friends took care of the affairs of everyday life for him - checkbook , tax returns , food .
He did numbers .
He seemed sentenced to a life of solitariness from birth , on the day of which his two sisters , age 3 and 5 , died of scarlet fever , leaving him an only child , doted upon and kept at home by a fretful mother .
Hitler disposed of nearly all the rest of his Hungarian Jewish family .
And Erdos never married .
His Washington
Post obituary ends with this abrupt and rather painful line : " He leaves no immediate survivors . "
But in reality he did : hundreds of scientific collaborators and 1,500 mathematical papers produced with them .
An astonishing legacy in a field where a lifetime product of 50 papers is considered extraordinary .
Mathematicians tend to bloom early and die early .
The great Indian genius , Srinivasa Ramanujan , died at 32 .
The great French mathematician , Evariste Galois died at 21 .
( In a duel .
The night before , it is said , he stayed up all night writing down everything he knew .
Premonition ? )
And those who do n't literally die young , die young in Erdos ' sense .
By 30 , they 've lost it .
Erdos did n't .
He began his work early .
At 20 he discovered a proof for a classic theorem of number theory ( that between any number and its double must lie a prime , i. e. , indivisible , number ) .
He remained fecund till his death .
Indeed , his friend and benefactor , Dr. ( of math , of course ) Ron Graham , estimates that perhaps 50 new Erdos papers are still to appear .
Erdos was unusual in yet one other respect .
The notion of the itinerant , eccentric genius , totally absorbed in his own world of thought , is a cliche that almost always attaches to the adjective " anti-social . "
From Bobby Fischer to Howard Hughes , obsession and misanthropy seem to go together .
Not so Erdos .
He was gentle , open and generous with others .
He believed in making mathematics a social activity .
Indeed , he was the most prolifically collaborative mathematician in history .
Hundreds of colleagues who have published with him or been advised by him can trace some breakthrough or insight to an evening with Erdos , brain open .
That sociability sets him apart from other mathematical geniuses .
Andrew Wiles , for example , recently achieved fame for having solved math 's Holy Grail , Fermat 's Last Theorem - alter having worked on it for seven years in his attic !
Erdos did n't just share his genius .
He shared his money .
It seems comical to say so because he had so little .
But , in fact , it is rather touching .
He had so little because he gave away everything he earned .
He was a soft touch for whatever charitable or hard luck cause came his way .
In India , he once gave away the proceeds from a few lectures he had delivered there to Ramanujan 's impoverished widow .
A few years ago , Graham tells me , Erdos heard of a promising young mathematician who wanted to go to Harvard but was short the money needed .
Erdos arranged to see him and lent him $ 1,000 .
( The sum total of the money Erdos carried around at any one time was about $ 30 . )
He told the young man he could pay it back when he was able to .
Recently , the young man called Graham to say that he had gone through Harvard and was now teaching at Michigan and could finally pay the money back .
What should he do ?
Graham consulted Erdos .
Erdos said , " Tell him to do with the $ 1,000 what I did . "
No survivors , indeed .
I had my Google GMail account for a while but never realized some of the additional services that are included with my Google account like the Search History service .
I decided to check it out and WAS I SURPRISED !
It was a history of my searches since the day I signed up for GMail .
Not only a history , but graphs on monthly , daily even hourly searches .
How can I delete the search records ?
Better yet how can I disable the Search History service ?
Many people are surprised to find out that Google has been tracking their searches since they created an account with Google .
Most of them are confused as they think clearing the search history from their browser will erase past searches , only later to find out that Google 's Search History Servicekeeps a history of searches in their Google account .
Still confused ?
Let 's take a closer look .
If you always stay logged on to your Google account , because you checked you GMail account or use any of Google 's many services or products that tie into your Google account , your searches will be tracked .
How can you tell if you are logged on ?
If you have Personalized your home page , or if you have not , go to Google 's home page , and you will see your GMail address at the top right of the page with three links , one them being Sign Out .
To locate your Search History , click on My Account , then under My Services click on Search History .
You will now see your entire Search History .
You can select the type of searches on the left menus , by the calendar on the right or from the Older and Oldest buttons at the bottom .
Want to see how much web surfing you have done over time ?
Click on the Trends link and be amazed by the level of detail of time you spend on the Internet !
Now that you come back to reality , your probably thrilled or in shock .
If the latter applies and you want to delete some or all of your history , or stop searches from being saved , follow the steps below :
Delete Searches : click on Search History , then select Remove items ( left menu ) and either select items you want cleared ( left menu ) , then click Remove ( right of Google logo ) .
To clear your entire Search History , select Clear entire Search History ( right of Google logo ) .
Note : you can also pause searches .
Pausing temporarily stop searches from being saved .
Delete the Search History Service : Click on My Account , under My Services , select Edit next to My Services .
Then click on Delete Search History and follow the instructions .
You may be thinking that Google is spying on you since they are keeping tabs on your searches , but my guess is that they are doing this to provide targeted advertisements based on your searches in the future .
So the next time your left wondering why you spend too much money online … blame it on Google .
To code or not to code , that is the question for senior software developers when they are presented with the opportunity to move into an architect , project manager or team lead position .
Rob Walling recently wrote an excellent article titled Why Good Developers Are Promoted Into Unhappiness describing his unsatisfying experiences as a manager and the problems that result from promoting star developers into non-development roles .
Rob 's article inspired me to contribute my own thoughts on this subject .
I have been thinking about this general topic for a while , as reflected in two of my recent articles titled How Much Do You Code ? and Are You Doing Enough Coding ?.
These articles have focused more on the amount of coding one does as a software developer , and point out that the more senior the developer , the less coding they tend to do .
Rob 's article , however , focuses on the separate ( but related ) issue of senior developers moving into non-development roles .
I think there are three major forces pushing developers in this direction :
Promotion from management .
The top performers within a team are often the most likely to be promoted to lead the team , even if they and the corporation are better off if they remain developers .
This is especially a problem in hierarchical organizations with no technical career path .
Desire to fix problems .
As Rob pointed out , you may feel obliged to take on a leadership role in order to help your team or save your project .
A contributing factor is the oft - mistaken belief that the new role will not take all of your time and that you will still have time to code .
Desire for new challenges .
If you are feeling stale in your current role then advancing into a more senior position is often the most obvious choice .
It is not , however , always the best choice .
The correct answer to whether to continue to code or not depends entirely on you and your motivations .
I recommend choosing the role that is most rewarding to you on a daily basis , and not choose a role based solely on its seniority , prestige , or salary level .
Many developers end up unhappy in non-coding positions because they allowed external forces to push them away from coding .
Unfortunately , it can be difficult to determine how much you will enjoy a role until you try it .
And once you try a non-coding role , it can be difficult to move back to coding .
This is when learning from the experiences of others can help .
So here are some of mine .
I personally love coding – the act of creation , as Rob pointed out – and always have since I was young .
I did my first coding as a kid on a Vic - 20 .
So becoming a software developer was the obvious career for me .
Early in my career I was offered and accepted the opportunity to become a team lead of a small team .
I found that I could spend a little less than half my time coding .
The other time was spent on administrative or project management activities .
The exact percentage varied from week to week : there were some weeks with almost no coding , and other weeks with more .
Even when I was involved with the code , a portion of this time was spent doing reviews and mentoring junior developers .
The team size varied from three to seven subordinates .
As the team grew , the less time I had to code .
After a few years and the successful release of a new piece of software , I knew it was time for a change , partly to take on new challenges , and partly to do more coding .
I joined the architecture team within the same company and became involved in a project to build a new application framework .
I was coding again full time together with some excellent experienced developers .
Those were good times .
Within six months , I was offered the architect team lead position , which I accepted partly because it had very limited administrative duties , so I was still able to devote a majority of my time to coding .
I did become involved with some non-coding duties , such as a training initiative regarding the use of automated unit testing and mentoring , but I did not mind because I found both activities rewarding , though not without their frustrations .
After a few years it was again time to move on .
I switched companies , joining CGI .
I was going to be a development lead on a project , but CGI failed to win the bid .
Instead , I joined a development project as a regular developer .
I had no non-coding responsibilities , and the project was in the construction phase , so I got to do some of the most intensive coding of my career – probably 95 % of my time .
But like most development projects , it soon ended , and I moved onto a maintenance team as a senior developer .
This was my first time in a pure maintenance role , and I discovered that there is definitely less time spent coding due to other responsibilities such as monitoring the operational production system and managing the process by which software changes were released into production .
However , I found the role to be an incredible learning experience – check out some of my articles I have written as a result .
A few years later I was offered another team lead position .
By this point in my career , however , I knew that I needed to code at least a certain percentage of my time .
The offered position was for a fairly large team with many administrative duties , which I knew would offer no time at all for coding , so I turned the position down .
Instead , my role in my existing team has gradually transformed into an architect role , partly out of a desire to fix problems , and partly out of a desire for new challenges .
This has led to a reduction in the amount of coding I do .
I still get to do some , and I am mostly enjoying the challenges associated with the new role .
But I am being careful to avoid moving any higher up as an architect .
As an application architect in my existing role , I am still fairly close to the code .
I know other application architects who are no longer involved with code , and once you become an enterprise architect that is guaranteed .
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with becoming an architect , team lead , or manager , but there is nothing intrinsically right about it either .
The choice of whether to code or not is best based on your motivations .
What do you want to do ?

Via Kansas City Star :
Missouri abortion clinics will face new regulations and new restrictions on teaching sex education classes .
Gov. Matt Blunt signed legislation Friday placing more abortion clinics under government oversight by classifying them as ambulatory surgical centers .
Planned Parenthood claimed the law , HB 1055 , could force it to spend up to $ 2 million to remodel one of its clinics and halt medical abortions at another site .
The new law , which will take effect Aug. 28 , also bars people affiliated with abortion providers from teaching or supplying materials for sex education courses in public schools , and it allows schools to offer abstinence - only programs .
It cements into state statute an existing grant program for centers that encourage women to deliver babies instead of having abortions .
Blunt proclaimed the law “ one of the strongest pieces of pro-life legislation in Missouri history ” as he spoke from a cross - shaped lectern during a signing ceremony in the sanctuary of Concord Baptist Church .
The governor also was scheduled to promote the legislation in Joplin , Hannibal and suburban St. Louis .

CBS : One more sign of how ' thinly stretched '
Army is now David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 11 , 2007 Print This Email
This CBS News reported Sunday that the final members of the 82nd Airborne are about to leave Fort Bragg for Iraq , saying , " This is only going to be to be the second time since World War II that the entire 82nd Airborne will be deployed overseas .
Just one more sign of how thinly stretched the Army is right now . "
The report continues , " Commanders say if an emergency happened elsewhere in the world , they could draw ground troops from Iraq and units recuperating at bases back in the U.S.
But it wo n't be easy " because neither equipment nor personnel on leave would be immediately available .
As a result , there are concerns about the ability of the military to respond to a crisis .
The following video is from CBS Evening News , broadcast on June 10 .
RUSH TRANSCRIPT RUSS MITCHELL :
And good evening , once again the battle for Iraq is striking close to home ear in the U.S.
With repercussions that could be feld around the world .
The 82nd Airborne are packing up to leave Ft. Bragg for duty in Iraq .
Joie chen is in washington with more on the deployment and the strain on the Pentagon 's manpower .
Joie , good evening .
REPORTER : Good evening , russ .
This is only going to be to be the second time since world war that the entire 82nd Airborne will be deployed overseas .
Just one more sign of how thinly stretched the arm see right now .
Tonight what 's left of the 82nd Airborne flies to Kuwait on its way to Iraq for a one - year tour .
For decades the 82nd Airborne has been the go - to team in a time of crisis .
But now they are all deployed .
The surge is in full swing , but some worry its demands could be draining America 's ability to respond to a crisis .
MITCHELL : we are in a pretty tight position in being able to respond rapidly the way we would like .
REPORTER : Of the Army 's 44 combat brigades , nearly half are in Iraq or Afghanistan .
MITCHELL : we can't keep this level of commitment up indefinitely in my judgment , with the size Army and Marine Corps that we have .
REPORTER : More than 400,000 U.S. Troops have served multiple tours in Iraq or Afghanistan .
20 combat brigades have been deployed twice .
11 brigades have had three tours or more .
MITCHELL : we are deeply committed in Iraq .
And the longer we stay there , the more troops we add , the less flexibility we have to respond elsewhere in the world .
REPORTER : Although the Pentagon admits readiness has been compromised , commanders say if an emergency happened elsewhere in the world , they could draw ground troops from Iraq and units recuperating at bases back in the U.S.
But it wo n't be easy .
MITCHELL : most of that Army has its equipment in depot or its people on leave or its reservists deactivated or temporarily back with their families .
REPORTER : Right now in the very final moments for the 82nd Airborne , as you see they are down in Ft. Bragg , north carolina , at this hour getting on to the last flights , on their way overseas and into combat .
With the entire brigade now deployed , the job of being the ready brigade now falls to the 101st at fort campbell , kentucky .
They will be the ready brigade , the go - to team as it were , ready to respond to any crisis anywhere in the world at any time .
But guess what , russ :
That team is also scheduled to deploy to Iraq by the end of the year .
MITCHELL : Joie chen in washington , thank you very much .
It was another day of violent attacks in Iraq .
A suicide bomber brought down a bridge south of Baghdad , wounding several U.S. Soldiers guarding the crossing .
Meanwhile , clashes between American troops and shiite militias left five Iraqis dead .
All this comes as U.S. Forces step up a plan to make progress block by block .
Chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan has more from Baghdad .
LOGAN : The U.S. Military calls this area of Aamel in southern Baghdad a model neighborhood .
As we drove through sewage water , past piles of rotting trash , soldiers from the blacklines infantry battalion explained it like this .
Surge troops are trying to turn troubled hot spots into a model for other neighborhoods to follow .
By isolating the area and restricting access , they 've been able to make it temporarily more secure , which they say allows the soldiers to start bringing back essential services for people who have been struggling without for years now .
SOLDIER : as you can imagine , they have about an hour of electricity from the government every day .
It 's pretty hot here .
With no electricity , they can't run air conditioning , they can't pump water , that sort of thing .
LOGAN : The fastest way to fix that problem is by bringing in large generators .
The plan is to reach every one of the 450 homes in the area so people will see a real benefit .
The Army hopes that with American soldiers staying in the neighborhoods they 're trying to secure , at combat outposts like this one , the locals will feel better protected .
MITCHELL : we live probably five minutes from here .
So as opposed to being 45 minutes to drive up here if something happens , we can physically hear attacks and send a patrol , and usually when the patrol comes in the area , it will stop any level of violence that is going on .
LOGAN : But there is only so much these soldiers can do on their own .
Their efforts need the support of the Iraqi government , and that is what soldiers tracking the progress of the surge are most concerned about .
In less than a week , all the troops for the surge will finally be in position .
And commanders will be pushing hard to get results here on the ground before the september deadline for America 's top general , David Petraeus , to report back to congress , russ .
MITCHELL : Let 's go back to what you said about American troops staying in those neighborhoods they are trying to secure .
As you said , it is designed to make people in the neighborhood feel better .
But how much more vulnerable does it make these soldiers to attacks ?
LOGAN : Well , they are significantly more vulnerable , but they do put a lot of resources in to keeping those bases protected .
If you can imagine , russ , they 're behind layers and layers and layers of concrete blast walls that really stretch up into the sky .
There is barbed wire , heavy machine guns , 24 - hour security , and very often a bradley armored fighting vehicle , which almost defeats the purpose of them being in the neighborhoods and being near the people .
They say it is a risky strategy but it 's worth the risk so far .
MITCHELL : Lara Logan in Baghdad , thank you .
I do n't know how this fish tank works exactly , but from what I could understand , the tank on top that joins the adjacent tanks works as a vacuum .
The result is that there are feeding holes in the side of the tank , and the water does not flow out .
I could not wrap my mind around this technology , but it works .
The fish were swimming between the side tanks over the tunnel .
The smarter fish would swim across to the side where we were giving them shrimp .
As you can see , the water stays within the half bowls that are affixed to the side of the tank .
You would think that the water would come gushing out , but it does n't .
In the words of Arthur C. Clarke , " Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic . " .
Yup .
These are all fish that you can find off of the coast of Oita .
This guy got a little carried away and jumped out of the tank .
He was delicious !
A brightly colored wrasse goes after some krill and misses .
Not the most coordinated fish in the tank ...
This rockfish was by far the most tenacious fish in the tank .
He boxed out all of the other fish , until he had his fill .
The squirrel fish was a bit harder to lure out .
A trigger fish takes his time , and grazes on a shrimp buffet .
This is my favorite picture of the lot .
Puffers , box fish , and cowfish all make me happy for some reason .
They 're such goofy fish , and tough to boot .
Misinterpreting Copyright — A Series of Errors
by Richard Stallman
Something strange and dangerous is happening in copyright law .
Under the US Constitution , copyright exists to benefit users — those who read books , listen to music , watch movies , or run software — not for the sake of publishers or authors .
Yet even as people tend increasingly to reject and disobey the copyright restrictions imposed on them “ for their own benefit , ” the US government is adding more restrictions , and trying to frighten the public into obedience with harsh new penalties .
How did copyright policies come to be diametrically opposed to their stated purpose ?
And how can we bring them back into alignment with that purpose ?
To understand , we should start by looking at the root of United States copyright law : the US Constitution .
Copyright in the US Constitution
When the US Constitution was drafted , the idea that authors were entitled to a copyright monopoly was proposed — and rejected .
The founders of our country adopted a different premise , that copyright is not a natural right of authors , but an artificial concession made to them for the sake of progress .
The Constitution gives permission for a copyright system with this paragraph ( Article I , Section 8 ) :
[ Congress shall have the power ] to promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries .
The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that promoting progress means benefit for the users of copyrighted works .
For example , in Fox Film v. Doyal , the court said ,
The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the [ copyright ] monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors .
This fundamental decision explains why copyright is not required by the Constitution , only permitted as an option — and why it is supposed to last for “ limited times . ”
If copyright were a natural right , something that authors have because they deserve it , nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time , any more than everyone 's house should become public property after a certain lapse of time from its construction .
The “ copyright bargain ”
The copyright system works by providing privileges and thus benefits to publishers and authors ; but it does not do this for their sake .
Rather , it does this to modify their behavior : to provide an incentive for authors to write more and publish more .
In effect , the government spends the public 's natural rights , on the public 's behalf , as part of a deal to bring the public more published works .
Legal scholars call this concept the “ copyright bargain . ”
It is like a government purchase of a highway or an airplane using taxpayers ' money , except that the government spends our freedom instead of our money .
But is the bargain as it exists actually a good deal for the public ?
Many alternative bargains are possible ; which one is best ?
Every issue of copyright policy is part of this question .
If we misunderstand the nature of the question , we will tend to decide the issues badly .
The Constitution authorizes granting copyright powers to authors .
In practice , authors typically cede them to publishers ; it is usually the publishers , not the authors , who exercise these powers and get most of the benefits , though authors may get a small portion .
Thus it is usually the publishers that lobby to increase copyright powers .
To better reflect the reality of copyright rather than the myth , this article refers to publishers rather than authors as the holders of copyright powers .
It also refers to the users of copyrighted works as “ readers , ” even though using them does not always mean reading , because “ the users ” is remote and abstract .
The first error : “ striking a balance ”
The copyright bargain places the public first : benefit for the reading public is an end in itself ; benefits ( if any ) for publishers are just a means toward that end .
Readers ' interests and publishers ' interests are thus qualitatively unequal in priority .
The first step in misinterpreting the purpose of copyright is the elevation of the publishers to the same level of importance as the readers .
It is often said that US copyright law is meant to “ strike a balance ” between the interests of publishers and readers .
Those who cite this interpretation present it as a restatement of the basic position stated in the Constitution ; in other words , it is supposed to be equivalent to the copyright bargain .
But the two interpretations are far from equivalent ; they are different conceptually , and different in their implications .
The balance concept assumes that the readers ' and publishers ' interests differ in importance only quantitatively , in how much weight we should give them , and in what actions they apply to .
The term “ stakeholders ” is often used to frame the issue in this way ; it assumes that all kinds of interest in a policy decision are equally important .
This view rejects the qualitative distinction between the readers ' and publishers ' interests which is at the root of the government 's participation in the copyright bargain .
The consequences of this alteration are far - reaching , because the great protection for the public in the copyright bargain — the idea that copyright privileges can be justified only in the name of the readers , never in the name of the publishers — is discarded by the “ balance ” interpretation .
Since the interest of the publishers is regarded as an end in itself , it can justify copyright privileges ; in other words , the “ balance ” concept says that privileges can be justified in the name of someone other than the public .
As a practical matter , the consequence of the “ balance ” concept is to reverse the burden of justification for changes in copyright law .
The copyright bargain places the burden on the publishers to convince the readers to cede certain freedoms .
The concept of balance reverses this burden , practically speaking , because there is generally no doubt that publishers will benefit from additional privilege .
Unless harm to the readers can be proved , sufficient to “ outweigh ” this benefit , we are led to conclude that the publishers are entitled to almost any privilege they request .
Since the idea of “ striking a balance ” between publishers and readers denies the readers the primacy they are entitled to , we must reject it .
Balancing against what ?
When the government buys something for the public , it acts on behalf of the public ; its responsibility is to obtain the best possible deal — best for the public , not for the other party in the agreement .
For example , when signing contracts with construction companies to build highways , the government aims to spend as little as possible of the public 's money .
Government agencies use competitive bidding to push the price down .
As a practical matter , the price cannot be zero , because contractors will not bid that low .
Although not entitled to special consideration , they have the usual rights of citizens in a free society , including the right to refuse disadvantageous contracts ; even the lowest bid will be high enough for some contractor to make money .
So there is indeed a balance , of a kind .
But it is not a deliberate balancing of two interests each with claim to special consideration .
It is a balance between a public goal and market forces .
The government tries to obtain for the taxpaying motorists the best deal they can get in the context of a free society and a free market .
In the copyright bargain , the government spends our freedom instead of our money .
Freedom is more precious than money , so government 's responsibility to spend our freedom wisely and frugally is even greater than its responsibility to spend our money thus .
Governments must never put the publishers ' interests on a par with the public 's freedom .
Not “ balance ” but “ trade - off ”
The idea of balancing the readers ' interests against the publishers ' is the wrong way to judge copyright policy , but there are indeed two interests to be weighed : two interests of the readers .
Readers have an interest in their own freedom in using published works ; depending on circumstances , they may also have an interest in encouraging publication through some kind of incentive system .
The word “ balance , ” in discussions of copyright , has come to stand as shorthand for the idea of “ striking a balance ” between the readers and the publishers .
Therefore , to use the word “ balance ” in regard to the readers ' two interests would be confusing .
[ 1 ]
We need another term .
In general , when one party has two goals that partly conflict , and cannot completely achieve both of them , we call this a “ trade - off . ”
Therefore , rather than speaking of “ striking the right balance ” between parties , we should speak of “ finding the right trade - off between spending our freedom and keeping it . ”
The second error : maximizing one output
The second mistake in copyright policy consists of adopting the goal of maximizing — not just increasing — the number of published works .
The erroneous concept of “ striking a balance ” elevated the publishers to parity with the readers ; this second error places them far above the readers .
When we purchase something , we do not generally buy the whole quantity in stock or the most expensive model .
Instead we conserve funds for other purchases , by buying only what we need of any particular good , and choosing a model of sufficient rather than highest quality .
The principle of diminishing returns suggests that spending all our money on one particular good is likely to be an inefficient allocation of resources ; we generally choose to keep some money for another use .
Diminishing returns applies to copyright just as to any other purchase .
The first freedoms we should trade away are those we miss the least , and whose sacrifice gives the largest encouragement to publication .
As we trade additional freedoms that cut closer to home , we find that each trade is a bigger sacrifice than the last , while bringing a smaller increment in literary activity .
Well before the increment becomes zero , we may well say it is not worth its incremental price ; we would then settle on a bargain whose overall result is to increase the amount of publication , but not to the utmost possible extent .
Accepting the goal of maximizing publication rejects all these wiser , more advantageous bargains in advance — it dictates that the public must cede nearly all of its freedom to use published works , for just a little more publication .
The rhetoric of maximization
In practice , the goal of maximizing publication regardless of the cost to freedom is supported by widespread rhetoric which asserts that public copying is illegitimate , unfair , and intrinsically wrong .
For instance , the publishers call people who copy “ pirates , ” a smear term designed to equate sharing information with your neighbor with attacking a ship .
( This smear term was formerly used by authors to describe publishers who found lawful ways to publish unauthorized editions ; its modern use by the publishers is almost the reverse . )
This rhetoric directly rejects the constitutional basis for copyright , but presents itself as representing the unquestioned tradition of the American legal system .
The “ pirate ” rhetoric is typically accepted because it so pervades the media that few people realize how radical it is .
It is effective because if copying by the public is fundamentally illegitimate , we can never object to the publishers ' demand that we surrender our freedom to do so .
In other words , when the public is challenged to show why publishers should not receive some additional power , the most important reason of all —
“ We want to copy ” — is disqualified in advance .
This leaves no way to argue against increasing copyright power except using side issues .
Hence , opposition to stronger copyright powers today almost exclusively cites side issues , and never dares cite the freedom to distribute copies as a legitimate public value .
As a practical matter , the goal of maximization enables publishers to argue that “ A certain practice is reducing our sales — or we think it might — so we presume it diminishes publication by some unknown amount , and therefore it should be prohibited . ”
We are led to the outrageous conclusion that the public good is measured by publishers ' sales :
What 's good for General Media is good for the USA .
The third error : maximizing publishers ' power
Once the publishers have obtained assent to the policy goal of maximizing publication output at any cost , their next step is to infer that this requires giving them the maximum possible powers — making copyright cover every imaginable use of a work , or applying some other legal tool such as “ shrink wrap ” licenses to equivalent effect .
This goal , which entails the abolition of “ fair use ” and the “ right of first sale , ” is being pressed at every available level of government , from states of the US to international bodies .
This step is erroneous because strict copyright rules obstruct the creation of useful new works .
For instance , Shakespeare borrowed the plots of some of his plays from works others had published a few decades before , so if today 's copyright law had been in effect , his plays would have been illegal .
Even if we wanted the highest possible rate of publication , regardless of cost to the public , maximizing publishers ' power is the wrong way to get it .
As a means of promoting progress , it is self - defeating .
The results of the three errors
The current trend in copyright legislation is to hand publishers broader powers for longer periods of time .
The conceptual basis of copyright , as it emerges distorted from the series of errors , rarely offers a basis for saying no .
Legislators give lip service to the idea that copyright serves the public , while in fact giving publishers whatever they ask for .
For example , here is what Senator Hatch said when introducing S. 483 , a 1995 bill to increase the term of copyright by 20 years :
I believe we are now at such a point with respect to the question of whether the current term of copyright adequately protects the interests of authors and the related question of whether the term of protection continues to provide a sufficient incentive for the creation of new works of authorship .
This bill extended the copyright on already published works written since the 1920s .
This change was a giveaway to publishers with no possible benefit to the public , since there is no way to retroactively increase now the number of books published back then .
Yet it cost the public a freedom that is meaningful today — the freedom to redistribute books from that era .
Note the use of the propaganda term , “ protect , ” which embodies the second of the three errors .
The bill also extended the copyrights of works yet to be written .
For works made for hire , copyright would last 95 years instead of the present 75 years .
Theoretically this would increase the incentive to write new works ; but any publisher that claims to need this extra incentive should be required substantiate the claim with projected balance sheets for 75 years in the future .
Needless to say , Congress did not question the publishers ' arguments : a law extending copyright was enacted in 1998 .
It was officially called the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act , named after one of its sponsors who died earlier that year .
We usually call it the Mickey Mouse Copyright Act , since we presume its real motive was to prevent the copyright on the appearance of Mickey Mouse from expiring .
Bono 's widow , who served the rest of his term , made this statement :
Actually , Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever .
I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution .
I invite all of you to work with me to strengthen our copyright laws in all of the ways available to us .
As you know , there is also Jack Valenti 's proposal for term to last forever less one day .
Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress .
The Supreme Court later heard a case that sought to overturn the law on the grounds that the retroactive extension fails to serve the Constitution 's goal of promoting progress .
The court responded by abdicating its responsibility to judge the question ; on copyright , the Constitution requires only lip service .
Another law , passed in 1997 , made it a felony to make sufficiently many copies of any published work , even if you give them away to friends just to be nice .
Previously this was not a crime in the US at all .
An even worse law , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , was designed to bring back what was then called “ copy protection ” — now known as DRM ( Digital Restrictions Management ) — which users already detested , by making it a crime to defeat the restrictions , or even publish information about how to defeat them .
This law ought to be called the “ Domination by Media Corporations Act ” because it effectively offers publishers the chance to write their own copyright law .
It says they can impose any restrictions whatsoever on the use of a work , and these restrictions take the force of law provided the work contains some sort of encryption or license manager to enforce them .
One of the arguments offered for this bill was that it would implement a recent treaty to increase copyright powers .
The treaty was promulgated by the World Intellectual Property Organization , an organization dominated by copyright - and patent - holding interests , with the aid of pressure from the Clinton administration ; since the treaty only increases copyright power , whether it serves the public interest in any country is doubtful .
In any case , the bill went far beyond what the treaty required .
Libraries were a key source of opposition to this bill , especially to the aspects that block the forms of copying that are considered fair use .
How did the publishers respond ?
Former representative Pat Schroeder , now a lobbyist for the Association of American Publishers , said that the publishers “ could not live with what [ the libraries were ] asking for . ”
Since the libraries were asking only to preserve part of the status quo , one might respond by wondering how the publishers had survived until the present day .
Congressman Barney Frank , in a meeting with me and others who opposed this bill , showed how far the US Constitution 's view of copyright has been disregarded .
He said that new powers , backed by criminal penalties , were needed urgently because the “ movie industry is worried , ” as well as the “ music industry ” and other “ industries . ”
I asked him , “ But is this in the public interest ? ”
His response was telling : “ Why are you talking about the public interest ?
These creative people do n't have to give up their rights for the public interest ! ”
The “ industry ” has been identified with the “ creative people ” it hires , copyright has been treated as its entitlement , and the Constitution has been turned upside down .
The DMCA was enacted in 1998 .
As enacted , it says that fair use remains nominally legitimate , but allows publishers to prohibit all software or hardware that you could practice it with .
Effectively , fair use is prohibited .
Based on this law , the movie industry has imposed censorship on free software for reading and playing DVDs , and even on the information about how to read them .
In April 2001 , Professor Edward Felten of Princeton University was intimidated by lawsuit threats from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) into withdrawing a scientific paper stating what he had learned about a proposed encryption system for restricting access to recorded music .
We are also beginning to see e-books that take away many of readers ' traditional freedoms — for instance , the freedom to lend a book to your friend , to sell it to a used book store , to borrow it from a library , to buy it without giving your name to a corporate data bank , even the freedom to read it twice .
Encrypted e-books generally restrict all these activities — you can read them only with special secret software designed to restrict you .
I will never buy one of these encrypted , restricted e-books , and I hope you will reject them too .
If an e-book does n't give you the same freedoms as a traditional paper book , do n't accept it !
Anyone independently releasing software that can read restricted e-books risks prosecution .
A Russian programmer , Dmitry Sklyarov , was arrested in 2001 while visiting the US to speak at a conference , because he had written such a program in Russia , where it was lawful to do so .
Now Russia is preparing a law to prohibit it too , and the European Union recently adopted one .
Mass - market e-books have been a commercial failure so far , but not because readers chose to defend their freedom ; they were unattractive for other reasons , such as that computer display screens are not easy surfaces to read from .
We can't rely on this happy accident to protect us in the long term ; the next attempt to promote e-books will use “ electronic paper ” — book - like objects into which an encrypted , restricted e-book can be downloaded .
If this paper - like surface proves more appealing than today 's display screens , we will have to defend our freedom in order to keep it .
Meanwhile , e-books are making inroads in niches : NYU and other dental schools require students to buy their textbooks in the form of restricted e-books .
The media companies are not satisfied yet .
In 2001 , Disney - funded Senator Hollings proposed a bill called the “ Security Systems Standards and Certification Act ” ( SSSCA ) [ 2 ] , which would require all computers ( and other digital recording and playback devices ) to have government - mandated copy - restriction systems .
That is their ultimate goal , but the first item on their agenda is to prohibit any equipment that can tune digital HDTV unless it is designed to be impossible for the public to “ tamper with ” ( i.e. , modify for their own purposes ) .
Since free software is software that users can modify , we face here for the first time a proposed law that explicitly prohibits free software for a certain job .
Prohibition of other jobs will surely follow .
If the FCC adopts this rule , existing free software such as GNU Radio would be censored .
To block these bills and rules requires political action . [ 3 ]
Finding the right bargain
What is the proper way to decide copyright policy ?
If copyright is a bargain made on behalf of the public , it should serve the public interest above all .
The government 's duty when selling the public 's freedom is to sell only what it must , and sell it as dearly as possible .
At the very least , we should pare back the extent of copyright as much as possible while maintaining a comparable level of publication .
Since we cannot find this minimum price in freedom through competitive bidding , as we do for construction projects , how can we find it ?
One possible method is to reduce copyright privileges in stages , and observe the results .
By seeing if and when measurable diminutions in publication occur , we will learn how much copyright power is really necessary to achieve the public 's purposes .
We must judge this by actual observation , not by what publishers say will happen , because they have every incentive to make exaggerated predictions of doom if their powers are reduced in any way .
Copyright policy includes several independent dimensions , which can be adjusted separately .
After we find the necessary minimum for one policy dimension , it may still be possible to reduce other dimensions of copyright while maintaining the desired publication level .
One important dimension of copyright is its duration , which is now typically on the order of a century .
Reducing the monopoly on copying to ten years , starting from the date when a work is published , would be a good first step .
Another aspect of copyright , which covers the making of derivative works , could continue for a longer period .
Why count from the date of publication ?
Because copyright on unpublished works does not directly limit readers ' freedom ; whether we are free to copy a work is moot when we do not have copies .
So giving authors a longer time to get a work published does no harm .
Authors ( who generally do own the copyright prior to publication ) will rarely choose to delay publication just to push back the end of the copyright term .
Why ten years ?
Because that is a safe proposal ; we can be confident on practical grounds that this reduction would have little impact on the overall viability of publishing today .
In most media and genres , successful works are very profitable in just a few years , and even successful works are usually out of print well before ten .
Even for reference works , whose useful life may be many decades , ten - year copyright should suffice : updated editions are issued regularly , and many readers will buy the copyrighted current edition rather than copy a ten - year - old public domain version .
Ten years may still be longer than necessary ; once things settle down , we could try a further reduction to tune the system .
At a panel on copyright at a literary convention , where I proposed the ten - year term , a noted fantasy author sitting beside me objected vehemently , saying that anything beyond five years was intolerable .
But we do n't have to apply the same time span to all kinds of works .
Maintaining the utmost uniformity of copyright policy is not crucial to the public interest , and copyright law already has many exceptions for specific uses and media .
It would be foolish to pay for every highway project at the rates necessary for the most difficult projects in the most expensive regions of the country ; it is equally foolish to “ pay ” for all kinds of art with the greatest price in freedom that we find necessary for any one kind .
So perhaps novels , dictionaries , computer programs , songs , symphonies , and movies should have different durations of copyright , so that we can reduce the duration for each kind of work to what is necessary for many such works to be published .
Perhaps movies over one hour long could have a twenty - year copyright , because of the expense of producing them .
In my own field , computer programming , three years should suffice , because product cycles are even shorter than that .
Another dimension of copyright policy is the extent of fair use : some ways of reproducing all or part of a published work that are legally permitted even though it is copyrighted .
The natural first step in reducing this dimension of copyright power is to permit occasional private small - quantity noncommercial copying and distribution among individuals .
This would eliminate the intrusion of the copyright police into people 's private lives , but would probably have little effect on the sales of published works .
( It may be necessary to take other legal steps to ensure that shrink - wrap licenses cannot be used to substitute for copyright in restricting such copying . )
The experience of Napster shows that we should also permit noncommercial verbatim redistribution to the general public — when so many of the public want to copy and share , and find it so useful , only draconian measures will stop them , and the public deserves to get what it wants .
For novels , and in general for works that are used for entertainment , noncommercial verbatim redistribution may be sufficient freedom for the readers .
Computer programs , being used for functional purposes ( to get jobs done ) , call for additional freedoms beyond that , including the freedom to publish an improved version .
See “ Free Software Definition , ” in this book , for an explanation of the freedoms that software users should have .
But it may be an acceptable compromise for these freedoms to be universally available only after a delay of two or three years from the program 's publication .
Changes like these could bring copyright into line with the public 's wish to use digital technology to copy .
Publishers will no doubt find these proposals “ unbalanced ” ; they may threaten to take their marbles and go home , but they wo n't really do it , because the game will remain profitable and it will be the only game in town .
As we consider reductions in copyright power , we must make sure media companies do not simply replace it with end - user license agreements .
It would be necessary to prohibit the use of contracts to apply restrictions on copying that go beyond those of copyright .
Such limitations on what mass - market nonnegotiated contracts can require are a standard part of the US legal system .
A personal note
I am a software designer , not a legal scholar .
I 've become concerned with copyright issues because there 's no avoiding them in the world of computer networks , such as the Internet .
As a user of computers and networks for 30 years , I value the freedoms that we have lost , and the ones we may lose next .
As an author , I can reject the romantic mystique of the author as semidivine creator , often cited by publishers to justify increased copyright powers for authors — powers which these authors will then sign away to publishers .
Most of this article consists of facts and reasoning that you can check , and proposals on which you can form your own opinions .
But I ask you to accept one thing on my word alone : that authors like me do n't deserve special power over you .
If you wish to reward me further for the software or books I have written , I would gratefully accept a check — but please do n't surrender your freedom in my name .

At the end of section 4 of Call - by - value is dual to call - by - name , Wadler tells a story about the Devil and a billion dollars .
After a long time thinking about it , the meaning of it suddenly hit me like an epiphany a few weeks ago , and I 'm finally in a position to give an explanation of what it means .
( This is also an exercise in TMR6 . )
And just for a bit of variety I 'm going to throw in some C++ and Scheme , starting with some simple C++ code :
This provides a ( somewhat unreliable , I think ) implementation of a discriminated union .
An object of typeis either an object of type A or an object of type B .
But unlike the ordinary union , it remembers the type of its contents .
I 've also provided anfunction .
Given a function of type A→C and a function of type B→C , then if we 're handed an object of typewe know that we can apply one or other function to it to get an object of type C . The functonapplies the appropriate one for you .
What 's unusual is the way I 've implemented it .
I 'm representing an object of typeas a function of no arguments ( in effect a lazy value ) returning something of type .
There are two paths by which an object can get out of such a function : either it is returned or it is thrown out .
Having two paths is what I 've used to implement of a template that represents either one thing or another .
This simple example should make it clear that there is some sort of a connection between exceptions and logical or ( ie. disjunction ) .
In functional languages exceptions tend to be handled a little differently .
Whereas C++ has akeyword , there is no equivalent in Scheme , say .
Insteadthefunction acts like .
The argument tois a functionand the argument to this function ( itself a function ) , here called , does the throwing .
For example consider the scheme expression :
The result is 7 , not 8 .
The 7 is thrown ' past ' theand is caught by the surrounding .
The important difference from C++ is that if any subexpression is to throw some value , it must be ' handed ' a suitable throw function .
Note also that Scheme is dynamically typed .
In a static functional language throwing exceptions is a tiny bit more subtle .
Not only must a subexpression be handed a suitable function for throwing , it must be handed a function of a suitable type .
In particular , if the data thrown is to be of type a , then the subexpression must be handed a suitable ' throw ' function that can take an object of type a as argument .
Think of such a function as an a -consumer .
So if we want to implement the C++ idea above in a statically typed functional language that supports exceptions we need to replace the function of typewith a function that consumes an A - consumer and returns an object of type B .
Such a function can either throw a result of type A or return a result of type B.
Anyway , here 's a complete Scheme example ( BTW it 's my first bit of Scheme code longer than one line ) :
OK , time for some logic .
As everyone familiar with propositional calculus knows , a ∨ b = ~a → b .
Or in English " a or b " is the same as " if a is n't true then b is " .
Less well known is the Curry - Howard isomorphism .
In a nutshell it goes like this : if you know a , and you know a → b , then you can deduce b ( using modus ponens ) .
Similarly , in a strictly typed programming language , if you have an object of type a , and a function of type a → b , then you can use them to make an object of type b ( just apply the function to a ) .
So given a bunch of propositions in 1 - 1 correspondence with a bunch of objects , you should be able to see that the set of propositions you can deduce by modus ponens is going to be in 1 - 1 correspondence with the objects you can make by function application .
But there 's more to logic than modus ponens .
In classical logic you also have double negation elimination .
In other words , if you know ~ ~a then you can deduce a .
So double negation elimination is like having a polymorphic function ~ ~a → a for any a .
What does " ~ " mean in terms of functions ?
In logic , define ⊥ to be the unprovable false proposition .
Then ~a is simply a→⊥ .
In programming define ⊥ to be the type with no instances and we can define ~a to be the type of functions a→⊥ .
A function of type ~a is a function that consumes an instance of type a and gives you back nothing in return .
Clearly if you can make an object of type a then no function of type ~a can exist or else you could apply it to a and get an object f type ⊥ , which is impossible by definition .
It 's not hard to see that there can be no well behaved function that for any type a can map an ~ ~a to an a .
An ~ ~a is a thing that consumes a -consumers .
In a sense it 's destructive .
There are no raw ingredients from which you could possibly make an a for all a .
So there is no function of type ~ ~a → a .
But this type can serve very well as the type of theoperator described above .
Rewriting the scheme example above with Haskell - like notation we expect something likecatch $ \ throw -> ... ( throw a ) ... Becausenever returns we can assign it the typewithout problems and hencecan be assigned type ~ ~a .
This now means that the Curry - Howard isomorphism can be extended to classical logic if we throw inalong with the usual functions you expect in a pure typed functional language .
So
If we useto throw an exception out of a function , then the function must be handed a ~a as argument .
So in order to implement , we must replace the C++ typewith .
In other words , if we use the symbol ∨ to mean , then exactly in classical logic , we have a ∨ b = ~a → b .
You can think of the argument toas being a bit like a bungee cord with one end attached to the .
If a function is handed the other end of such a bungee cord it can either use it to catapult out a value of type a , or the function can ignore it and return somehing of type b.
But there 's a neat twist on this .
If b = ~a then the function , on being handed a bungee cord , could simply hand it back as a return value .
In other words , whatever type a is , we can always construct an object of type a ∨ ~a from the identity function .
This corresponds to the fact that a ∨ ~a is a tautology of classical logic .
And now you can reread Wadler 's story about the Devil and see that my story about a bungee cord is really the same one .
Exercise : Implement Left , Right and either using the method above in the Haskell Cont monad .
PS Reasoning about exceptions in this way is new to me and so I do n't feel I have the above on a firm footing .
So expect some errors .
In particular I have n't thought about what happens if you try to nest disjunctive structures this way .
You can be sure that the C++ implementation will fail because the exception may be caught by the wrongUpdate : fixed some typos .
But also here 's an exercise : Exercise : a ∧ b = ~ ( ~a ∨ ~b ) .
What does that mean in the above context ?
( I have n't got my head around this yet . )

EA Staffer Attempts to Alter Wiki History
Shacknews made the discovery using a tool called Wikipedia Scanner , made by Cal Tech grad student Virgil Griffith and detailed in a recent Wired article .
The tool cross-references the anonymous Wikipedia editors ' IP addresses with a WHOIS IP query and other data .
The most damning evidence stems from an extensive " cleanup " by the aforementioned EA IP address on November 20 , 2006 .
A side - by - side comparison of the revisions reveals the removal of Trip Hawkins as founder of the company from the " key people " section of EA 's Wikipedia description box .
The EA Wiki user also removes a reference to Trip Hawkins ' founding of the company in the main description of the entry , and cuts a paragraph from the " History " section detailing Hawkins ' business plan .
Seemingly unsatisfied with the entry a few months later , a user at the same Redwood City IP address attempted to further purge Hawkins ' name from the introductory paragraph in the " History " section on April 5 , while adding a paragraph emphasizing the achievements of Larry Probst , former EA CEO and current chairman , when he became sales VP in 1984 .
Though by this time , the references to Hawkins as founder of the company had been added back to the Wikipedia entry .
Other changes made by the user in the November cleanup focused on clearing out controversy associated with the publisher 's business practices .
A user at the Redwood City IP removed a line --" The company has also been the subject of criticism , most notably for its business tactics and its employment policy " -- from the end of the introductory description of the company .
In addition to removing several paragraphs from the " Criticism " section , the user deleted references to the notorious ea_spouse debacle and spun the class action lawsuit brought on by overworked , undercompensated employees to portray the company in a good light .
The new text would describe EA as having " led the industry in reforming work / life balance issues that are endemic to the software industry . "
And a line tacked on at the end would add a consolatory but unattributed statement : " Since that time , many other game companies have been struck with similar lawsuits . "
The IP in question is the most active Wikipedia user among the IP addresses registered to EA , accounting for a third of the 1,351 changes made by the lot of them .
Many of the changes attempted by this EA - registered IP have since been reversed by the Wikipedia community .
It 's certainly in a company 's interest to correct mistakes regarding its operations on a publicly available Internet information site , but one has to wonder where the line should be drawn .
Shacknews contacted EA about the issue but did not receive a response .

As his sixth birthday approached , Morgan Smith 's parents thought hoisting the Jolly Roger would be the perfect way to make the pirate - mad youngster 's day .
The flag was duly run up the pole in the back garden , leaving Morgan looking forward to a party on Saturday with lots of friends wearing eyepatches and wielding toy cutlasses .
But little did the family know that out on the treacherous high seas of bureaucracy , trouble was heading their way .
Council officials branded the skull and crossbones flag " unneighbourly " and banned Morgan 's parents Richard and Sharon from flying it .
Scroll down for more ...
The couple must apply for planning permission at a cost of £ 75 , and then an assessment of the 5ft by 4ft flag 's " impact " on the surrounding area of Stone , Staffordshire , will be undertaken .
The intervention has sunk the plans for a pirate - themed party .
Morgan 's 40 - year - old father , an engineer at Bentley Motors , said : " It 's not as though
I 'm building a huge extension which will blight the neighbourhood .
It 's a child 's pirate flag .
" Morgan is really upset because I 'd told him we could have a pirate party for his birthday with him and his friends all coming dressed as pirates .
" The skull and crossbones was to be the centrepiece .
We 'll wait to see if the Jolly Roger is approved and if so we 'll hold the party at a later date . "
For years , the patriotic family have flown a Union Jack or a St George 's flag on the 18 ft - high flagstaff at their detached home without a problem , but a neighbour complained to the council about the Jolly Roger .
Mr Smith said : " When the lady from the council came to see me she said that it was no problem flying any of the other flags , it was the Jolly Roger that was of concern .
" She said that we would have to take it down .
I 've put in a planning application but I should n't have to go to all this trouble . "
Mrs Smith , 43 , said : " It strikes me as very petty .
Who would complain about it ?
Obviously someone with too much time on their hands . "
Councillor Richard Stevens said the council had objected to the flag because " it was unneighbourly and could open the doors for all kinds of flags " .
A Stafford Borough Council spokesman said : " A planning application has been made for a Jolly Roger flag to be flown at a property in Stone .
" The application is currently under review and will include planning officers looking at the impact the flag has on the area , with the decision expected by the end of this month .
" Legislation requires planning approval before it can be flown from the flagpole . "
The Jolly Roger dates back to the 1700s when pirates would fly it to make their victims surrender readily .

The Guardian
“ All men will have big willies ” , said the headline of the Sun .
This was the story of Dr Oliver Curry , “ evolution theorist ” from the Darwin@LSE research centre .
“ By the year 3000 , the average human will be 6½ft tall , have coffee - coloured skin and live for 120 years , new research predicts .
And the good news does not end there .
Blokes will be chuffed to learn their willies will get bigger – and women ’s boobs will become more pert . ”
Where did this story come from ?
And does it stand up ?
Well , what has been represented as important “ new research ” is in fact just a rather fanciful essay from a political theorist at LSE , and while it ’s not ridiculous , there ’s quite a lot to take issue with in the science .
For example , Dr Oliver Curry seems to think that geographical and social mobility is a new thing , and that this will produce uniformly coffee coloured humans in 1,000 years .
Oliver has perhaps not been to Brazil , where black African , white European , and Amerindian have lived side by side and bred together for many centuries .
The Brazilians have not gone coffee coloured , they in fact still show a wide range of skin pigmentation , from black to tan .
This is because skin pigmentation seems to be coded for by a fairly small number of genes and probably does n’t blend and even out as Oliver – a political theorist , not a scientist – suggests .
What about his other ideas ?
Like the one that ultimately , through extreme socioeconomic divisions in society , humans will divide into two species : one tall , thin symmetrical , clean , healthy , intelligent and creative , the other short , stocky , asymmetrical , grubby , unhealthy and not as bright ?
Dividing into species requires some fairly strong pressures , like geographical divisions : even then , the Tasmanian aboriginals , who were isolated for 10,000 years , can still have children perfectly easily with white Europeans .
“ Sympatric speciation ” , a division into species where the two groups live in the same place , as Curry is proposing , is even tougher .
For a while , many scientists did n’t think it happened at all .
It would require that socioeconomic divides were absolute , although history shows that attractive impoverished females and wealthy ugly men can be remarkably resourceful in love .
I could go on ( the full press release is at badscience .
net for your amusement ) .
But the trivial problems in this trivial essay are not the issue : what ’s odd is how it became a “ boffins today said ” science story , all over the media , with the BBC , the Telegraph , the Sun , the Scotsman , Metro and many more lapping it up , without criticism .
How does this happen ?
The “ research ”  – or “ essay ” – was paid for by Bravo , a bikini and fast car “ men ’s TV channel ” celebrating its 21st year in operation .
Just to give you a flavour of Bravo , tonight at 11 pm you can catch the movie classic Temptations :
“ When a group of farm workers find that the bank intends to foreclose on their property , they console each other with a succession of steamy romps .
This might go some way to explaining the “ pert breasts ” angle of Curry ’s “ new research ”  .
More and more , empty “ science ” stories are being generated by public relations companies , who team up with academics , and commission some spurious piece of “ research ” that will be attractive to the media , where the company is name - checked .
The classic examples are the “ equations for ” stories .
None of Dr Curry ’s doubtless excellent scholarly work in political theory has ever generated media coverage like his silly futuristic essay .
I spoke to friends on other newspapers ( the Guardian did n’t cover the story , mercifully ) who told me they had stand up rows with news desks , explaining that this was not a science news story .
But the selective pressure on national newspapers is for journalists who compliantly write up this kind of commercial puff nonsense as “ science news ”  , while religious fundamentalism of all varieties is conquering the world .
Bravo !
A Polite Request :
Are you an academic who has been approached to give your name and affiliation over to commercial promotional activity like this ?
Did it make you feel dirty ?
Email me in confidence , ben@badscience.net … it ’ll make you feel better .
Incidentally , we discuss this issue in the Guardian Science Podcast that ’s out on Monday .
The excellent Dr James Randerson PhD , in particular , is endearingly indignant on the subject .

The Press Release :
EVOLUTION STUDY REVEALS WHAT MAN WILL LOOK LIKE IN YEAR 3000 AND BEYOND
Research predicts humans will have coffee - coloured skin , grow to an average of 6
Â½ feet and live for up to 120 years by the year 3000
Humans to begin to diverge into genetic â€˜havesâ€™ and â€˜have notsâ€™ within 10,000 years
The human species is set to evolve within a thousand years into a â€˜coffeeâ€™ coloured race of 6
Â½ foot giants who can live up for up to 120 years , according to a new research project released today .
Evolution expert Dr Oliver Curry of the Darwin@LSE research centre at the London School of Economics embarked on a two - month project to investigate the impact of technological , biological and environmental factors on the future evolution of man over the next 1,000 , 10,000 and 100,000 years .
The report , commissioned by leading menâ€™s television channel Bravo to celebrate their 21st anniversary , predicts that the human species is set to reach its peak in the year 3000 , growing taller and living longer thanks to improved nutrition , lifestyles and increased medical knowledge .
They will also modify themselves â€ “ through technology or otherwise – to attract partners and will therefore be better looking .
â€ ˜Raceâ€™ will also be a thing of the past – by the year 3000 all humans will have â€ ˜coffeeâ€™ coloured skin .
However , the research also predicts that after 10,000 years mankindâ€™s reliance on technology will allow genes to degenerate ; for example , the immune system will deteriorate through an over - reliance on medicine .
Looking further into the future , 100,000 years from now , thousands of years of mate choice and sexual selection will create greater and greater genetic inequality , which could see humans diverge into two separate sub- species â€ “ a genetic upper class and a genetic underclass .
1,000 years from now
The Bravo Evolution Report indicates that people of the year 3000 will have reached the peak of human enhancement , leading the longest , healthiest and most accomplished lives in the entire history of the human race .
Improved nutrition and understanding of the human body will see people grow taller , with men reaching an average height of between six and seven feet , while life spans will also be far greater , with humans living for up to 120 years .
Physical features will be driven by indicators of health , youth and fertility that men and women have evolved to look for in potential mates , the accomplishment of which will be aided by cosmetic surgery and advanced body modifying techniques .
As a result , men will exhibit symmetrical facial features , athleticism and the classic signs of high testosterone such as a square jaw , deeper voice and a bigger penis .
Meanwhile , women will exhibit lighter - coloured skin , large clear eyes , pert breasts , glossy hair , symmetrical features and smooth hairless skin .
Across both sexes , regional variations in skin tone are also expected to be smoothed out as humans move towards having a uniform â€ ˜coffeeâ€™ coloured skin tone .
However , eating processed foods means that there is less chewing to do , so future humans will have less developed jaws and shorter chins .
10,000 years from now
While mankind reaches a peak in 1,000 yearâ€™s time , further in the future the outlook for mankind is bleak and as the report predicts that the human species will pay the genetic price for its overwhelming reliance on technology .
Spoilt by the gadgets around them , the research predicts that humans may come to resemble domesticated animals .
Many key skills such as communicating and interacting with others will be degraded , and emotions such as love , sympathy , trust and respect are predicted to diminish leaving humans less able to care for others or perform in teams .
Far away from the peak experienced in the year 3000 , humans will look more juvenile .
This might make women look younger and more attractive , but it would be yet another factor , following on from the impact of human losing their jaw structure due to a lack of chewing , in men becoming â€˜chinless wondersâ€™ .
There is also a very real danger the human reliance on technology leading to defects in genetic make - up and diseases – such as cancer not being weeded out of the gene pool .
The increasing obsession with hygiene and reliance on medicine are also likely to lead to deterioration in the immune system .
As the size of infants continues to rise , natural mothers will also be forced to resort to caesarian sections .
A rise in genetic engineering may allow humans to replace faulty stretches of DNA and may also lead to more genetic uniformity as humanity strives for perfection .
100,000 years from now
Much further in the future it is predicted that sexual selection â€ “ that is , being choosy about with whom one mates – will create more and more genetic inequality .
With the genetic elite moving in ever more exclusive circles and losing contact with the rest of society , it is expected that new varieties of human will be created .
Mankind may be divided into two distinct sub- species â€ “ the â€˜gracileâ€™ descendents of a genetic upper class and the â€˜robustâ€™ descendents of a genetic underclass .
The genetic â€˜havesâ€™ will be tall , thin , symmetrical , clean , healthy , intelligent and creative .
The genetic â€ ˜have - notsâ€™ will be short , stocky , asymmetrical , grubby , unhealthy and less intelligent .
The Bravo Evolution Report was researched and prepared by Dr Oliver Curry , of the Darwin@LSE research centre at the London School of Economics .
Dr Curry comments : â€ ˜The Bravo Evolution Report suggests that the future of man will be a story of the good , the bad and the ugly .
While science and technology have the potential to create an ideal habitat for humanity over the next millennium , there is the possibility of a monumental genetic hangover over the subsequent millennia due to an over - reliance on technology reducing our natural capacity to resist disease , or our evolved ability to get along with each other .
After that , things could get ugly , with the possible emergence of genetic â€˜havesâ€ ™ and â€˜have - notsâ€™.â€ 
Johnny Webb , Director of Programmes at Bravo says , â€ œThe Bravo Evolution report makes fascinating and rather uncomfortable reading , and it is amazing to think that in just one thousand years time away everything will be so different.â€ ™

Three Things Trump Should Do to Own Biden in Tonight 's Debate
Many people think they can safely drive while talking on their cell phones .
Vanderbilt neuroscientists Paul E. Dux and René Marois have found that when it comes to handling two things at once , your brain , while fast , is n’t that fast .
“ Why is it that with our incredibly complex and sophisticated brain , with 100 billion neurons processing information at rates of up to a thousand times a second , we still have such a crippling inability to do two tasks at once ? ”
Marois , associate professor of Psychology , asked .
“ For example , what is it about our brain that gives us such a hard time at being able to drive and talk on a cell phone simultaneously ? ”
Researchers have long thought that a central “ bottleneck ” exists in the brain that prevents us from doing two things at once .
Dux and Marois are the first to identify the regions of the brain responsible for this bottleneck , by examining patterns of neural activity over time .
Their results were published in the Dec. 21 issue of Neuron .
“ In our everyday lives , we seem to complete so many cognitive tasks effortlessly .
However , we experience severe limitations when we try to do even two simple tasks at once , such as pressing a button when a visual stimulus appears and saying a word when a sound is presented .
This is known as dual - task interference , ” Dux , a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Psychology , said .
“ We were interested in trying to understand these limitations and in finding where in the brain this bottleneck might be taking place . ”
The research is particularly timely , as additional states consider banning the use of cell phones while driving .
“ While we are driving , we are bombarded with visual information .
We might also be talking to passengers or talking on the phone , ” Marois said .
“ Our new research offers neurological evidence that the brain cannot effectively do two things at once .
People think if they are using a headset with their cell phone while driving they are safe , but they ’re not because they are still doing two cognitively demanding tasks at once . ”
Identifying the information bottleneck responsible for this dual - task limitation required the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , an imaging technology that reveals the brain areas active in a given mental task by registering changes in oxygenated blood concentration in these regions .
While fMRI is an excellent tool for identifying a particular area in the brain involved in a given task , it generally provides limited information about how that area responds over time .
To overcome this limitation , Dux and Marois rapidly sampled brain activity using fMRI while subjects were performing two demanding tasks .
Evaluation of the data produced by this rapid sampling method allowed them to characterize the temporal pattern of activity in specific brain areas .
The two tasks consisted of pressing the appropriate computer key in response to hearing one of eight possible sounds and uttering an appropriate syllable in response to seeing one of eight possible images .
Different senses and motor responses were enlisted in order to ensure that any interference between the two tasks was not specific to a particular sensory or motor modality , but instead originated at a central information - processing bottleneck .
The results revealed that the central bottleneck was caused by the inability of the lateral frontal and prefrontal cortex , and also the superior frontal cortex , to process the two tasks at once .
Both areas have been shown in previous experiments to play a critical role in cognitive control .
“ We determined these brain regions responded to tasks irrespective of the senses involved , they were engaged in selecting the appropriate response , and , most importantly , they showed ‘ queing ’ of neural activity –the neural response to the second task was postponed until the response to the first was completed , ” Dux said .
“ Neural activity seemed to be delayed for the second task when the two tasks were presented nearly simultaneously – within 300 milliseconds of each other , ” Marois said .
“ If individuals have a second or more between tasks , we did not see this delay .
“ This temporal delay is the essence of dual - task interference for tasks that require actions .
By using time - resolved fMRI , we can see its signature in the brain , ” he continued .
“ These findings allow us to really now focus on this set of brain areas and to understand why these areas cannot process two tasks at once . ”
The researchers are interested in further exploring what is happening in the bottleneck to slow performance and believe the work may have future implications for people performing complex tasks .
“ It may be possible to look to the sort of tasks people are going to have to do in a very complex environment , such as flying a plane , and find out under what circumstances these tasks may be less vulnerable to dual - task interference , ” Dux added .
For the record , neither Marois nor Dux use their cell phones while driving .
“ I ’m Australian , and it ’s illegal there , so I ’m trained not to , ” Dux said .
“ Even so , I would never do it .
Dual - task costs can be up to a second , and that ’s a long time when you ’re traveling at 60 miles per hour . ”

Gunmen opened fire at a wake , leaving a man dead and another wounded .
They had been standing outside with a group of women , paying their respects to Ucal Chin - up to that point the most recent victim of the city 's gangland shootings .
Suddenly , three cars screeched into Frobisher Close , Chorlton - on - Medlock .
Four shots rang out from the middle vehicle .
A 23 - year - old known only as Tyson was hit in the stomach and collapsed outside the front door of Chin 's mother .
Now funeral arrangements are being prepared for Tyson .
A 33 - year - old shot in the leg during the drive - by shooting was last night recovering in hospital .
After the funeral , Chin 's mother had invited mourners back to their terraced home .
Her son had been murdered by gunfire from the passenger seat of a car three weeks ago - the fifth drive - by attack in south Manchester 's notorious gangland in seven days .
Six bullets were fired from a car that pulled up alongside him close to Longsight 's Victoria Park .
In the hours following the shooting at the wake , police described how they gathered the remnants of bottles and glasses from the street while looking for evidence .
The manageress of the nearby pub , The Gold Cup , said : ' They just opened fire .
It is incredible when you think it was mainly women there .
The lad who got killed was a friend of Ucal's , he was a lovely lad .
Police gave the cortege an escort , so they must have been expecting trouble .
The killers heard about the funeral and took a chance .
It looks as if they took a pop at anyone there . '
Neighbours said that no one called an ambulance after the shooting : instead , they bundled the victims into cars and rushed them to Manchester Royal Infirmary .
One said : ' I heard bangs , but I thought it was someone tapping on a window .
Then I heard tyres screeching , but that 's not unusual .
This is a 20 - mile - per - hour area , but sometimes it 's like Brands Hatch around here . '
The drive - by attack at Frobisher Close has raised concern as to whether officers had received specific intelligence that a shooting was planned .
An escort of two police motorbikes and three patrol cars had accompanied the funeral cortege to the city 's Southern Cemetery .
Witnesses said their presence suggested that the police were ' expecting trouble ' .
Some neighbours even reported seeing an armed response unit in the vicinity of the shooting half an hour before the assassins turned up .
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police yesterday claimed that the funeral escort was in the interests of ' road safety ' .
One local , who refused to be named for fear of reprisal , said : ' Funny that the police were in the cemetery as well . '
The mood throughout the funeral was described as tense .
The officers surrounding the mourners were a constant reminder to the 300 who gathered that the gangland dispute that killed Chin , 24 , had not been settled .
Yet these incidents were not the only shootings in a night when the city - and particularly Moss Side , Chorlton - on - Medlock and Longsight - once again lived up to the nickname of ' Gunchester ' .
Two hours earlier and half a mile away on Stretford Road in Hulme , a 14 - year - old had been shot while riding his bicycle .
Armed police were last night guarding the teenager and the 33 - year - old wounded at Frobisher Close in the city 's Royal Infirmary amid fears that gang members may attempt to finish off their targets .
The latest outbreak of violence in Manchester raised fresh questions yesterday over whether police are tackling a burgeoning gun culture centred in a tiny but heavily - populated area south of the city centre .
Gun crime is a problem for the whole of Manchester .
Police logged more than 3,000 firearms incidents in the 15 months up to May .
New figures for the Longsight division of Greater Manchester Police , which covers Moss Side , Chorlton - on - Medlock and Hulme , reveal that guns had been fired 115 times in the 12 months to April .
Even before the attacks that followed Friday 's funeral , police had responded to three other shootings last week .
Four months ago , Chief Superintendent David Keller , admitted that gun crime was increasing amid reports that teenagers had started walking around in body armour .
Yesterday , he adopted a bullish tone in the face of the latest tragedy : ' We 've had a lot of successes and we 're just having a difficult time at the moment . '
Armed patrols , he promised , would be stepped up to try and control the spiral of tit - for - tat shootings .
Officers are particularly concerned at the young age of perpetrators and victims .
Patsy McKie , chair of Mothers Against Violence , said : ' I can't believe another mother is going through what I went through . '
Her son , Dorrie , was killed in a gangland shooting eight years ago .
None the less , she remains optimistic that a solution can be found .
' We have to find why young people are doing this , ' she said .
' The fact that they are giving up their lives means they are n't thinking straight . '
City of shootings
· 15 June 2007 Ucal Chin , 24 , from Chorlton - on - Medlock , is shot dead while driving his car .
His 21 - year - old passenger suffers a gunshot wound to his hand .
· 30 April 2007 A 16 - year - old boy is held by police after allegedly shooting a 12 - year - old girl in the head in Gorton .
· 9 September 2006 Jessie James , 15 , shot dead in Moss Side in what detectives believe was a planned attack .
· 22 August 2006 Mark Daniels , 25 , shot in the chest in Woodhouse Park , Wythenshawe , in what police say was a targeted shooting .
Taken to Wythenshawe Hospital , but dies later .
· 4 July 2006 Ernest Gifford , 45 , is shot dead after three men enter his home in Moss Side .
· 13 September 2005 Ramone Cumberbatch , 18 , a member of the Doddington Gang operating out of Moss Side , shot dead in Hulme .
· 16 January 2005 Stacey John Lloyd , 31 , shot through the head .
His body is found in his burnt - out Subaru Impreza in Unsworth .
Mejia , 30 , never did go back .
He went on the run for five months , staying with friends and relatives , using only cash , travelling by bus and not calling his mother or daughter , before he turned himself in as a conscientious objector .
A military tribunal sentenced him to one year in prison .
Like Mejia , 24 - year - old Darrell Anderson went on the run just a few days before he was due to redeploy .
" I was supposed to leave for Iraq on January 8th .
On the 3rd I started to talk to people about the war .
By the 6th I woke up and had hit a brick wall .
I just knew I was n't going to be able to live a normal life if I went back . "
He told his mother , Anita , who said she " had been hoping for that " .
" I packed up the car and took him to Canada .
It was the first time I slept through the night in two years , " she says .
Anderson is now essentially a fugitive seeking asylum in Canada .
And then there was Joshua Casteel , an interrogator at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison .
His turning point came when a 22 - year - old Saudi who came to Iraq for jihad was brought before him for questioning .
" He admitted it , " says Casteel , 26 , a deeply religious Catholic convert from Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
" I asked him why he had come to Iraq to kill .
Then he asked me why I had come to Iraq to kill .
He said I was n't following the teachings of Jesus , which was pretty ironic .
But I thought he sounded just like me .
He was not a maniacal kind of killer .
He had never fired a weapon in his life ... I know what it 's like to proselytise .
At one time I had been a pretty nationalistic kid .
I understood where he was coming from but in order to do my job I could n't look at him as a human being .
I had to look at him as an object of exploitation . "
Two days later Casteel went to Qatar on leave .
When he came back he told his commander that he would be applying for conscientious objector status .
" I said I would n't turn in my weapon while I was there or talk to the media but would carry on doing my job and when I got back home I would ask to leave the military . "
He filed his application on February 16 and was granted an honourable discharge on May 31 .
Whether you call them deserters , conscientious objectors or resisters , every story of American soldiers who left the army prematurely because of the Iraq war shares the same emotional trajectory .
They begin with doubt and end with determination .
And somewhere along the way comes that ill - defined but crucial moment when the psychological struggle and moral angst overwhelm their military commitment .
The number applying for conscientious objector status has quadrupled since 2000 but remains small , though many more simply go awol .
In 2004 , 110 soldiers filed , of whom around half were successful .
The rest went back to war , refused to serve , were jailed or are still in hiding .
Yet there has been a huge increase in enquiries , according to JE McNeil , director of the Centre on Conscience and War .
Before 9/11 , she says , its GI hotline received roughly one phone call a month from those seeking information about how to get out of the military .
In the year after , it went up to one or two a week .
Currently it stands at more than one a day .
Which could explain the army 's increasingly hardline attitude towards deserters .
In the past the overwhelming majority of deserters ( 94 % ) were released - if not with an honourable discharge , at least with little fuss .
But as the war on terror started , the military had to get tough on those who went missing .
Shortly after 9/11 it issued new rules that deserters should be returned to their military units for evaluation .
In May 2004 , Major General Claude Williams of the Army National Guard issued an internal memo saying : " Effective immediately , I am holding commanders at all levels accountable for controlling manageable losses . "
He ordered commanders to retain 85 % of the soldiers who were scheduled to end their active duty and " execute the awol recovery procedures for every awol soldier " .
In one instance , one of those in command had a change of heart .
In June Ehren Watada became the first commissioned officer to refuse to deploy .
" This war is not only morally wrong but illegal under international and American law , " he said .
" I took an oath to defend the laws and constitution .
My participation would make me party to war crimes . "
When we spoke , Watada 's unit was due to ship out in a matter of days and he was getting ready to do time .
In July he was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer , " missing movement " and contempt toward officials .
" I will probably go to jail but I think it 's my duty to say it 's not a lawful order , " says Watada , who plans to challenge the legality of the war at any trial that may ensue .
If convicted he could face nearly eight years in prison and a dishonourable discharge .
There are at least 50 ways to leave your regiment .
Many simply go absent without leave and hope they are never found , others flee to Canada or apply for release as a conscientious objector .
Some pursue less confrontational avenues .
" People try for medical discharges , or discharge on grounds of hardship , " says McNeil .
" They take drugs and hope they get caught .
They come out as gay . "
A few resort to truly desperate measures .
In December 2004 , Marquise Roberts , 24 , got his cousin , Roland Fuller , to shoot him in the leg , then told the police he'd been struck by a stray bullet .
" I was scared , " he told police after they found no blood or casings in the area and the cousins could n't keep their story straight .
" I did n't want to go back to Iraq and leave my family .
I felt that my chain of command did n't care about the safety of the troops .
I just know that I was n't going to make it back . "
Fuller was sentenced to up to 30 months in prison ; Roberts got a year in military prison ; his wife , Donna , who helped them , got four years ' probation .
The process for becoming a conscientious objector is both involved and tough .
Soldiers have to show that they are opposed to all wars , not just a particular war .
They must also inform their commanding officer , who then appoints an investigating officer .
The investigating officer arranges for the soldier to be interviewed by both a chaplain and a psychiatrist , both of whom write reports .
Then the investigating officer writes a report and , finally , the commanding officer delivers his verdict in his own report .
This usually takes between 12 and 18 months , during which time the soldier must remain with his or her unit .
" The standard is pretty high and the military can be capricious about following its own standards , " says McNeil .
" Basically it 's a crap shoot .
And you 're still in the military until they decide .
The only thing they can't make you do during that time is pick up a weapon .
The response of your colleagues can vary .
Some soldiers have been raped ; others were told , ' I do n't agree with you but I 'll support you any way I can . ' "
Desertions - those who leave without permission - rose steeply from 1,509 in 1995 to 4,719 in 2001 , only to drop again last year to 2,500 .
For soldiers to be classified as deserters , they must be awol for 30 days .
At that point they are dropped from the military rolls and a federal warrant is issued for their arrest , although for many years they were rarely pursued for lack of resources .
Jeffry House , a Toronto - based lawyer fighting through the Canadian courts for political asylum for soldiers escaping the military , says he has seen a " steady trickle " of soldiers make it across the border .
House made the same journey himself in 1970 after he came up number 16 on the draft lottery for Vietnam .
He has 12 clients and knows of around 25 more being represented by others and another 200 " in other situations " in Canada .
His bid to gain the deserters political asylum now sits with the Canadian federal court of appeal , having been rejected by lower courts , but he is convinced they wo n't get sent back .
" I 'd be very surprised , " he says .
" It would run contrary to everything Canadians think about themselves . "
These figures do not represent an exodus in terms of the overall size of the US military , which stands at roughly 2.3 million ( including reservists ) , or compared with historical rates of desertion and conscientious objection during other wars .
During the Korean war 4,300 soldiers were granted conscientious objector status ; during Vietnam between 50,000 and 90,000 came to Canada , mostly as draft dodgers rather than deserters .
None the less , in an army that is overextended and where recruitment is proving increasingly difficult , every soldier counts .
More than 2,600 US soldiers have been killed in the Iraq war and around 19,500 have been injured .
They have to be replaced .
Since 2001 the military has taken extraordinary steps to bolster its depleted ranks .
There is currently a push to attract non-citizens to the service and to lift the upper age limit for new recruits .
And , over the past few years , the military has raised by half the rate at which it grants " moral waivers " to potential recruits who have committed misdemeanours and lowered the educational level required .
Steven Green , the former soldier accused of raping a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and murdering her family in Mahmudiya , entered the military on one such waiver .
Reservists , for whom the military was a part - time commitment , are seeing their tours of duty in Iraq extended and the defence department has once again imposed " stop loss " orders - refusing to allow a military member to leave or retire once their required term of service is complete .
The political rhetoric from the Bush administration and Congress maintains that the nation must stay the course in Iraq .
" It 's time for this House of Representatives to tell the world that we know our cause is right and that we are proud of it , " Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert said during a debate on withdrawal in June .
The next day the House rejected setting a timetable by 256 to 153 .
Hastert and his colleagues , however , have yet to convince the people fighting the war .
A Zogby International / Le Moyne College survey earlier this year revealed that 72 % of troops said the US should withdraw within 12 months , while 29 % said they should pull out immediately .
To grasp fully why some troops go awol , one must look beyond the polls to what made them join in the first place .
All have their own reasons but Darrell Anderson 's story is the one you hear most often .
" I was trying to get into college , " he says .
" I was living in a trailer with my grandmother .
I was broke and I needed education and healthcare , and if I had to go to war for it then that was just what I had to do .
Going to the military was my last chance .
My last option . "
He describes the circumstances that shaped his choice with a resigned smile and the choice itself with candour - as though going to war were a necessary , if unfortunate , stepping stone to his own American dream .
One of the central differences between this generation of deserters and those of the Vietnam era is class , says Lee Zaslofsky , coordinator of the War Resisters Support Campaign in Canada .
" Back then we went to university to get deferments from the draft .
Now they go into the military to go to university , " he says .
Troops in the Vietnam war were conscripted ; now they are volunteers .
Zaslofsky himself went north of the border in 1969 .
Poverty is one of two defining factors in recruitment to the military .
Not the abject penury of the underclass but the borderline desperation of the aspirant working poor .
America 's servicemen are better educated than the population at large , with blacks and Hispanics - the two ethnic groups least likely to support the war - the most over - represented in its ranks .
The other factor is patriotism .
Not tub - thumping nationalism but the latent , yet strongly - held , belief that the US is a force for good in the world and that its military exists to impose that good when other means have failed .
Such views are both so pervasive and dominant in the American psyche that they do n't need evidence to sustain them .
Support for the troops , regardless of their mission , is an indisputable fact of public discourse .
Liberals sport bumper stickers stating : " Support the troops , oppose the war . "
Flight attendants regularly announce the presence of a serviceman on board to rousing applause .
So when Anderson signed up , he knew there would be a war and , as much as he thought about it at all , he supported it .
" I thought I was going to free Iraqi people .
I thought I was going to do a good thing .
I did n't know anything about the politics of it . "
For nearly all of them , the first time this patriotism was put to the test was also the first time they went abroad - to Iraq .
Anderson recalls his initial thoughts while on patrol in Baghdad .
" I just thought , what are we doing here ?
Are we looking for weapons of mass destruction ?
No .
Are we helping the people ?
No , they hate us .
What are we working towards , apart from just staying alive ?
If this was my neighbourhood and foreign soldiers were doing this , then what would I be doing ? "
Initially appalled by what he describes as the racism and hatred of some of his fellow soldiers , he said within a few months he was " cocking my weapon at innocent civilians without any sympathy or humanity " .
Like Anderson , Camilo Mejia was able to conform for only so long .
Mejia worked in a prisoner of war camp in Al Assad .
" The prisoners were barefoot , hooded , their hands tied with concertina wire , and we had to soften them up for interrogation , " he says .
" We had to keep them awake for 48 to 72 hours .
They were so tired and occasionally they just could n't stay awake .
Then we would get a sledgehammer and hit the wall so it sounded like an explosion to scare the shit out of them .
Sometimes we would put a 9 mm pistol to their heads to make them think they were going to be executed .
I did n't say anything because I was afraid and everybody else was doing it .
Maybe they felt the same as I did , although some of them did n't really mind doing it .
But I knew the prisoners were not all terrorists .
One man had a rifle to protect his sheep .
I said to myself , this guy 's innocent .
I thought , this is not a prisoner of war camp - this is a torture camp . "
Casteel was similarly outraged by events in Abu Ghraib .
While training , he would be presented with mock scenarios : " We were told that whatever was written on the file was true , " he says .
" If it says this person is a genocidal terrorist , then that would be what he was .
So you felt justified in what you were doing .
But the intelligence we were working with in Iraq was terrible .
I interrogated 40 people .
I could count on one hand the people who had participated in systematic violence .
The rest knew nothing about it .
They were taxi drivers or young fathers .
Some were involved in tribal defence but that 's not systematic violence . "
There is a difference between knowing what is wrong , working out what needs to be done and then taking action .
To take the fateful step requires maturity and resolve .
Anyone who has stayed in an abusive relationship or a demoralising job too long knows what it is to be paralysed by indecision and false hope .
It is no different for deserters .
Each one now feels certain they made the right choice ; but the process by which they made that choice was marked by crippling uncertainty .
" There was a lot of conflict in me , " says Mejia .
" On the one hand I knew it was brutality .
On the other hand I had been preparing to be an infantryman for eight years .
I signed a contract .
I felt I was not entitled to my opinions .
I was worried that I would be perceived as a coward and a traitor .
So I thought I would just do it and keep quiet .
The sense of community in the military is very strong .
You rely on these people in really difficult situations .
I did n't want to disappoint them .
But these were all justifications you give yourself to avoid the bigger issues .
You keep coming back to the bigger picture .
What are we doing there ?
What about the people we are oppressing ?
In the end I decided there was no way I could justify participating in this war . "
Casteel also found himself wavering between extremes .
" I was torn , " he says .
" On the one hand I had my conscience .
On the other hand I felt I 'm trained for something but I 'm watching it from a place of comfort .
One week I would feel , this is all absurd , I 'm a pacifist and I need to get out .
The next week I would think I need to join Special Forces . "
And having spoken their own truth , they must then face the consequences .
Jail , disparagement , exclusion , ridicule .
" Some people called me a traitor , " says Anderson .
" But I thought , ' You 're supposed to support the troops and you 're not listening to a word I 'm saying . ' "
For Ivan Brobeck , 21 , joining the marines was his childhood ambition .
" As a kid I always wanted to join the military .
I was patriotic and I wanted to fight for my country .
I thought we had been doing the right thing all along but I did n't really keep up with the news , so I did n't know much about what was going on in Iraq . "
When he decided he could not return , his mother told him to see a therapist .
As he was leaving for Canada with his most important stuff - " My electronics basically " - his mother came to find him to take him back to the base and he had to hide from her .
It 's at this point it becomes apparent how young most of these men are .
Brobeck may be 21 , but with his boyish features he would struggle to get served in a British pub .
Most confided not in colleagues or superiors but in their mothers , who in more than one case assisted them in their esape plans .
When Anita Anderson went on talk radio to defend her son , one caller said he should be publicly executed .
At the doctor 's office in the small conservative town in Kentucky where she lives , her boss called a meeting at which her colleagues , who had previously congratulated her on Darrell 's service , said she was not allowed to talk about her son 's desertion .
" My boss made me sign a paper saying I would resign if the patients started to complain . "
She got another job .
" People say ' Support the troops ' but whenever you talk about supporting one individual soldier , they are not interested . "
At a picnic for resisters in Fort Erie , Canada , Anderson lies with his head in his wife 's lap and his mother sitting alongside him .
He is wearing a T - shirt saying AWOL and a broad smile , even though he joined the military in the first place to give himself more options and now he finds himself more trapped than he ever was .
His claim for refugee status was denied and he thinks it will be just a few months before he gets his deportation papers .
His wife is Canadian , so that might help .
The US border is just five minutes ' drive away but he can't go back .
He says that does n't bother him .
" All those rich people in my country sent me to die for oil and my education , " he says .
" I do n't feel like I want to go back right now .
Maybe if things change . "
Casteel , meanwhile , has been studying playwriting and non-fiction in Iowa , as well as teaching rhetoric .
He recently came to England and performed a monologue entitled Interrogation Room from his play , Returns , about his time at Abu Ghraib and post - traumatic stress disorder .
And whatever happened to the young Saudi jihadist who stiffened Casteel 's resolve by so reminding him of himself ?
" I have no clue , " says Casteel .
" I 'm sure that guy 's still in prison . "
According to
tax return data released this week by the IRS
( data above are from Table 5 ) , the share of federal income taxes paid by the top 5 % of taxpayers reached a 19 - year high of 57 % in 2004 ( see bottom graph above ) .
During the same period , the share of income taxes paid by the bottom 50 % of taxpayers reached a 19 - year low of 3.3 % in 2004 , compared to 6.5 % in 1986 ( see top graph above ) .
Note : Federal income taxes include taxes on salary and wages , dividend and interest income , and income from capital gains .
Measured by the share of federal income taxes paid , the 2003 tax reform was a " tax cut for the poor " and a " tax hike for the rich . "
BTW , the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee just muscled through a budget bill on a party - line 12 - 11 vote this afternoon that would pretty much guarantee the demise of Bush 's tax cuts , which expire at the end of 2010 .
In my last post , I talked about Goowy .
And I mentioned that they should seriously consider allowing third party developers to develop applications for their Web OS .
It ’s a repeatedly proven fact – enabling others to develop applications for your platform is a surefire way to success .
As more and more developers start writing applications for your platform , it becomes more useful and attractive for a common user .
Two most conspicuous examples – Windows and Flash .
While I wish that folk over at Goowy will do this someday , there is another Web OS that already provides an API for developing third party apps – Eye OS .
In that sense , Eye OS is the first open Web OS .
Eye OS is Open Source .
You can create an account on their public server here or download it and install it on your own server .
Here ’s a screenshot of Eye OS in action
Applications
While some applications come preinstalled , there is a variety of applications that you can install later .
Word Editor , Spreadsheet , Blogger , Chat , Audio Player , Browser , Calculator , Calendar – here ’s the complete list .
A lot of applications can be installed only if you are running eyeOS on your own server and not if you have an account on their public server .
More applications are continuously being added by third party developers .
Here ’s the API if you want to write your own killer app .
You can either use PHP or Flash .
File Sharing
An important aspect of a Web OS is the accessibility of data everywhere .
You can keep your files on the server – I ’m not sure about the storage limit on their public server .
However , there is no folder structure to arrange / categorize the files .
And though I could upload / download files from my computer to Eye OS , I could not see them in the Eye OS viewer – it kept saying “ You ca n’t access this file ” .
Well , it ’s just a minor bug , I think 🙂
Look
A lot of effort has been made to give it a desktop - like look .
The theme is configurable – here is a screenshot of the mac theme .
Possible Improvements
Integration with the desktop – to add contacts , all you can do is enter them manually .
There is no option to import contacts from other applications or web email sites .
Same for other apps like the calendar – it would be nice if it integrates with Outlook calendar for example .
I ’d also like to see more applications like To - do lists , rss readers etc .
But Eye OS does not have to worry about that .
They should be concentrating on providing a smooth development experience .
Developers will take care of the rest .
What is SSHGuard ?
sshguard protects hosts from brute - force attacks against SSH and other services .
It aggregates system logs and blocks repeat offenders using one of several firewall backends , including iptables , ipfw , and pf .
Brute - force attacks without SSHGuard SSHGuard blocks brute - force attacks
I first saw Yahoo's 13 Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site referenced in a post on Rich Skrenta 's blog in May .
It looks like there were originally 14 rules ; one must have fallen off the list somewhere along the way .
It 's solid advice culled from the excellent Yahoo User Interface blog , which will soon be packaged into a similarly excellent book .
It 's also available as a powerpoint presentation delivered at the Web 2.0 conference .
I 've also covered similar ground in my post , Reducing Your Website 's Bandwidth Usage .
But before you run off and implement all of Yahoo's solid advice , consider the audience .
These are rules from Yahoo , which according to Alexa is one of the top three web properties in the world .
And Rich 's company , Topix , is no slouch either -- they 're in the top 2,000 .
It 's only natural that Rich would be keenly interested in Yahoo 's advice on how to scale a website to millions of unique users per day .
To help others implement the rules , Yahoo created a FireBug plugin , YSlow .
This plugin evaluates the current page using the 13 rules and provides specific guidance on how to fix any problems it finds .
And best of all , the tool rates the page with a score -- a score !
There 's nothing we love more than boiling down pages and pages of complicated advice to a simple , numeric score .
Here 's my report card score for yesterday 's post .
To understand the scoring , you have to dissect the weighting of the individual rules , as Simone Chiaretta did :
My YSlow score of 73 is respectable , but I 've already made some changes to accommodate its myriad demands .
To get an idea of how some common websites score , Simone ran YSlow on a number of blogs and recorded the results :
Google : A ( 99 )
Yahoo Developer Network blog : D ( 66 )
Yahoo !
User Interface Blog : D ( 65 )
Scott Watermasysk : D ( 62 )
Apple : D ( 61 )
Dave Shea 's mezzoblue : D ( 60 )
A List Apart : F ( 58 )
Steve Harman : F ( 54 )
Coding Horror : F ( 52 )
Haacked by Phil : F ( 36 )
Scott Hanselman's Computer Zen : F ( 29 )
YSlow is a convenient tool , but either the web is full of terribly inefficient web pages , or there 's something wrong with its scoring .
I 'll get to that later .
The Stats tab contains a summary of the total size of your downloaded page , along with the footprint with and without browser caching .
One of the key findings from Yahoo is that 40 to 60 percent of daily visitors have an empty cache .
So it behooves you to optimize the size of everything and not rely on client browser caching to save to you in the common case .
YSlow also breaks down the statistics in much more detail via the Components tab .
Here you can see a few key judgment criteria for every resource on your page ...
Does this resource have an explicit expiration date ?
Is this resource compressed ?
Does this resource have an ETag ?
... along with the absolute sizes .
YSlow is a useful tool , but it can be dangerous in the wrong hands .
Software developers love optimization .
Sometimes too much .
There 's some good advice here , but there 's also a lot of advice that only makes sense if you run a website that gets millions of unique users per day .
Do you run a website like that ?
If so , what are you doing reading this instead of flying your private jet to a Bermuda vacation with your trophy wife ?
The rest of us ought to be a little more selective about the advice we follow .
Avoid the temptation to blindly apply these " top ( x ) ways to ( y ) " lists that are so popular on Digg and other social networking sites .
Instead , read the advice critically and think about the consequences of implementing that advice .
If you fail to read the Yahoo advice critically , you might make your site slower , as as Phil Haack unfortunately found out .
While many of these rules are bread - and - butter HTTP optimization scenarios , it 's unfortunate that a few of the highest - weighted rules on Yahoo's list are downright dangerous , if not flat - out wrong for smaller web sites .
And when you define " smaller " as " smaller than Yahoo " , that 's.. well , almost everybody .
So let 's take a critical look at the most problematic heavily weighted advice on Yahoo 's list .
Use a Content Delivery Network ( Weight : 10 )
If you have to ask how much a formal Content Delivery Network will cost , you can't afford it .
It 's more effective to think of this as outsourcing the " heavy lifting " on your website -- eg , any large chunks of media or images you serve up -- to external sites that are much better equipped to deal with it .
This is one of the most important bits of advice I provided in Reducing Your Website 's Bandwidth Usage .
And using a CDN , below a reasonably Yahoo - esque traffic volume , can even slow your site down .
Configure ETags ( Weight : 11 )
ETags are a checksum field served up with each server file so the client can tell if the server resource is different from the cached version the client holds locally .
Yahoo recommends turning ETags off because they cause problems on server farms due to the way they are generated with machine - specific markers .
So unless you run a server farm , you should ignore this guidance .
It 'll only make your site perform worse because the client will have a more difficult time determining if its cache is stale or fresh .
It is possible for the client to use the existing last - modified date fields to determine whether the cache is stale , but last - modified is a weak validator , whereas Entity Tag ( ETag ) is a strong validator .
Why trade strength for weakness ?
Add an Expires Header ( Weight : 11 )
This is n't bad advice , per se , but it can cause huge problems if you get it wrong .
In Microsoft 's IIS , for example , the Expires header is always turned off by default , probably for that very reason .
By setting an Expires header on HTTP resources , you 're telling the client to never check for new versions of that resource -- at least not until the expiration date on the Expires header .
When I say never , I mean it -- the browser wo n't even ask for a new version ; it'll just assume its cached version is good to go until the client clears the cache , or the cache reaches the expiration date .
Yahoo notes that they change the filename of these resources when they need them refreshed .
All you 're really saving here is the cost of the client pinging the server for a new version and getting a 304 not modified header back in the common case that the resource has n't changed .
That 's not much overhead .. unless you 're Yahoo .
Sure , if you have a set of images or scripts that almost never change , definitely exploit client caching and turn on the Cache - Control header .
Caching is critical to browser performance ; every web developer should have a deep understanding of how HTTP caching works .
But only use it in a surgical , limited way for those specific folders or files that can benefit .
For anything else , the risk outweighs the benefit .
It 's certainly not something you want turned on as a blanket default for your entire website .. unless you like changing filenames every time the content changes .
I do n't mean to take anything away from Yahoo's excellent guidance .
Yahoo's 13 Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site and the companion FireBug plugin , YSlow , are outstanding resources for the entire internet .
By all means , read it .
Benefit from it .
Implement it .
I 've been banging away on the benefits of GZip compression for years .
But also realize that Yahoo's problems are n't necessarily your problems .
There is no such thing as one - size - fits - all guidance .
Strive to understand the advice first , then implement the advice that makes sense for your specific situation .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - A science probe making NASA ’s first foray into the asteroid belt missed its summer launch window , jeopardizing NASA ’s first attempt to orbit two bodies with a single spacecraft , officials said on Sunday .
The Dawn spacecraft was originally scheduled to fly on June 20 but assembly of the Boeing Delta 2 rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was delayed after a crane failure .
Then the spacecraft needed minor repairs to one of its solar wing panels .
The mission was rescheduled for Saturday , but poor weather at the launch site delayed rocket fueling and then an airplane needed to help track the spacecraft after liftoff developed mechanical problems .
Unable to get firm commitments for launch dates later in the month , due to previously scheduled missions at Cape Canaveral , NASA gave up for the summer and reset Dawn ’s liftoff for September .
“ A September launch for Dawn maintains all the science goals , ” said NASA spokesman George Diller .
September will be NASA ’s last chance for 15 years to explore its two targets , Vesta and Ceres .
After that , the two bodies will begin moving apart from each other and the spacecraft will no longer be able to reach both .
Dawn is intended to be a low - cost mission to explore two of the largest bodies in the asteroid belt , a vast area between Mars and Jupiter littered with primordial remains from the solar system ’s formation .
The spacecraft will be the first able to go into orbit around more than one target , thanks to its innovative ion-powered engines that can be stopped and restarted during flight using a fraction of the fuel of conventional chemical thrusters .
NASA last year canceled Dawn , citing budget pressures and technical issues , but scientists appealed and won an additional $ 100 million to continue the program .
Total mission costs will now be about $ 450 million .
The Science of Insulting Women
Picking up women has been getting plenty of press these days , leading up to this week ’s premiere of the VH1 reality show The Pick - Up Artist .
The show follows eight “ socially inept ” men through an eight - week boot camp on seduction techniques , led by a self - proclaimed Lothario called “ Mystery . ”
The headliner ( whose real name is Erik Von Markovik ) initially found fame after being profiled in Neil Strauss ‘s 2005 book The Game : Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists , and went on to co-write his own book , How to Get Beautiful Women Into Bed : The Mystery Method .
Under particular discussion is a pickup technique that Mystery advocates known as “ negging ” — a move that involves interjecting an insult during an initial conversation with a woman .
The motivation behind the insult is , as Esquire ’s A.J. Jacobs puts it , to “ lower her self - esteem , thus making her more vulnerable to your advances . ”
While this tactic has provoked considerable ire , by all accounts from Strauss and his skirt - chasing Svengali , it seems to work .
Meanwhile , the psychologists Steve Stewart - Williams and William F. McKibbin have been researching the topic of men insulting women , publishing a study called “ Why Do Men Insult Their Intimate Partners ? ” in the July Journal of Personality and Individual Differences .
Their first set of data consisted of a survey of 245 men with a mean age of 25.8 , all of whom had been in heterosexual relationships for a mean length of 43.1 months .
Each man was asked to record how often he insulted his female partner in the course of a month , choosing from a list of 47 insults divided into four categories : “ derogating physical attractiveness ” ( e.g . “ You ’re ugly ” ) ; “ derogating value as partner / mental capacity ” ( e.g .
“ You make my life miserable ” or “ You ’re stupid ” ) ; “ derogating value as a person ” ( e.g . “ You ’re useless ” ) ; and “ accusations of sexual infidelity . ”
These men were also asked to record how often they performed any of 104 acts labeled “ mate retention behaviors ” during that same month , including “ direct guarding ” ( e.g. , secretly following a partner when she goes out alone ) and “ public signals of possession . ”
A second set of data came from 372 women who were asked to detail the number and type of insults they received from their partners , as well as the males ’ mate - retention behavior rates .
The results showed that men who piled on the insults ( particularly those in the “ derogating value as partner / mental capacity ” group ) were far more likely to engage in mate retention behaviors , suggesting that “ men ’s partner - directed insults may be deployed as part of a broader strategy of mate retention . ”
Next , maybe Stewart - Williams and McKibbin will turn their attention to the relationship - initiation phase and gather data on “ negging . ”
Or maybe they ’ll tackle a question that many would surely like to know : if it ’s successful for men , does it work for women as well ?

The exam - sat by teachers seeking promotion - provoked outrage by posing questions which appeared to degrade Islam 's holiest figure by alluding to personal habits and proclivities .
Most of the 40 multiple - choice questions have been judged so mocking that Iran 's state - controlled media has refrained from publishing them .
One less offensive question , reproduced by local newspapers and websites , lists four choices when asking how Muhammad compared himself with the prophet Joseph .
They are : " A ) I am more beautiful than Joseph ; B ) Joseph is more beautiful than me ; C ) I am cuter than Joseph ; D ) Joseph is more beautiful than me but I am cuter than him . "
Others refer to his hair and beard colour .
The national teachers ' representative body protested after the test was given to diploma and higher - diploma level teachers in Tehran province .
The local education authority admitted the questions were " in bad taste " and withdrew them .
An alternative exam is being drawn up for teachers who failed , although the results of those with pass marks have been declared valid .
Some MPs branded the incident a deliberate plot to undermine Iran 's Islamic system and likened it to last year 's row over Danish cartoons satirising Muhammad , which provoked outrage throughout the Muslim world after they were published in several European newspapers .
" What is the difference between these questions and the caricatures drawn in Denmark against the prophet ? " said Emad Afrough , the fundamentalist head of the cultural committee in Iran 's parliament .
The latest row has spurred parliamentarians to begin preparations for impeaching the education minister , Mahmoud Farshidi , who has apologised for the tests .
However , MPs have dismissed his mea culpa as insufficient and have called on Mr Ahmadinejad to apologise on the government 's behalf .
The president has declined to comment directly but said in a speech this week in the northern province of Gilan : " The unity , authority and dignity of the Iranian nation stems from sticking to the dignified presence of the dear prophet of Islam , Muhammad . "
Teachers were given 30 hours off classroom duties to study a biography of the prophet by the late Ayatollah Muhammad Tabatabai , a Shia philosopher whose teachings inspired many senior figures in Iran 's Islamic revolutionary movement .

Working at the BBC can be a strange experience .
On occasions during my 25 years as a journalist with the corporation it was jaw - dropping .
In 1984 I returned to BBC Scotland after covering the Tory conference in Brighton .
The IRA had come close to assassinating Margaret Thatcher with a bomb and the country was in shock .
Apart , that is , from some of my BBC colleagues .
" Pity they missed the bitch , " one confided to me .
Sign up for the latest news alerts
For three decades I was that rare breed - a Conservative at the BBC .
In my time working on programmes such as Today and Breakfast News I could n't have formed a cricket team from Tory sympathisers .
As one producer put it , you feel almost part of an ethnic minority .
We all know the cliched critique of the BBC : a nest of Lefties promoting a progressive agenda and political correctness .
Depressingly , that cliche is uncomfortably close to the truth : the BBC is biased , and it is a bias that seriously distorts public debate .
In the past 30 years , ' Auntie ' has transformed from the staid upholder of the status quo to a champion of progressive causes .
In the process , the ideal at the heart of the corporation - that it should be fair - minded and non-partisan - has all but disappeared .
I suppose none of this should have surprised me .
I got a job with BBC Radio Brighton
in 1978 after working in newspapers .
I was delighted ; I believed I was joining the world 's finest broadcasting organisation with a global reputation for integrity .
But by the time I was appointed BBC Scotland 's business and economics correspondent in 1981 , I had doubts .
The BBC in Scotland was deeply antagonistic towards the Conservative Government ; our narrative was one of devastating industrial decline and Government heartlessness .
I had endless arguments with colleagues .
On one occasion , a producer got so cross with me for defending Mrs Thatcher that we came close to blows .
His view , shared by many colleagues , was that her Government 's actions were indefensible .
But surely if BBC impartiality meant anything , we would have balanced our story by emphasising the growing banking , oil and electronics industries .
Instead , we constantly lamented the closure of shipyards and fretted about the ailing Ravenscraig steelworks .
By the time I moved to London to work on the Money Programme in 1989 , Thatcherite economics could no longer be dismissed : they worked .
The Left 's bitterness towards Thatcher , however , was undiminished .
The real Britain was recovering , but inside the Money Programme offices it was a gloomy economic winter where every privatisation was doomed and government spending was ruthlessly cut to satisfy wicked monetarists .
Our scripts were as opinionated as any commentary in The Guardian .
I argued the case for Thatcherism but was massively outgunned .
I was viewed , I think , as a deluded oddity - more to be pitied than taken too seriously .
My face did n't fit and I moved to Breakfast News .
The General Election of 1992 put things into sharp focus .
The BBC had privately rejoiced at the downfall of Thatcher in 1990 and there was widespread expectation of a Labour victory .
But that optimism was misplaced .
Neil Kinnock failed to convince the voters .
On Election night , the atmosphere in the newsroom was one of palpable deflation .
A young female producer was in tears .
John Major had little opportunity to enjoy his success ; within months , Sterling was ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and his Government never recovered .
The BBC mounted a barrage of negative coverage on everything from the NHS to sleaze .
That was coupled with a devotion to the European ideal .
I remember arguing with a senior editor about the Maastricht Treaty and saying it was an issue of democracy , not economics .
He told me I was mad .
As the 1997 Election approached , the Government was constantly on the defensive and the BBC was often happy to do Labour 's Opposition work for it .
Fortunately , I did n't always have to concentrate on domestic politics and did stints in Washington and Russia .
But in 1998 I finally decided to voice my concerns .
I was in my 40s , experienced and confident enough to say what I believed .
Also , I had the perfect place to do it .
My colleagues had elected me to the BBC Forum , designed to improve communication between management and staff .
At one meeting , director - general John Birt seemed nonplussed when I raised the issue of Left - wing bias .
He asked Jenny Abramsky , a senior news executive , to answer .
Her reply was short and dismissive ; my fears , she said , were unfounded .
I was wrong to raise them .
In 1999 the news was dominated by Nato 's war against Serbia .
The BBC was supportive , in contrast to its sceptical attitude to the Falklands and the first Gulf wars .
Why the difference ?
At the time Tony Blair enjoyed uncritical support within the BBC , as did President Bill Clinton .
At a Forum meeting in December 2000 , I suggested to Greg Dyke , the new director - general , that there should be an internal inquiry into bias .
Dyke , a Labour Party donor and member along with BBC chairman Gavyn Davies , mumbled a muddled reply .
As he left the meeting , I overheard him demand angrily of his PA : " Who was that f****r ? "
At the end of the meeting a reporter from the BBC staff magazine Ariel asked for more details but warned me that " controversial " topics were often spiked .
Sure enough , not a word appeared .
I feared I was becoming one of those obsessives - familiar to all journalists - who write long , fastidiously researched but quite mad letters in green ink .
But I felt my worries needed to be addressed - even at the risk of looking ridiculous .
In 2001 I was hired by Rod Liddle , then editor of Radio 4 's Today , to report on politics and economics .
With an audience of six million , the programme is arguably the most influential in Britain .
But I soon began noticing bias in the subjects chosen , the people interviewed and the tone of voice .
I wrote to Phil Harding , the BBC 's director of editorial policy , using the Macpherson Inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence as an analogy .
If the Metropolitan Police was " institutionally racist " , I wrote , the BBC was " institutionally Leftist " .
He was reluctant to engage and eventually told me he could devote no more time to my views , while Mark Damazer , deputy head of news , accused me of feeling frustrated about my career progress and attacked me for impugning the integrity of my colleagues .
Both allegations were false ; I enjoyed my career and never doubted the integrity of my colleagues - they truly believed they were acting impartially , they just did n't recognise their bias .
' Neutral ' for BBC journalists is left of centre for everyone else ; everything is seen through the distorting prism of the progressive agenda .
As one senior news presenter told me : " Anybody who attacks the Labour Government is always coming from the Left , and the Tories are written off as insane or - if there 's the slightest chance of them getting anywhere - evil . "
But Damazer was n't interested in my views .
As I was so " disaffected " , he suggested I consider leaving the BBC .
The situation was becoming Kafkaesque .
I was trying to get the BBC to be true to its obligations and being treated like a mad dissident .
Privately , though , many colleagues agreed I had a point .
As Christmas 2002 approached I decided there was one , final avenue left open to me : the BBC governors .
However , I hesitated .
I was , after all , an ordinary employee and , frankly , I was nervous of repercussions : I could be risking my career .
Nonetheless , I voiced my concerns .
Alongside specific interviews and programmes I thought demonstrated bias , I recounted the story of Steve Richards and John Kampfner , BBC current affairs presenters who both subsequently became political editor of the New Statesman .
About two months later I received a response .
After discussing my letter with Dyke and Richard Sambrook , then director of news , they concluded I " did not provide conclusive evidence of systematic bias " .
I was disappointed .
It was n't just the slightly patronising tone of the reply , but the way my concerns were dismissed on the say - so of a senior BBC executive .
What would the BBC have said if the Metropolitan Police , faced with accusations of racism , had held a brief internal inquiry that concluded that there was no problem ?
Bias not only stifles public debate ; it is destructive for the corporation , too .
Adherence to a left - of - centre agenda brought the BBC to its biggest crisis in decades and one I witnessed at close quarters on Today .
Within the BBC , opinion ran strongly against the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Most staff felt war was unjustified ; feelings intensified by their contempt for President George Bush .
On Today we occasionally allowed the case for war to be made , but the prevailing tone was doom - laden .
Arguing for a better balance was a thankless task : at one meeting I said our coverage was too anti-war ; the editor 's response was brusque .
" That 's a very dangerous view , " Kevin Marsh , who took over as Today 's editor in 2002 , told me .
Dangerous to whom ?
I wondered .
On 25 May 2003 , four days before Andrew Gilligan 's infamous report , Today presenter John Humphrys wrote about weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) and the reasons for invading Iraq in a Sunday newspaper .
He said : " You need a very good reason to kill people .
Which is why so many were opposed to the war in Iraq in the first place .
But eventually most were persuaded , even some MPs who had expressed profound misgivings .
The question many of them are asking now is whether they were misled . "
Four days later Gilligan conveniently provided the answer on the air , in his report about claims that Iraq could launch WMDs within 45 minutes .
" Actually , " he told Humphrys , " the Government probably knew that that 45 - minute figure was wrong . "
The crucial point about the Gilligan saga is that the BBC got into a mess because it wanted to believe the story .
Today and the corporation would have quickly disowned Gilligan 's story had it not so perfectly fitted their chosen narrative .
In late 2003 the Today programme became obsessed with the ' human rights ' of detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
At a planning meeting I argued that ' human rights ' are contingent and that fanatical Islamists cannot expect to be treated as innocent victims .
Afterwards , a BBC trainee confided that she often found herself thinking along similar lines but felt unable to speak up .
It is worth bearing in mind what happens if someone at the BBC breaks ranks .
In 2004 , TV presenter Robert Kilroy - Silk wrote about the Arab people and asked : " What do they think we feel about them ?
That we adore them for the way they murdered more than 3,000 civilians on September 11 and then danced in their hot , dusty streets to celebrate the murders ?
That we admire them for being suicide bombers , limb amputators , women repressors ? "
Kilroy - Silk 's TV career ended the next week .
In a statement , the BBC 's director of television , Jana Bennett , said : " Presenters of this type of programme have a responsibility to uphold the BBC 's impartiality .
" This does not mean that people who express highly controversial views are not welcome on the BBC , but they cannot be presenters of a news , current affairs or topical discussion programme . "
But how consistently is the Gospel according to Bennett adhered to ?
Are sanctions equally applied to all presenters who express " controversial views " ?
Consider this passage : " The Pope 's approach to AIDS has been outrageous .
He has called for a ban on the use of condoms in fighting the disease in Africa ... The orders from Rome are verging on the wicked . "
A controversial view ?
Certainly among Britain's four million Catholics .
An impartial view ?
Certainly not .
And the writer ?
John Humphrys in a newspaper column in October 2003 .
Another example , from a writer seeking " rational debate " on gay sex without a condom : " The first guy I ever f***** without a condom gave me HIV . '
Since I 've been HIV - positive , I 've had ' unsafe sex ' more times than I can remember , often with men whose names I could not tell you now . "
Controversial ?
Yes .
Impartial ?
Hardly .
So who is writing here ?
Nigel Wrench , one of the presenters of Radio 4's PM programme , in The Pink Paper in 2000 .
So how was the Jana Bennett test applied in these two instances ?
It was n't .
The point is that whether a statement is " controversial " or not depends on your starting point .
What Kilroy - Silk said was controversial , presumably , among Britain 's Muslim minority but , decisively , it was controversial within the BBC .
What John Humphrys wrote was not .
Nigel Wrench is still one of the senior reporters , and sometime presenter , on PM ; his views were , presumably , also judged not to be controversial .
After the Hutton Inquiry in 2004 I decided to take voluntary redundancy from the BBC .
It was an amicable parting but I felt I could take my complaints about bias no further .
The money I got enabled me to write the book which I hope will start a proper debate about the BBC 's impartiality .
In 2007 , there is a solid consensus within the BBC on most issues of private morality and , in many cases , public policy .
One presenter described the sense of superiority that working at the BBC confers on its staff .
" It 's the whole thing that 'we know best ' and it's our responsibility to educate the poor unfortunates beneath us in how things should be . "
The way the BBC is run is about to change , with the governors replaced by a BBC Trust .
But this is unlikely to deal with bias .
The Government will make appointments to the Trust - it will undoubtedly hire ' reliable ' people whose political views mirror its own .
The erstwhile young rebels who changed the BBC in the Sixties and Seventies are now the Establishment , and their views , once so radical , have become an ossified consensus - just like the ones they replaced .
However , there is a big difference : the old Establishment was undermined by media scrutiny ; the new Establishment is the media .
Who can debunk it ?
One answer comes from America , where the Right long complained about liberal bias in the main networks .
The Americans , true to form , turned to the free market ; Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News provides a calculated alternative with a brash , patriotic , unashamedly populist tone .
It is time to give people a choice in Britain .
Perhaps the BBC should divest itself of a small part of its £ 3 billion a year income for an alternative service .
Two per cent of revenues would give a newcomer £ 60 million a year for a speech - based rival to Radio 4 .
The centre - right in Britain needs to be clear - sighted about its situation .
The BBC is a profoundly influential opponent of nearly everything conservatives believe , with the Right forced to accede feebly to the Left - liberal consensus .
If the time comes when British conservatives feel like fighting back , broadcasting policy might not be a bad place to start .

When you think of Macs and virtualization , what pops to mind ?
Well regardless of what you think , there ’s a new kid on the Mac virtualization block : VMware Fusion .
And “ new kid ” is n’t exactly the right term .
VMware pioneered x86 virtualization and has been doing virtualization for nine years now .
With Apple ’s switch to Intel processors , all that experience can now be brought to your Mac .
Hold on to your mighty mouse , because when the granddaddy of virtualization turns its attention to your favorite MacBook Pro , you can do some crazy things .
These are some of our favorites :
SWITCH !
Want to leverage the digital lifestyle of your Mac but have one or two Windows applications that you ca n’t live without ?
You do n’t have to be locked in anymore .
Outlook , Windows Media Player , Microsoft Project , AutoCAD , Solidworks … you name it .
They all can run in a Windows virtual machine on VMware Fusion .
Bring your USB peripherals with you as you switch too ; they still work .
Walk and chew gum at the same time .
With virtualization you are running , in effect , two computers at the same time when you run Windows on your Mac .
That can take some horsepower .
VMware Fusion ’s mature technology means much less CPU overhead .
As Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal noticed , “ VMware Fusion has a much smaller impact on the Mac ’s overall performance [ than Parallels . ] ”
With VMware Fusion , Outlook in your Windows virtual machine does n’t slow down your Safari session running on Mac OS X .
Use the full strength of your Mac hardware .
VMware Fusion ’s virtual SMP lets you assign up to two CPUs to a single VM .
Up to 8 GB of RAM too in a VM .
Want to test run the latest Oracle database in a 64 - bit Linux VM , with 4 GB RAM and 2 cores ?
Want to test SQL Server 2007 on Windows Server 2003 64 - bit edition ?
You can do it .
Though you should probably be doing something else on your Saturday night .
Reduce , reuse , recycle … your RAM .
VMware pioneered memory page file sharing .
So running a VM in VMware Fusion takes up much less of your Mac ’s memory than other virtualization products .
And it gets better the more VMs you ’re running at once .
Five Windows XP virtual machines at a time does n’t mean 5 x the memory of a single XP virtual machine .
By sharing the sections of memory that are common between the VMs — like with common OSs — you can “ over commit ” memory .
Run those Windows apps as if they were Mac apps .
VMware Fusion ’s Unity feature your Mac treats Windows applications like its own .
Windows applications show up in the Dock on launch and you can even minimize Windows apps down to the Dock too .
They fly around in Exposé , sport drop shadows around their edges , you name it .
As far your Mac is concerned , they ’re native apps .
Do n’t lose your head ( or your way ) with USB 2.0 support .
Got a GPS unit that does n’t support Mac ?
With VMware Fusion , just load the software in Windows and plug the USB cable into your Mac .
Blackberry , USB VOIP softphones , webcams , scanners , printers , all of the above .
You can still use them with a Windows VM .
Just because you want to switch , does n’t mean you should have to say goodbye to near and dear peripherals .
Bring that Mac into the enterprise .
Usually there are a handful of applications that are absolute must - haves in the enterprise that are tying you to that PC .
VMware Fusion lets you run those in a Mac .
And VMware Fusion USB support means that the Crackberry monkey will still be on your back .
VMware Fusion ’s stability , and the amazing support network provided by VMware ’s forums , make it a business - class solution .
Run over sixty x86 compliant operating systems on your Mac. Linux , Solaris , Windows from 3.1 through Vista Ultimate x64 .
32 - bit or 64 - bit. VMware Fusion can run it .
In fact , VMware Fusion can run over 60 operating systems on your Mac. Sure , Mac OS X is great , but why not learn some Linux , FreeBSD , or even turn back the clock to Windows 3.1 .
You can even drag and drop files between Linux and your Mac or Windows and your Mac .
Go shopping for some appliances to match your pretty Mac .
There are over 550 virtual appliances available in the Virtual Appliance Marketplace , including pre-staged anti-spam and security appliances , demo software , you name it .
Pull one down , fire it up on VMware Fusion , and you ’re up and running .
No install discs , . ISOs , or anything .
You can use those CDs for coasters , if you want .

Castle and Sky
Credit & Copyright Paco Bellido
Explanation : While Comet McNaught ruled southern skies , last week 's conjunction of the Moon and Venus could be enjoyed by denizens of both hemispheres of planet Earth .
The two more commonly viewed celestial beacons produced this lovely twilight scene , recorded last Saturday in skies above Almodovar near Cordoba in southern Spain .
Brilliant Venus and a slender crescent
Moon seem to overlook the small town , along with a well - lit Castle Almodovar .
The impressive castle 's construction began in the 700s on the strategic site of a Roman fort .
It was extensively restored in the 20th century .

An important part of any online media outlet is their ability to have first - hand access to details , interviews and photographs that have n't already been sifted through other news agencies — allowing us the ability to determine for ourself what is worth reporting about a certain story .
To this end , there are a number of Wikinews members who will arrange to do original reporting .
Keep notes
You must be able to provide evidence of everything you include in an original article .
Therefore , it is vital that you keep adequate notes , and place your notes on the article 's discussion page .
Add the Original reporting template ( {{original}} ) to the Sources section of your article .
Include everything you can , including ( for example ) transcripts of interviews and e-mails .
You can upload audio files to the Commons .
If you do n't want to publish notes on Wikinews itself , whether for privacy or length reasons , feel free to e-mail the research to an administrator or an accredited reporter , who should note on the article 's talk page that they have received the research notes .
When taking notes , you might try making your own shorthand .
Specify what are verbatim quotes .
Ensure you clearly identify yourself on the article 's talk page in order for others to know who can verify the evidence .
Wikinews has a peer - review process for publication , and a reviewer must have well - defined evidence with which to verify the article .
Evidence which is of unknown source is not evidence .
Please do not misrepresent facts or swamp the article with similar unsourced material if unsourced material you have submitted is not being cited .
Ethics
Journalists should follow a Code of Ethics , some aspects of which may be relevant to your conduct when in contact with third - party sources .
If you are planning to report about a demonstration , choose beforehand what side you are going to be on : you can join the protest , or be a neutral reporter .
If you go to a protest to participate in it , leave your Wikinews Press Card at home !
Other behaviour is taken for granted in interview situations , which may not be documented in the ethics code , but which should be documented elsewhere .
Some is documented below , but it is beyond the scope of this document to give detailed information about how to conduct an interview .
Talking to sources
A good article will have multiple sources quoted , but every article must have multiple sources contacted behind - the - scenes .
It is not enough that the subject of the article told you that he or she is " the first Canadian to do a certain action " , that he or she " operates the largest website of its genre " or " was fired from his or her job because of comments he or she made about the President " .
The onus is on you as the reporter , to make sure those facts are correct .
Our articles should not advance an agenda , they are here to inform , not influence .
If Person A says that Person B was fired due to theft , go talk to Person B and get the other side of the story as well .
Do not judge which side of the story " seems more believable " and then only tell that side — present both sides in a neutral light and let the reader make up their own mind .
Laws vary between nations , but it is typically required that you identify yourself as a reporter to the person with whom you are speaking .
You do n't need to make this an awkward formality , just work it into your introductions .
" Hi , I 'm Jeff Davies , a local reporter who 's covering the arrest outside your restaurant yesterday .
I was wondering if I could ask you a couple questions ? "
Again , you must inform the subject if you are going to make an audio recording of the interview .
It is best to present it to them as a precaution for their sake .
If they ask why you 're recording , do n't say " So that I have proof of what you said " — simply explain that " I 'd like to have it as a reference when writing up the story tonight , because I would hate to accidentally misquote you on anything or leave out one of your salient points " .
If they 're a public figure you can always use a search engine to determine the proper spelling of their name once you get home ... but if it 's not somebody likely to have already been in a number of news stories , double - check that you have all the names / spellings correct .
As a general legal principle , everything a source tells you before you 've identified yourself is " off the record " and cannot be published unless you get them to repeat it for you later .
Similarly , if a source tells you anything is " off the record " , do not print it .
On the other hand , people will often allow you to speak to them for " background material " , where they do not wish to be identified in your article — but may still provide you with information nonetheless .
Sometimes they will allow this information to be credited to " a police officer on the scene said that ... " , other times they will demand no reference in the article .
Respect their wishes .
Often a source will give you a photograph of their imprisoned brother , their father during the war or some similar family ' photograph ' to be used for your story .
Ask them if they'd be willing to release the licensing to the image , so that other media outlets can use the photograph in the future if the subject returns in another news story — if you can do it without seeming awkward , direct them towards permissions@wikimedia.org to confirm the release of their image .
When you are unsure of anything , clarify it .
If you speak to someone who deals with the press often , you should be mindful of the fact that such people often become expert at manipulating the impressions of reporters .
Your ability to see through manipulation techniques will improve with practice .
If your source has more experience in interviews than you do , then it is important to consider what slant the person may want to give your final story , and to make sure that you , rather than the source , decide which details are relevant .
Interviews are best the closer they are to the source : for example , at their workplace instead of over the phone .
Information from news releases , phone or e-mail interviews , etc. , should be noted as such in the article .
You should normally prepare for interviews by learning some background information .
For example , if you profile a mayor , you should n't ask him when he was elected .
You should be able to learn that elsewhere beforehand .
As long as you have advised your source that you are a reporter , anything they say is presumptively " on the record " and can be quoted .
However , sources may expect that only the formal " interview " part of your interaction is going to be used in your story , and may be surprised if you choose to use other material .
Since Wikinews has no , strict , formal approval process for authors , when contacting sources , you must represent yourself as an independent author / researcher , not as a ' representative ' of Wikinews .
This remains the case if you are an accredited reporter : then , you must introduce yourself as an independent or freelance reporter .
You may , of course , inform the source where you hope to publish , but please ensure they understand in this case that your own views and activities are not representative of anyone else who uses Wikinews , nor does the reputation of Wikinews , or lack of reputation of Wikinews , reflect on yourself .
Wikinews aims for high standards ; meets those set by Google News for listing as a news source ( as - per most mainstream sources ) but is a volunteer best - effort with regards to reporters ' fact - checking and independent editorial review and oversight .
Be polite and act without bias .
Eyewitness accounts
When reporting as a witness of an event , explain briefly in the Original reporting notes section of the Talk page ( described above ) who you are and why you were present , in relation to the event , in addition to the usual features of the story .
In this circumstance you are the source , and others may wish to contact you for verification , interview , or for other details .

Aides say he remains on track to formally announce his candidacy the week of the Fourth of July , although they say no date is set in stone .
Mary Matalin , the former counselor to Vice President Cheney , says she will be advising Thompson .
A campaign source says she will be an unpaid adviser .
Matalin is friends with Thompson and his wife , Jeri , and her involvement began informally , the source says .
Advisers say the head of economic policy for Thompson 's fledgling team will be Lawrence B. Lindsey , who was President Bush 's first economic policy adviser and an architect of his tax cuts .
Lindsey was chief economic adviser to Bush 's first presidential campaign and is a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
Lindsey will also have a hand in the campaign 's broader policy formulation , sources say .
The head of domestic policy is to be David M. McIntosh , a lawyer and former congressman from Indiana who was an official in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations , according to the sources .
The chief foreign policy adviser will be chosen soon , the sources say .
Adding to the Bush - Cheney ties , the campaign has said that the chief operating officer will be Thomas J. Collamore , a former aide to the older Bush when he was vice president and also an official in the Reagan administration .
And Michael Turk , e-campaign director for George W. Bush 's reelection campaign , will take a leave of absence from his current job with the National Cable & Telecommunications Association to assist in getting the Thompson website off the ground .
He may continue in a webmaster capacity for the campaign .
George P. Bush , the chief operating officer of a real estate development firm in Fort Worth , Texas , sent the appeal Friday afternoon along with Timothy P. Berry , the firm 's president .
The e-mail closes " Devotedly , " then has both of their signatures .
" Friends and Colleagues , " the e-mail begins .
" We are writing you on behalf of Sen. Fred Thompson to ask for your support as he considers running for president .
As you know , Sen .
Thompson has generated buzz this election cycle because of his likable personality and approachable brand of politics , which , consequently , has attracted tremendous grassroots support of his potential candidacy .
Additionally , his consistent record in public service and sincere vision to pursue a reform - based agenda in Washington , D.C. , has primarily contributed to strong national polling numbers without having even announced . "
George P. Bush was unavailable to discuss the e-mail , although associates confirm its authenticity .
He is a son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and was a popular surrogate for his uncle 's first presidential campaign , drawing comparisons to John F. Kennedy Jr. when he spoke to the Republican National Convention .
Since then , he has served as a clerk for a federal judge , married and become involved in several business and charitable groups .
In March , he joined the Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer .
Using language similar to other appeals for Friends of Fred Thompson , the e-mail continues : " As a ' Friend of Fred Thompson , ' your support will finance Sen .
Thompson 's efforts to test the political waters starting on June 4 , 2007 .
If Sen .
Thompson decides not to seek the presidency , any unspent funds that you contribute will be returned to your attention .
Donations must not exceed federal contribution limits ; therefore , an individual may contribute up to $ 2,300 .
If a joint checking account is used , the total can be $ 4,600 , but both individuals must sign the check .
Corporate and foreign national contributions are prohibited .
It is very important that your check be dated June 4 , 2007 , even if you make out your check before this date . "

The whiners at Fox are apoplectic over the craaaaazy notion that they might be a " biased " against progressives , but it 's no big shocker .
In a normal world , saying " Fox is biased toward Republicans " would be no more controversial than saying " Daily Kos is biased toward Democrats " .
Of course they 're both biased .
But just one of those media outlets has the integrity to be honest about it .
Witness this .
Variety writes a story talking about Fox 's bias problems and efforts to land two more CBC debates ( yup , the issue is n't dead just yet ) .
The story included this line , which was deleted in an update to the story :
Fox is working overtime to sponsor a debate between Democrats , seen as critical to maintaining its ' Fair and Balanced ' mantra and credibly covering the 2008 election .
Why was it deleted ?
Because a
Fox flack probably called threatening unless the line was pulled .
But it 's the truth .
And why is it so important to Fox to pretend it 's something it 's obviously not ?
Because it 's hurting its bottom line .
From the Project for Excellence in Journalism 's State of the News Media 2007 report , we find that Fox has been unable to translate its ( now flagging ratings ) into real ad dollars :
While the numbers are impressive -- particularly Fox News 's financial milestones -- they do not come without questions .
First , Fox News was expected to overtake CNN in profits in 2005 as well , but fell short , so the accuracy of projections remains a question .
The second is more long - term .
With all channels losing audience in 2006 , has the cable industry as a whole -- beyond just news -- begun a downward curve ?
The number of cable households that are subscribers has barely increased in years , inching just 1 % or so every year in the last five .
With no new audience , advertisers are n't paying what they used to .
Cable networks are no longer able to get the significantly higher rates they are accustomed to , and ended up with only a 2 % gain in the 2006 advertising " upfront " period .
In addition , the slowdown in advertising revenue and growth means each network or channel spends more on self - promotion to maintain its position .
Stoller mulls what that all means .
In all likelihood , Fox News has a less profitable and less influential demographic base than CNN , which is why their larger audience is n't translating to higher profits .
Their partisan branding problem is probably something that 's always made them nervous and something they 've always papered over with an aggressive ' Fair and Balanced ' branding campaign ( Air America , which is overt about its ideology , has trouble with advertisers ) .
Witness this community 's efforts targeting advertisers showing up on Ann Coulter 's site .
The last thing an advertiser wants is to be on the receiving end of negative publicity of that sort .
So many of the biggest advertisers avoid any partisan site .
Some who do n't are careful to advertise on both sides of the " aisle " , so to speak , to head off complaints that they 're being partisan .
So if Fox News is strongly branded as a partisan media outlet it hurts its bottom line .
So it 's important for them to get Democrats and the CBC and their retinue of useful Democratic idiots to provide ideological cover .
That 's why the network is so adamant in protecting its " fair and balanced " fiction .
It 's why numerous Fox personalities have blown gaskets , calling us things like " Nazis " and " Stalinists " -- immediately giving us cheap " Goodwin 's Law " victories .
And it 's apt , because they can't defend themselves on the merits .
These past few weeks have been a disaster for Fox .
Their carefully cultivated " fair and balanced " branding efforts have taken a serious hit .
The Democrats are pulling their cover , and the CBC is under intense pressure to do the same .
News story after news story have reinforced the notion that Fox News is a partisan outlet , regardless of their protestations to the contrary .
Their bottom line is at stake , and a cornered animal is the most dangerous of all .
So expect them to amp up the ridiculous rhetoric to even shriller heights .
But fact is we 're winning .
And ultimately , what we demand is quite reasonable :
Fox News should be up front an honest about its biases .
That 's it .
Why is it that enterprise - related news , discussions and analysis in the blogosphere takes such a backseat to the latest over - funded " me too " VC - backed consumer startup that 's got about as much chance of generating a positive IRR as I do of winning the New York marathon ?
Look , we know our place ... we get that for every blogger who likes to talk about enterprise software , global outsourcing , corporate governance and the like , there are roughly 8.3 million blogs ready to dissect the latest YouTube clone , or calendaring tool , or best garage band on MySpace .
But today when I read that Wikipedia deleted the term " Enterprise 2.0 " , I nearly lost my mind .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales describes Wikipedia as :
..." an effort to create and distribute a multilingual free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language . "
OK , a bold doctrine to be sure , and one whereby you could see Wales making the argument that some things are worthy of deletion ( under the " highest possible quality " argument ) .
So maybe there was a good reason for the term Enterprise 2.0 to be deleted ?
Here is the explanation from the editor :
Enterprise 2.0 Neologism of dubious utility .
I can find examples of it's use online but there does n't seem to be a consensus on what it means other than " sort of like Web2.0 , but businessy " Artw 22:23 , 27 June 2006 ( UTC )
OK , so the main issues are :
It 's a neologism
It has " dubious utility " with no consensus of meaning
It 's sort of like Web2.0 but " businessy "
Where should I begin ?
Neologism , by definition , is a word , term , or phrase which has been recently created ( " coined " ) — often to apply to new concepts , or to reshape older terms in newer language form .
Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions , new phenomena , or old idea which have taken on a new cultural context .
" Dubious Utility " ... can the editor who deleted Enterprise 2.0 articulate the utility of the term Web 2.0 ?
What 's the consensus definition of Web 2.0 , I ask ?
Yet , it 's not deigned worthy of deletion , far from it .
That term has been viciously debated , defended , assaulted and dissected and yet , it 's become one of undeniable presence ; so much so that Tim O'Reilly actually service marked the term .
For someone who 's assailing the validity of a neologism , does anyone else find it downright ridiculous that he used the term " businessy ? " in defense of the deletion ?
" Businessy ?!?! ? " ... if that half - cocked neologism is n't a clear indication of just how out of focus the editor is with the business world , I do n't know what more needs to be said .
I know there 's been a fair amount of debate lately regarding Wikipedia and the editing policies ; and up to now I 've stayed out of the fray because , frankly , I did n't care all that much .
But this one has hit close to home .
As much as so many bloggers feel they are part of Web 2.0 in some small way , I am most certainly part of Enterprise 2.0 in my own way ; as are most of my fellow Irregulars and other business - focused bloggers .
Where 's the logic in this deletion ?
Clearly , there are people passionate about the concept :
... and thousands more ; but you get the picture .
Truthfully , if Wikipedia is REALLY about being the ultimate reference source for every human being on the Earth , it should n't matter if ONE or ONE BILLION people care about the term " Enterprise 2.0 . "
But when you realize that it's a term at the epicenter of a lot of creative thought and debate , I 'm incensed that someone so UNFOCUSED on the business world would simply delete the entry .
How is Wikipedia better for the deletion ?
On another note , what 's done is done .
But in the interest of fairness , here are a few items in Wikipedia that need to be deleted as they violate the same criteria that " Enterprise 2.0 " fell victim to :

Will Ferrell Gets Keys To First BMW Hydrogen 7 For Daily Use
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
While its use has mainly been to usher green - minded celebrities to premieres and events , the BMW Hydrogen 7 is finally going to have an owner for more than one night .
Comedian Will Ferrell has been chosen as the first celebrity to take home the vehicle for extended use .
Through the Hydrogen 7 Pioneer Program , BMW plans on handing out additional cars to industry leaders and prominent figures in entertainment , politics , business .
Ferrell is a natural choice as he ’s a committed environmentalist , active supporter of the National Resource Defense Council , and already an owner of hybrid and electric vehicles .
Oh yea , he can also channel the spirit of Ricky Bobby to make this car purr .
Â
Truly , it ’s nice to see someone other than the traditional “ green spotlight ” celebs lead the charge for a new technology .
What ’s so cool about this technology ?
Here ’s a nice summary from Autobloggreen ,
“ Running in hydrogen mode , the BMW Hydrogen 7 essentially emits nothing but water vapor , representing a major step in reducing harmful CO2 emissions .
During the program , 25 of the 100 cars that are produced will be used in evaluation programs in the US .
The BMW Hydrogen 7 is not for sale , but is considered to be a milestone in bringing forward hydrogen as the sustainable fuel for individual transportation . ”
We ’ll keep you updated on who will be next to take the Hydrogen 7 for an extended spin .
While many have their doubts on US transitioning to a hydrogen economy , it ’s great to at least see some headway being made in getting the vehicles out there .
Hit the jump for more .
From the NY Times
( subscription required ) :
" Young women in New York and several of the nation 's other largest cities who work full time have forged ahead of men in wages , according to an analysis of recent census data .
A recent study shows that women of all educational levels from 21 to 30 living in New York City and working full time made 117 percent of men's wages , and even more in Dallas , 120 percent ( see chart above for NYC , 1970 - 2005 , click to enlarge ) . "
Why the pay gap ..... for MEN ?
" Women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men , and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas .
In 2005 , 53 % of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates , compared with only 38 % of men of that age .
And many of those women are not marrying right after college , leaving them freer to focus on building careers . "
MP : Just wondering if Representative Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) , who represents NYC and has long been an advocate of gender equity , will be as concerned about this pay gap for NYC men as she has been when there was a pay gap for women ?
Conservative Christian group calls for Vitter resignation
Will Menaker
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This
As he remains in seclusion over an admission that he used a Washington escort service , Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) is losing the support of his base .
Arguing for " intellectual consistency , " the Louisiana - based group ' Christian Conservatives for Reform ' have called on Senator Vitter to resign following revelations of his numerous trysts with DC escorts and frequent patronage of brothels .
The Rev. Grant Storms explained that , " when Bill Clinton fell ... we said ' resign ' , when William Jefferson was indicted we said ' resign ' , now it 's one of our people , and we need to be consistent and say , ' David , do the right thing and resign . ' "
Vitter 's office has said that he will be returning to Washington for votes in the Senate , but did not specify when we would be back .
Although a colleague has been quoted as saying he would return as early as Tuesday .
The following video is from The Associated Press , released on July 15 .
As you may have figured from that video
Wood posted , we 're big on the alphabet around here these days .
This week I was really getting sick of all the stupid alphabet books we had been reading , so I decided to make my own .
Do n't get me wrong , I am a big fan of Nikki McClure 's Awake to Nap and Michael De Feo's Alphabet City , but despite the latter 's lovely urban scenery , the subject verbiage itself is a bit humdrum for my taste .
Like most alphabet books , the words tend to be either zoological or agricultural .
I wanted to create a book for a kid , like mine , who is growing up in a dirty - ass city and who already knows the names of all the animals in the zoo and in the Big Red Barn .
De Feo ( who did create the beautiful paste - ups for his book ) simply does n't use very many words that are n't that different from those in all of the other alphabet books I 've seen .
The letter N , for example , is represented in De Feo 's book by a nest .
Every alphabet book uses a nest for the letter N. Juniper and I seem to be in agreement that nests are kind of irrelevant .
I feel it is much more important for her to identify other things that start with the letter N , such as ninjas :
Now if our home is ever attacked by a group of numb - chuck - wielding , star - throwing ninjas , Juniper can shout out a warning that could save all our lives .
The same is true for this one :
You traditionalists can teach your kids about all the zebras all you want , but my kid is going to know how to identify a zombie wearing underwear as soon as she sees one .
And anyone who has seen a Romero film knows how important a few seconds of warning can be when fending off zombies .
The same theory works for mummies , pirates , robots , economists , vikings , and yeti .
You wo n't find them in any other alphabet books , but you will find them in ours .
I also threw in some hard words like Gnome and Knight just to mess with her head .
Now I do n't want to hear any bullshit about how my kid is going to need therapy or how I 'm so politically incorrect etc. etc. ad nauseam .
We get plenty of e-mails about that every week .
If you have an inclination to point something like that out , just remember you 're not as clever as you think you are .
Seriously : yawn .
For the past few months whenever I see a painting or a stencil of something that would make a good subject word in an alphabet book , I have snapped a picture .
I have so much gratitude for the amazing artists who are out there creating these beautiful works in our streets for little or no recognition , risking so much just to make our cities a little more colorful and interesting .
In a few days I 'll probably post some pictures on flickr to show how I turned these images into an actual book , but for now if you have any interest in making one yourself , using or adapting any of the images , or just getting a closer look , click on the 4 - paneled jpegs below for high - res downloadable images .
Juniper and I had a lot of fun making this ( I knew which images to choose when she pointed at the screen and said , " who 's THAT guy ? " ) .
Enjoy .

Soldiers , sailors and airforce personnel will not be able to blog , take part in surveys , speak in public , post on bulletin boards , play in multi-player computer games or send text messages or photographs without the permission of a superior if the information they use concerns matters of defence .
They also cannot release video , still images or audio - material which has previously led to investigations into the abuse of Iraqis .
Instead , the guidelines state that " all such communication must help to maintain and , where possible , enhance the reputation of defence " .
The regulations , issued by the Directorate of Communication Planning , come in the wake of the row over the MoD allowing two of the HMS Cornwall sailors held captive in Iran to be paid for their stories .
Receiving money for interviews , conferences and books which draw on official defence experience has now been banned .
The MoD document , circulated last week , covers " all public speaking , writing or other communications , including via the internet and other sharing technologies , on issues arising from an individual 's official business or experience , whether on - duty , off - duty or in spare time " .
The rules have provoked consternation among the ranks , with human rights lawyers saying yesterday that they could be in contravention of Article 10 of the Human Rights Act , which allows for freedom of expression .
The rules apply not only to full - time forces but to members of the Territorial Army and cadets whilst on duty , as well as MoD civil servants .
Service personnel are currently bound by Queen 's Regulations , which mean they must seek permission before speaking to the press but are free to blog and take part in online debates .
However , many have spoken out anonymously on issues such as poor kit , housing and the treatment of wounded service personnel evacuated from combat zones .
Criticism of the RAF in Afghanistan and the state of the ageing vehicles being used there have all appeared in the press .
An unofficial soldiers ' website , arrse.co.uk , was full of angry debate about the issue yesterday .
One poster said : " Why does it not occur to MoD that if it did things properly , and treated its people well , they would n't feel the need to bring things into the public arena quite so often , and they would n't need to spend so much time covering - up ? "
Another suggested that the rules were intended to silence the average " tommy " while senior personnel were free to speak to the media without fear of reprimand .
" Every single leak of significant information to the media , certainly in the last six months , has come from the top down .
Not the other direction , " he said .
" Should Cpl Bloggs , or Major Good Bloke in some Platoon House in downtown Helmand - on - Styx complain in a private letter that he has n't enough ammo to despatch the Queens ' enemies , or the RAF really should try harder to deliver it , it 's ' March in the guilty B*stard ' and ' conduct prejudicial to good order ' and discipline and finger - wagging all round . "
The MoD 's director general of media communications , Simon McDowell , denied that the guidelines were a form of censorship or gagging .
" We are trying to give straightforward , clear guidance that is up to date .
The existing regulations were confusing and did n't include things like accepting payment .
It applies to communicating about defence matters , not personal things .
Particular things can impact on operational security ; information which somebody can get a hold of .
Even a little photograph sent from Afghanistan on a mobile phone could endanger people 's lives and break operational security . "
He added : " It is not gagging .
It is setting out procedures so people know what the rules are . "
Those infringing the rules would be dealt with on a case by case basis , he said .
" There is now far less of a chance of having the kind of mishaps that we had with Iran now there are clear guidelines . "
Mr McDowell said that the MoD was experimenting with authorised blogs from Afghanistan .
It was also seeking " legitimate outlets for people to express themselves " .
Geoffrey Robertson , QC , a leading human rights lawyer , said that the guidelines were likely to contravene the Human Rights Act .
He said they reminded him of the " catch - all " section of the old official secrets act , which made it a criminal offence to disclose information without lawful authority .
The discredited section , which was repealed in 1989 , " stopped soldiers from revealing the brand of tea served in the MoD canteen " , he said .
" It 's increasingly important , given Britain 's escalating foreign troop engagements , often in conjunction with less - disciplined forces , that soldiers , officers and officials can speak frankly to the media about their engagements without having their honest briefing subject to any spin , " Mr Robertson said .
Ministers are overestimating the number of exceptionally bright pupils in Britain 's schools , the World Council for Gifted and Talented Children will be told this week .
Research shows that teachers charged with picking out the top pupils feel that far too many are labelled as ' gifted and talented ' and that the government was wrong to recommend that 10 per cent were picked out in each school , a total of 800,000 across the country .
Instead , between 2 and 5 per cent of children should be classed as ' gifted learners ' , cutting hundreds of thousands of pupils already placed in the top group .
' Teachers said they felt they had to control the number of children in their classroom who are gifted and talented , ' said Dr Thomas Balchin , an academic at Brunel University , who carried out the research with 800 co-ordinators .
' Unfortunately , in many schools , typically the inner-city schools in disadvantaged areas , co-ordinators are convinced they really only have 2 to 4 per cent . '
He added that in some schools , nearer 30 per cent of pupils should be classified as exceptionally able under the same criteria , but many teachers felt under pressure to stick to the 10 per cent recommended by ministers .
While the government asks schools to identify just 5 per cent nationally of the top pupils aged 11 to 19 for membership of a student academy for the gifted , it also asks them to pick out 10 per cent of pupils in each school as ' gifted and talented ' .
In Wales and Scotland teachers go further , choosing 20 per cent .
Balchin's work also looked at problems in the type of children being identified .
Many teachers felt that bright children who were bored in class , misbehaved or did not flourish in traditional lessons were being missed out , despite being extremely gifted .
Others who behaved well and handed work in on time were far more likely to be chosen as talented .
The research will be presented to the council at its annual conference which opens today at Warwick university , the government 's centre for the promotion of the country 's bright children , attended by academics from more than 50 countries .
Many will disagree with Balchin 's call to cut down the numbers classified as gifted and talented .
' Why only identify 2 to 5 per cent ? ' said Johanna Raffan , chair of the programme committee for the conference .
' Ten per cent may seem a blunt measure , but by being told to identify 10 per cent , schools have to address this issue . '
Professor Deborah Eyre , director of the government 's Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth , said : ' Wherever one draws the dividing line is entirely artificial .
The only reason is a resource issue - if you are going to target additional resources , you need to draw a line at where the resources are available . '
But others argued that there were not the resources to meet the needs of 10 per cent .
' I am a passionate supporter of the gifted and talented , ' said Sir Cyril Taylor , a leading government adviser .
' But if you are doubling the numbers , where is the budget ?
Are you trying to get schools to spend their own money ?'
Taylor argued that providing extra support must be accountable , so pupils who are identified should be expected to get three As at A - level , which is not a realistic goal for 10 per cent of pupils in each school .
Other experts recommended a different approach .
Professor Joan Freeman , a psychologist working with able children , said that pupils should be able to voluntarily sign up for extra classes .
Meanwhile , Belle Wallace , a consultant on gifted education , will present research on a study she has been carrying out with schools that not only identified 10 per cent of pupils as gifted and talented , but also highlighted a ' shadow group ' who could move into the top category at any time .
' We have to keep an open - door policy because intelligence and talent are not fixed , ' she said .
Edwards : Bush 's Iraq / September 11 remarks ' border on the delusional ' Nick Juliano

Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards slammed President Bush for connecting insurgents in Iraq with the terrorists who attacked the US on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The former Democratic senator said that the president 's remarks " border on the delusional , " and accused him of ignoring his own key role in allowing al Qaeda to gain strength in Iraq .
" The president 's remarks today defending his Iraq policy without regard to actual facts border on the delusional , " Edwards said in a statement released Thursday , hours after a Bush press conference .
" The president claimed that the same people attacking U.S. troops today are the ones who perpetrated 9/11 . "
Speaking to reporters in the newly opened White House briefing room , Bush defended his war strategy and continued to conflate the war in Iraq with the terror attacks that brought down the World Trade Center .
" The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11th , " Bush said .
Edwards said that assertion ignores recent history , and the fact that there was no relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda prior to US troops invading .
" It must be nice to live in a world where your actions have no consequences , " he said .
" There was no group called Al Qaeda in Iraq before the president 's disastrous mismanagement of the war gave them a foothold , a fact the president flagrantly ignores . "
Democrats in the Senate this week are debating a Pentagon funding bill to which they are attaching measures aimed at reducing the US presence in Iraq .
Keying off an interim report issued today that shows the Iraqi government is meeting less than half is required benchmarks for political progress , war critics are saying now is the time to begin bringing troops home .
" We 've been told over and over again we can't expect a military victory in Iraq ; it will take a political victory for us to finally see stability , " Sen .
Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , said at a Capitol Hill press conference Thursday .
" And yet , as the benchmark assessment reports tell us , there 's little evidence of political progress in Iraq today , and certainly more violence and more death . "
Sen. Hillary Clinton , the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination , said Bush 's report was an attempt to " put the best face on a failed strategy . "
" Even the President 's own portrait cannot paint over the reality on the ground : our strategy in Iraq is failing , " Clinton said in a prepared statement .
Sens. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , and Jack Reed , D - R.I. , have introduced an amendment this week that would begin a drawdown of US forces within four months with a goal of having only a limited US presence in Iraq by April 31 , 2008 .
That amendment has drawn support from some Republicans , including Maine Sen .
Olympia Snowe , as public opinion continues to turn against President Bush 's strategy in Iraq .
Tying the war in Iraq to the hunt for al Qaeda , Sen. John D. Rockefeller , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee , said invading Iraq prevented the US from " finishing them off when we had the chance in 2002 and 2003 . "
He pinned the blame for reports of al Qaeda 's increasing strength firmly on the decision to continue occupying Iraq .
 If we really want to protect our homeland and our citizens from attack , we must end our involvement in the Iraqi civil war and refocus on destroying the al Qaida organization that still wants to attack us here at home ,  Rockefeller said .
President Bush indicated that he would continue his policy of vetoing any Congressional measure that attempted to establish a deadline for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
At a White House press conference , a reporter asked Bush if he was still " committed to vetoing " any deadlines .
" You mean in this interim period ?
Yeah , " Bush said .
" I do n't think Congress ought to be running the war .
I think they ought to be funding our troops . "
Bush insisted that he was " interested in their opinion " and would continue to work with Congress , but Bush said he hoped an amendment that would have nearly all troops out of Iraq by the end of April does not pass the Senate .
The only way Congress will be able to end the war , Bush implied , would be to cut off funding for the military mission .
" Congress has all the right in the world to fund .
That 's their main involvement in this war , which is to provide funds for our troops , " Bush said .
" What you 're asking is whether or not Congress ought to be basically determining how troops are positioned .
... I do n't think that would be good for the country . "
