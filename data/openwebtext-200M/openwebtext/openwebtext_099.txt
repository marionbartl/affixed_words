I read something heartfelt and damning today that reminded me of stories my Dad used to tell .
Today would have been his 78th birthday , but the Alzheimer ’s finally got him just after his 77th .
Mr. Touré and Mr. Compaoré , the authors of that article , are the Presidents , respectively , of Mali and Burkina Faso .
Most readers will know little of these countries except that they are African and poor ; their article explains one of the reasons they stay poor , and the remarkably simple and painless way we could make that problem go away .
There ’s no nice way to say this :
The world ’s richest countries are deliberately , and as a matter of policy , promoting poverty and starvation in the world ’s poorest countries .
Here ’s how I found out about it .
My Dad was a farm boy who got his Ph.D. in Agriculture , specializing in Crop Production and Plant Breeding .
He spent his working life in the Third World : Lebanon , Jordan , Morocco , Tanzania , and Zambia ( in that order ) .
In his African postings , he was working on bringing lessons from the “ Green Revolution ” to African food production .
Grow It , Ca n’t Sell
It ·
When we talked about it , he would mention two big problems .
The first was that some modern agricultural techniques just did n’t work that well in African conditions , so they had to learn as they taught .
The more serious problem was that once they got some wheat production going , they discovered they could n’t sell it , because the imported wheat from the developed world was cheaper .
Cheaper , not because of the actual cost of production , but cheaper because rich - country governments throw subsidies by the bucketload at their own agriculture sectors .
Messrs .
Touré and Compaoré have numbers : “ In the period from 2001 to 2002 , America ’s 25,000 cotton farmers received more in subsidies — some $ 3 billion — than the entire economic output of Burkina Faso , where two million people depend on cotton . ”
Their whole article focuses on cotton , but the same pattern occurs across the spectrum of agriculture .
This is craziness , bad craziness ; those countries in Africa have warm climates , lots of sunshine , and cheap ( starving in some cases ) labour .
We should bloody well be buying cotton and wheat and butter from them , not the other way around , saving ourselves big money while helping them on the long hard climb out of poverty .
How Did It Happen ? ·
All over the Western world , people living in the country have bigger heavier votes than those in the cities .
This is partly due to the electoral structures lagging behind the huge , steady shift of population from farm to city in recent generations .
But it ’s also a matter of fairness ; there are so few people left on the farm that if electoral weight was distributed purely on the basis of population , they ’d be cut out of the system almost entirely .
But the effect is , when politicians are looking for a way to buy elections , throwing money at the farm sector is a remarkably efficient way to do it on a cost - per - vote basis .
Lethal Sentimentality ·
But there ’s more to it than that ; in the European Union and North America , the lobbyists for farm subsidies play the nostalgia card , imploring us to do what it takes to keep a way of life from vanishing .
This plays on the fact that quite a few people have a sort of vague urban angst and think that somehow the honest farmer deserves special treatment .
My own mother , a resident of Saskatchewan , has become quite heated when I suggest that we should drop all agricultural subsidies tomorrow and if the Prairies empty , then they empty .
“ Are you willing to toss a whole profession on the trash - heap ? ” she demands .
Well , you know , it happens .
Buggy - whip makers , data - entry clerks , and stenographers are all distinguished by their absence these days .
I do n’t see why farming , as a profession , deserves to be protected when others are n’t .
The Ugly Side · Maybe it ’s that I know a little too much about farming ; I ’ve lived on a farm and have farms in the family .
There ’s nothing sentimental or heart - warming about modern industrial agriculture , and a high proportion of the Western world ’s subsidies go straight to large corporations , not to individual farmers .
But corporate or individual , the farming business these days — in particular animal farming — is more horrifying than heart - warming .
Animals dosed with antibiotics as weight - gain agents , fed with the rendered flesh of other animals , crowded and stressed past the possibility of health ( those antibiotics let you push harder ) .
All this is regulated of course , and the farmers push right up to the very edge of what the rules allow , and beyond .
I have seen this .
I ’m a little closer to the biz than most city - dwillers , and I ’m sorry , pouring money into it while potentially cheaper producers are stuck in starvation in the third world seems to me like unadulterated evil .
The pro-subsidy arguments can get weird .
I remember a conversation with a Swiss friend — they subsidize like crazy too — and he explained to me that if they stopped coddling the farmers , there ’d be nobody left to take care of those lovely mountain valleys .
Hmm , it seems to me that those valleys were there well before Homo Sapiens and are likely to survive us , and actually I suspect that they will recover faster than we expect from the collatoral environmental damage from Agribusiness .
Going Hungry ? ·
The single silliest argument for going on shoveling money into agriculture is the notion that we need to be self - sufficient in food .
Hmm , last time I checked we were n’t self - sufficient in cars or oil or music or wine or cameras , and we manage to get along .
Why is food so special ?
We ’re living in a capitalist economy , which has its drawbacks , but also has the huge advantage that if something is needed but is n’t being produced , someone will start producing it .
So , What Happens ? ·
What would happen if the rich part of the world abolished agricultural subsidies and trade barriers tomorrow ?
There ’s only one sane answer : we do n’t know .
The history of trade liberalization has seen some industries vanish with their protective barriers , and others innovate and prosper .
I suspect that there ’s a huge market for agriculture that focuses on quality , flavor , and purity .
When was the last time you bought a tomato in a supermarket that you could actually taste , and would you pay more for one ?
Here in Vancouver , which is not that large a city , there are a dozen different organic - foods and quality - foods outlets , all apparently doing just fine .
Yes , the stuff they sell costs more than at the supermarket , but then again it tastes better .
And if the industry did shrink , and some parts of the Prairie went back to the eternally - waving grasses , and some valleys in Switzerland were filled in by forests ; well , would that be such a bad thing ?
Particularly if at the same time the African basket - cases were struggling from the ground to their knees and maybe their feet , and we were paying less for commodity foods at the supermarket , and saving a few bucks on taxes .
What ’s happening now is evil , just evil .
The UK Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) plans to release its classified files regarding UFO sightings to the public .
According to an article in yesterday 's Guardian , the MoD will publish its files dating back to 1967 " within weeks " , following the French government 's decision to do so in March .
David Clarke , a lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University and author of Flying Saucerers : A Social History of UFOlogy , reckoned that opening the MoD 's files could calm down the conspiracy theorists .
" The more of this stuff that they put on their website or put in the national archives , the less it will cost the taxpayer , because at the moment people are writing in about individual incidents and they are having to respond , " he told the Guardian .
In fact , it seems unlikely that any true conspiracy theorist worth his tinfoil hat would be pacified by anything short of spaceships and dead aliens on display in the Science Museum - and even then there would surely be some asserting that the real good stuff was being kept hidden .
In particular , a lot of people believe that the UK's version of Area 51 / Roswell took place at Rendlesham Forest in 1980 .
The MoD has already made available reams of old bumf covering the incident , much of which is splendid conspiracy fodder : mysterious glowing objects , farm animals going into a frenzy , curious depressions left in the ground .
And - aha !
- cameras recording the air - defence radar picture were switched off at the time .
If that 's not evidence of a secret government conspiracy , we do n't know what is .
Even better , there is talk of heightened radiation levels in the forest .
It 's hard to imagine any new documentation convincing people that nothing happened there .
If the MoD is lucky it might see a slight drop in Freedom of Information Act requests and general time wasting , but quite likely not .
As the Air Staff officer who handles such requests revealed last year , the level of public interest in UFOs is much more affected by the film industry than it is by anything that the MoD or ( presumably ) even the aliens may get up to . ®
Bush 's days of secrecy are over
Posted Saturday , March 24 , 2007 1:15 am
Saturday , March 24
The Bush administration has been the most secretive in history .
Even Richard Nixon pales before George W. Bush when it comes to clamping down on public disclosure .
The White House has been able to get away with it for six years thanks to a compliant , rubber stamp Republican Congress .
But now the Democrats are in control of the House and Senate and they are n't afraid to start demanding administration accountability .
The White House can invoke the right of executive privilege all it wants , but none of its claims can pass legal muster .
White House spokesman Tony Snow can claim that it's " unprecedented " and " highly unusual in any White House " for presidential advisors to be called by subpoena by Congress to testify .
But Snow is wrong .

According to the Congressional Research Service , 31 of President Clinton 's top aides testified under oath to Congress on 47 different occasions , including his closest advisors -- George Stephanopoulos , Harold Ickes and John Podesta , legal counsels Bruce Lindsey and Beth Nolan and national security advisor Sandy Berger .
By contrast , the only Bush advisor to testify before Congress during his first term was homeland security chief Tom Ridge .
While Clinton did not refuse any invitations for his aides to testify , Bush has refused three times -- making him the first president since Nixon to do so .

Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Calif , chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee , also pointed out that when his committee was run by Indiana Republican Dan Burton , it issued 1,052 subpoenas between 1997 and 2002 , demanding testimony from Democratic Party or Clinton administration officials .
Snow might think people have forgotten the blizzard of subpoenas and the myriad of investigations launched by Republicans against the Clinton administration in the 1990s .
He might try to make it seem that what Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , is asking for is unreasonable .
But the game is over for the Bush White House .
The days of being able to dictate the terms on when , where and how it will deliver information to Congress are over .
Leahy wants senior political advisor Karl Rove and other top Bush aides to testify under oath before his committee about what may have been the politically motivated firings of eight federal prosecutors by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .

As a former state 's attorney , Leahy is smart enough to know that the only testimony that means anything in a court of law is testimony made on the record under oath .
What the White House wants -- a closed - door chat with no transcripts , no oaths and no accountability -- is as Leahy rightly called it , " nothing , nothing , nothing . "
The White House knows this .
They can , and do , lie with impunity on just about every subject .
But there is a big difference between lying to a reporter and lying to a congressional committee under oath .
The former is just lying , while the latter is perjury .
We hope the Judiciary Committee resists compromise with the administration .
Congress has a duty to perform oversight on the executive branch , a duty that was neglected until the Democrats won back control .
The only way that the wall of secrecy that has surrounded every act of the Bush White House can be breached is through the power of subpoena .
If President Bush wants to challenge this principle in court , he is welcome to .
If legal precedent is a guide , he is not likely to prevail .
Kucinich blasts ' minimum wage for maximum blood ' report Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) delivered a blistering speech on the House floor today in response to an Associated Press report that " the latest Iraq Supplemental funding plan , incredibly , will tie an increase in the minimum wage to funding the war through October . "
Earlier today , Anne Flaherty reported for the AP that " the next war spending bill most likely will fund military operations and not demand a timeline to bring troops home , although it will contain other restrictions on Bush 's Iraq policies , " including so - called " benchmarks " that the Iraqi government will be expected to reach .
" The Democrats ' new bill also was expected to include the first federal minimum wage increase in more than a decade , a top priority for the Democrats who took control of Congress in January , " Flaherty continued .
" White House officials have said Bush was amenable to accepting an increase in the minimum wage , although they and key GOP lawmakers favor larger tax cuts to accompany the measure . "
Kucinich said in response , " If this is true , and I hope it is not , it tells American workers that the only way they will get an increase in wages is to continue to support funding the war which is taking the lives of their sons and daughters . "
" First blood for oil , " Kucinich continued .
" Now a minimum wage for maximum blood .
Are n't the American people giving enough blood for this war without having to give more to have a wage increase ? "
Kucinich asked , " What 's happened to our country ?
We are losing our moral compass .
We 're losing our sense of justice .
We 're losing touch with the difference between right and wrong . "
" We do not have to fund this war , " the 2008 Democratic presidential candidate added .
" We must leave Iraq now .
Support our troops and bring them home .
HR 1234 is a plan to end the war and stabilize Iraq and give Iraqis control of their oil .
We must take a new path .
We must take a path of truth and justice . "
We hear a lot about violence in video games being to blame for all the ills besetting the youth of today .
Now , a Thai games developer has decided it is time to right the balance and has developed a snappily titled Ethics Game to teach youngsters about being good , decent and teetotal .
The game is based around the five precepts of Buddhism : do not kill , do not steal , do not commit adultery , do not lie , and do not drink alcohol .
It follows three children on a pilgrimage with a wise old monk .
The players have to deal with problems and obstacles along the way , but in a way which is consistent with the teachings of the Buddha .
Normal game playing behaviour - shooting stuff , hurting animals , and so on - will cost the player points .
Pakorn Tancharoen , a senior officer in Thailand 's Religious Affairs Department , explains that he became concerned about the moral impact of gaming when he heard about a boy who attacked his mum when she would n't pay for an online gaming session for him .
He told Thai paper The Nation : " It is impossible to stop kids from playing games or flocking to online - game arcades .
So , let them play , but play good games . "
Faced with a shortage of " good games " , he set about developing his own .
He worked in his spare time at first , hanging out at game arcades after work and watching what the kids were into .
Then he involved the kids in designing the characters who would go on the pilgrimage he devised .
When the project was approved , he found a gaming firm to develop and launch it .
He said : " They said they had been hired to produce so many violent games , they saw this as a chance to make amends . "
The game can be downloaded here .
Being able to read the Thai language will be an advantage , and is not one we have , so we can't vouch for it actually being any fun . ®
You should probably buy a shredder today .
I get a heck of a lot of credit card applications in the mail .
A bunch for Visa , quite a few from Mastercard and tons of them from American Express .
I almost always tear credit card applications in half and throw them away .
Sometimes , if I am feeling particularly paranoid , I 'll tear them into little bitty pieces .
Is that good enough ?
Could a determined and dexterous criminal gather all the bits , tape them together and apply for a credit card in my name ?
Would a credit card company balk when confronted with an obviously resurrected application ?
A test was in order , and when the latest application arrived from Chase Mastercard , I was equal to the task .
The ice - giant Gliese 436 is 30 light years from Earth
The finds were among 37 objects seen orbiting distant stars by a US and Anglo - Australian team in the last year .
Other objects reported by the group , at an American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu , included five failed stars , known as brown dwarfs .
The finds increase the total number of known exoplanets to 236 , more than half of which were discovered by the team .
" The more we look , the more we find planets , " said Professor Tinney of the University of New South Wales , head of the Australian part of the Anglo - Australian Planet Search .
" Super - Earth "
Among the finds were at least four multiple - planetary systems .
All of the planets were so - called gas giants , similar to Jupiter , with no solid surface .
" Something like 10 to 15 % of stars host gas giants , " said Professor Tinney .
" A larger fraction of stars may host planets too small for us to detect . "
These could include Earth - sized objects , which could harbour life .
The smallest exoplanet discovered orbits Gliese 581
Earlier this year , scientists using the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) 3.6 m
Telescope in Chile discovered the smallest exoplanet - as astronomers call planets that orbit a star other than the Sun - yet .
The " super - Earth " orbited the faint star Gliese 581 , 20.5 light - years away in the constellation Libra .
Its radius was just 1.5 times that of the Earth .
Intriguingly , the planet could have liquid water on its surface , a key ingredient of life .
It was discovered using a sensitive instrument that can measure tiny changes in the velocity of a star as it experiences the gravitational tug of a nearby planet .
It was the same method used to detect the latest batch of extra solar planets .
According to Dr Jason Wright of the University of California , Berkeley , one of the members of the US California and Carnegie Planet Search , the technique has become more sophisticated , improving detection rates dramatically .
" We 're just now getting to the point where , if we were observing our own Solar System from afar , we would be seeing Jupiter , " he said .
These techniques allow scientists to detect changes in the motion of stars as small as one metre per second .
Astronomers are stuck with such indirect methods of detection because current telescope technology struggles to image very distant and faint objects - especially when they orbit close to the glare of a star .
Ice planet
The discovery of the 28 new planets has given astronomers new targets to analyse in more detail .
For example , a planet discovered two years ago has already yielded a mass of " extraordinarily rich " information , according to Professor Geoff Marcy of the University of California , Berkeley .
Circling the star Gliese 436 , 30 light years from Earth , was an ice - giant planet that was calculated by Swiss and Belgian scientists to be at least 22 Earth masses , slightly larger than the mass of Neptune .
Their studies had also revealed its density .
" It must be 50 % rock and about 50 % water , with perhaps small amounts of hydrogen and helium , " said Professor Marcy .
" This planet has the interior structure of a hybrid super - Earth / Neptune , with a rocky core surrounded by a significant amount of water compressed into solid form at high pressures and temperatures . "
However , the planet is not thought to be capable of supporting life .

Enter the Academy Awards .
Some years it ’s great and other years David Letterman hosts .
That ’s part of the fun and one reason an average of nearly 45 million viewers tune in every year — we crave the potential to catch Madonna yelling at the sound tech after her microphone failed to emerge from the floor ; we love the behind - the - scenes stories of Russell Crowe intentionally mucking the names of best actress nominees ; we revel in Tom Hanks ’ unintentional outing of his high school drama teacher ; we merrily cringe at Antonio ’s atonal duet with Santana .
What will happen this year ?
Who knows , but we hope it will be memorable — for better or for worse !
And that ’s generally what this equation measures : how high were dramatic expectations and were they met ?

Iraq was about many things , supporters of the war intone .
The fact that no WMD were discovered is irrelevant .
President George W. Bush , Vice President Richard Cheney , and a host of Republican ( and many Democratic ) legislators solemnly proclaim that knowing what they know now they would go to war all over again .
Why ?
It was important to “ drain the swamp , ” even if there were no alligators .
After all , plenty of other unsavory creatures haunted the muck .
Saddam Hussein had violated all sorts of UN resolutions , threatening the international organization ’s credibility .
And democracy had to be spread .
Hussein was a murderer , the Iraqi people deserved to be liberated .
Never mind America ’s national interest : there was a humanitarian imperative to intervene .
It sounds very attractive .
In fact , the most appealing argument for invading and conquering another nation is precisely this one : war is awful , but is the lesser of moral evils when it is the only means to save lives .
That the Republican Party has become the party of humanitarian intervention is ironic .
After all , Woodrow Wilson , the great proponent of war to end war and spread democracy , long was a liberal icon criticized by conservatives for his disregard of U.S. interests and international realities .
His misguided decision to enter World War I and his incompetent negotiation at the Versailles peace conference led to World War II .
The GOP was skeptical of humanitarian warmaking less than a decade ago , when President Bill Clinton took America into war with Serbia , a small state that had threatened neither the U.S. nor any of its allies .
Thuggish Slobodan Milosevic was , but dangerous to anyone but those who were in  or were attempting to secede from  his own nation he was not .
Then - House Majority Leader Tom Delay ( R - Texas ) famously called the conflict “ Bill Clinton ’s war . ”
In 2003 , however , the Bush administration , with the congressional Republican Party in tow , dressed in full warrior garb .
If you did n’t believe that Saddam Hussein was more dangerous than Hitler , armed with nuclear weapons , unmanned aerial vehicles capable of hitting America , and massive stocks of biological weapons , no matter : it was America ’s duty to take him out because he was a killer .
Whether the president and his supporters were sincere is hard to know .
After all , there are many ugly regimes around the world .
Republicans had n’t seemed terribly concerned about mass slaughter in Rwanda , bloody civil war in Liberia , a bitter Kurdish insurgency in Turkey , years of conflict in Sudan , a horrific civil war that killed millions in the Congo , decades of brutal repression in Burma , or a host of other conflicts , including the Kosovo insurgency .
In these cases , the GOP ’s passion for the helpless and dying was strangely absent .
Any commitment to safeguarding Iraqis was well - concealed before 9/11 .
Had the administration been focused on saving Iraqi lives , the president should have asked the Pentagon to begin drafting war plans on the afternoon of Jan. 20 , 2001 , or the morning of Jan. 21 , at the latest .
After all , lives were at stake : if the administration believed the U.S. had to go to war to save Iraqis , why did it wait more than two years to liberate them ?
The only logical conclusion is that administration officials were n’t particularly interested in suffering Iraqis , and that humanitarianism was primarily a politically popular gloss for a war that the president was determined to undertake for other reasons .
Finding an alternative justification was particularly important when it became evident that Hussein had no WMD .
So much for the smoking mushroom cloud with which then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice attempted to scare the public .
Still , the argument is not necessarily illegitimate because of the administration ’s rank hypocrisy .
Hussein was a tyrant ; Human Rights
Watch figures between 250,000 and 290,000 people died under his regime .
He also started two wars  though , frankly , few Americans shed many tears for Iran , and the Ronald Reagan administration , represented by special envoy Donald Rumsfeld , cheerfully aided Hussein in that conflict .
Yet humanitarian intervention traditionally has been envisioned as stopping ongoing genocide , or at least mass slaughter .
In March 2003 , Hussein was oppressing his people , but not killing THAT many of them .
One can argue that the West should have previously stopped him from cracking down on the Kurds , crushing the Shi’ite insurgency , and embarking upon other murderous expeditions .
But those campaigns were long over and the resulting mass graves were long overgrown .
However attractive the prospect of bringing him to justice , doing so did not warrant going to war .
Again , humanitarianism looks to be an administration afterthought , a PR tactic to win support for the invasion rather than a serious rationale for action .
At the time Washington embarked upon the Iraq war , its ally Saudi Arabia was probably killing as many people as was Iraq .
But the ruling Saudis were routinely feted in Washington and offered the hospitality of George W. Bush ’s Texas ranch .
Nevertheless , assume a moral justification for loosing the dogs of war .
Has the Iraq war turned out to be a humanitarian venture ?
Alas , this case grows weaker by the day .
The justification for humanitarian intervention is fundamentally utilitarian .
More people will live than die as a result .
Given the uncertainties of war , one can never be sure about a war ’s result .
This is the reason why few people believe America should have attacked either the Soviet Union or the People ’s Republic of China during the Cold War .
There were many lives to be saved , many more than were at stake in Iraq .
However , the catastrophic consequences of global war were too great to risk .
Humanitarian intervention is more commonly advocated for governmental basket cases with little or no serious military capability .
Even Yugoslavia in 1999 could offer only minimal resistance when it faced the world ’s greatest military alliance .
Other targets are usually despotic Third World dictatorships or failed states with a disorganized or absent state .
Even then , humanitarian intervention results in an uncomfortably utilitarian calculus .
Some people who otherwise would live 
American soldiers , coalition forces , enemy combatants , foreign civilians  will die .
Are their deaths okay because many others will live ?
The challenge is particularly important in terms of U.S. government policy .
The lives of Americans are of no greater moral value than those of other people .
However , Washington is responsible to its own citizens : they fund its operations , man its military , are accountable for its actions , and expect its protection .
The nation - state ’s responsibility to guard their interests includes the lives of its fighting men and women .
They are not pawns to be sacrificed in a global chess game , and their lives should not be forfeit when policymakers , especially those happily insulated from the rigors and risks of combat , seek to promote objectives largely irrelevant to the interests of the Americans whose protection is the fundamental objective of government .
If it seems extreme to say that one life is too many to sacrifice no matter how many would be saved , surely it is not unreasonable to say that the risk of even one death requires that decisions be made seriously , not frivolously , and that the costs and risks to Americans be weighed very heavily .
It is not right , morally or practically , to attempt to turn 18 - year - old U.S. soldiers into guardians of distant outposts in a new global empire , even if such an enterprise is advanced in glowing moral terms .
But for a moment assume that humanitarian intervention is justified so long as more are saved than die , or substantially more , anyway .
Then does Iraq qualify ?
Never mind the supposed good intentions and the manifold might - have - beens .
The death of 100 or more Iraqis every day means the death of 100 Iraqis who would have lived had the allies not invaded .
What moral calculus can justify this ongoing human tradeoff ?
Indeed , the more one looks at Iraq , the more one doubts the invasion ’s moral justification .
For an argument that is largely utilitarian , the place to start is American casualties .
The 2,800 deaths and 21,000 wounded are sobering indeed .
( A third of those wounded died in the Vietnam War ; thankfully , medical and technological advances have lowered mortality rates in Iraq . )
Nor is there any reason to believe that the toll will fall dramatically anytime soon .
Reported MSNBC in mid-October : “ U.S. military casualties have surged in Iraq in recent weeks , with U.S. troops engaging in perilous urban sweeps to curb sectarian violence in Baghdad while facing unrelenting violence elsewhere . ”
Ending these sweeps will lower U.S. casualties , but leave Iraqi violence free to rise even further .
And the number of dead Iraqis raises particularly profound doubts as to the humanitarian justification of the conflict .
No one knows for sure how many Iraqis have died , but the toll is high and growing .
President Bush recently acknowledged 30,000 , a significant admission for someone who has steadfastly avoided mentioning the slightest hint of bad news in Iraq .
The British group Iraq Body Count , which attempts to keep track of reported deaths , comes in at 44,000 to 49,000 deaths .
Gen. George Casey , the U.S. commander in Iraq , points to a high - end estimate of 50,000 .
A Pentagon report expected out in November reportedly says 60,000 .
With its Iraqi Index , the Brookings Institution estimates 61,000 deaths .
Any of these numbers should give pause even to an avid interventionist .
However , they all probably are low .
The Iraqi Health Ministry figures 150,000 .
The Washington Times , which has consistently editorialized in favor of the war , cites the estimate of 128,000 dead between the war ’s start and July 2005 from the Iraqi group Iraqiyun .
Notes the Times , “ extrapolated to the present , the figure would be in the high 100,000s or low 200,000s . ”
Finally , a new study out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health ( and a doctor from the School of Medicine at Baghdad ’s al - Mustansiriya University ) figures 655,000 deaths since March 2003 ( with a range from 393,000 to 943,000 ) .
The number of violent deaths is pegged at 601,000 , ranging between 426,000 and 794,000 .
These numbers are shocking , even horrifying , and were understandably seized upon by war opponents .
If this report is accurate , who could deny that the war has been a moral as well as strategic disaster ?
The study ’s methodology is time - tested , and the researchers argue that many deaths occur outside of Baghdad , where most reporters , NGOs , and U.S. officials are based .
Still , the sample size , wartime conditions , and estimated prewar death rate all have been challenged .
Indeed , the results are hard to believe  not hard to believe that so many people could die in a conflict , but hard to believe that so many people have died in this war .
Absent the use of nuclear weapons , it takes a lot of effort to kill hundreds of thousands of people , and murderous kidnappings , revenge killings , incidental wounding from military actions and errant bombings , and similar deaths would n’t seem to add up so .
Moreover , it is difficult to believe that so many additional deaths would not have been noticed .
But the sobering nature of the conclusion warrants closer study .
Whatever the exact toll so far , it is steadily growing .
As sectarian strife has worsened , the daily tally has come to average about 100 , with fears that it is more likely to increase than decrease .
For instance , murder by death squads has trebled since February .
The U.S. military acknowledges that its much - ballyhooed strategy of reinforced patrolling in Baghdad has done little to slow the killing .
Stated Gen. Casey in mid-October , “ The levels of violence over the last few weeks are as high as they have been . ”
The Pentagon is talking about maintaining current troop levels until 2010 .
If sectarian strife remains high for that long , tens of thousands more Iraqis will die .
And all these deaths are occurring in a population that is less than one - tenth the size of America .
The equivalent toll in America would be hundreds of thousands or even millions .
But the U.S. - led coalition has done more than loose the forces of death .
It has ripped away the thin veneer of order that gave Iraqis a sense of security if not liberty in Hussein ’s Iraq .
Iraqis now face not just the risk of death , but pervasive fear .
Normal family , community , civic , and political life has become increasingly difficult , if not impossible .
For instance , it is not just notable politicians who risk death .
Journalists , barbers , and even garbagemen are regularly killed .
The latter are targeted by insurgents seeking to prevent the discovery of explosives hidden in the trash .
Businessmen and bureaucrats alike are kidnapped and held for ransom ; Shia and Sunni are kidnapped to be killed because they are Shia and Sunni .
Nor is it enough to murder : many if not most bodies these days are found with evidence of torture , including the use of drills .
The destruction of the economic and social infrastructure that remained after a decade of sanctions is causing more hardship .
The lack of stable services can kill .
The Johns Hopkins study observes , “ Aside from violence , insufficient water supplies , nonfunctional sewerage , and restricted electricity supply also create health hazards .
A deteriorating health service with insecure access and the flight of health professionals adds further risks . ”
Many Iraqis have simply fled the bloody chaos .
In early October , Iraqi Immigration Minister Abdul - Samad Sultan announced that about 890,000 Iraqis had gone to Iran , Jordan , and Syria , and another 300,000 Iraqis had moved within Iraq , since March 2003 .
Many of those leaving are Christians , victims of virulent religious persecution that was almost entirely absent under Saddam Hussein .
The administration and its supporters spent most of the last three years attempting to downplay the increasing cost being paid by Iraqis .
Members of the war lobby have chattered about all of the good news that is n’t being reported , including  seriously  harbors dredged , grants provided , city trash collected , and “ exploding ” cell phone use .
But at last even President Bush seems to realize that denying the obvious makes him look ludicrous .
His administration ’s fallback is simply to deny that the bloodshed is America ’s fault .
“ The coalition takes enormous precautions to prevent civilian deaths and injuries , ” says military spokesman Lt. Col.
Mark Ballesteros .
Similarly , argues Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman , “ We take great precautions in our military operations .
That ’s in stark contrast to what the enemy in Iraq is doing .
They take no such precautions .
In fact , they deliberately target innocent civilians in their attacks . ”
It is true that the U.S. does attempt to minimize civilian casualties .
That is not the case with the Iraqi jihadists .
Still , civilian deaths are inevitable , and Washington cannot escape responsibility for them .
Cars filled with civilians speeding toward military checkpoints are riddled with bullets ; aerial bombing raids fail to distinguish between insurgent and civilian .
Early occupation policy routinely mistreated and humiliated those caught in military sweeps .
Abu Ghraib demonstrated that Americans , too , were capable of abuse .
Moreover , the administration is ultimately responsible for the Iraqi government it has created .
The problem is not that the former is imperfect .
The problem is that factions within it are using state power to commit murder and mayhem .
Last fall , Iyad Allawi , the secularist chosen by the U.S. to be the first post - Hussein prime minister , claimed that “ People are doing the same as [ in ]
Saddam ’s time and worse . ”
That ’s surely an exaggeration , but Allawi had a point : “ We are hearing about secret police , secret bunkers where people are being interrogated .
A lot of Iraqis are being tortured or killed in the course of interrogations .
We are even witnessing Sharia courts based on Islamic law that are trying people and executing them . ”
The Iraqi government is permeated by sectarian combatants .
The police , in particular , are widely suspect in the calculated murder of Sunnis .
The Interior Ministry recently purged some officials in an attempt to restore balance , but few believe the policy will be effective .
Even hospitals have become a killing ground : the health ministry is controlled by Moqtada al - Sadr ’s forces , and Sunni patients have been routinely kidnapped and killed .
There has been much frustration expressed toward the inadequacies of the Iraqi government .
President Bush says he is “ vexed ” by the ongoing conflict .
Yet , as Ivan Eland of the Independent Institute asks , “ if the best military in world history cannot disarm militias and pacify Iraq , how does the U.S. government expect the inexperienced Iraqi security forces to do so ? ”
Moreover , there is a certain chutzpah in such expectations .
After all , it was the U.S. invasion that spawned an insurgency , attracted jihadist terrorists , and unleashed sectarian war .
And it was a series of mistakes after Hussein ’s overthrow  failing to provide security , imposing a heavy - handed occupation , creating mass unemployment among the army and bureaucracy  that accelerated the rise of violent opposition .
That the Bush administration wanted none of this matters not .
It was entirely predictable , and , indeed , was predicted by many analysts .
But for the decision for war , none of the ongoing violence would be occurring .
But for the blundering afterwards , the ongoing violence would not be as great .
The administration ’s war of choice has pushed Iraq off a cliff into an abyss of unknown depth , and today we can only watch in horror , wondering how far it will fall .
Perhaps most fundamental to the question of humanitarian intervention is : who decides ?
After spending three years making sunny predictions , President Bush acknowledges , “ I know that a lot of innocent people have died and it troubles me and grieves me . ”
But he ignores his role in bringing about the deaths .
When confronted with the Johns Hopkins study , President Bush dismissed its findings and added , “ I applaud the Iraqis for their courage in the face of violence .
I am , you know , amazed that this is a society which so wants to be free that they ’re willing to you know , that there ’s a level of violence that they tolerate . ”
Yet no Iraqi  except , perhaps , Ahmed Chalabi and other exiles hoping to take over once Hussein was disposed of  had any role in shaping American policy .
With some asperity , Ximena Ortiz of The National Interest observes ,
" The president , in referring to a war he launched , is marveling at the Iraqi society ’s willingness to tolerate the violence he has in effect brought to their country  willingness and tolerate of course being the operative words .
Perhaps he should next wonder why they do n’t ask for cake .
The breadth of his misunderstanding and naivety is simply astounding .
" In some swerve of logic , Bush has decided for the Iraqis that they see the death of , say , their child or children , husband , wife , the descent of their entire country into chaos and hell  all worth it for the sake of what Bush deems to be freedom .
It should go without saying that the president ’s conclusion begs a question : what choice do the Iraqis have ?
Does the president really believe that , given such a choice , the Iraqis would choose ruinous war in exchange for his own vision of freedom ? "
In retrospect , few Iraqis who are killed or maimed , or who lose loved ones or friends , would likely view their liberation as “ worth it . ”
Some extraordinary people might consider freedom to be a prize for which no sacrifice is too high , but they are likely to be few indeed .
Some larger number of Iraqis might have been prospectively willing to take the risk , at least if they thought the odds of success to be reasonable .
Alas , as the last three years have demonstrated , despite the fantasizing that passed for planning in the Pentagon , the odds of creating a liberal , democratic state in Iraq always were long .
More important , though , no one ever asked the Iraqis what they desired .
A handful of officials in Washington had a vision and forcibly imposed it on 26 million people half a world away .
The goodness of the president ’s intentions do n’t matter .
No one can , or should , feel comfortable standing by in the face of oppression and murder in other lands .
But so - called humanitarian intervention inevitably fails the tests of both morality and practicality .
The difficulties of humanitarian intervention have long been evident , but the Iraq imbroglio should put a stake through the doctrine ’s heart .
Sadly , in the end , humanitarian intervention just is n’t humanitarian .
By Sarah Toms
BBC News , Manila
Naming a child is often a difficult decision .
For many Filipinos , individuality is an important factor , with many choosing unconventional first names .
So when the BBC's Sarah Toms gave birth in the Philippines , could she come up with an original name ?
Would Sarah Toms ' daughter end up with an unusual name ?
Made in the Philippines and born in the Philippines , it seems only yesterday that I was trying to leave hospital with my newborn .
The nurses had quickly christened her " Miss Philippines " because of her long legs .
But then I discovered that until I came up with a real name and began her birth registration at the hospital , I would not be allowed to leave .
Exhaustion made any decision difficult and I started worrying I would be celebrating her first birthday in the hospital if I did not find a name soon .
' Ace ' politician
Filipinos place serious importance on finding unique names for their children , most of them injected with a large dose of Philippine humour .
Here , there is nothing ironic about a senator called Joker Arroyo - it is his real name .
Several politicans have unusual names including Joker Arroyo
Another politician however , is known as Ace .
Congressman Robert Ace Barbers is always known by his middle name as his two other brothers and late father all share Robert as their first name .
One composite name that has become popular is Luzviminda , taken from the three main regions of the Philippines : Luzon , Visayas and Mindanao .
One writer said it is like being called " Engscowani " for England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
In this devoutly Roman Catholic country it is not surprising that many have taken on religious names , but with a Philippine twist .
With a rapidly growing population , it seems there are not enough last names to go round
His name is Jejomar , composed of the first few letters of Jesus , Joseph and Mary .
Catholicism started here with the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the colonisation of the Philippines .
Beyond food and architecture , religion is one of the lasting influences of Spanish rule .
And that is at the root of the desire to have a unique first name .
Many Filipinos who converted to Catholicism took on surnames with religious references , such as Santos or De la Cruz , for good luck .
But this resulted in many people having the same last names .
To solve the problem , the Spanish decided to restrict the surnames of Filipinos to a number of acceptable ones .
But with a rapidly growing population , it seems there are not enough last names to go round .
Originality
Security experts say that with so many surnames being the same it can take ages to do background checks .
A first name with a bit of individuality can help avoid confusion and cases of mistaken identity
Filipinos encounter their own problems with the country 's notoriously poor records system .
Getting a bank loan or passport can be a nightmare if someone with the same name is wanted for a crime .
With the country ranked as one of the most corrupt in Asia , thousands of Filipinos are forced to walk around with certificates from the National Bureau of Investigation to prove they are not wanted criminals .
So a first name with a bit of individuality can help avoid confusion and cases of mistaken identity .
Because of that I know a Peachy , a Preciosa and even a Bogi .
I also know a Boy and a Girlie , names that often come from being the lone son or daughter in a large family .
One journalist friend told me of an interview he had with a Hitler Manila
Still , I was taken aback when a famous and middle - aged newspaper columnist asked me to call him Babe .
Cultural misunderstanding
Some of the names are real and some are nicknames , but it is hard to tell them apart .
That brings me to the doorbell names : it is not uncommon to call your little one Bing , Bong , Bong Bong and even Ping and Ting .
How would you feel being christened Led Zeppelin , Mick Jagger or Nirvana ?
One journalist friend told me of an interview he had with a Hitler Manila .
Mr Manila , who does not share the Nazi ideology , told him that he was always remembered for his name but it sometimes caused problems .
One time , when he was shooting pool with some visiting Germans , the atmosphere became tense after he wrote his name on the blackboard to reserve the next game .
Another friend told me of a couple who named their five daughters Candy , Caramel , Cookie , Peanut and Popcorn
Still , that experience did not stop him from carrying on the family tradition .
His sons are named Himmler and Hess after two of Hitler 's closest associates .
Deliberation
Another friend told me of a couple who named their five daughters Candy , Caramel , Cookie , Peanut and Popcorn .
Scott Harrison , an American businessman here , says he has heard of a woman who gave birth to twin girls on either side of midnight , naming them Sunday and Monday .
Nothing unusual in that - my daughter 's kindergarten teacher is called Wednesday .
So what did I name my daughter ?
After much deliberation and temptation to join the Philippine name game , I settled for an old French favourite , Elise .
Elise is not a strange name by any means , but in the Philippines it is as unusual as you can get .

How to kill a book , in 3 easy steps
Here 's how you kill a book :
First , see to it that it emerges into the public eye on the Friday of a holiday weekend .
Advertisement
Then , express ostentatious boredom at its contents .
Then , attack .
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson declined to comment on the question of whether the campaign leaked to The Washington Post a copy of one of two forthcoming biographies of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y . ) .
And though there ’s no confirmation that the Clinton campaign leaked either book , there is at least some circumstantial evidence that points that way .
“ The only people who have an interest in putting it out on a Friday before Memorial Day are the Clinton folks , ” said Chris Lehane , a veteran of Clinton White House damage control .
The use on Clinton ’s website of passages from one book also appeared to confirm that the campaign had a copy of the book in its possession .
Meanwhile Philippe Reines , Clinton ’s spokesman , drew chuckles inside the Beltway for his canned response to the books : “ Is it possible to be quoted yawning ? ”
But the campaign 's precise reaction contradicted its showy lack of interest , particularly in one of the two books : “ Her Way , ” by former New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth and current Timesman Don Van Natta Jr .
At 8:41 p.m. on Thursday , before The Washington Post story appeared , Media Matters for America , a Democratic - leaning group whose founders are close to the New York Democrat senator 's presidential campaign , launched a dense 2,713 - word attack on Gerth .
The reporter has been loathed by some Clinton supporters since he was the first national journalist to write about the Whitewater affair in 1992 , an investigation that unpredictably would lead to Clinton 's impeachment six years later .
( Media Matters spokesman Karl Frisch did n't respond immediately to the question of whether his group had coordinated with the Clinton campaign . )
At 1:24 p.m. Friday , the campaign went on the attack .
Clinton research director Judd Legum posted a blog item on Clinton ’s website claiming that “ the book 's central premise has already been debunked . ”
The premise in question : that the Clintons had long plotted a two - decade path for both of them to the White House .
A source quoted in The Washington Post , the historian Taylor Branch , disputed Gerth and Van Natta ’s report that Branch had told two people about the " plan . "
In the Post piece detailing the books ’ contents , Reines declared , evidently between yawns , that they are “ cash for rehash . ”
“ I think that was a phrase that they concocted months ago , before they knew the first thing about what was in our book , ” Van Natta said Friday in an interview from his New Jersey home .
“ I wonder if they 'll be yawning when they realize more than half our book is about Hillary ’s Senate career , and it ’s all new material . ”
He also criticized the Post ’s stress on the early portions of the book and its focus on the notion of a two - decade Clinton “ plan . ”
“ Peter Baker did a terrible job , ” he said of the Post 's lead reporter on the Friday piece .
Baker declined to respond to Van Natta 's criticism .
The Post article reveals details of both the Gerth and Van Natta volume and of Carl Bernstein ’s “ A Woman in Charge , ” though the Clinton campaign ’s attack on the former is more intense .
It reports that “ Her Way ” delves into Hillary Clinton ’s supervising attacks on an alleged Bill Clinton lover , Gennifer Flowers , and quotes passages from Bernstein ’s book on Hillary Clinton ’s reaction to her husband ’s infidelity .
The Post also said that the book dwells on Bill Clinton ’s attempts to seize the issue of climate change from his vice president , Al Gore .
The Post piece does n’t contain any blockbuster new facts , though the return to the sordid Clinton coverage of the 1990s may serve as a reminder of what voters liked least about the Clinton presidency .
The Post reports that the Times reporters ’ book “ suggests ” that Hillary Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq in 2002 before voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq .
Reines responded Friday that she had been briefed on it .
None of the other senators running for president has claimed to have read the document at the time , and John McCain and Chris Dodd conceded Friday to The Politico that they had not , while spokesmen for the others did not respond immediately to the question .
The Washington Post reported in 2004 that only six senators had viewed the classified report .
Any leaks , and the campaign against the book , are not new tactics .
During Clinton ’s 2000 Senate campaign , Wolfson directed a fierce campaign at another book , “ Hillary 's Choice , ” by Gail Sheehy .
As in this case , the attacks began before the book hit the stands , and focused on — in that case — real inaccuracies .
Wolfson went so far as to appear at Sheehy ’s book events to discredit the volume .
It was a pattern that repeated Friday .
“ Given that the central premise has already been discredited two weeks before its publication date , I can understand why Mr. Van Natta is unhappy , ” Wolfson said .
Only the Clinton campaign has characterized Branch ’s comments that way , and Van Natta denied that the supposed “ 20 - year plan ” was the book ’s central premise .
The leak seemed calculated to catch the publishers off guard , though people familiar with each book ’s publication plans said both are still on schedule .
Bernstein ’s book is due out from Knopf on June 5 .
The Gerth and Van Natta volume is due out from Little , Brown on June 8 , and an 8,000 - word treatment of the book ’s details on the run-up to the Iraq war is still scheduled to run on the cover of The New York Times Magazine on June 3 , people familiar with the plans said .
Van Natta said part of its inspiration came from reading Hillary Clinton 's own autobiography , “ Living History . ”
“ I read her autobiography , and it was a big incentive for me to take on ‘ Her Way , ’ ” he said .
“ I thought her book was mainly a platform for her inevitable run for president , and it raised more questions about her than it answered . ”
He declined to discuss the substance of “ Her Way , ” which was not obtained by The Politico .
The Clinton campaign did n’t respond to requests from Politico for the book , and the publisher is maintaining its embargo .
Van Natta also engaged the Clinton campaign ’s main attack on his book , a dispute over his report that the historian Branch had told two others early in the Clinton presidency that President Clinton “ still planned two terms in the White House for Bill and , later , two for Hillary . ”
Talking to the Post , Branch dismissed the report as “ preposterous ” and said he ’d never heard talk of a “ plan ” for both Clintons to be president .
Van Natta responded that “ the Post implied we did not contact [ Branch ] , but we did and he declined to comment . ”
“ He 's one of Bill Clinton ’s best friends , ” Van Natta added .
He also said he had a second source for the supposed plan .
“ Leon Panetta is quoted in our book talking about the 20 - year project , ” he said , referring to the former White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton .
Panetta did not respond immediately to a call seeking his version of events .

“ This debate will go on , ” promised Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California , who voted against the war spending and described the new benchmarks as token restrictions .
Democrats also pointed to the $ 2.10 - a- hour increase in the minimum wage that was approved as part of the legislation , as well as the extra spending they wrested from the White House for veterans and military health care , Gulf Coast hurricane recovery , farm aid and children ’s health care .
While many Democrats joined Ms. Pelosi in dismissing the new benchmarks as inconsequential since the penalties can be waived by the president , the bipartisan authors of the plan say the conditions and the new reporting requirements were significant and could force a serious review of administration strategy as early as July .
“ This legislation will not only ensure that our troops get the funding that they need for training , for equipment , for other essential purposes , this legislation is also about accountability and consequences , ” said Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , a co-author of the approach written chiefly by Senator John W. Warner , Republican of Virginia .
But to many House Democrats , the new conditions fell far short and represented a failure by their party to fulfill the promise of their winning control of Congress in November .
“ The American people voted us into power for one reason , ” said Representative Lynn Woolsey , Democrat of California .
“ They trusted us to hold this administration accountable and to bring our troops home . ”
The fight over the money began in earnest on Feb. 5 when Mr. Bush requested the Pentagon financing and urged Democrats to deliver a clean bill without restrictions .
But Democrats , empowered by their election gains , sought to use the “ power of the purse ” to push Mr. Bush toward withdrawing combat troops from Iraq .
The first spending measure approved last month would have ordered troop withdrawals beginning Oct. 1 , but Mr. Bush vetoed that measure on May 1 — the fourth anniversary of his speech aboard an aircraft carrier before a banner declaring Mission Accomplished .
The House then passed a bill that would have provided the Pentagon money in stages , requiring more votes for future installments .
That approach went nowhere in the Senate and Democrats and the White House entered negotiations that produced the legislation being considered in the hours before Congress left town for a Memorial Day break .
“ They ’ve got a president that is talking one day about having nuclear bombs and saying he ’s not the next day , and taking hostages , ” he said on Friday , referring to the Iranian capture of 15 British sailors and marines .
“ I ’m not saying that we should take a foreign policy stance ; I ’m saying it ’s not a good place to invest our money . ”
Mr. Anderson ’s language was notably more heated when he introduced the bill in January , raising the specter of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and calling money “ the mother ’s milk of terrorism . ”
Last week , Mr. Anderson said he had toned down the terrorism angle in part because of legal concerns regarding divestment bills , which came into vogue in the 1980s as part of a movement to force pensions and money out of South African interests in protest of apartheid .
More recently , divestment has been used to voice displeasure with tobacco companies and the atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan .
States are not the only entities trying to put pressure on Iran .
On March 24 , the United Nations Security Council imposed new , more stringent sanctions in an effort to stop the country ’s uranium enrichment program and to try to force it to rejoin negotiations .
In Congress , Representative Tom Lantos , a Democrat from the San Francisco Bay Area , introduced legislation last month to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran .
Mr. Lantos cited denials of the Holocaust by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran and his comments that Israel should be “ wiped off the map . ”
Last year , California joined a roster of states that have opted out of investment in Sudan with a bill similar to the Iran bill , passed by a pension - related committee in the State Assembly on Wednesday .
Assemblyman Alberto Torrico , a Bay Area Democrat who cast the sole committee vote against the bill , said he thought it would find wide support in the Legislature despite his concerns about the plan ’s feasibility and vagueness .
“ Our pension funds are invested in thousands of companies , ” Mr. Torrico said .
“ I do n’t know how you ’re going to do it . ”

I was re-reading fare ‘s excellent What Makes Lisp Great , an awesome and insightful discussion of Lisp ’s unique qualities ( which , regretfully , did n’t take off on reddit , hence this post ) .
I took the time to read the comments and enjoy the author ’s answers .
And there i found this little gem on how Greg Trasuk finally gets Lisp .
If you ’re a lisper , you probably knew about it already ; but if you really need a little push to start learning Lisp , that may be it .
Of course , Faré ’s article should make for a great one .

For quite some time , my OS of choice was Debian GNU / Linux .
I had found my way to it by a winding path through several other Linux distributions , thanks in part to some guidance from friends ( thanks , Ratha and Joseph — did I forget anyone ? ) .
I loved quite a lot about Debian , including ( but not limited to ) :
Stability : Debian was by far the most stable Linux distribution I ’d yet encountered .
Even though I used the so - called “ testing ” release almost exclusively , it was more stable in operation than the stable releases of every other distribution I ’d encountered .
This was due in large part to the extensive compatibility and stability testing Debian packages undergo in the process of moving them down the chain from Experimental releases , through Unstable and Testing releases , and ultimately into the Debian Stable release branch .

Ease of Installation :
The process of installing Debian proved simple , easy , fast , and well suited to getting exactly what I wanted on the system — or , perhaps more importantly , not getting a bunch of software I did n’t want .

Software Management :
The incredible ease of software management with APT just blew me away .
That was the real coup , for me — the big one .
The fact that APT worked quickly , smoothly , and without hiccups , allowed me to make of Debian exactly the operating environment I wanted .
I could start from a bare minimum CLI - only install and install every piece of software I needed for my day to day work and a productivity - enhancing GUI environment in about ten or fifteen minutes .
Security patching was a few seconds of time .
Installing and uninstalling software was easier than opening software that ’s already installed can be on MS Windows sometimes .

Software Archives :
The stability of the packages in Debian ’s software archives was not their only virtue .
The sheer number of packages in them was mind - boggling — at around 20 k discrete packages , we ’re talking about several times as many packages as the next runner - up Linux distribution .

Upgrade Path : Unlike most OSes , when I wanted to upgrade the OS itself , I just updated the software versions for each component as it became available in a stable form .
This included the kernel itself .
There was no stair - stepping upgrade process as Version Foo Dot Zero of WhateverOS hit the market .
It was a beautiful thing .
I had some minor concerns , of course .
One thing that bothered me was my increasing unease with the GPL , the license under which the core toolset and even the Linux kernel are distributed .
I do n’t think this is the paragraph in which I should get into the subject of what ’s wrong with the GPL , but suffice to say I was ( and am ) much more comfortable with the BSD License .
For a long time , I thought about trying out FreeBSD and / or OpenBSD , but I simply never got around to it .
Part of it was complacency — Debian did so much for me , provided me with so much convenience and productivity enhancement and other wonderful stuff , that I ’d never imagined I could get from an OS , that I just could n’t be arsed to try something else without a compelling reason .
In truth , the licensing issue was a compelling reason , and became more so after some threatened litigation related to the GPL , but I still needed a bit of a push in terms of technical benefits to a different OS .
Finally , that motivation came in the form of the degradation of the Debian distribution ’s benefits .
It has become gradually less warm and fuzzy for me over the course of the last year .
All of these problems , it seems , center around the collapse of the smoothness , stability , and ease of use of APT .
It has degraded to the point now where I wonder whether Fedora ’s YUM might not be better .
Mandriva ’s urpmi , judging by my experience , still does n’t compare if only because it ’s structured a bit like someone threw darts at a dart board , then did n’t bother to tell anyone what decisions were made .
In any case , problems that I ’ve encountered with APT and Debian software archives used by APT include :
GPG errors :
The frequency of GPG key errors in Debian ’s APT has been steadily on the rise , in my experience .
Sometimes the problem clears itself up in a few days .
Sometimes , you need to give APT a swift kick .
Sometimes you need to rebuild your GPG key database for APT .
Sometimes you need to wave chicken bones over it and chant , as if you were troubleshooting MS Windows .

software configuration problems : I have found that software configuration would sometimes break after an update .
This ranged from the mildly annoying , like having to reset a specific option in some application , through the incredibly annoying , like a recent episode where Postfix and / or Mutt started creating mail headers that would get my emails rejected as spam or otherwise illegitimate by recipient mail servers , to the downright painfully awful , like when a Firefox upgrade not only wiped out all my bookmarks but somehow managed to destroy my backup of bookmarks as well .

package management errors :
The incidence of errors in how the system tracks package versions and available packages is on the rise .
My current frustration relates to the fact that APT seems incapable of properly managing a Wine install unless I regularly wave chicken bones over it , chant some evil chants , and refrain from trying to use version pinning to use the version of Wine that I actually need .
This is not keen .

software stability / compatibility :
At one point , ndiswrapper just stopped working on a laptop of mine .
A new kernel version with native Broadcom chipset support was released , so I tried upgrading it — and it broke everything related to networking , apparently unfixably .
I had to roll back to the previous kernel version and hack configuration basically like cutting my way through the thick of a South American jungle with a pocket knife just to get it working again without wireless .
Eventually I got wireless working again — but I never figured out why kernel 2.6.18 hated my laptop so much .
It was n’t even a hardware failure — the package dependencies just screwed everything up , somehow , with incompatible software being necessary for different parts of the same solution .
I got my motivation , my push , to try out something non-Linuxy — to try out something new .
This was especially the case when my laptop ’s screen crapped out , and I got a desktop system set up to replace it for my day - to - day work ( I ’m using it now ) .
I decided I ’d use this opportunity to install FreeBSD on something and see how I like it .
Thus far , I ’m in heaven .
It ’s not only better than the Debian of recently degraded quality : it ’s better , at least for my purposes and tastes , than the Debian I remember from back when everything in Debian “ Just Worked ” without hassle .
Debian still offers a lot .
It ’s still my favorite Linux distribution — do n’t take my above complaints to be as dismayingly negative as they probably seem .
Debian is still relatively stable and easy to use — relative to most other Linux distributions , and so much more so than MS Windows that it beggars the imagination for someone who has n’t given it a shot and does n’t know what ( s ) he ’s missing .
It just does n’t measure up to FreeBSD , or even to itself from a couple years ago .
I suspect some of these problems are related to the accelerated release cycle pressure for the distribution in the last year or so .
If Debian were to clean up its act and get things back to the level of stability and slickness to which I had become accustomed — well , I ’d still use FreeBSD , but at least it would n’t make me sad to think about it any longer .
Three months of intense training in a form of meditation known as " insight " in Sanskrit can sharpen a person 's brain enough to help them notice details they might otherwise miss .
These new findings add to a growing body of research showing that millennia - old mental disciplines can help control and improve the mind , possibly to help treat conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
" Certain mental characteristics that were previously regarded as relatively fixed can actually be changed by mental training , " University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson said .
" People know physical exercise can improve the body , but our research and that of others holds out the prospects that mental exercise can improve minds . "
Paying attention to facts requires time and effort , and since everyone only has a limited amount of brainpower to go around , details can get overlooked .
For instance , when two pictures are flashed on a video screen a half - second apart , people often miss the second image .
" Your attention gets stuck on the first target , then you miss the second one , " Davidson said .
This is called " attentional blink , " an effect akin to how you might overlook something when you blink your eyes .
Still , the fact that people can occasionally catch the second picture suggests it 's possible to sharpen one 's attention with training , which is just what the new meditation study found .
Brain plasticity " Meditation is a family of methods designed to facilitate regulation of emotion and attention , " said Davidson , who headed up the study .
In recent years , scientists have found meditation affects brain functions .
For instance , research into Tibetan monks trained in focusing their attention on a single object or thought revealed they could concentrate on one image significantly longer than normal when shown two different images at each eye .
Another study of people who on average meditated 40 minutes daily found that areas of their brains linked with attention and sensory processing became thicker .
" One of the fundamental mysteries that is now becoming better understood as we go along but which is still a breakthrough area of research is neuroplasticity , the idea that we can literally change our brains through mental training , " Davidson told LiveScience .
" Certain kinds of mental characteristics such as attention or certain emotions such as happiness can best be regarded as skills that can be trained . "
When Davidson first met His Holiness the Dalai Lama nearly a decade ago , the exiled leader of Tibet encouraged Davidson to conduct scientific research into meditation , " and I recognized it was a very appropriate time to begin such research , because the methods we have available now to study the brain have improved dramatically and the scientific community is significantly more receptive to such ideas . "
Ten to 12 hours daily Davidson and his colleagues investigated the impacts of Vipassana , a roughly 2,500 - year - old discipline that is the oldest form of Buddhist meditation and focuses on reducing mental distraction and improving sensory awareness .
Davidson has practiced Vipassana and other forms of Buddhist meditation for more than 30 years .
" This is not the only form of meditation we 're interested in , but it is a widely practiced form of instruction that can easily be replicated elsewhere in the country , " Davidson said .
The researchers investigated 17 volunteers before and after they completed three months of rigorous training in Vipassana .
T hey meditated for 10 to 12 hours a day .
The researchers also studied 23 novices who received a one - hour meditation class and then meditated for 20 minutes daily for a week .
The scientists asked volunteers to look for numbers flashed on a video screen amongst a series of distracting letters .
Their brain activity was monitored using electrodes placed on their scalps .
Davidson and his colleagues found the brains of volunteers who received the intense mental training apparently needed less time to spot details than before .
The training also improved their ability to detect the second number within the half - second attentional blink time window .
In comparison , the novices did not appear to experience such improvements to a significant degree , findings detailed online May 8 in the journal PLoS Biology .
ADHD treatment potential " This attentional blink finding shows a little wedge of what might be a much larger dimension of experience that could be opened up by meditation techniques , " said neuroscientist Clifford Saron at the University of California - Davis Center for Mind and Brain .
" You can imagine that life is a series of attentional blinks , and we might be missing an awful lot of what 's going on . "
Applications of this work include treatment of attention - related conditions , Davidson explained .
" There is an absolute explosion of prescriptions for kids who are diagnosed with ADHD .
I 'm not against the judicious use of medication , but there probably is vast over - prescription for this disorder , and strategies like meditation could be an acceptable complement or substitute for medication for certain kids , " Davidson said .
" There still needs to be rigorous research to establish that , but our work is provocative enough to warrant more systematic follow - up . "
In the next five years , Davidson expects a dramatically increased level of research into meditation " because it is beginning to be recognized as something that takes advantage of the plasticity of the brain , has relatively few if any side - effects and has potentially very beneficial effects , the impact of which can be documented using the most rigorous scientific methods . "
Other avenues of research Davidson and his colleagues are currently pursuing include the impacts of meditation on pain , inflammation regulation , and emotions and the brain circuits that handle feelings .
Top 10 Mysteries of the Mind
The Greatest Modern Minds
All about the Mind ?
Why Do We Make Writing Harder Than It Needs to Be ?
It ’s amazing how often we undercut our own progress , cause a power failure , make things hard on ourselves .
We set up roadblocks and wonder why the path is hard to travel .
We take the long way home , because we fear the easy way .
We shoot ourselves in the foot , and we do n’t know that we ’re doing it .
In training writers , I ’ve seen people talk themselves out of writing in so many ways .
Most are easy to stop if you know that you ’re doing them .
If you think you might be making things harder than they need to be .
Hang on .
I ’ve got the list for you .
10 Sure - Fire Ways to Stop Making Writing So Hard
Writing will never be easy .
That ’s a fact .
But hey , we do n’t have to make it harder .
Take look down this list and see whether you find yourself here .
If you do , you might be able to make it less hard by changing how you approach your writing .
Do you . . .
1 . Do you keep starting and stopping ?
It ’s because you do n’t know what you want to say .
At some point , before you start writing , ask yourself , What is it I want readers to know ?
2 . Do you think too much before you write ?
Is your head too full of information ?
Try reading less , taking notes , and taking a break after you read .
Give the information time to sort and settle .
Taking in large amounts of information is stressful , writing needs relaxation and deep thinking .
Give yourself room for a brief transition .
3 . Are you overly competitive ?
Do you find yourself thinking that everyone took all of the good ideas ?
Stop reading the other guys or read them at a greater distance from when you write .
They ’ll have less power the further away you can put them .
Remember they are reading you and thinking the same thing .
4 . Are you a perfectionist ?
There ’s no such thing as perfect , but there is better than the last .
We can only do what is humanly possible .
When you start feeling like you need to beat the rest of us humans at everything , it ’s okay to tell yourself you do n’t have superpowers .
5 . Do you scrap every original idea that you have ?
Turn off your internal editor .
Tell your editor the on switch will be engaged when you edit .
Then find ideas , twist them and turn them into something you like .
Write until you have something you can organize before you invite your editor back .
6 . Do you try to write for traffic , instead of readers ?
Traffic surges are unpredictable .
Write what you know and feed your readers .
Your core audience will stay with you and encourage their friends to join them .
Traffic is fickle and often just looks and leaves .
7 . Do you get stuck between great headlines and great articles ?
If you write a great title , keep the promise it makes .
Give up the headline , and go with a great article if you can ’t .
8 . Is your best style stream of consciousness and you just know it should n’t be ?
You can write stream of consciousness if you make it vivid and engaging .
Crawl into that stream and describe in such a way that your readers feel wet .
9 . Do you write 8 - mile sentences and do n’t know what to do ?
Read your post aloud .
Break them apart at the places where you need to stop to breathe .
Your readers will stay with you longer .
10 .
Do you think writing is an individual endeavor ?
Writing is for , inspired by , or about other people .
Half of being a writer is observing and listening to the people around us .
That ’s how we get better , that ’s how we learn and refine the art and craft .
PLUS ONE : Forget the screen and the lurkers .
Write to an audience of one .
Imagine that audience is someone intelligent who shares your passion for what you are writing about , but does n’t know the subject as well as you do .
Writing will never be easy , but it does n’t have to be overly hard .
I still love the quote that ca n’t be attributed .
I hate writing .
I love having written .
What do you do to make writing harder than it needs to be ?
Be irresistible .

UNSPEAKABLE LOVE : Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East ( Book Review )
I wrote the following book review for Gay City News -- New York 's largest gay and lesbin weekly -- which publishes it tomorrow :
UNSPEAKABLE LOVE : Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East , by Brian Whittaker ; 264 pp. ; University of California Press When Tayseer , a Palestinian from Gaza , was 18 , he was found in bed with a boyfriend by an older brother -- and as a result , he was severely beaten by his family and threatened with strangulation by his father if he ever had gay sex again .
A few months later , Tayseer was invited into an orange grove for sex by an undercover police agent of the Palestinian Authority , and subsequently arrested .
Police told Tayseer that the only way for him to avoid prison was to himself become a Judas goat , to lure other gay men into sex so that they , too , could be arrested .
When he refused to be police bait in this entrapment scheme , Tayseer was hung by his arms from the ceiling .
“ A high - ranking officer he did n’t know arranged for his release -- and then demanded sex as payback . ”
When Tayseer fled Gaza for Tulkarem , he was eventually re-arrested , and forced to stand in neck - high sewage water with his head covered by a feces - filled sack .
During one police interrogation , Tayseer was stripped and forced to sit on a Coke bottle .
Tayseer ’s story is just one of the accounts by Arab lesbians and gay men in Brian Whittaker ’s new book , UNSPEAKABLE LOVE : Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East , just published simultaneously here and in the U.K.
Whittaker ( left ) , the Middle East Bureau Chief for the British daily The Guardian , writes that he was inspired to do this book when covering the infamous Queen Boat case in Egypt , in which 52 men were arrested in 2001 at a gay party on a disco boat , and subjected to a highly - sensationalized trial -- in a state security court normally reserved for terrorists -- for using “ perverted sexual acts ” as part of “ satanic rituals ” ( one Cairo newspaper headline blared , “ Perverts Declare War on Egypt . ” )
Thirty - five of the men received prison terms and 200 lashes each -- and 70 more men who had initially been arrested , then released , were also later sentenced to prison .
Whitaker writes that “ the dearth of coverage about Arab homosexuality encourages the idea that it is almost entirely a foreign phenomenon . ”
It is the great merit of this book that it helps to give a fuller picture of both the wide - spread existence of same - sex love in the Arab world and of the increasing number of Arabs who are choosing to define themselves through a gay identity .
In dissecting the wide gap between portrayals of homosexuality in Arab media and official discourse , and the lived reality of Arab same - sexers , Whitaker writes that “ Arab portrayals of homosexuality as a foreign phenomenon can be [ plausibly ] attributed to a reversal of old - fashioned Western orientalism .
Western orientalism , as analyzed by Edward Said ( right ) in his influential book , highlights the ‘ otherness ’ of oriental culture in order ( Said argued ) to control it more effectively .
Reverse orientalism -- a comparatively new development in the Arab world -- taps into the same themes but also highlights the ‘ otherness ’ of the West in order to resist modernization and reform .
Homosexuality is one aspect of Western ‘ otherness ’ that can be readily exploited to whip up popular sentiment …
Where symbolism of this kind applies , the sexual act must necessarily be described in terms that maximize the reader ’s disgust : there is no scope for portrayals of homosexuality that are anything but negative . ”
In this context , and given prevailing cultural and official attitudes toward homosexuality , the near - impossibility of being openly gay , and the absence of public spaces where same - sexers can lawfully gather and meet , it is hardly surprising that , as Whitaker writes , “ a point made repeatedly by interviewees …was that to be gay and Arab is often extremely lonely . ”
So great is ignorance about the real nature of the same - sex impulse in the Arab world that the semi-official Egyptian daily al - Ahram al - Arabi could run a lengthy 2001 interview with “ a professor of surgical medicine ” on the “ most successful method ” of “ curing sexual perversion ” : to wit , “ cauterizing the anus , which , by narrowing the anus , makes it more painful for the passive homosexual to be penetrated , which makes the active homosexual unable to penetrate , and causes the sexual encounter to fail . ”
Whitaker quotes the late Zaki Badawi ( right ) , head of the Muslim College in London , as saying that , “ Homosexuality has always existed and continues to exist in all Islamic countries .
Many high - ranking leaders in the Islamic world are gay . ”
Unfortunately , Whitaker does n’t name any of those leaders , except for the Sultan of Oman .
He might well have mentioned King Mohammed VI ( left ) of Morocco ( also the country ’s chief spiritual leader as Commander of the Faithful ) who was outed on his ascension to the throne in 1999 by the leading Belgian daily , Le Soir , which revealed that as a university undergraduate in Brussels , the king - to - be had spent all his free time in gay bars .
Then there ’s Algeria ’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika ( right ) , knowledge of whose homosexuality is widespread in his country , where he is frequently referred to as " ateka , " a word - play nick - name meant to portray him as a “ queen ” ( it can mean " old maid , " and it 's been chanted at him by entire football - stadiums ! )
Whitaker devotes a chapter to the rare images of homosexuality in Arab cinema -- briefly touching on the work of the likes of Egyptian directors Youssef Chahine , Salah Abu Saif , and Yousri Nasrallah , and the Tunisian Nouri Bouzid -- and the relatively few portrayals of it in modern Arab fiction .
Novels like the Lebanese Hoda Barakat ’s 1990 “ The Stone of Laughter , ” Egyptian Alaa al - Aswani ’s huge best - seller “ The Yacoubian Building ” ( 2002 ) , and Nobel Prize - winner Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt ’s 1947 “ Midaq Alley ” are discussed .
But the burgeoning lesbian and gay literature written in French by Mediterranean Arab writers from former French colonies -- who cannot publish in their own countries in Arabic -- gets only a sentence : the talented Moroccan Rachid O ( right ) , whose novels have won critical acclaim , is mentioned but not discussed ; and not even mentioned at all are such interesting writers on gay themes as the Algerian Aniss A. , the Egyptian Sonallah Ibrahim , the Moroccans Kasim Nasseri and Bahaa Trebelsi , or the Tunisian Eyet - Chékib Djaziri .
It ’s unfortunate that , as Whittaker notes , most of his face - to - face interviews with gays and lesbians were limited to Egypt and Lebanon , and to the cosmopolitan centers of Cairo and Beirut -- although there are 22 countries in the Arab League .
Thus , the North African countries of Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia -- with a combined population of over 80 million -- are hardly mentioned .
The particularly virulent menace to homosexuals posed by the rise of Islamic fundamentalism gets no systematic examination , although fundamentalism is evoked briefly and in passing in several different sections of the book .
Whitaker does , however , dissect the anti-gay arguments of several English - language Islamist websites and the pronunciamentos of Yusuf al - Qaradawi ( above left ) , an influential religious figure in the Arab world popularized by his regular appearances on Al - Jazeera TV .
But the book is also marred by several errors .
For example , Whitaker writes that the Lebanese gay group Helem “ is the only specifically gay and lesbian organization functioning openly in an Arab country ” -- thus overlooking ASWAT , the self - described “ organization of Palestinian gay women , ” which received an award for its work inside the Palestinian Authority from the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission in March 2006 .
Whittaker characterizes the Iranian theocracy ’s attitude toward the transgendered as “ comparatively liberal ” -- but he makes no mention of how an Iranian seeking sexual reassignment surgery must have an official document declaring themselves “ mentally ill ” before being allowed to have such an operation .
Nor does he mention how Iran ’s mullah - controlled psychologists routinely pressure homosexuals into sex - change operations -- to which some same - sexers reluctantly agree in order to avoid prosecution for homosexuality , a capital crime in Iran .
The French public television network France 2 last year gave a detailed account of this phenomenon in a documentary with the telling title , “ Changer de Sexe ou Mourir ” ( translation : “ Change Sex or Die . ” )
And in August 2006 , I interviewed for The Advocate a 24 - year - old Iranian lesbian refugee named Maryam , now seeking asylum in France as a sexual refugee -- she told me that when , after her lesbian affair was revealed , she was forced to undergo six months of treatment from two women psychologists at the University of Shahid Beheshti , “ they ordered me to have it [ sex - change surgery ] .
‘ No , ’ I said .
‘ I ’m Maryam , a girl , and I do not want to be a man ! '
The female doctor told me , ‘ If you do n’t change your sexuality and you continue unlawful acts , your future will be a death sentence . ’”
Still , despite these caveats , UNSPEAKABLE LOVE is a valuable introduction to the difficulties of being homosexual in the Arab world , and one of the few recent books in English to discuss contemporary Arab same - sex relations from a sympathetic point of view .
One of the most useful chapters in the book is Whitaker ’s dissection and refutation of the arguments of Joseph Massad ( left ) , a controversial Columbia University professor and author of a widely - circulated essay ( " Re-Orienting Desire : The Gay International and the Arab World , " Public Culture , Spring , 2002 ) complaining that gay rights in Arab and Muslim countries is an imperialist ‘ missionary ’ project orchestrated by what he calls the “ Gay International . ”
In concluding his dissection of Massad , Whitaker writes that Massad and his acolytes present the debate “ as a choice between cultural authenticity on the one hand and the adoption of all things Western on the other .
In fact , neither is a realistic proposition .
Exposure to foreign ideas and influences cannot be prevented , but nor are Arabs incapable of making critical judgments about them .
Equally , Arab culture cannot be treated as a fossil ; it is a culture in which real people lead real lives and it must be allowed to evolve to meet their needs .
The issue , then , is not whether concepts such as ‘ gay ’ and ‘ sexual orientation ’ are foreign imports , but whether they serve a useful purpose .
For Arabs who grow up disturbed by an inexplicable attraction towards members of their own sex , they can provide a framework for understanding .
For families -- puzzled , troubled , and uninformed by their own society -- they offer a sensible alternative to regarding sons and daughters as sinful or mad . ”
To which one can only say , Amen !

Interesting post .
I did n't know homosexuality was punishable by death .
There must be a good amount of closet cases .

Ron Paul : ' Peace is powerful message '
RAW STORY
Published : Saturday May 26 , 2007 Print This Email This Speaking as a guest on Bill Maher 's HBO show this week , the underdog Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul issued a rebuke to the tough - talking Rudy Giuliani and spoke at length about the value of non-intervention in the pursuit of peaceful change .
" Peace is a powerful message , " said Paul , speaking to Maher , along with fellow guests Ben Afflect and P.J. O'Rourke .
" Especially after the war has been going on and the people wake up and realize how many people die and how much it costs .
And that 's why i think people are really ready for a message that says we do n't have to be in this mess .
Logic tells us that we can make a better world in a much easier way than causing wars . "
After earning a reputation as an independent - minded politician , attacked by fellow Republicans for his unconventional viewpoints and championed by some liberals , Paul garnered attention in a recent debate between Republican candidates by arguing with Giuliani as to the role of US foreign policy in the 9/11 attacks .
After defending his position , Paul described his hope that Giuliani may learn a little about the issue from a reading list provided to him by the Texas congressman .
" We have Mr. Giuliani studying tonight , " joked Paul .
" He 's at home reading all those books , and he 's gonna apologize to me - he 's gonna say , ' I 'm sorry Ron , I just did n't know that that 's the way foreign policy works . ' "

This feature includes various hacks to boost Ubuntu ’s performance , such as viewing running processes , identifying resources , finding process startups , tuning kernel parameters , and
speeding up boot time .
This is a complete chapter in the ExtremeTech book “ Hacking Ubuntu : Serious Hacks Mods And Cusomtizations . ”
The default Ubuntu Dapper Drake installation includes some basic processes that check devices , tune the operating system , and perform housekeeping .
Some of these processes are always running , while others start up periodically .
Occasionally you might see your hard drive start up or grind away for a few minutes — what ’s going on ?
On mission critical servers , serious gaming boxes , and other real - time systems , unexpected processes can cause huge problems ; administrators should know exactly what is running and when .
The last thing a time - sensitive application needs is for a resource - intensive maintenance system to start at an unexpected time and cause the system to slow down .
In order to fine - tune your system , you will need to know what is currently running , which resources are available , and when processes start up .
From there , you can tweak configurations : disable undesirable processes , enable necessary housekeeping , and adjust your kernel to better handle your needs .
Time to Change
Different versions of Ubuntu ( and Linux ) use different startup scripts and run different support processes .
Knowing how one version of Linux works does not mean that you know how all versions work .
For example , one of my computers has a clock that loses a few minutes after every reboot .
( It ’s an old computer . )
When I installed Ubuntu Dapper Drake ( 6.06 ) , I noticed that the time was correct after a reboot .
I started to look around to find out how it did that and which timeserver it was using .
The first thing I noticed was that there was no script in / etc / init.d/ for setting the time .
Eventually I tracked down the network startup scripts and found that the ntpdate script was moved from / etc / init.d/ ( in previous Ubuntu releases ) to /etc/network/if-up.d/ .
This script allowed me to find the network time protocol ( NTP ) configuration file ( /etc/default / ntpdate ) .
A similar problem came up when I started running Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog ( 5.04 ) .
Periodically the hard drives would grind when I was not doing anything .
At other times it happened when I was running processes that were impacted by disk I / O when the drives began to grind , the critical process would detect a processing problem .
I quickly narrowed the disk grinding to updatedb a caching program that works with slocate for quickly finding files .
What I could not find was how this program was being started .
Eventually I discovered that updatedb was started by anacron , an automated scheduler .
While it is important to know what is running , it is even more important to know how to track down running processes and tune them to your needs .
Learning the Lingo
Everything that runs on the system is a process .
Processes are programs that perform tasks .
The tasks may range from system maintenance to configuring plug - and - play devices and anything else the user needs .
System processes manage keep the operating system running , whereas user processes handle user needs .
Many processes provide services for other processes .
For example , a web server is a service for handling HTTP network requests .
The web server may use one or more processes to perform its task .
Some services are critical to the system ’s operation .
For example , if the system must support graphics but the X - Windows service is unavailable , then a critical service is missing .
Although most system processes are services , most user processes are applications .
Applications consist of one or more processes for supporting user needs .
For example , the Firefox web browser is an application that helps the user browse the web .
In general , services start and end based on system needs , while applications start and end based on user needs .
None of these definitions — programs , processes , applications , and services — are very distinct .
For example , the Gnome desktop consists of programs and processes that provide services to other programs and supports user needs .
GDE can be called a set of programs , processes , applications , or services without any conflict .
When I talk about processes , I refer to anything that generates a running process identifier ( see the next section for Viewing Running Processes ) .
Programs are the executable files on the system that generate one or more processes .
Users directly use applications , while the operating system uses services .

An engraving on the IRS building in Washington reads , " Taxes are what we pay for a civilized society . "
Unfortunately , paying taxes does not bring society a civilized tax code .
Tax Day reminds us every year just how unruly our tax code has become .
A tax code should simply , fairly , and transparently collect the revenue necessary to pay for the functioning of the government .
But America's tax code is fundamentally unfair , complicated , a drag on the economy , and encourages corruption .
The entire tax code needs to be thrown out and replaced with one that is simple , fair , and flat .
Our annual tax ritual requires the average person to spend 26 hours filing a standard 1040 form , and more than 60 percent of us will pay for accounting services .
Professional help is needed because America 's tax rules and regulations are nearly 60,000 pages of special interest loopholes , convoluted legalese , and social engineering .
This year , as a nation , we will spend 6.6 billion man-hours completing our taxes .
That 's more time than it will take to build every car , truck , and van assembled in the United States this year .
The US Department of Treasury estimates that the total cost of complying with the income tax is $ 125 billion a year .
That 's $ 125 billion a year that our capital markets , small businesses , and schools never see .
Unreformed , the tax code could amount to a hidden cost of more than 1 trillion dollars over the next eight years .
In 1885 , the Scottish economist J.R. McCulloch warned , " The moment you abandon the cardinal principle of exacting from all individuals the same proportion of their income or their profits , you are at sea without a rudder or compass , and there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit . "
Congress is now paying the price for maintaining this tax code that encourages corruption by allowing politicians to hand out special favors .
Fundamental tax reform would be real lobbying reform .
Scrapping the current income tax and replacing it with a flat tax on all income would eliminate the considerable opportunity for bribery presented by the current code .
By eliminating itemized deductions and special breaks , the flat tax removes the entire playing field on which tax lobbyists operate .
A neutral law like the flat tax would transform the entire political culture in Washington .
Nine countries around the world are currently enjoying the benefits of a flat tax .
A flat tax would allow a personal deduction for everyone so families could feed , clothe , and shelter themselves before paying the government .
A family of four would get four such deductions .
Any income anyone earned above that would be taxed at the same rate .
No other exemptions .
No loopholes .
No mess .
We could file our taxes in minutes .
A flat tax would also treat all income , individual and business , equally before the law and eliminate double taxation .
The politically connected could n't slide their way through exemptions .
Americans would n't have to deal with the fear of becoming a felon for not understanding a complex code .
The $ 125 billion and 6.6 billion hours saved from hidden costs could be reinvested back into our economy , or , in the case of the extra time , enjoyed with friends and family .
And in the global marketplace , a flat tax would make America a more attractive place for investment and job - creation .
Shortly after the founding of America , Chief Justice John Marshall prophetically wrote , " the power to tax is the power to destroy . "
Little did he know how destructive the tax code would become .
It is time to scrap the tax code and start over .
Americans deserve nothing less .

New evidence on racial test score gaps
In the United States , past research has consistently found that Black teenagers underperform
White teenagers by an average of about one standard deviation on tests of IQ and academic achievement .
Substantial racial test score gaps are found as early as age five .
Roland Fryer and I have written two papers on racial differences in test scores in the past ( see here and here ) .
In those papers , we were able to answer some interesting questions , but we did n’t have the right sorts of data to get at the question of whether the differences in test scores across races that are commonly observed might have a genetic component .
In a new paper , we tackle that controversial issue , using a large U. S. government data set that administers a test of mental functioning to children aged 8 - 12 months .
No one has ever looked carefully at racial test score differences in children this age using a large , nationally representative data set .
As they approach their first birthday , how do you think the Black children do relative to the White children on these tests ?
Our preliminary answer is here .
But before you look , make your own guess as to the results .
I think we will be seeing a lot of Steve Sailer on this site in the near future — this issue is even closer to his heart than legalized abortion .
A fun and easy way to get your message out to thousands , even millions of people , is through the medium of talk radio .
Although firmly in the trenches of the right , it 's still possible to get a liberal point of view onto the airwaves by following these easy steps :
1 ) When the screener asks you what you want to talk about , be sure and tell them something relatively innocuous but tangentially relatable to the point you want to make .
2 ) If possible , use a slightly southern or hick accent - they 're more likely to put you on and the AM audience is more likely to relate to you .
3 ) Do n't go straight to your main point - get there incrementally .
Remember there 's a seven - second delay and they 'll cut you off if you go too far or get there too fast .

This business about Bush being Hitler , that 's just ridiculous ...
Hitler 's Dead !
Drudge :
Well they say it 's not Auschwitz yet ... it 's coming , it 's not yet .
Jason : Bush is a lot more like David Koresh the way I see it .
Y'know he talks to God , he 's got a little ranch outside of Waco - sees everything in terms of good and evil ...
He ai n't no Hitler .
Drudge : uh ...
Jason : Just ' cuz his grandpa supported Hitler , an ' maybe his dad might 've supported Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden ... y'know , ya can't tar George W. with the sins of his fathers ...

Well , y'know they try , they try ... yes ...
Jason : Now I just wanted to say ...
Drudge :
As they salute Armand Hammer , right ...
Jason : Now I just wanted to say a little thing about dirty laundry ... and uh , now we got what ?
We got 485 people dead , we got somethin ' like 2,700 seriously wounded over there ...
That 's over thirty - two hundred blood - soaked U.S. uniforms , y'know ?

Ain't that funny ?
Ah mean ...
Ain't that a hoot ?

Topic : The Catholic Church and the War in Iraq
Guest : Father Donahue , a stridently pro-war priest who holds the War in Iraq adheres to the Church 's notion of a " Just War " , ( no matter what the Pope says ... )
Me : " Jason from Oceanside " ( with mild hick / Nascar dad accent )
Warning :
This text gets very graphic .
Jason : " Thanks for having me on Alan - I consider myself to be a god- fearing Christian and a big supporter of my country and I just wanna tell you about the sermon I listened to yesterday in church .
The subject was " Who would Jesus Bomb ? " and the answer was pretty much ' nobody . '
The major point the p riest was making was that bombing , ALL bombing ... was just plain cowardly , and it did n't matter if it was us doing it or anybody else , but what it all boiled down to was that bombing is cowardly and Jesus would n't support it .
And he said his inspiration for the sermon had come from the Pentagon itself - when they said the reason they thought the Iraqi Army folded so quickly was because they were mostly just conscripts , y' know ... just kids pulled from outta their villages ...
So I gotta wonder why , y'know ... why we gotta kill all these kids who had nothin ' to do with it ... "
Alan :
So what do you say father ?
This is what 's being said in some churches . "
Father Donahue : Uhhh yeah , I think they should find another religion - why do n't they become Quakers ?
My religion , Roman Catholicism , rejects that totally and that 's why they have the most sophisticated understanding of what a Just War ...
Alan Colmes :
This is priests who are saying this ... Catholic Priests !
Father Donohue :
That 's right and you 'll find , uh , no end to the number of nuns in this country who are pro-abortion and nobody wants to talk about that - all I 'm telling you is they do n't represent the teachings of the Catholic Church .
The teachings of the Catholic church are found in the catechism , the ministry of the Pope and ...
Alan Colmes : Alright Jason , thanks for your call ...
Jason : May I ? May I just interject one more time ?
AC : Yes .
Jason :
The most striking thing that he talked about was something called " overpressure " , which is not the explosive force of the bomb but the pressure wave that radiates around the bomb ... and that what that does is that it implodes the sinuses and the eardrums of the people who are there ...
AC : Yeah , Bombing is n't good for ya ...
Jason : and that what happens is your cerebral spinal fluid - your brain fluid , leaks out through your nose and through your ears ...
AC : Right ...
Jason :
And that you do n't die right away ...
You 're as good as dead , but you do n't die right away ...
AC : ( Uncomfortable ) Right , right ... right .
Jason :
And that these are just kids ...
That was the point he was really trying to make - these were just kids pulled outta villages !
and they do n't have a Chance !
They did n't have a Chance to fight back ...
And they just gotta lie there - starin ' up at the sky and prayin ' to whatever God they got to pray to ...
AC : ( Throughout ) Uh , yeah , right ... right , uh right ...
Jason :
While their brain fluid is drippin ' out through their nose and through their ears ...
AC : Uh Jason I gotta move on ...
Jason :
And it 's our tax dollars that are payin ' for this ...
AC : Uh , Jason , thank you for your call , I thank you very much .

Michael Savage
I made this call about a week after Savage lost his cable TV show for exploding at a caller he termed a " sodomite " and saying he should " die of AIDS " .
I was hoping with my call to bait him into saying something similarly stupid and possibly getting him off the airwaves entirely .
Failing that , I hoped I might give him an aneurysm .
Came pretty damn close too .
Savage : Okay , I wanna hear from you callers out there , the ones who were raised by leftist parents ... all you red - diaper doper babies out there .
I wanna hear if you liked them , if they screwed you up , whatever .
Our first call 's from Justin in Los Angeles .
Justin , welcome to the Savage Nation .
Justin ( Me ) : Hi Michael .
I 'm definitely one of those kids - of - leftists .
My father was very big into civil rights and poverty issues back in the sixties .
I hate to disappoint you though : he was n't a hippie or anything like that , he was more a nerdy kind of activist , you know , the kind with short hair ...
Savage : Uh-huh .
Justin :
And I guess , ' cuz he spent a lot of time trying to help out other people and his causes and the like , he was n't really home all that much , or not as much as he could 've been , and I know it must 've had some impact on the family , but y'know what ?
Savage : What ?
Justin :
You are n't fit to lick his boots .
Savage : ( enraged )
What ?!
What the hell do you know about me ?
What the hell do you know about anything ?
You do n't know anything about me , about what I 've done ... about my work in nutrition , in conservation ... anything !
How would you know anything about me ?
Justin :
Well , I hear what you say on the radio ...
Savage :
You do n't know anything !
You 're just stupid , like the rest of them , what do you know ?

For months , the painting sat wrapped in a garage .
Before that , it hung for decades in a home in Pisa , Italy .
The owner , a Southern California woman , never knew the value of the painting .
For her , it represented fond memories of her grandmother , and it looked good on the wall over the piano , where she eventually hung it .
On Super Bowl Sunday , someone gambled more than half a million dollars at an Oakland auction that the painting is the lost work of a 17th - century Italian master .
All the seller had hoped for was a couple thousand dollars to help pay for her daughter 's tuition at UC Berkeley .
" This was a surprise to all of us , " said the woman , who asked to remain anonymous because she did n't want people to know about her windfall .
" It still has n't registered yet .
We 're all in shock . "
The painting is untitled and unsigned .
No one knows for a fact who painted it or when .
But it appears to be the work of a 17th - century Italian artist named Pier Francesco Mola .
It was sold to an unnamed art dealer in the New York area .
The painting originally belonged to the seller 's grandmother , who lived in Italy .
It hung in the back room of her grandmother 's home and was known by the family simply as " The Quadro , " Italian for " The Painting . "
" All we know is that it was given as a gift to my grandmother , " the seller said in a telephone conversation from her Southern California home .
" I do n't know if it was from a boyfriend or not , but I like to think it was .
It makes the story a lot better .
But I really do n't know . "
The seller said she used to see the painting during occasional family trips to Italy to see her grandmother .
She loved the work but never really thought about its value .
About two years ago , her grandmother died , and the seller 's mother -- who has since died -- had her belongings shipped to the United States .
The seller was the only surviving grandchild , so the belongings went to her .
She put the painting in the garage for several months and later hung it on a wall over the piano where her daughters learned to play music .
And there it stayed until the seller 's oldest daughter was accepted to UC Berkeley .
The seller said she and her husband are not rich , just average , middle - class people living in a modest , middle - class home in a suburban city .
Paying UC tuition was a real challenge .
The woman decided to part with the painting and some other furniture and items left by her grandmother .
She had never done anything like that , so she did an Internet search for auction houses .
She found a reference to Clars Auction Gallery in Oakland and liked the fact that another woman had used it to sell similar items .
She called Clars and asked if the gallery could help her out .
Redge Martin , president of Clars , sent a truck to her home and brought some of the items to Oakland to put them up for auction .
He and his staff could not determine the origin or value of the painting , but it looked like it might have been made by one of the Old Masters .
He thought the painting might sell for a few thousand dollars .
The staff at Clars spread the word across the country and in Europe that the painting was for sale and generated some buzz in the art world .
Then came the auction .
It was Super Bowl Sunday .
Bidding opened at $ 5,000 .
The seller was at home in Southern California .
She was painting a closet prior to the football game when the auction began .
Her husband checked the auction on eBay because it was being sold simultaneously live at Clars and on the Internet .
" I heard a shout and went to see what happened , " the seller said .
" I went in the other room , and my husband had fallen out of his chair .
We watched the price go higher and higher .
We could n't even say anything because it did n't seem real . "
And that was just when the price hit $ 30,000 .
Ted Bielen , a patent attorney from Berkeley , was in the audience at Clars .
As the price rose and rose , he said , jaws started dropping .
Every time another bid came in , he said , there was a collective " whoa ! "
" People were saying , ' What 's going on here ? ' " he said .
Apparently , the bidding was hot and heavy between an American and some European bidders , who drove the price to $ 300,000 , where it seemed to stall .
Then a bidder from New York came in and drove the price even higher .
The New York bidder fought with a French bidder until the price reached $ 560,000 , and the French team dropped out .
The final sale price , with buyer 's premium , was $ 620,900 .
Martin said the buyer wished to remain anonymous .
He said he did not know whether the dealer was working on behalf of a specific buyer but that dealers do n't want people to know what they paid for a piece because it might affect what they can sell it for .
The seller said she and her husband hosted a small Super Bowl gathering at their home .
They said nothing of the sale , she said , because they were in shock and still not 100 percent certain that the whole thing was for real .
So they sat there , stone - faced and bursting inside and unable to share the story with their friends .
Paintings by Francesco Mola hang at San Francisco 's de Young and Legion of Honor museums as well as the Getty Museum in Los Angeles , the Louvre in France and the National Gallery in England .
The highest price paid for a Francesco Mola appears to be $ 2.8 million , though many of his works sell for $ 100,000 or less , Martin said .
Kathy Wong , fine arts appraiser for Clars , said to the best of her knowledge no one has authenticated the painting as a Francesco Mola .
Determining the origin of a painting can be difficult , she said .
Experts usually can tell by comparing certain artistic traits , such as the painting technique or particular details in the artwork .
Others might have access to library materials , such as sketches or notes made by the artist , that are identical to the actual work .
But it 's an inexact science , she said .
The painting might have been made by a student or admirer of Francesco Mola's .
Still , it 's unlikely that someone would pay more than half a million dollars on a hunch .
Someone probably did a lot of research on the painting before he or she was willing to pay big bucks .
It 's the dream of anyone who 's ever watched " Antiques Roadshow , " to discover that some old painting or piece of furniture is worth a small fortune .
Martin said it 's not uncommon for an auction item to sell for several times the amount it is thought to be worth .
Usually , he said , the scale is much smaller .
Something estimated at a couple thousand dollars might go for tens of thousands of dollars , he said .
Levi Morgan , a spokesman for Bonhams & Butterfields in San Francisco , said estate sales are ripe for those kinds of situations because the valuable items can get lost among all the other items for sale .
And you never know when Grandma or Grandpa came upon a collector 's item and did n't know it .
Usually , he said , auction items are on display before they 're up for sale , so potential buyers have time to examine them and determine their worth .
" You can usually smell that in a preview , " he said .
" People come in and look at something important , and the excitement is in the air . "
He , too , said items valued in the hundreds or low thousands will sometimes bring in 10 times that much .
" We can only hope to catch the painting that goes for a half million , " he said .
The seller said the money is an incredible gift from her grandmother and mother .
She put a photo of her grandmother on the piano , near where the painting once hung .
She kisses the photo and says , " Thanks , Grandma " several times a day .
" Really , though , this is n't going to change us , " she said .
" We 'll use the money for tuition and maybe pay off the mortgage , but it 's not like we 're going to go out and buy new cars or anything .
I do n't think our friends will even know the difference . "

The image of the super - svelte Frenchwoman has taken a battering after a new survey showed more than a third are overweight .
In all , the study found that 19.8 million people out of the country 's population of 63 million were too fat , and that 5.9 million of them were obese - 2.3 million more than nine years ago .
" Women appear to be more affected than men , " said Professor Arnaud Basdevant , a Paris hospital nutritionist who jointly co-ordinated the study .
" Women 's waistlines are certainly expanding the fastest , " he added .
The survey revealed that , rather than following in the slender tradition of a young Brigitte Bardot , more than a third of French women are overweight .
Far too many drink to excess , with one in 30 consuming enough to be classed as an alcoholic .
More than half of Frenchwomen are thought to be at serious risk from overeating , smoking or drinking .
Last year the bestseller French Women Don't Get Fat ' explained ' how a bit of common sense combined with a moderate intake of calorie - filled delicacies could ensure a perfect figure .
Its author , Mireille Guiliano , 60 , claimed that traditional French ways of choosing and preparing food ensured good health and figure .
The reality , however , is that McDonald 's and Burger King are now regular features of towns and cities across France .
Family meals are being replaced by supermarket ready dinners .
Even Miss Guiliano has admitted that her book 's title may have to be revised .
" Of course some French women get fat , " she said .
" I find it obscene , frightening , that France has one of the largest number of McDonald 's outside America .
" Even in France there are now homes without a dining table .
People sit in front of the TV with junk food , saying they are too busy to prepare meals .
" But you can make a lovely carrot soup in 20 minutes .
It 's a 21st century trap .
People work more , have less time and there 's prepared - food galore – full of sugar , salt and preservatives . "
The latest study , titled ObEpi 2006 , was carried out by TNS Healthcare Sofres , between January and March .
A cross-section of 23,747 aged over 15 were interviewed .
In all , it found that 12.4 per cent of the population is now obese , compared to 11.3 percent in 2003 and 8.2 per cent in 1997 .
Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen is shocked at the way in which some Muslims are misrepresenting Denmark in the Islamic world .
“ I am speechless that those people , whom we have given the right to live in Denmark and where they freely have chosen to stay , are now touring Arab countries and inciting antipathy towards Denmark and the Danish people , ” Rasmussen told journalists yesterday .
Rasmussen was responding to the recent visits by certain imams , Muslim intellectuals and representatives of Danish Muslim organizations who toured a number of Muslim countries to “ explain ” the Danish cartoon affair to local political and religious leaders and media .
The affair started last September when the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten published 12 cartoons of Muhammad .
Meanwhile , after last week ’s rejection of their complaint by the public prosecutor , Danish Muslim organisations have announced that they will take the newspaper to the European Court of Human Rights over the controversial publication .
Islam forbids the depiction of the Muslim prophet .
Carsten Juste , the editor of Jyllands - Posten repeated late last week that the daily will not apologise for publishing the cartoons :
“ We will not apologise , because we live in Denmark under Danish law , and we have freedom of speech in this country .
If we apologised , we would betray the generations who have fought for this right , and the moderate Muslims who are democratically minded . ”
Rasmussen said he did not want to use the word “ treason , ” as Pia Kjærsgaard , leader of the Danish People ’s Party , has done to describe the Danish Muslims ’ visit to the Arab countries .
Rasmussen said treason has a certain legal reference and should only be used in appropriate circumstances .
He also stressed the necessity of a proper tone in the debate from all parties , but at the same time he said , with a reference to the words of Kjærsgaard , that Denmark had a tradition of wide ranging freedom of expression and one should tolerate the use of this freedom .
“ As Prime Minister I will not evaluate what other people say nor judge what is proper .
The courts decide when someone crosses the line , ” he added .
In the Danish Parliament there is general indignation at the Arab visits by the Muslim representatives .
However , instead of using strong words the government has decided to ask Danish embassies to correct the misinformation .
Previously Rasmussen had urged the Muslim representatives to correct the misinformation themselves .
These , however , claim the wrong information did not come from them and that it is therefore not their responsibility but that of the „ international press ’ “ .
Meanwhile the 12 cartoons were published on Tuesday in the Norwegian Christian newspaper Magazinet “ in support of the freedom of expression . ”
Magazinet has received much feedback since publishing the cartoons and the overwhelming majority of it has been positive , thanking the newspaper for its initiative in defense of freedom of expression .
Much of it has come from Denmark , but also from e.g.
Sweden , Great Britain , Canada and the United States .
Yesterday the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet also published the cartoons on its website .
„ We are ourselves a nation that has been exposed to increasing Muslim violence against freedom of expression , “ said Vebjørn K. Selbekk , the editor of Magazinet , and referred to the 1993 murder attempt on Willam Nygaard , the Norwegian publisher of Salman Rushdie ’s Satanic Verses .
Consequently , Selbekk said , Norway has a special responsibility to confront this problem .
He said that Norwegian illustrators were tending towards the same self - censorship as their colleagues in Denmark .
They do not dare to depict Muhammad for fear of a violent Muslim reaction .
Drawing cartoons of Muslim religious leaders suffices to become the target of threats and even death threats , as Morten M. Kristiansen , illustrator at the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang , has experienced .
He says he often received remarks from Christians when he depicted Jesus Christ and from Muslims when depicting their religious leaders , but in recent years the Muslim remarks have turned into threats .
“ We cannot tolerate this in a democratic society , ” said Selbekk .
Asked if he was himself afraid of reprisals he said : “ We have gone astray if we begin to concede on this issue out of fear .
Many have already done much to prevent this problem from being hushed up .
We hope that by publishing the cartoons we can do our bit . ”

The Truth About Staying Next Story :
Reboot Needed
So last week I wrote about some simple " desugaring " transformations that turn a fairly conventional block - structured programming language into the call - by - value lambda calculus with some small extensions .
The main problem is that I relied on first - class continuations .
This has at least two undesirable consequences :
First - class continuations are the goto of functional programming .
Actually , that understates the amount of unconstrained tangle that they can unleash - they are far more powerful and dangerous than goto .
So one can argue that programmers are better off avoiding first - class continuations and using more constrained control flow , much like we are advised to shun goto in favour of break , return , and exceptions .
of functional programming .
Actually , that understates the amount of unconstrained tangle that they can unleash - they are far more powerful and dangerous than .
So one can argue that programmers are better off avoiding first - class continuations and using more constrained control flow , much like we are advised to shun in favour of , , and exceptions .
Continuations can't easily be implemented with a conventional linear stack .
When you return a normal value up the stack , the top stack frame (s ) can be freed , but if you return a continuation up the stack , they cannot : calling the continuation re-activates these frames .
The stack becomes a cactus .
A common solution to this problem is to allocate activation frames on the heap , but this seriously stresses the garbage collector and harms locality : whereas a stack works up and down over the same small area of memory , the heap blasts forever upwards .
Fortunately there 's a nice solution : multi-return function calls .
The idea is to separate continuation arguments from normal arguments , and restrict the continuations so that activation frames are still used in a normal stack - like LIFO manner .
What 's really neat is that it preserves a lot of the the power of first - class continuations .
However , the desugaring transforms become more complicated .
The scope of the multi-return continuations is restricted so that you cannot ( for example ) return from a function by invoking its continuation from an inner block , because the continuation is not available there .
Instead you have to add plumbing to pass the early - return continuation into the block along with the block 's normal sequential continuation .
This plumbing ends up being rather like the standard continuation - passing - style transformation described in the lambda - the - ultimate papers linked to above , but with an extra continuation for each early exit .
This extra-continuation plumbing is also similar to a standard implementation technique for exceptions ( which I called " non-trivial " last week , but is n't actually hard to understand ) .
As well as the sequential continuation that is passed around in CPS , you pass around an exception handler continuation which is invoked in order to throw an exception .
This is very similar to implementing exceptions in C with setjmp and longjmp , except in C you can keep the current exception handler in a global variable instead of passing it around .
The downside of these techniques is that the plumbing is an overhead .
However , it is " pay - as - you - go " , in that you only need the plumbing if you use early exits from blocks .
( It 's less easy to avoid the exception plumbing since exceptions can usually be thrown anywhere . )
By contrast , the more complicated infrastructure needed for first - class continuations affects the performance of the whole run-time system .
( The mathematics in the typing of these constructions relates directly to their balance of practicality and power .
Constrained continuations like multi-return functions and exceptions are usually used linearly and have an intuitionistic ( constructive ) typing .
Call - with - current - continuation , however , has a classical typing which is not expressible in most practical type systems .
This kind of direct relationship between theory and practice is one of the beauties of computer science . )
America is headed for a military dictatorship  and recent legislation makes this all but inevitable .
Last September , Congress passed the Defense Authorization Act , which empowered the president to declare martial law with very little provocation , namely in the aftermath of a “ terrorist attack or incident . ”
Having determined that “ the execution of the laws ” is hampered by the “ incident , ” the president can unilaterally impose martial law  without the consent of Congress , which need only be informed of the event “ as soon as practicable . ”
The only condition attached instructs the president to report to Congress after 14 days , and every 14 days thereafter .
This use of the military to enforce domestic order is a new development in American history , one that augurs a turning point not only in terms of law , but also in our evolving political culture .
Such a measure would once have provoked an outcry  on both sides of the aisle .
When the measure passed , there was hardly a ripple of protest : the Senate approved it unanimously , and there were only thirty - something dissenting votes in the House .
Added to the Military Commissions Act [ .pdf ] , this new brick in the wall of domestic repression creates the structure of a new imperial system on the ruins of the old constitutional order .
George W. Bush and his hard - core neoconservative henchmen may have lost the war in Iraq , but they have won a virtually uncontested victory at home : the conquest of the old republic by an emerging imperial order .
This recalls the opening of Garet Garrett ‘s 1952 philippic , Rise of Empire , wherein he diagnosed the essential indeterminacy of the transition :
“ We have crossed the boundary that lies between Republic and Empire .
If you ask when , the answer is that you cannot make a single stroke between day and night ; the precise moment does not matter .
There is no painted sign to say : ‘ You are now entering Imperium . ' ”
The usually prescient Garrett got it somewhat wrong here :
The single stroke between day and night can be fixed precisely in time , at 8:45 a.m. EDT on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and the Military Commissions Act and the disturbing changes in the U.S.
Code outlined above are the closest to painted signs we are likely to get .
Waiting in the wings , an infamous cabal took advantage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , moving with preternatural speed to consolidate a dictatorship of fear .
With the passage of more recent legislation , they are now moving to consolidate their gains .
Sinisterly , the new legislation also alters the language of Title 10 , Chapter 15 , Section 333 of the U.S. Code ( the so - called Insurrection Act ) in an ominous manner :
“ Whenever the president considers it necessary to use the militia or the armed forces under this chapter , he shall , by proclamation , immediately order the insurgents or those obstructing the enforcement of the laws to disperse and retire peaceably to their abodes within a limited time . ”
Why insert the bolded phrase  unless your objective is to widen the category of miscreants to include those exercising their First Amendment rights ?
No one expects an insurgency to be launched in this day and age in America , yet peaceably assembling to protest government policies can easily be interpreted to include “ obstructionists ” who might be “ dispersed . ”
As José Padilla discovered , any American can be kidnapped and held without trial  or even formal charges  on the orders of the president , and the granting of unprecedented power to rule by decree builds on this neo - royalist theory .
The Bushian doctrine of the “ unitary executive , ” which gives the occupant of the White House monarchical power in wartime , has now been approved by the Democrats , who ca n’t wait to wield it themselves .
Of course , they would exercise such unholy power only in a good way  say , if a state refused to cooperate in enforcing or implementing federal legislation instituting a draft , or , more likely , federalizing a state National Guard unit to be shipped to the Middle East .
Oh , you mean that ’s not so good ?
Just wait until the Democrats get their hands on all that power : then you ’ll see the real collapse of the movement to preserve civil liberties in America .
Remember , it was Hillary Clinton who said of the Internet : “ We are all going to have to rethink how we deal with this , because there are always competing values .
There ’s no free decision that I ’m aware of anywhere in life , and certainly with technology that ’s the case . ”
Yes , the technology is very “ exciting , ” she averred , yet “ there are a number of serious issues without any kind of editing function or gatekeeping function .
What does it mean to have the right to defend your reputation , or to respond to what someone says ? ”
The First Amendment is not big with Hillary and never has been .
She ’s power - mad , and every once in a while the frigid mask gives way to the face of a real authoritarian , albeit a different one than that of the red-state fascists , as Lew Rockwell describes the anti-libertarian Right .
Blue - state fascists trample on our civil liberties “ for the children , ” but the effect is the same : bipartisan support for the abolition of our old republic and the inauguration of a new era in American history : the Age of Empire .
With the neoconized “ conservative ” movement transformed into a force fully committed to outright authoritarianism , and the “ liberals ” defending the depredations of the Democrats in power , who will be left to defend what ’s left of the Constitution ?
Just Ron Paul and Alexander Cockburn .
The rest will go with the herd instinct of sheep threatening to stampede at the apparent intrusion of a wolf in their pasture .
Under the terms of this legislation , who defines a terrorist “ incident ” ?
The president .
Who defines an “ unlawful combination ” ?
The president .
Who determines that a “ conspiracy ” is in progress , one that threatens national security and domestic order ?
The president of these United States  which are to be united , in our darkest future , by a superpresident who can outlaw the opposition with the stroke of a pen and is more a military leader than the chief executive of an ostensible republic .
Stop , for a moment , and consider where we are in the spring of 2007 .
On the home front , the representatives of the people have conceded the last of their waning powers to the executive branch and paved the way for the restoration of royalism in America .
Overseas , American troops are fighting a war of conquest  there is no other way to describe it  in an effort to prop up a rapidly failing puppet government in the Middle East .
Meanwhile , U.S. forces are gathering in the Persian Gulf for what looks to be a strike against Iran .
The unpopularity of our foreign policy is increasingly a cause for concern in the Imperial City , where both parties have colluded  with surprisingly little dissent  in ensuring a permanent U.S. military presence in the Middle East .
It is merely a question of the size of our footprint that divides the two major parties on this all - important question .
The Democrats want to “ redeploy ”  to Qatar and other neighboring countries .
The Republicans wo n’t give up an inch of conquered Iraqi territory and instead want to extend the battle into Iran , which is already the target of a not - so - covert campaign aiming at “ regime change . ”
( The Iran Freedom Support Act , authorizing millions in aid to “ democratic ” groups , was supported by the leadership of both parties in Congress . )
Rising antiwar sentiment worries William F. Buckley Jr. , who opines that “ There are grounds for wondering whether the Republican Party will survive this dilemma . ”
Given the authoritarian proclivities of the Bush administration and the neoconized GOP , there are grounds for wondering whether the republic will survive .
We are just a terrorist “ incident , ” either real or imagined , away from a declaration of martial law and all its attendant consequences .
Buckley grimly notes the polls are “ savagely decisive ” on the war question , and he asks : “ Beyond affirming executive supremacy in matters of war , what is George Bush going to do ? ”
The answer may be contained in Title 10 , Chapter 15 , Section 333 .
Senators Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and Kit Bond ( R - Mo. ) are sponsoring legislation that would repeal the changes , but , as Sen .
John Warner pointed out the other day , when the Insurrection Act was revised to give the president extraordinary powers , no one raised any objection .
Now , suddenly , the senators , including Warner , see some reason to regret their hasty actions  do they know something we do n’t ?
I fear , however , that it may be too late .
Bush will surely veto the Leahy - Bond measure  and , if necessary , declare America ’s governors , who all oppose this brazen usurpation , an “ unlawful combination , ” as the Insurrection Act puts it .
Then he will be empowered to “ disperse ” them , and the Senate , at will .
I ’m back to Garet Garrett , who never fails to come up with some apt aphoristic prognostication , this one being from his classic The Revolution Was :
“ There are those who still think they are holding the pass against a revolution that may be coming up the road .
But they are gazing in the wrong direction .
The revolution is behind them .
It went by in the Night of Depression , singing songs to freedom . ”

Do n’t you just hate it when you wake up before the alarm clock rings , feeling refreshed , see the clock and decide that you should sleep a few minutes more , and by the time the alarm rings again , you are so deeply asleep that it feels so terrible being woken up that you wish you did n’t sleep that extra 5 minutes ?
That ’s because traditional alarm clocks do not synchronize with your brain ’s sleep cycle .
By sleep cycle , we ’re talking about the different phases of sleep with characteristic brain wave patterns .
Throughout the night , we fluctuate between different levels of sleeping , deep sleeping , shallow sleeping and the famous Rapid Eye Movement phase ( REM ) .
What this alarm watch does is that it detects your shallow sleep within a preset time frame , say if you want to wake up at 7 am , you set the time frame to be 6:40 to 7:20 , then the alarm watch would wake you up when it detects that you ’re in the shallow sleeping phase , but not the deep sleeping phase .
As much as this sounds cool in theory , how does it work in reality ?
Well , the NikkeiBP dude managed to wake up refreshed enough to take a picture , not bad eh .
The watch is priced at $ 170 in Japan . — Sam Chan
SleepTracker Review [ NikkeiBP ]
Leon Bambrick ( aka SecretGeek ) has started a series on Agile methodologies and Test Driven Development ( TDD ) in which he brings up his own various hidden objections to TDD in order to see if his prejudices can be overcome .
One of the questions he asks is an age old argument against TDD .
Who Tests the Tests ?
Leon sees potential for a stack overflow since , given that the tests are code , and that according to TDD , code should be tested , should n’t there be tests for the tests ?
The short answer is that the code tests the tests , and the tests test the code .
Huh ?
Testing Atomic Clocks
Let me start with an analogy .
Suppose you are travelling with an atomic clock .
How would you know that the clock is calibrated correctly ?
One way is to ask your neighbor with an atomic clock ( because everyone carries one around ) and compare the two .
If they both report the same time , then you have a high degree of confidence they are both correct .
If they are different , then you know one or the other is wrong .
So in this situation , if the only question you are asking is , “ Is my clock giving the correct time ? ” , then do you really need a third clock to test the second clock and a fourth clock to test the third ?
Not if all .
Stack Overflow avoided !
Principle of Triangulation
This really follows from the principle of triangulation .
Why do sailors without electronic navigation systems bring three sextants with them on board a ship ?
With one sextant , you could rely on the manafacture testing to assume its measurements are correct , but wear and tear over time ( not much unlike the wear and tear a codebase suffers over time ) might make the measurements slightly off .
If you take measuremnts with two sextants , then you have enough information to decide if both are measuring accurately or if one is not .
However in this situation , we need to know exactly which measurement is correct .
So we take a third sextant out .
The two sextants that take measurements most closely together are most likely correct .
Accurate enough to cross the Atlantic .
“ I support this plan 100 percent , ” Mr. Wexler said before introducing Mr. Crist .
“ This governor means what he says , and he ’s coming to Tallahassee and he ’s spreading the message throughout Florida that this is n’t about Republican or Democrat , it ’s not about this ideology or that ; it ’s about unifying people and doing what ’s right for the people of Florida . ”
The 15 Florida counties that have adopted touch - screen voting in recent years , including Miami - Dade , Broward , Palm Beach and Hillsborough , would move to optical - scan voting under the proposal before the presidential election of 2008 .
The plan would give them the option , however , of using touch - screen machines during the state ’s two - week early voting period that precedes Election Day , if the machines are modified to provide a paper trail .
Those counties represent 54 percent of the state ’s registered voters .
Broward County alone has bought about 6,000 touch - screen machines in recent years , and Palm Beach County has about 4,500 .
Mr. Crist said county election supervisors would explore how to make optical - scan voting easier for blind people and for those who speak foreign languages .
In some cases , they have been able to vote without assistance on the touch - screen machines .
Asked how he felt about discarding tens of millions of dollars worth of touch - screen machines just years after they were acquired , Mr. Crist said , “ The price of freedom is not cheap .
The importance of a democratic system of voting that we can trust , that we can have confidence in , is incredibly important . ”
Election experts estimate that paperless electronic machines were used by about 30 percent of voters nationwide in 2006 .
But their reliability has increasingly come under scrutiny , as has the difficulty of doing recounts without a paper trail .
Federal technology experts concluded late last year that paperless touch - screen machines could not be secured from tampering .
Some states had bought early versions of the paperless machines before the 2000 recount , and one of them , New Mexico , switched last year to optical scanners .
But most of the machines in other states were purchased with federal money provided under a 2002 law that required states to upgrade from old punch - card and lever systems .
New York is planning to buy either screens with printers or optical scanners , New Jersey is adding paper trails to its touch screens and Connecticut is buying the optical scanners .
A recent survey by Election Data Services , a Washington consulting firm , estimated that 36 percent of the nation ’s counties have bought electronic machines , including some with printers attached , while 56 percent have the optical scan systems .
This narrated computer animation shows results from a research project involving simulated Darwinian evolutions of virtual block creatures .
A population of several hundred creatures is created within a supercomputer , and each creature is tested for their ability to perform a given task , such the ability to swim in a simulated water environment .
The successful survive , and their virtual genes containing coded instructions for their growth , are copied , combined , and mutated to make offspring for a new population .
The new creatures are again tested , and some may be improvements on their parents .
As this cycle of variation and selection continues , creatures with more and more successful behaviors can emerge .
The creatures shown are results the final products from many independent simulations in which they were selected for swimming , walking , jumping , following , and competing for control of a green cube .

Why is this work still cutting edge ?
@benjohn :
It 's incredible indeed that this work is still cutting edge in the field after more than 15 years , and here is a reason why :
It typically takes several years of involvement to write such a program .
Most of the people who did it and published in the field spend their Master 's or PhD doing it , and once the program works , it 's time to graduate and move on .
The program they developed is usually so complex that no student wants to continue the effort .
That 's academia .
In industry , you 'd have to convince your boss to pay you and wait for 2 - 3 years before any result comes out ...
Also , there seem to be quite a long way between the successful completion of such a research project and an economically viable application .
In recent years , however , some software ( FramSticks , Breve 3D , 3D creature evolution ) have appeared that allow people to conduct similar experiments in a much shorter time .
However , I do n't know to which extent they allow one to reproduce Sim 's results .

Subject : Stunning
I think the earlier reviews have failed to understand how cool this film is :-)
The creatures in this film were n't " designed " by a human .
They were entirely evolved by a piece of software that simulates a physical universe within a computer .
To begin with , the world is populated with rondomly generated creatures .
Over time they compete and the " fittest " at various tasks come to dominate their less able siblings , giving rise to the critters that you see swiming , walking , slithering , rolling , jumping and grabbing in front of you .
In the final part of the movie where creatures are seen competing , they are literally fighting for survival and continued membership of the gene pool .
As far as I know , this work still represents the cutting edge in the field , which is incredible and sad given that it is nearly 15 years old .

Klotho seems to delay the effects of old age in mice
They say the gene has a key role to play in many of the processes related to ageing .
Because humans have a very similar version of the gene , the hope is that it will show a way to improve our declining years .
The gene studied in the new research is called Klotho , named after a minor Greek goddess who spins life 's thread .
The gene certainly seems to do that .
Mice - and people - with defective forms of the gene appear to age prematurely .
Now researchers have shown that by boosting the activity of the gene , they can extend the natural lives of male mice by about six months , to two - and - a - half years .
The effect is not quite so strong in female mice .
Downsides
" It could be one of the significant steps for developing anti-ageing therapy , " Dr Makoto Kuro - o , assistant professor of pathology at the University of Texas ' Southwestern Medical Center and senior author of the study , told Science magazine .
Klotho seems to delay many of the effects of old age , like the weakening of bones , clogging of the arteries and loss of muscle fitness .
This is important for those researching the causes of ageing , whose intention is not so much to prolong life as to improve the quality of our final years .
But there may be downsides with Klotho .
The long - lived mice in the new experiments tend to be less fertile .
And the gene may also predispose people to diabetes .
The trick for researchers will be to find ways of getting the life - enhancing results of Klotho while avoiding the drawbacks .
It does n't actually crack skulls , well , maybe , but probably not .
Somebody realized that the annoying , high - pitched car alarms are pretty worthless , and the Club is better off being used to actually crack someone 's skull .
This system violently shakes the steering wheel so hard that it will actually break arms if the thief tries to maintain control of the wheel .
No word if you can actually buy this product to be installed in a car — it seems like a DIY jobber — but I would be reluctant to use this in the first place .
I would hate to have the system backfire when I am doing 70 down the highway .
Lisp project sites do n't provide enough information - Lisp Propulsion Laboratory log
Lisp project sites do n't provide enough information
I hesitate to critique free resources , especially when the prolificity of their authors is in sharp contrast with my limited contributions .
But since Gary King publicly acknowledges information problems about his own Lisp software , I will chime in with a constructive spirit [ * ] .
I have been submitting entries to the Common Lisp Directory since early 2006 .
CLD is a database of Common Lisp software and other resources .
I try to include in CLD entries as much information as possible about projects .
This is to help users understand what a particular software project does , which Lisp implementations it runs on , which libraries are required , where to get the code , and evaluate the resource to decide whether it fits his needs .
But I frequently run across projects that do n't prominently - - or at all - - provide one or more of the following information , all of which is important :
the names of authors or maintainers , or even screen names / nicknames ; at times there is no trace of author identification all over the source code and documentation files
what the software actually does , what problem it is supposed to solve ; some descriptions are so cryptic that they are useless
, what problem it is supposed to solve ; some descriptions are so cryptic that they are useless what Lisp implementation and operating system the software runs , has been tested , or is assumed to work on ; this is among the most common missing pieces of information , and forces the user to dig the code for #+ foo - lisp forms or impdep.lisp files to figure it
, and forces the user to dig the code for forms or files to figure it what libraries the software requires ; ASDF - INSTALL takes care of this in many cases , but knowing in advance which libraries the software relies on may help the user understand whether the program is able to run with his setup
some kind of information on the project status , such as a version number or date of the latest release ; knowing dates is particular important , for example , for assessing whether a program is still likely to run on current implementations ; and gives an indication on whether the project is still active
links to download a tarball with the latest version , or to a browsable version of the source code repository , when available ; the latter is particularly useful for checking the quality and completeness of the code , assessing the project status , or studying the code for useful tricks or techniques
licensing information ; many are nervous about using code with unknown distribution conditions
I do n't think that the missing information is due to lack of time .
Rather , I think that authors take too much for granted , and have difficulties in getting in the shoes of users and understanding their needs .
Actually , the web sites of Gary King 's many useful Lisp projects do provide this information .
The only headaches I had , as mentioned in his blog entry , are with dependencies .
His software heavily relies on libraries with complex dependencies , at times apparently circular .
Now I understand why you often find " meta " in his project names :-)
You may note that the information I discussed matches the fields of CLD entries .
Indeed , we spend some time with each project entry and dig its source code or web site so that you do n't have to .
Finally , this is problem is common to all free software , but Lisp projects have specific informational needs .
My mate Ed has been working on a new project for the last week or so .
He has n't done the classic " never comes out for food or sleep " routine , because , unlike all those other scientists in the movies , he is n't an idiot .
But he did keep the basement door locked ( where our workshop is ) , and he did refuse to tell me what he was doing .
Ed has done this before .
Usually the results , though utterly , utterly useless , make great conversation pieces , but sometimes they are explosive or , on one memorable occasion , sentient , so I was in two minds about what to expect this morning when he announced that he was done , and asked me down into the basement to show me .
I could n't see anything new in there except for a single , one - inch long component rocker switch in the middle of the otherwise empty worktop .
It had a red wire and a black wire soldered to the contacts underneath , trailing off the table into some dark corner of the lab .
Ed was sitting in a chair at the worktop , with the switch under one hand and a stopwatch in the other .
As I descended the stairs I saw him turn the switch on and start the stopwatch simultaneously .
He counted to five and then turned it off , before he looked up .
" Is that all of it ? " I asked , sitting in the chair opposite him .
" Yes , " said Ed bluntly , smiling broadly at me .
There was a pause .
I was half - inclined to believe him .
Ed is the kind of guy with whom , after a while , you learn to take nothing for granted .
But he shook his head and continued , " No , this switch is connected to one of Jazz 's network ports . "
He nodded at Jazz , the extremely ancient Acorn personal computer that has been sitting in the corner of our basement for the last four or five years .
" As you know , Jazz 's other network port runs directly into the university data network .
That network has a large number of other computers on it , including among other things a pair of Cray supercomputers that serve the Theoretical Physics labs ... "
I know all this already , and Ed knows I know .
Most of his projects begin with a speech exactly like this , right up to " Theoretical Physics labs " .
" Now the Crays , as you are probably not aware ( unless , like me , you are updated on a minute - to - minute basis of the status of the experiments currently in operation in the Theoretical Physics Centre ) , are even as I speak involved in running and processing the data from a ground - breaking experiment in a region of physics known as quantum tunnelling .
Now , as I recently realised , quantum tunnelling is not all that different from the phenomenon called teleportation ... "
I hold up a hand .
" Let me guess the rest .
You 've got some kind of program stored on Jazz .
When you close the switch , that 's the cue for it to transfer itself all the way over to the Crays , where it forcibly takes over the experiment . "
" You have learned well .
Yeah , it aborts the experiment currently in progress , and then begins its own sequence of instructions .
When I open the switch again , the program ceases and everything goes back to normal . "
I nod approvingly .
I long ago made the point to Ed that doing bad things to other people 's expensive laboratory equipment was not very nice .
" So what does the program actually do ? "
Ed waves his hands vaguely .
" Teleports stuff .
It 's a bit complicated . "
" I saw you already closed the switch . "
Ed winks , and checks his stopwatch .
" That was one minute and thirty - one seconds ago .
Why do n't we take a walk outside ?
The results wo n't be visible for a few minutes . "
" The results will be visible from the street ? "
" You 'll see .
Or not . "
Cryptic .
Ed takes the stopwatch with him as we head up to the front door .
He locks it and we walk out into the suburban street .
There is no traffic about but there are a few people going about their business .
It 's a beautiful day , the sun is shining and it 's almost noon .
" You 're not gonna blow the whole world up , are you ? " I ask Ed .
This is not a dumb question .
Ed flirts with Armageddon practically on a monthly basis .
It 's all rather worrying .
" No , nononono .
Nothing like that .
Something rather more spectacular . "
I point at a dark building on the horizon and say , " TPC 's that way . "
I 'm still half - expecting some kind of explosion .
Ed shrugs .
There 's a long pause while we wait under one of the trees that line this street .
I sit down on the pavement and enjoy the sunshine .
Ed intently studies his stopwatch .
We wait for at least five minutes .
Nothing happens .
I point this out to Ed .
" It 'll happen , it 'll happen , " said Ed . " What 's the speed of light these days ? "
" Uh ...
Two hundred and ninety - nine million , seven hundred and ninety - two thousand , four hundred and fifty - eight metres per second by definition , " I recite .
I 'm a geek .
You know this .
" And the radius of the Earth 's orbit ? "
" Just under a hundred and fifty million kilometres . "
I frown and look up , cogs a - whirring in my head .
Ed counts from the stopwatch .
" Eight minutes fifteen , eight minutes sixteen , eight minutes seventeen - "
The Sun goes out .
There is no sound , there is no descending " pyeeow " tone of power generators spinning to a halt , but suddenly the world is plunged in total darkness .
All the birds stop singing .
I hear a very distant honking as cars screech to a halt in the middle of the road .
There are stars visible overhead .
My eyes are n't adjusted to the darkness - I can't see a thing , least of all Ed , but I can hear him beside me , laughing uproariously like the lunatic genius he always was .
" Well , so much for the rumours of the Daystar , " is the funniest line I can come up with on such short notice .
Five seconds later the Sun came back on again , just as Ed promised .
We went back inside and performed the traditional post - experiment ritual of getting some popcorn and watching the news reports about it on TV .
Ed , the forward - thinking guy he is , already has a blank videotape cued up .
The press seemed to be pretty excited about this one , and personally I did n't blame them .
" Are you gonna tell them who did it ? "
" Probably not , " said Ed . " See , if I did , I 'd get loads of credit for it , but they 'd probably lock me up as well .
Whereas if I leave it as a total mystery , I 've got this great gag lined up for Christmas 2012 ... "
Feeling tired throughout the day could suggest a problem
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
A survey is suggesting that only a tiny minority of us are getting eight hours ' sleep a night .
But do we really need that much ?
" Getting your eight hours " is one of those injunctions , like drinking plenty of water or not to swim in canals , that most people take at face value .
When former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was reported to need only five hours ' sleep a night , it was taken as evidence of a near - supernaturally tough constitution .
And it 's become an increasingly common sentiment that too much work and stress and missing out on our eight hours is the modern plague .
THE ANSWER
We do n't need any set of amount of sleep - it's all down to genes and whether we feel fresh and alert during the day
But the good news , says Prof Jim Horne , director of Loughborough University 's Sleep Research Centre , is that we do n't need eight hours at all .
" It 's nonsense .
It 's like saying everybody should have size eight shoes , or be five foot eight inches .
" There is a normal distribution - the average sleep length is seven , seven and a quarter hours . "
Lots of people report having more or less than the average , he said .
It may all be down to genes , and what people are accustomed to .
The US National Sleep Foundation suggests seven to nine hours a night is advisable for adults , and a survey it conducted in 2002 suggested three - quarters of Americans had problems sleeping and a third were so sleepy during the day their activities were affected .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
The foundation says : " In the past century , we have reduced our average time in sleep .
Though our society has changed , our brains and bodies have not .
Sleep deprivation is affecting us all and we are paying the price . "
But Prof Horne says : " The test of insufficient sleep is whether you are sleepy in the day or if you remain alert through most of the day . "
In a nutshell , if you sleep for eight hours a night go to work and find yourself lolling and drooling on the keyboard , you are n't getting enough .
If you 're sleeping five hours and running the country , you probably are getting enough .
And Prof Horne , the author of Sleepfaring : A journey through the science of sleep , says the idea that Victorians got lots of sleep and had a better work - life balance is a myth .
Indeed a classic demand of the 19th Century labour movement was " Eight hours labour , Eight hours recreation , Eight hours rest " .
Women may need more sleep than men , Prof Horne says , due to the structure of their brains .
And he says there is evidence that young children are getting too little sleep , with a detrimental effect on their behaviour .
Sleep patterns disrupted by shift work have been linked to heart disease , but this has also been linked to stress caused by unpleasant jobs , Prof Horne notes .
He stresses that sleep disorders are a 24 - hour phenomenon with sufferers spending their days stressed and unable to clear their heads at night .
Leaving the bedroom and doing a jigsaw is one course of action , Prof Horne says .
And the insomniac must not dwell on his problems or his condition .
As Mrs Thatcher once told the Sun : " If you brood and brood and brood ... you wo n't go to sleep . "
I was told at uni that sleep is cyclical and that as long as you wake up during the lighter part of the sleep cycle you will feel fresh and alert .
Wake up during the heavy sleep part and you will be a like a bear with a sore head all day .
I think there are even devices on the market now that detect these cycles and wake you at the right moment .
John D , Glasgow , UK
Very interesting - but more to the point is not the length of sleep but when it takes place .
My internal clock seems permanently to be set to British Summer Time and I automatically feel energized when we put the clocks forward ( which means I go to bed effectively an hour earlier ) .
I do n't sleep for any longer but it is considerably more refreshing .
Somehow I never seem to be able to overcome the ' jetlag ' of GMT !
Garry Humphreys , London
Why does it have to be continuous ?
I have a 10 - 20 minute period in the afternoon where , if I 'm honest , I would be better off crashing before carrying on .
In other countries that would be the siesta period ...
I can cat nap , my girlfriend can't .
Allan , St Albans , UK
As a child growing up in London , we were told an old adage that the requrirements for sleep were :- By Nature 5 , by Custom 7 , by Laziness 9 and by Wickedness 11 .
Needless to say we were not allowed long lay - ins in the morning !!
Anne Merryweather , Limerick , Ireland
Alcohol and coffee ( any caffeine , really ) have a detremental effect on our ability to sleep properly .
Go without for a week and see the effects !
Easier to get to sleep , deeper sleep , better stamina & concentration throughout the day , less tired driving ...
The only problem is I really like wine & coffee !
Richard , Bath
I can't physically sleep for 8 hours !
If so , I 'll be sluggish or in a bad mood all day .
Andrew McGreevy , Bournemouth
The most disruptive thing towards sleep patterns is the 9 o'clock start at work .
Which lunatic ever decided that ' the day ' should start at 9 ?
It would be more sensible to work 12 till 8 .
That way people will naturally wake up and be more alert in work .
It will also give families time to have breakfast together .
Daniel Meadowcroft , Stockport , England
.... but strangely no mention in the article of the feelings associated with having too much sleep .
If on the odd occasion i allow myself a very big lie in , the rest of the day is a right off , feeling like i've been asleep for years and really not able to wake up !
Ed S , London , UK
This is report is nonsense .
How can it be natural for an alarm clock to forceable wake the body up ?
Why do some countries have a siesta ?
Humans need at least 8 hours sleep and I would even say 10 for myself !
Ray , Manchester
I think the reason the Americans are so sleepy all the time is because they eat too much ( carbohydrates ) not due to the fact how much they sleep !
patrick , london
I agree with this entirely .
I find that going to sleep at 1 am , and waking up at 7 am i feel fresh all day .
Whereas if i sleep for " 8 hours " i actually feel worse for it .
I occasionally lie in on weekends and perhaps get 8 or 9 hours then , but thats a rarity .
Andy , Nottingham
Eight hours , I 've never been able to sleep for that long .
I manage and continue with about 4 hours a night and have been doing so for a considerably long time now .
It takes me a while to go off whatever the time of night and always I wake before any alarm that might be set , for work .
Pete , Havant
Every time I hear a debate regards too little sleep , Professor Horne of Loughborough University is wheeled out to say it is all rubbish that we need 8 hours sleep .
Then why is that most people I speak to these days say they feel shattered and just want to go to sleep , and when I ask these people how much sleep have they had they always say below 7 and half hours .
The evidence is staring us in the face - we 're not getting enough sleep !
Too much late night television might be a good start for any meaningful research into this problem !
Bill O'Rourke , Lancashire
I think we 're a sleep - deprived nation .
People do n't seem to value their sleep - they seem to view it as time wasted .
But sleep is vitally important to a happy , productive life .

RECENT advertisements for Microsoft show office workers as dinosaurs , stuck in a bygone era .
Aptly , it is an accusation that some are now making about the software company itself .
Microsoft earns more than half its $ 40 billion or so of annual revenue — and the vast majority of its profits — on just two products : the Windows operating - system and Office , a collection of personal - computer ( PC ) applications including word - processing and spreadsheet programs .
Both , however , are coming under threat from new technologies .
The pressure Microsoft is facing in its core businesses is similar to one confronted by IBM — another firm that was once synonymous with computing .
At the beginning of the 1990s IBM had to face up to the shift from a computing world dominated by mainframes to one dotted by personal computers .
In this new world hardware became a low - margin commodity and Microsoft 's operating system took the privileged position .
Today , Microsoft still dominates the PC market .
But like IBM before it , today 's giant knows that its position is under threat .
The threat to Microsoft comes from online applications , which are changing how people use computers .
Rather than relying on an operating system and its associated application software — bought in a box from Microsoft , and then loaded onto a PC — computer users are increasingly able to call up the software they need over the internet .
Just as Amazon , Google , eBay and other firms provide services via the web , software companies are now selling software as a subscription service that can be accessed via a web - browser .
Salesforce.com , the best known example of this trend , offers salesforce management tools ; other firms offer accounting and other back - office functions ; there are even web - based word - processors and spreadsheets .
This lowers the economic and technical barriers to entry for firms wanting to compete with Microsoft , as well as diluting the advantages the firm gets from controlling how the computer works .
These huge shifts in computing take a very long time , because there is so much inertia in the marketplace — the idea of online applications has taken years to get even this far .
Microsoft is still in a position that most firms would kill for .
Its two main products — Windows and Office — remain fabulously profitable quasi-monopolies .
Even if online applications and open - source software make rapid progress , Microsoft would retain a powerful and profitable position for some time .
For all that , however , online applications clearly threaten the way Microsoft makes its money .
Its licensing agreements are geared for a world where software is a physical product , purchased on discs , and paid for at once or in regular instalments .
But its online competitors charge each user a subscription : some like Google are even supplying software as a free online service , financed by advertisements .
Last month Google acquired the firm that created Writely , a popular online word - processing program that is an obvious potential competitor to Microsoft Word .
Online competitors have also mastered quick development and deployment times that Microsoft cannot match .
Meanwhile open - source software — developed co-operatively and distributed free of charge — is also gaining ground .
George Colony , the boss of Forrester , a technology - research firm , believes Microsoft faces the biggest challenge in the firm 's history : “ Bill Gates knows how to compete with anyone who charges money for products , ” he says , “ but his head explodes whenever he has to go up against anyone who gives away products for free . ”
There are signs that Microsoft is feeling the pressure .
In recent days the firm said that it would have to delay the introduction of both the next version of Windows , called Vista , and the next version of Office until early 2007 .
It also announced yet another re-organisation of its Windows division .
In an effort to respond to the new world it faces , Microsoft had already undergone a thorough management restructuring last autumn .
Its seven business units were recast under three presidents , all of whom hail from the business side , not the technical one .
Oversight of the sprawling Windows division was bundled alongside its internet unit , MSN , an admission of the importance that online services will play in operating systems in future .
At the same time , a relative outsider , Ray Ozzie , a veteran techie brought in last year , has created a stir by questioning why the most successful recent tech products , from Google search to the BlackBerry and the iPod , were not created by Microsoft .
His remit is to see that the company reorients itself by adding an online component into virtually all its products .
The first steps in that direction are “ Windows Live ” and “ Office Live ” .
Microsoft , in short , wants to turn the rise of online software into an opportunity rather than a threat .
“ Before , we sold a cardboard box with a disk in it .
We 're now in a world where it is easier for us to sell add - ons , ” says Charles Fitzgerald , a Microsoft executive .
Fortunately , Microsoft already has within the firm units that have demonstrated the agility and online awareness that the whole company now needs .
The Xbox gaming unit boasts more than 2 m paying subscribers for its Xbox Live service — which allows users to download games and entertainment and chat — and is the model for Windows Live and Office Live .
Meanwhile MSN has captured a small share of the roughly $ 10 billion online advertising market .
But the anchor products of Windows and Office , which in effect subsidise these ventures , have not evolved to reflect the new online era .
So Microsoft now plans to graft subscriptions , downloadable add - ons and advertisements on to its core products .
Again , it portrays this as an opportunity to open up new revenue streams , rather than a defensive tactic .
“ There are three ways to pay for anything in this business : ads , transactions and subscriptions , ” says Craig Mundie , one of Microsoft 's chief technology officers .
“ You 'll see the company offer a full range of different ways to buy our product . ”
The difficulty will be getting the timing right , so that new products do not undermine existing cash cows .
For now , however , too many Microsoft managers are still measured by their success with yesterday 's business model — selling boxes of software .
Microsoft is still formulating its response to the rise of online software .
As one former Microsoft executive explains : the company 's problems are not just technical but organisational .
“ It has a vision but not a roadmap ; it can see the peaks but does n't know how to cross the foothills to get there . ”
Though they were touted as a customer favorite , the real value in regional jets was that these aircraft were bigger and flew farther than turboprops , so regional carriers could fly these planes on routes that major carriers used to fly .
( While the planes were advertised as preferable to turboprops , in reality they replaced larger jets . )
The major airlines could outsource flying to their lower cost regional affiliates .
Fifty - seat regional sets were at the heart of this revolution , because in general airline pilot contracts allowed the majors to pay smaller regional airlines to fly the planes .
Anything larger and the majors would run into contract problems with their pilots union ( since they ’d be contracting out flying of aircraft close to the size that their own pilots flew , something often verboten under collective bargaining agreements ) .
Over 1000 of Bombardier ’s 50 seat Canadair Regional Jets are now in operation , with 152 having been delivered in Bombardier ’s fiscal year 2004 .
Now , though , they ’re all out of orders and they ’ve announced layoffs of 660 employees .
[ S ] ome analysts warned it could be a long time before the company books another order for a 50 - seat RJ .
“ The market is glutted , ” Canaccord Capital analyst Bob Fay said .
There ’s several reasons for that .
RJs , introduced by Bombardier in 1992 , caught on primarily in the U.S. , and by early this decade the market was getting saturated .
Then , major carriers were hit by plunging traffic ( after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks ) and growing competition from discount airlines .
That pushed some into bankruptcy ; more followed after fuel prices soared .
With fewer passengers , cheaper tickets and higher costs , 50 - seat RJs became less economical on some routes .
The industry - wide restructuring also forced unionized pilots to give up concessions , freeing airlines to add more large regional jets to their non-unionized feeder networks .
They were previously limited to RJs with 50 seats or less , which were n’t always optimally - sized for some routes .
After predicting demand would gradually shift to larger RJs , Bombardier and rival Embraer had to throw out their earlier projections , as demand accelerated for the larger planes , and fell off for 50 - seaters .
Airline bankruptcies have another financial consequence for Bombardier , a function of their aggressive sales agreements :
Some of Bombardier ’s largest customers are expected to unleash dozens of 50 - seaters onto the used market .
That will whipsaw back at Bombardier : the company guarantees part of the resale value of its planes , and faces a maximum exposure of US $ 2.6 - billion in the worst case scenario over the next 20 years or so .
Meanwhile , production of Bombardier ’s turboprops ( e.g. Dash - 8s ) – the very planes that regional jets were supposed to send to the dustbin of history – are on the rise .
Offering fewer seats , they were less attractive to major airlines and their regional partners who sought to replace mainline flying .
But the world has turned upside down .
Major airlines have brought down their labor costs , so the cost advantages to outsourcing flying are lower .
Major carrier bankruptcies have meant renegotiating down pilot and pension costs .
Meanwhile , the cost of fuel has risen markedly and turboprops are more fuel efficient .
Those two factors have the pendulum swinging back towards the ‘ old ’ prop planes .
Fast forward and we have a window into a key driver of the financial disaster that is Washington Dulles - based low fare carrier Independence Air .
Independence Air is the airline formerly known as Atlantic Coast , a long - time regional affiliate of United Airlines .
When United entered bankruptcy it sought to reduce its payments to United Express carriers .
Atlantic Coast would n’t take lower fees , and threatened to go off on its own and start a new airline .
Everyone , myself included , thought this was a bluff .
It was n’t .
The airline owned planes and leased its own gates at Dulles , where it was already the largest carrier .
It did n’t have the luxury of starting slowly and building up markets .
It had to fully utilize these assets on day one .
Hence eight flights a day between DC and Lansing , Michigan .
( At the time I thought they should at least split their fleet and operate half as a regional feeder for a major airline and only half as a startup low - fare carrier , allowing them to offer fewer flights at least until they built a customer base ) .
They had planes to fill , and while they advertised heavily in Washington , DC they did n’t want to pay fees to the computer reservation systems like Sabre and Galileo .
If customers booked direct on the Southwest website , they ’d book direct at flyi.com too !
Only not too many customers in Lansing thought of doing so .
Even when Independence had the lowest price , Orbitz or Expedia did n’t display it , and customers did n’t book it .
$ 39 fares to Pittsburgh without any advance purchase or minimum stay requirements were n’t enough to fill planes .
Independence Air finally gave back aircraft and started paying for displays in CRS systems .
But that only put the lie to their fundamental business model – which is that you ca n’t be a low cost carrier if you have high costs , and your costs wo n’t be low if you operate primarily a fleet of regional jets .
( While a 50 - seat regional jet costs less to fly than a 737 , there are also a whole bunch fewer seats to amortize your fixed costs across . )
Only one carrier had tried the low - fare regional jet model before .
Midway Airlines , in its second incarnation ( when it no longer even flew to Chicago ’s Midway airport ) , operated primarily RJs ( along with some Fokkers and a single Airbus ) .
It survived for awhile through its marketing partnership with American , essentially operating as a feeder carrier , since American had scaled back its once near - hub operations at Midway ’s hub of Raleigh .
When that partnership ended , so did Midway ’s revenue stream .
The airline shut down operations in the days after 9/11 , but was given enough cash to make once last failed attempt when the government paid out cash subsidies to all commercial carriers post - 9/11 based on prior year traffic .
Insiders tell me Independence would love to scrap their whole business model , get rid of all the regional jets , and go for an all - Airbus fleet .
But when they entered the third quarter of 2005 with less cash than they lost in the second quarter , they had to give up several Airbus orders , raising cash by getting deposits back .
The future appears to be a convergence between mainline aircraft and regional jets , with the most successful RJs being larger than in the past .
Here ’s the latest move by United :
United Airlines is slowly rolling out its latest weapon in its battle to fight off low - cost carriers and win over business travelers : new 70 - seat regional jets .
Unlike most small jets , these aircraft for short - haul flights of up to three hours on United Express have three seating sections — first class , “ economy plus ” and coach .
In first class , the Embraer 170 twin - engine planes also have extra legroom ( 38 inches ) and meals ( a cold sandwich ) .
Coach passengers get a soft drink and a snack .
Bombardier is a fairly diversified company , making smaller turboprops , larger regional jets , and even firefighting aircraft .
But it ’s not clear how in the world Independence Air can possibly survive …
MANY AMERICANS will be puzzled , and perhaps even a little hurt , that Europeans reacted with such incredulity to this week ’s denial by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the U.S. has been ghosting suspected terrorist prisoners to countries where they are likely to be tortured .
Let me explain .
First ,
Rice ’s statement appeared to have been very carefully lawyered .
On the face of it , an assertion that the U.S. has not transported anyone to a country “ when we believe he will be tortured ” looks pretty watertight .
But “ will be ” is the key phrase .
She should have said “ may be . ”
Second , she said : “ Where appropriate , the United States seeks assurances that the transferred persons will not be tortured . ”
This is risible .
Just how much weight should we attach to a piece of paper signed by a member of , say , the Egyptian , Syrian , Libyan or Moroccan security services promising that the suspect will not be tortured ?
Even a cursory knowledge of the human rights situation in the countries concerned suggests the answer is : not much .
Third , it has recently become apparent that many Americans have a different definition of torture than that which prevails in Europe -- and indeed in much of the rest of the world .
Europeans have watched with incredulity what appears to be a serious debate in the United States about whether “ waterboarding ” ( immersion just short of drowning ) constitutes torture .

Fourth , Rice ’s protestations of innocence have to be matched against the known facts .
There are witnesses .
A small number of people have emerged alive from this secret gulag , and the stories they tell are wholly at odds with the bland assertions in her statement .
Fifth , if cruel , inhumane or degrading treatment is n’t being applied , then what ’s it all about ?
Why has this vast , secret web been constructed , if not to ensure that whatever is happening takes place beyond the reach of U.S. law ?
Finally , of course , some of us have long memories .
We have been here before -- in Chile , El Salvador , Iran under the shah , Vietnam
In his book , “ Decent Interval , ” about the final days of the Vietnam War , former CIA agent Frank Snepp recounts the fate of a high - level communist prisoner , Nguyen Van Tai .
“ Just before the North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon , a senior CIA official suggested it would be better if he disappeared .
The South Vietnamese agreed .
Tai was loaded into a plane and thrown out at 10,000 feet over the South China Sea . ”

I have no doubt that the truth about the secret prisons and the mistreatment of detainees will emerge in due course .
Retired CIA agents will start writing their memoirs .
There will be hearings in Congress , official breast - beating , promises that it will never happen again , perhaps even a resignation or two .
Openness is one of the great strengths of American society .
The weakness , however , is that memories are short and , after 20 years , it happens all over again .

Language features and libraries
Programmers who have been programming in the mainstream languages may , when they see Scheme , feel like ``how can I program with such a language with little features ? ''
The Scheme standard is only 50 pages thin .
Scheme programmers claim it 's the proof of simplicity of the language .
Ok .
But it has minimal I / O functions and you can't even delete files you 've created .
String operations are even inferior than C standard libraries , and without regular expression it is almost useless as a scripting language .
I browse thorough the standard document and found unnecessarily complicated loop syntax , which can't be easily ``break ' ' .
What ?
I should use recursion ?
No joke .
I 'm writing production code , not a CS class assignment .
Oh , well , and where 's object oriented features ?
Nowadays even BASIC has an OO flavor .
How can you recommend a language lacking of it ?
If you want Scheme to be used widely , should you extend the language to meet the modern programming style ?
These claims , although they have some truth , miss the point .
It is true that Scheme does n't have enough library .
No Scheme advocate will write a production code with only the functions in the standard .
On the other hand , most Scheme programmers do n't want to make Scheme bigger [ 2 ] .
This is not a contradiction .
Scheme programmers think the features of the language are different from the features of the library .
This difference is not a kind of thing that I can define formally , but you could get the idea :
To extend a library , you can write functions in the language .
To extend a language , you have to change the implementation of the language .
Of course distinction of these two are blurry , and depends on the language you 're discussing .
A lot of languages require langauge - level extension to add new operators .
If you want to add Perl 's `x ' operator to Java , you should start rewriting syntactic definitions .
The ``feature '' to overload new semantics to the existing operaters are built in to the most languages .
This has never been an issue in Lisp - family languages , for they do not distinguish operators and function calls .
If you want a new operator , or to extend an existing operator , you can always go ahead to write your own .
How about the more basic features , such as calling a procedure ?
Probably this feature is intrinsic in most existing programming languages .
If you have such a low level language that does n't support a procedure call , you can emulate it with some string - substituting macros .
However , such trick tends not to be transparent .
In some assembly languages , a procedure call may be a macro definition of saving current PC to the stack , increment SP and jump to the specified address .
This works until a careless programmer changes SP in unexpected ways .
In order to provide a procedure call as a robust feature without caring how that is implemented , such an operation must be handled in the language itself , and no careless programmer can break it .
Locally scoped variables and recursions are such features of the language as well .
So , what 's the feature set that is necessary and sufficient to abstract computers and allow programmers to express various range of algorithms easily ?
Here 's some answers Scheme is trying to provide .
( of course it 's not all ) .
Built - in garbage collection
Lexical scoping
First - class closure
First - class continuation
Optimized tail calls
Syntactic macros
Do n't be scared if you have n't heard some of the terms .
I 'm not trying to perplex you by using those terms .
I need to use them so that we can discuss in abstract level without concerning implementation details .
Suppose somebody 's discussing the necessity of do - while syntax .
Some say for - syntax is enough , and some argue there are cases that do - while is handy .
However , the point is the necessity of syntax specialized for loops .
And it is known that if you have such things as ``optimized tail calls '' , and with ``syntactic marcros '' , any programmer who wants a special loop syntax can implement his own , and that will be as if it is built - in to the language .
That is , a careless programmer wo n't break things in any way , and it runs as efficient as the built - in features .
This fact makes the discussion of suitable loop syntax irrelevant .
In other words , Scheme provides a basis of language that you can adapt to whatever problem domain you want to solve .
If you want a specialized language to describe your problem , you can have it by just writing libraries , without modifying the language itself .
Actually , writing mini-language for particular problem domain is pretty common in the Lisp world , and Scheme is no exception [ 3 ] .
A bare Scheme seems to provide so little , but it has enough features to grow into your ideal language .
This flexibility is double - edged , however .
People write their own libraries and the compability between those code is lost .
Lisp re-integrates those libraries into CommonLisp .
In Scheme , there 's an effort to define a recommended set of libraries [ 4 ] .
A Legend of Object Oriented Programming
The popular languages claims they support object oriented paradigm .
Even some debate that their support is ``purer '' OO than others .
They claim , by writing in object oriented programming language , you can have benefits such as reusable and understandable code .
Why does n't Scheme have OOP ?
I think there are two answers .
Answer 1 .
Object oriented paradigm is not so intrinsic for a programming language as to become its feature .
Answer 2 .
There are lots of ways to implement object oriented paradigm on a programming language , and the optimal implementation may depend on the problem .
It is better to let programmers select the best fit implementation , rather than to tie programmers to one specific implementation .
Let 's start from explaining the answer 2 .
Think about the way of OOP implementation on C++ or Java .
You get those features .
You can define a class on your code .
An instance is created at run time , from a class as a template .
Each instance allocates a chunk of memory where it keeps its state .
When state changes , it rewrites the memory location .
You define a set of methods that can access internals of the instance .
Some states of instance can't be accessed except by the defined methods .
You can inherit class to change the behavior of the class or adding new state .
Which features are intrinsic to the OOP ?
Some object oriented languages do n't have restriction of access , which is very useful when you develop interactively .
CLOS is well used to large scale development , still does n't restrict access to object slots .
If you really want to restrict the access , you can write so by extending class definitions using metaobject protocol .
Some languages do n't have class and instance .
Self [ 5 ] has only one level , objects , and you can create another object by using the original one as a template , which is instancing and / or subclassing .
In some languages , a class is just an instance of another class .
There 's no reason to bound instance to its class permanently .
In some languages , you can change class of an instance .
It is extremely useful when you have a persistent instance , and you change its classes a lot during development .
Methods need not to belong to a class ; see CLOS .
It has some benefits to make methods belong to class , for it creates a namespace of methods by classes .
But namespace is a different issue from OOP implementation .
In the functional OOP , instances does not have fixed memory to keep state .
Such OOP does n't modify the memory location to change state ; rather , it creates a new instance when state changes , with keeping instance identity for some way .
Oleg Kiselyov showed that if you have OOP with inheritance and you allow subclasses to replace the superclass 's behavior , it is practically impossible to ``separate interface from implementation ' ' [ 6 ] .
He also showed how to avoid it , using a sort of functional approach .
Henry Baker pointed out the ``iterators '' in the OOP languages like C++ and Java shows fundamental weakness of the design , and there are problems that iterators can't solve , which pure functional approach can [ 7 ] .
I 'm not trying to dispute object oriented languages .
I just want to emphasize there are lots of ways to implement object oriented paradigm , and each of them has its own strengths and weakness .
It is not a problem if you choose one of them knowing its merits .
However , no single implementation solves all domains of problems .
It is arguable that , at least it is handy to provide an OOP implementation if it can solve some of the problem domains .
Here we come back to the answer 1 .
Do you really need to extend the language to implement OOP ?
Scheme has more than half dozens of object systems written entirely in Scheme [ 8 ] .
They implement inheritance and method dispatching ; some are pure functional , some have a sophisticated metaobject protocol .
All of them are very concise .
Note that ``written in Scheme ' ' does n't mean it 's slow .
You can compile it , for example .
Or , most Scheme system allows you to extend the system by writing native library , so you can tune the OO system by writing such modules .
It is equivalent to write a string processing library in native code to improve performance [ 9 ] .
The reason that you can implement an object system on Scheme so easily is because of the first - class closure .
In Scheme you can create a function inside another function , and such functions can refer to the variables it can see .
Those variable bindings are valid even you return from the first function .
This is called a first - class closure .
Suppose you 're writing a filter program that reads data from a source and writes result to a sink .
In OOP terms , you define abstract base classes , one is that you can read from , another is that you can write to , and your code takes instances of those classes .
Then , you can take any input and output , no matter if they are associated to files or sockets or on - memory objects , as far as they inherit those base classes .
In Scheme , it is much simpler .
You just define your filter program to take two functions ; one returns new data for each invocation , and the other you can call with the result .
The function can encapsulate what it is operating on .
This effectively allows programmers to create unnamed base class at run time , and you do n't need to think about inheritance .
Programming in Scheme
I 'm not claiming Scheme is perfect .
As I wrote above , Scheme is just a seed unless you grow it toward your problem domain by adding libraries .
This explains why there are so many Scheme implementations .
The basic design strategy may differ among problem domain .
One implementation can't cover all the cases .
Nevertheless , it helps a lot to have a single standard .
You can easily understand the Scheme code which is written for another Scheme implementation , and usually it is easy to port it unless the code uses very weird extention of the specific implementation .
If you want to write production code in Scheme , I recommend you to choose one implementation that is most suitable to your problem domain , and forget about porting .
You can use all the extensions the implementation provides .
Some implementations provides tons of libraries , although each of them covers different domains .
It is silly to limit yourself in the greatest common divisor of all the implementations .
If what the implementation provides is not enough , you can extend it by writing more libraries ( remember , you can even define your own loop syntax as a library extension ) .
It is even better if you feed back your extension to the implementation developers .
If you want your library to be used across many implementations , then , you go through the code to factor out implementation - dependent parts ; usually it should be small .
Fortunately , the basic libraries become standardized by SRFI .
Especially , SRFI - 1 ( List library ) , SRFI - 13 ( String library ) and SRFI - 14 ( Character - set library ) include rich set of functions most Scheme programmers have had written partially before .
If you start now , you should use these SRFIs .
Lots of active implementations support them .
If you know your library is big and nice to be cross- platform , you can take a look at other implementation to see if they have similar interface .
If SLIB 's implementation does n't run efficiently on your implementation , it is good to write SLIB - compatible extention on your implementation ; the other code that depends on yours may run on other implementations using SLIB .
In ``Being Popular ' ' , Paul Graham says it will be important for languages to have well designed rich libraries [ 10 ] .
I do n't know if Scheme will grow towards that ; but I can say Scheme wo n't limit such growth by its language design ; it is the spirit of Scheme , shown in the epigram at the beginning .

However , Scheme has a tradition to take time to see whether such a feature is essential or not before including it to the specification .

D uring a recent visit to an optician , one of my friends was told of an exercise for the eyes by a specialist doctor in the US that he termed as 20 - 20 - 20 . "
It is apt for all of us , who spend long hours at our desks , looking at the computer screen .
I Thought I 'd share it with you .
Step 1
After every 20 minutes of looking into the computer screen , turn your head and try to look at any object placed at least 20 feet away .
This changes the focal length of your eyes , a must - do for the tired eyes .

メンテナンス可能なコードの書き方 著者： Bram Cohen 日本語訳： yomoyomo
以下の文章は 、Bram Cohen による How to Write Maintainable Code の日本語訳である 。
本翻訳文書については、福盛秀雄さんと竹中明夫さんから誤訳の訂正を頂きました。ありがとうございました。
ソフトウェア技術者は、自分が書くコードがどのようにあるべきか分からず悩んでいる。よく知られたエッセイ「悪い方がよい」（訳注：日本語訳）がその良い例である――どうして悪いほうがより良くなれるの？
やっぱり悪いほうが悪いんじゃないの？ さらにややこしいことに、「悪い方がよい」の話は、それが主張しようとしている内容とは正反対の議論の中で引き合いに出されることが多い。
問題は、みんながコードの「美しさ」を判断するのに非常に多様な、また往々にして相反する基準を採用していることだ。美的感覚よりも客観的な、コード品質に対する基準が明らかに必要である。
僕としては、メンテナンス性に基づいてコードを判断することを提案したい。
真にメンテナンス可能なコードは順応性があり、多くの用途に採用できる。たくさんの機能を盛り込んだからというだけで、コードのメンテナンス性が高くなるわけではない――現状使っていない機能を呼び出すのはメンテナンスではなく、それは単なる機能の利用である。メンテナンスとは、新機能を追加したり、既存の機能を変更する場合を指す。元のコードが書かれてからずっと後になって、それもまったく予想できなかった形で行われることが多い。
予想できないことを考慮するというのは矛盾した考え方である――それが何なのか分からないのに、どうやってそれを考慮しろっての？
ありがたいことに、役に立つ具体的なテクニックが多くある。
コードを短 く
コードが短ければ短いほど、メンテナンスの手間は小さくなる。ひたすらプログラムのコードの文字数や行数を数え、何が何でもそれを減らせというのではないが、一般的に言って、短いほうがよい。使用しない関数やテスト文を除去すること――それらは苦労して読むにはゴミに過ぎない。
当然ながら、ライブラリを利用すれば、コードは短くなる。実際には、ライブラリには質がとても悪いため、書き直したほうが良いのも多いが、そうでないライブラリも多いので、可能な場合はライブラリを利用すべきである。
カプセル 化
狭い橋しか接続手段のない明確な境界を作れば、近隣には何も知らせることなく街全体を再構成できる。あまりに交通量が多いと、一つ道をなくすだけで広範囲にパニックを引き起こしかねない。
前提条件を減ら す
どのように呼ばれるかとても分かりにくいコードがあると、他のすべてのコードについてもメンテナンスがより大変になる。例を挙げると、メソッド群が特定の順序でコールされないといけなかったり、特定のメソッドが一度だけコールされないといけない場合がある。こういうのは避けるようにしよう。
メンテナンスしやすいプログラミング言語で書く
メンテナンス性の面で僕が気に入っている言語は
Python だ。シンプルできれいな構文、オブジェクトのカプセル化、充実したライブラリのサポート、そしてオプションの名前付きパラメータがある。メンテナンス性が悪い言語の一例は
Perl である。うん、僕は確かにそう言ったよ。撤回するつもりはない。
テストコードを書 く
新規に書いたコードには何か壊してしまう危険が常にある。走らせるのが簡単で、「全部テストを通った」か「これらのテストに失敗した」か返すテストスイートがあれば、リグレッションの検出と修正がとても容易になる。実装よりもインタフェースをテストするようにすれば、テストコードの変更が必要となる頻度はずっと少なくなる。例えば、オブジェクトを文字列に変換し、それを復元する（「ピクル処理」（pickling）として知られる）コードならば、あるオブジェクトをピクルしてアンピクルし、その結果を元のと比較することでテスト可能である。こうしたテストは、たとえ文字列のフォーマットがまったく変わってしまっても継続して使える。
ツールを作成す る
納屋を建てるには二つやり方がある――ひとつは自分でハンマーを作り、それを納屋を釘付けするのに使うやり方、もう一つは手で納屋を釘付けするやり方である。かかる時間は同じかもしれないが、ハンマーがあれば、将来もう一つ作るときに役に立つ。
安全な技術を用い る
ほぼあらゆる環境においてよりメンテナンス性の高いコードにつながる技術がいくつか存在する。ガーベッジ・コレクションはメモリ割り当てに関するあらゆる頭痛の種をてきめんに取り除いてくれる。単一スレッド化は、スレッドの安全に関するあらゆる頭痛の種を取り除いてくれる。また、インターネットアプリケーションを書く際の第一法則を忘れちゃいけない――「TCP/IP を再実装するなかれ 」
欲求不満を持つようにする
これまで幾度となく、自分は何か「正しく」やろうとして欲求不満を感じ、「そいつをやっつけたい」と思い、より簡潔で適切な対処をしてきた。それがハック止まりなこともあるが、多くの場合それが、自分が欲求不満を感じた正にその問題に対するより柔軟な解決法につながっている。
性能について言い 分
コードの 1 % が、全体の動作時間の x % を占め、近年ではその x が劇的に増加しつつあるという経験則がある。高速なマシンが開発時間よりずっと安価になっていることとあわせると、これは性能が、以前より大きな問題でなくなっているということを示している。より良い性能を目指して努力するのが当然な場合もあるが、性能は他の要素と同じように一つの特徴として見るべきで、ソフトウェアを構築するのに最優先すべきものではない。メンテナンス性のほうがずっと重要なのだ。

From the Bushongo in the Congo comes Bumba , the African Creator God of Vomit .
Yes , vomit .
In the beginning , all was dark .
Then out of the darkness came Bumba , a giant pale - skinned figure .
He was not feeling well .
In fact he had not been feeling well for millions of years .
He was lonely , and the unbearable solitude was making him ill .
Troubled by a ballooning bellyache , he staggered , moaned and vomited up the Sun .
Light burst forth into the Universe — and he choked out the Moon .
The stars came next and then , with a tremendous effort , he threw up the planet Earth .
We do live in a very sick world .
This nauseating display was brought to a triumphant conclusion when , as an encore , he vomited forth nine animals , an assortment of humans , and a pile of diced carrots .
Exhausted from his labors , he sat and watched as the nine creatures multiplied .
After a while , they had evolved into every living thing on Earth .
Which just shows that Creationism and Evolution are both right .
All his creatures were friendly and respectful .
His loneliness abated and finally he was content .
Then Bumba ’s children appeared .
His three strapping sons were Nyonye Ngana , Chonganda and Chedi Bumba .
They added the finishing touches and thus the world was made .
But his fiery daughter Tsetse Bumba was quite a handful and had to be sent to the sky without her supper .
Bumba spoke kindly to his human creations before ascending to Heaven , never to be seen again .
So far as we know , his stomach has never troubled him since .

If you ask a random sample of friends how they became friends , they will probably tell you that they like a lot of the same things and , perhaps more important , that they like the same people .
So they may .
But one of the surest routes to friendship is disliking the same things about other people , according to Jennifer Bosson and three colleagues , who published “ Interpersonal Chemistry Through Negativity : Bonding by Sharing Negative Attitudes About Others ” this past June in the journal Personal Relationships .
“ It ’s not that we enjoy disliking people , ” Bosson , a social psychologist at the University of South Florida , says .
“ It ’s that we enjoy meeting people who dislike the same people . ”
To prove their case , Bosson and her colleagues conducted three separate studies .
In the first , they asked college students to recall the formation of their closest friendships ; in the second , they asked students about the attitudes toward others that they currently shared with their three closest friends .
“ We found a very robust tendency for people to mention more negative than positive attitudes about other people , ” Bosson says , and the closer the friends were , the more negative attitudes toward others that they shared .
Gossipers might shrug at this , but in the third study , Bosson asked whether you could take two strangers and get the same effect .
The researchers told a group of 97 students that they were going to meet someone , then they played them a tape of a conversation between two supposed undergrads , Brad and Melissa .
“ He ’s obviously hitting on Melissa but he ’s also nice to her , ” Bosson explains .
“ We wanted it to be a typical interaction between undergraduates . ”
After listening to the tape , the students were asked to list one thing that they liked about Brad and one thing that they did n’t .
The researchers then told the students that they were going to meet another student who either shared their positive idea about Brad or their negative idea about Brad .
Next they were asked to rate the likelihood of their liking that person .
“ Overall , ” Bosson says , “ people expressed stronger beliefs that they could be friends if they thought they shared their negative evaluation . ”
As for people who like the same things about other people , they “ are n’t doomed , ” Bosson says .
“ They ’ll just have to keep talking until they find something about someone that they both dislike . ”
In a wide - ranging study published in 2000 , the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that ultimately recoverable resources of conventional oil totaled about 3.3 trillion barrels , of which a third has already been produced .
More recently , Cambridge Energy Research Associates , an energy consultant , estimated that the total base of recoverable oil was 4.8 trillion barrels .
That higher estimate — which Cambridge Energy says is likely to grow — reflects how new technology can tap into more resources .
“ It ’s the fifth time to my count that we ’ve gone through a period when it seemed the end of oil was near and people were talking about the exhaustion of resources , ” said Daniel Yergin , the chairman of Cambridge Energy and author of a Pulitzer Prize - winning history of oil , who cited similar concerns in the 1880s , after both world wars and in the 1970s .
“ Back then we were going to fly off the oil mountain .
Instead we had a boom and oil went to $ 10 instead of $ 100 . ”
There is still a minority view , held largely by a small band of retired petroleum geologists and some members of Congress , that oil production has peaked , but the theory has been fading .
Equally contentious for the oil companies is the growing voice of environmentalists , who do not think that pumping and consuming an ever - increasing amount of fossil fuel is in any way desirable .
Increased projections for how much oil is extractable may become a political topic on many different fronts and in unpredictable ways .
By reassuring the public that supplies will meet future demands , oil companies may also find legislators more reluctant to consider opening Alaska and other areas to new exploration .

On a global level , the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , which has coalesced around a price of $ 50 a barrel for oil , will likely see its clout reinforced in coming years .
The 12 - country cartel , which added Angola as its newest member this year , is poised to control more than 50 percent of the oil market in coming years , up from 35 percent today , as Western oil production declines .

Nanotechnology barcodes to quickly identify biological weapons
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
In an effort to detect biological threats quickly and accurately , a number of detection technologies have been developed .
This rapid growth and development in biodetection technology has largely been driven by the emergence of new and deadly infectious diseases and the realization of biological warfare as new means of terrorism .
To address the need for portable , multiplex biodetection systems a number of immunoassays have been developed .
An immunoassay is a biochemical test that measures the level of a substance in a biological liquid .
The assay takes advantage of the specific binding of an antigen to its antibody , the proteins that the body produces to directly attack , or direct the immune system to attack , cells that have been infected by viruses , bacteria and other intruders .
Physical , chemical and optical properties that can be tuned to detect a particular bioagent are key to microbead - based immunoassay sensing systems .
A unique spectral signature or fingerprint can be tied to each type of bead .
Beads can be joined with antibodies to specific biowarfare agents .
A recently developed novel biosensing platform uses engineered nanowires as an alternative substrate for immunoassays .
Nanowires built from sub-micrometer layers of different metals , including gold , silver and nickel , are able to act as " barcodes " for detecting a variety of pathogens , such as anthrax , smallpox , ricin and botulinum toxin .
The approach could simultaneously identify multiple pathogens via their unique fluorescent characteristics .
" The ability to miniaturize and adapt traditional bench - top immunoassay protocols to a fully automated micro- or nano - fluidic chip holds tremendous promise to enable multiplex , efficient , cost - effective and accurate pathogen sensing systems for both biodefense and medical applications , " says Jeffrey B. - H.
Tok , a researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) .
Multi-striped nanowires allow rapid and sensitive immunoassays for biowarfare agent simulants .
( Image : LLNL )
The team , led by LLNL and including researchers from Stanford University , the UC - Davis Center for Biophotonics and Nanoplex Technologies , used multi-striped metallic nanowires in a suspended format to rapidly identify sensitive single and multiplex immunoassays that simulated biowarfare agents ranging from anthrax , smallpox and ricin to botulinum .
The entire assay can be performed within 34 h , thus making it feasible to be employed on a rapid diagnostic platform .
The core of this portable nanotechnology bioweapon - recognition system consists of two parts : Nanowires with a diameter of about 250 nm and a length of about 6 µm are electrochemically formed and then layered with bands of silver , gold and nickel to produce patterns that are similar to the ubiquitous barcodes found on products worldwide .
The other part is an assortment of antibodies , which are essentially glued to the nanowires .
Each type of pathogen calls for a unique antibody which is attached to the nanowires each antibody type with its unique " barcode " .
The reflection pattern and fluorescence from each stripe sequence can later be clearly recognized , similar to a barcode on a retail product .
" In the end you will have a pool of various striped nanowires , each of which will have a unique antibody assigned to it , which is to detect for that particular pathogen , " Tok explained .
To identify pathogens , the barcoded , antibody - carrying nanowires are floated in a neutral liquid called an assay buffer , into which samples of suspected pathogens are injected .
If an antigen associated with a pathogen meets its corresponding antibody , the two will join , creating a nanowire / antibody / antigen sandwich that will fluoresce , or glow , under a special light .
" An important advantage of the system " Tok said , " is that many kinds of barcoded antibodies can be mixed together in the assay buffer liquid , which can be used over and over .
In theory , we could interrogate for as many as 100 different striped nanowires in one single snapshot , which makes the analysis very fast . "
The system not only applies to biowarfare agents , but could also be used during an outbreak of an infectious disease .
Ongoing work at LLNL is focused on incorporating the assay onto a microfluidic device to allow for a portable biosensing system for biological warfare agents .
The platform will ultimately enable an affordable and portable multiplex biodetection system for both first responders and clinicians such that the identity of the infectious agents can be accurately detected and confirmed , thus facilitating point - of - care applications .
In a fundamental discovery that someday may help cure type 1 diabetes by allowing people to grow their own insulin - producing cells for a damaged or defective pancreas , medical researchers here have reported that they have engineered adult stem cells derived from human umbilical cord blood to produce insulin .
The researchers announced their laboratory finding , which caps nearly four years of research , in the June 2007 issue of the medical journal Cell Proliferation , posted online this week .
Their paper calls it " the first demonstration that human umbilical cord blood - derived stem cells can be engineered " to synthesize insulin .
" This discovery tells us that we have the potential to produce insulin from adult stem cells to help people with diabetes , " said Dr. Randall J. Urban , senior author of the paper , professor and chair of internal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and director of UTMB 's Nelda C. and Lutcher H. J. Stark Diabetes Center .
Stressing that the reported discovery is extremely basic research , Urban cautioned : " It does n't prove that we 're going to be able to do this in people -- it 's just the first step up the rung of the ladder . "
The lead author of the paper , UTMB professor of internal medicine / endocrinology Larry Denner , said that by working with adult stem cells rather than embryonic stem cells , doctors practicing so - called regenerative medicine eventually might be able to extract stem cells from an individual 's blood , then grow them in the laboratory to large numbers and tweak them so that they are directed to create a needed organ .
In this way , he said , physicians might avoid the usual pitfall involved in transplanting cells or organs from other people -- organ rejection , which requires organ recipients to take immune - suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives .
Huge numbers of stem cells are thought to be required to create new organs .
Researchers might remove thousands of donor cells from an individual and grow them in the laboratory into billions of cells , Denner explained .
Then , for a person with type 1 diabetes , researchers might engineer these cells to become islets of Langerhans , the cellular masses that produce the hormone insulin , which allows the body to utilize sugar , synthesize proteins and store neutral fats , or lipids .
" But we 're a long way from that , " Denner warned .
Denner said this research , which reflects a fruitful collaboration with co-authors Drs. Colin McGuckin and Nico Forraz at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the United Kingdom , used human umbilical cord blood because it is an especially rich source of fresh adult stem cells and is easily available from donors undergoing Caesarian section deliveries in UTMB hospitals .
" However , " he added , " embryonic stem cell research was absolutely necessary to teach us how to do this . "
Embryonic stem cells have been engineered to produce cardiac , neural , blood , lung and liver progenitor cells that perform many of the functions needed to help replace cells and tissues injured by many diseases , the paper notes .
Among the insights into cell and tissue engineering gained from work with embryonic stem cells , it adds , are those " relevant to the engineering of functional equivalents of pancreatic , islet - like , glucose - responsive , insulin - producing cells to treat diabetes . "
The researchers said they tested adult stem cells in the laboratory to ensure that they were predisposed to divide .
Then they used a previously successful method in which complex signals produced by the embryonic mouse pancreas were used to direct adult stem cells to begin developing , or " differentiating , " into islet - like cells .
As they grew these adult stem cells in the laboratory , the researchers conducted other tests in which the cells to be engineered showed evidence of a characteristic , or marker , known as SSEA - 4 that was previously thought to exist only in embryonic cells .
They also found that , just as embryonic cells have been shown to do , these adult stem cells produced both C - peptide , a part of the insulin precursor protein , and insulin itself .
Confirming the presence of the C - peptide was especially crucial , the researchers suggested , because although insulin is often found in the growth media with which the cells are nurtured and is often taken up by such cells , the presence of the C - peptide proves that at least some of the insulin was produced , or synthesized , by the engineered cells .
In addition to Denner , Urban , Forraz and McGuckin , other co-authors of the study -- entitled " Directed engineering of umbilical cord blood stem cells to produce C - peptide and Insulin " -- include Yvonne Bodenberg , Jiangang Zhao , Margaret Howe and Ronald G. Tilton , all of UTMB 's Stark Diabetes Center and McCoy Diabetes Mass Spectrometry Research Laboratory ; Julie Cappo , formerly of UTMB and now of the Institut Universitaire de Technologie , Montpellier , France ; and John A.

Recently quasi-celebrity P - Diddy and Burger King conducted a master class on how NOT to use the evolving Web 2.0 environment to build a brand .
This cautionary tale is not only highly amusing to those who have any leanings towards schadenfreud , but also speaks volumes about the dangers of trying to import traditional “ talking at consumers ” brand - building approaches into the Brave New World of user - generated content .
This e-disaster started with a tin-ear , cringe - inducing video posted on online video megasite YouTube , which showed famous - for - being - famous P - Diddy going into “ his local Burger King ” to “ have it his way . ”
Implausible as it is that Mr. Bling would actually deign to enter a Burger King , the brand destruction really gets under way when Diddy says that “ Burger King has named me ‘ The King of Music and Fashion . ' ”
This hit another false note , with the wanna - be icon spouting a blatant attempt to connect his brand with that of BK .
The marketing car wreck continues with Diddy going to the counter to order a Whopper “ his way , ” which , apparently , and idiotically , means simply a Whopper with everything on it .
Then he actually gets huffy with the counter guy for asking him ( yes , even you , Diddy ! ) to pay for his Whopper .
Finally , he unleashes the pompous line , “ You know , when two kings get together , they ’ve got to do it in a special way , ” and ends with a promise to feature his celebrity friends and even ( gasp ! ) “ non-famous ” people on his new YouTube channel , which he and Burger King have just “ purchased , ” even though YouTube channels are free .
Go figure .
As terrible as the video was , and as brand - destroying as it was for both Diddy and Burger King , insult was quickly added to injury via the tens of thousands of comments about the video that were posted by YouTube visitors .
The great majority of the posts were , well , let ’s just say “ highly critical ” of the video , often using colorful language and brutal expletives directed at both offending parties .
And , as the final nail in the coffin for this foray into Web 2.0 marketing , a popular parody of the clip by YouTube favorite Lisa Nova skewered the clip so effectively that this parody video was viewed almost as much as the original , only with much more favorable comments and a higher quality rating .
Then , surprisingly enough , the clip itself was pulled , leaving only the tens of thousands of negative comments .
Way to go , Diddy and BK !
The big lesson learned from this misadventure : Marketing in user - generated environments should be spontaneous and honest , not stilted and formulaic .
A good example of this is the Coke +
Mentos clips , where the interaction of these two products produces pyrotechnic results , and which have been great brand - building exercises for both companies .
Of course , those companies had nothing to do with those the creation of those clips , which leads us to next week ’s topic , namely , what companies ARE using the Web 2.0 environment to successfully build their brands .

Merely thinking you got a workout can help you lose weight
Scientists have long known the placebo effect can be incredibly powerful :
Fake pills can ease pain as much as real medication , and rubbing fake poison ivy on people can cause actual rashes .
( There was a terrific story in the New York Times magazine last spring about the placebo effect . )
But now a new study poses an even trippier idea :
That merely imagining that you got a workout can give you the same effects as a real - life one .
A group of researchers led by Harvard ’s Ellen Langer recently performing an interesting experiment .
As a press release describes it :
The researchers studied 84 female housekeepers from seven hotels .
Women in 4 hotels were told that their regular work was enough exercise to meet the requirements for a healthy , active lifestyle , whereas the women in the other three hotels were told nothing .
To determine if the placebo effect plays a role in the benefits of exercise , the researchers investigated whether subjects ’ mind - set ( in this case , their perceived levels of exercise ) could inhibit or enhance the health benefits of exercise independent of any actual exercise .
Four weeks later , the researchers returned to assess any changes in the women ’s health .
They found that the women in the informed group had lost an average of 2 pounds , lowered their blood pressure by almost 10 percent , and were significantly healthier as measured by body - fat percentage , body mass index , and waist - to - hip ratio .
These changes were significantly higher than those reported in the control group and were especially remarkable given the time period of only four weeks .
That ’s just lovely !
Even your weight loss can be affected by your mindset .
The full paper is here online if you want to read it .
I can just imagine the hilarious ways this study will get twisted out of proportion in the popular press .
Someone ’s probably going to start an “ imaginary gym ” , and charge people $ 100 a month merely to tell them that they ’ve had workouts .

Obama defends McCain 's comments WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Democratic National Committee may be demanding an apology from Sen. John McCain about his comments Wednesday about U.S. troops , but one of his fellow presidential contenders on the Democratic side is defending the Arizona Republican .
" The one area I do n't think he can be questioned is his dedication to American troops , " said Sen.
Barack Barack Obama , D - Illinois , who appears to be still smarting from his own gaffe last month about U.S. troops .
Appearing on " The Late Show With David Letterman , " McCain said , " We 've wasted a lot of our most precious treasure , which is American lives . "
Asked Thursday whether McCain should apologize , Obama responded , " We have a duty , a sacred duty , to make sure we are honoring their sacrifice by giving them missions in which they can succeed .
I 'm positive that was the intent in which he meant it . "
Obama added , " It was the same intent that I had when I made my statement , John McCain and I may have disagreements .
The one area that I do n't think he can be questioned is his dedication to American troops .
He 's been there .
He 's done that . "
On his first official campaign trip in Iowa last month , Obama said " We now have spent $ 400 billion and have seen over 3,000 lives of the bravest young Americans wasted . "
Obama , who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , apologized the next day , calling it " a slip of the tongue . "

Flickr is one of the most popular photo - sharing sites
Late last year photographer Rebekka Gudleifsdóttir discovered that eight of her pictures were reportedly being sold by a UK - based online gallery .
She raised the issue on Flickr but a photo and comments were deleted .
Yahoo , which had no involvement in the row over the sale of the photos , has now apologised for its " mistake " .
According to Ms Gudleifsdóttir , online gallery Only Dreemin sold 60 prints of eight of her photos , for more than £ 2,500 , without her consent .
No - one from gallery Only Dreemin was available for comment .
Ms Gudleifsdóttir owns the copyright to all of her photos on Flickr and the website clearly states that people cannot use them without permission .
Withdrew photos
The gallery withdrew the photos for sale but refused to compensate her , she said .
Earlier this month Ms Gudleifsdóttir posted a photograph on Flickr to highlight her problem with the gallery and received more than 450 comments of support from other users .
But the post was removed by Flickr staff on the grounds it could " harass , abuse , impersonate , or intimidate others " .
Ms Guðleifsdóttir said Flickr had also threatened to terminate her account .
The fact remains that they made a profit off my work when they had absolutely no right to
Rebekka Gudleifsdóttir on the alleged use of her work by Only Dreemin
" Freedom of expression ?
Telling the truth ?
Not popular with Flickr administration , apparently , " she wrote on her blog .
The co-founder of Flickr , Stewart Butterfield , has now apologised .
" We screwed up and for that I take full responsibility , " he said .
He added : " It 's important to be clear why the photo was deleted : it had nothing to do with a desire to silence Rebekka from calling attention to the outfit which had reportedly sold copies of her photos without knowledge or permission and without compensating her .
" This had nothing to do with fear of a lawsuit , but with deeply held beliefs about the kind of place we want Flickr to be .
Unfortunately , those beliefs were misapplied in this case , but we still hold the general principle to be true . "
He said Flickr had removed the comments because there was " personal information of the infringing company 's owner and suggestions for how best to exact revenge " .
Ms Gudleifsdóttir told BBC
News that the gallery had told her they had bought the photos from a third party for £ 3,000 in good faith and had been shown " official looking documents " .
" When my lawyer requested that they send a copy of these documents , to prove that this transaction had indeed taken place , we heard no more from them , " she said .
" If I had decided to proceed further with this case , my next move would have been to hire a UK - based lawyer to take them to court .
I however did not feel able to do this , as I simply do n't have the money needed to pay for it . "
She said she had been left feeling " extremely frustrated " by the gallery and had been " offended " by Flickr 's initial reaction to her protest .
But she said she had now accepted Flickr 's apology but would continue to campaign for compensation .
" The fact remains that they [ Only Dreemin ] made a profit off my work when they had absolutely no right to , " she said .
Engineering Samples
Everyone loves Intel ES ( Engineering Sample ) processors , do n't they ?
They used to be very limited units used within Intel and sent to select ( lucky ) reviewers .
For years , everyone has been chasing for these processors since they used to have their multipliers unlocked .
Now , that 's an overclocker 's wet dream come true !
However , that distinction has blurred with the Intel Core 2 processor .
Not only are Core 2 Duo or Core 2 Quad engineering samples far more plentiful , they are easily purchased by all and sundry .
Unlike the " traditional " engineering samples we all love though , their multipliers are not unlocked .
This cuts down a little on their appeal .
Only Core 2
Extreme engineering samples have unlocked multipliers .
In other words , as far as multipliers are concerned , ES processors are similar to retail processors .
Still , they are engineering samples .
Who would n't want them ?
They could have been handpicked for better overclockability .
After all , Intel sends out ES units as review samples .
Intel would n't send lousy processors to reviewers , would they ?
Unfortunately , engineering samples are n't what you think they are .
As far as the Core 2 engineering samples that are sold out there are concerned , they should really be considered defective goods , rather than special handpicked samples .
Cheap & Good ?
The market has seen a remarkable influx of Core 2 engineering samples .
They are sold like OEM processors , without any cooler , packaging or documentation .
They are often available at a lower price than retail or OEM processors , but there are traders who sell them at a premium because of their mystique and purported " hand - picked " status .
However there are some implications you should be aware of before you buy these units .
First of all , these ES processors are meant for internal use by Intel engineers and their partners .
They are not meant for sale at all .
They are generally used in Intel 's quality control tests and remain Intel 's property after the fact .
Hence , those who sell these processors are actually selling stolen property .
As a result , you could be in quite a bit of a fix if these processors do not work right , because :
a ) ES processors are not covered by any warranty .
b)
If you try sending one to Intel for RMA anyway , you will have the unenviable task of explaining to them how you procured a stolen processor .
Even if you are aware of the legal risks in purchasing such processors , you should also be aware that these ES processors have been subjected to incredible stresses during the tests .
As such , many of these processors are inevitably damaged at the end of these tests .
The damage may be relatively unnoticeable , as in minor logic units , or it can be so severe that the processor will not boot up on many motherboards , especially those using Intel 965 and 975 chipsets .
Update @ Dec. 7 , 2008 - A confidential source just informed us that some unscrupulous dealers are flooding the market with ES samples from China .
Many are now sold as OEM ( tray ) processors while others have been repackaged as fake retail processor kits or worse , used in PCs sold to unsuspecting users .
More details to follow in the conclusion of this report .
Update @ Dec. 24 , 2008 - According to another confidential source , the dealers are getting their Core 2 engineering samples from Shenzhen , China .
A mixed batch of 300 Intel Core 2 ES processors was available for just RM 6000 ( ~USD 1714 ) .
That 's an average cost of just RM 20 ( USD 5.70 ) per processor !
Even if most of the ES processors are of the slower E4000 series , that is still very much cheaper than what the actual OEM ( tray ) processors are going for .
More details to follow in the conclusion of this report .

How a homestead might have looked in the flooded area Archaeologists are uncovering a huge prehistoric " lost country " hidden below the North Sea .
This lost landscape , where hunter - gatherer communities once lived , was swallowed by rising water levels at the end of the last ice age .
University of Birmingham researchers are heralding " stunning " findings as they map the " best - preserved prehistoric landscape in Europe " .
This large plain disappeared below the water more than 8,000 years ago .
The Birmingham researchers have been using oil exploration technology to build a map of the once - inhabited area that now lies below the North Sea - stretching from the east coast of Britain up to the Shetland Islands and across to Scandinavia .
' Terrifying '
" It 's like finding another country , " says Professor Vince Gaffney , chair in Landscape Archaeology and Geomatics .
Prehistoric rivers , hills and valleys are mapped off the east coast
It also serves as a warning for the scale of impact that climate change can cause , he says .
Human communities would have lost their homelands as the rising water began to encroach upon the wide , low - lying plains .
" At times this change would have been insidious and slow - but at times , it could have been terrifyingly fast .
It would have been very traumatic for these people , " he says .
" It would be a mistake to think that these people were unsophisticated or without culture ... they would have had names for the rivers and hills and spiritual associations - it would have been a catastrophic loss , " says Professor Gaffney .
As the temperature rose and glaciers retreated and water levels rose , the inhabitants would have been pushed off their hunting grounds and forced towards higher land - including to what is now modern - day Britain .
The rising water levels began to remake the coastline " In 10,000 BC , hunter - gatherers were living on the land in the middle of the North Sea .
By 6,000 BC , Britain was an island .
The area we have mapped was wiped out in the space of 4,000 years , " explains Professor Gaffney .
So far , the team has examined a 23,000 - sq - km area of the sea bed - mapping out coastlines , rivers , hills , sandbanks and salt marshes as they would have appeared about 12,000 years ago .
And once the physical features have been established , Professor Gaffney says it will be possible to narrow the search for sites that could yield more evidence of how these prehistoric people lived .
These inhabitants would have lived in family groups in huts and hunted animals such as deer .
The mapping of this landscape could also raise questions about its preservation , says Professor Gaffney - and how it can be protected from activities such as pipe - laying and the building of wind farms .

What are these ?
THE French turned out en masse on Sunday May 6th to elect Nicolas Sarkozy as their new president , handing him 53 % of the vote , next to 47 % for his Socialist rival , Ségolène Royal .
Ms Royal conceded , just one minute after the first results were broadcast on election night , leaving the Gaullist 52 - year - old former lawyer to take to the stage at a theatre in central Paris .
Speaking of the " immense emotion " he felt , he declared that his was " not the victory of one France against another " , and promised " to be the president of all the French . "
Polls had made Mr Sarkozy the favourite for weeks , but the margin often looked narrow .
Two elements seemed to have lifted his score late in the campaign .
One was his performance during a televised debate with Ms Royal , in which he kept his cool and stuck to his policy briefs , while she lashed out at him with surprising aggression .
The other was that , while Ms Royal made an abrupt turn away from her political base on the left in a bid to court the centre ground , Mr Sarkozy kept to his first - round message : essentially , that France has to change , that work needs to be valued , effort rewarded , and authority strengthened .
In the end , he won not only some two - thirds of the far - right vote , but half of the centrist vote too — despite the decision of François Bayrou , the centrist leader , not to back Mr Sarkozy .
It was , in many ways , a remarkable performance .
Mr Sarkozy was , until a few weeks ago , a minister in an unpopular government under a tired president , Jacques Chirac .
This was the Socialist Party 's election to lose .
As it is , the Gaullists have now won three consecutive presidential polls , and are set for a run of 17 years in power .
Mr Sarkozy 's victory was built on a message of change — rupture is his favourite word — that many analysts considered far too risqué for the supposedly conservative French .
This election has shown that , given leadership and a charismatic candidate , they too are ready to adapt their country .
By sheer drive and political cunning , Mr Sarkozy managed to build up an electoral machine , through the party that Mr Chirac originally founded , and reinvent himself — 30 years after entering electoral politics — as a force for change .
The question now is how far Mr Sarkozy will be able to implement some of the controversial reformist elements of his programme .
In his election - night speech , he declared that " the French people have chosen change . ”
Among the first reforms that he intends to bring about are labour - market measures : he plans to secure minimum service on public transport during strikes ; to break the big five unions ' stranglehold on union representation ; to change the unemployment - benefit rules to penalise those who refuse two job offers ; and to introduce a single job contract with progressive rights .
Unlike President Chirac , who in 1995 also tried to bring about reform but had been elected on an uncontroversial promise to " heal the social fracture " , Mr Sarkozy arrives in office with a clear mandate to change .
Not only was his score high , but turn - out — at about 85 % — was too .
Mr Sarkozy knows that he has to move fast to capitalise on that .
On minimum service for trains and buses , for instance , he says that he will let the unions and bosses ' organisations try to negotiate a deal until the end of the summer ; after that , in the absence of agreement , he will legislate .
There will doubtless be resistance , and strikes and street protests are widely predicted .
Indeed , on election night there were already clashes between riot police and anti-Sarkozy protesters .
Mr Sarkozy has until May 16th to name a prime minister — François Fillon is tipped for the job — who will form an interim government until legislative elections are held in June .
The Socialist Party also needs to prepare to defend its parliamentary seats .
But it is now under strain , with its moderate members and its left - wing already blaming each other for defeat .
It may be that Mr Sarkozy 's victory , and the humiliation of the third consecutive presidential defeat , is what it takes to force the Socialists finally to break with the past and construct a modern party of the left .
The Economics of Martha Stewart Living
BusinessWeek recently reported on the creative product - placement deals that daytime TV shows employ .
The highlight of the article is Martha Stewart — the self - described “ most trusted guide to stylish living ” — discussing with pure candor her capitalizing ways : “ I like to inform people about good things . ”
Stewart ’s syndicated NBC show , which airs daily at 4 PM , is currently lagging in the ratings and can only charge advertisers about $ 10,000 for a 30 - second spot , as opposed to $ 18,000 for The View or a staggering $ 100,000 for Oprah .
But if an advertiser spends at least $ 250,000 total on ads during a season , the money also buys a special “ branded segment ” on the show , along with mentions in Stewart ’s magazine and radio broadcast .
It seems the idea is working : airtime for Martha Stewart Living is sold out through the 2007 - 08 season .
Latecomers or advertisers who do n’t want to invest the full $ 250,000 can also buy a “ one - time in - show oral mention with product close - up , ” as BusinessWeek calls it , for $ 100,000 , while a two - minute segment that “ works in an advertiser ’s talking points ” starts at $ 250,000 .
It would be interesting to see what Stewart ’s fans think of the system .
Do they enjoy her product “ suggestions ” and appreciate her candor ?
Or might the product placements have something to do with her lag in the ratings ?
I turned and saw Nikita climbing a drain pipe to the roof of one of the stores .
While I was writing “ Spider - Man ” in my notebook , his shadow as he leaped from one roof to another passed over the page .
Jeff Belle has an office in Paris , where he handles fire - department business .
To speak with him , I brought a translator , Susan Chace , an American novelist who lives in Paris .
Belle , who is forty - five , is small and wiry .
He has a round face , a sharp chin , dark eyes , and black , cropped hair with flecks of gray .
He was wearing a fireman ’s uniform , a dark - blue garment like a jumpsuit .
The legs ended just above the tops of his black combat boots .
Over the uniform , he wore a long coat that had “ Pompier de Paris ” written on the back .
We met at his office , then he took us to an empty , low - ceilinged room with a bar and an espresso machine and some tables stacked on top of each other .
On the wall were photographs of firefighters .
Jeff said that David was a restless boy .
“ He was always exercising in front of the TV , ” he said .
“ He still takes whatever ’s next to him , maybe a big book , and starts lifting it .
He ca n’t sit still .
He lives with it . ”
The brothers did not see much of each other until David , at fourteen , moved to Lisses to live with his mother .
Then Jeff , who was already a fireman , began to look after him .
He would show him how to climb ropes and perform gymnastic maneuvers , and David would go off and do it his own way .
Now and then , David would go to the climbing wall in Lisses with his father and show him things he had taught himself , and Raymond , thinking that he was being encouraging , would say , “ I could do that when I was nine . ”
Through Jeff , David was exposed to the methods of Georges Hébert , a French sports theorist , whose motto was “ Be strong to be useful . ”
Hébert believed that modern conveniences such as elevators were debilitating .
He thought that Africans he had met while travelling were healthier and stronger than Europeans , and that the proportions of the bodies he saw in Greek and Roman statues were ideal .
The philosophies and the exercises he developed , which are part of a French fireman ’s training , were also meant to cultivate courage and discipline .
Inspired by Hébert , a Swiss architect developed an obstacle course called a parcours .
“ David took Hébert ’s ideas and said , ‘ I will adapt it to what I need , ’ ” Jeff said .
“ Instead of stopping at a reasonable point , he just kept going . ”
David was briefly a fireman recruit , until he hurt his wrist .
While he was recuperating , he started thinking things over and saw that the life of a fireman had too many rules , and not enough action , and he decided to join the Marines , but he did n’t find the same values among them , the “ traditional values . ”
He left the Marines and went to India , where he stayed for six months .
When he came back to Paris , he was twenty - four , and he did n’t know what to do with himself .
“ He came to see me at my house , ” Jeff said , “ and he told me he did n’t know where his life was going .
He was only interested in parkour .
You could be a super policeman or a firefighter using it , but you ca n’t earn your living , because there ’s no championship .
I said , ‘ Maybe if we film what you ’re doing . ’ ”
It was 1997 , and Jeff was involved in planning an annual ceremony in which recruits perform firefighting drills .
He decided that David should put on a show .
He told him to get a group together , so that he would n’t look insignificant by himself .
David collected two of his cousins and some other kids from the neighborhood , including Sébastien Foucan , with whom he ran around doing parkour .
Jeff choreographed a routine for them .
They dressed as ninjas and called themselves the Yamakasi .
“ It means ‘ strong spirit ’ in the language of Zaire , ” Jeff said , “ but it sounded Asian . ”
During the show , David climbed a tower and did a handstand at the top .
He also scaled a fireman ’s ladder and did a backflip from it .
After the demonstration , David began getting invitations to perform .
Jeff is proud of David , but worries about him .
“ This was a kid who refused any kind of system , who just wanted to live his life , ” he says .
“ If he ’s surrounded by the right people , he can do what he wants .
Ordinary life really upsets him , though , because this world the rest of us live in is not where he finds his pleasure .
He ’s easily disturbed by ordinary things .
But he ’s also asking , ‘ Why am I doing this parkour ? ’
All his family who did this physical stuff were doing it for a reason , but he ’s asking , ‘ Why am I doing this , what does it mean ? ’ ” Jeff added , “ He ’s simple in his purposes .
He does n’t like talking very much .
He ’s someone who is looking for his way . ”
I asked what sort of routines David observed in his training .
Jeff shook his head .
“ He ’s still eating Big Macs and drinking Coke , ” Jeff said .
“ He likes chicken sandwiches .
He trains when it comes to him .
He ’s usually sleeping in the morning .
He ’s really a night guy . ”
We arranged to meet with David the following day , in Lisses , where he was staying with his mother .
When David is in France , he lives either with her or with Jeff .
“ He does n’t really have a lot of money , ” Jeff said , “ although people think that he does . ”
He added that David was very easy to live with .
“ We do n’t know about the inside of his head , but outside he ’s very neat .
His room is always in perfect shape . ”
The next day , I took a taxi with Susan Chace to Lisses , about half an hour south of Paris .
When we were under way , the driver asked why we were going there .
Chace said , “ To see David Belle . ”
The driver nodded .
Chace asked if he knew who Belle was , and the driver said , “ Of course .
Il est unique . ”
We left the highway and , following Jeff ’s directions , went around a rotary and came to a collection of low , flat - roofed , two - story buildings , like shoeboxes , painted light brown .
We stopped in front of Belle ’s building .
Chace knocked , the door opened , and the driver said , “ That ’s him ! ”
Belle had his chin tucked slightly , like a man looking out from under the brim of a hat .
He had dark hair cut short like a pelt and a thin , asymmetrical face , with a sharp chin and a hook nose .
He was wearing a red fleece top and jeans .
As I paid the driver , Jeff Belle drove up behind us .
We went into the apartment .
The kitchen was by the door , and there was a living room beyond it with a circular stairway leading up .
In the living room was David ’s girlfriend , Dorine Sane .
David had his fleece top zipped to his chin — he had a sore throat — and he seemed subdued .
He had just come back from three weeks in the Czech Republic , where he was making “ Babylon AD , ” which stars Vin Diesel , and is based on a French science - fiction novel .
David plays the head of an Internet gang that does parkour , and he choreographed scenes for ten actors .
Jeff and David spoke for a few moments , and then Chace said that David was going to rest , while Jeff took us to the Dam du Lac .
Outside , we crossed a parking lot , then took an asphalt path through a park .
Several hundred yards off , the Dam du Lac rose up against the side of a small lake .
It was the color of sandstone and had the shape of an arch .
“ David was afraid of it in the beginning , ” Jeff said .
“ Now he walks on it like it was solid ground . ”
The lac turned out to be made of concrete .
As we walked along the edge , ducks paddled away from us .
For some time now , a fence has enclosed the wall , but it was easy to climb around it .
The wall was slightly concave , and the top was intersected by a horizontal slab , which had roughly the dimensions of a king - size mattress and was curled up at one edge .
Here and there on the face of the wall were footholds and handholds in the form of slots the size of bricks .
On one side was a rectangular box , open at one end , like a cave , which is called the cabana .
Below , sticking straight out from the wall and about fifteen feet tall , was a form in the shape , more or less , of a hammer .
Jeff said that the first maneuver David had done was a backflip from the cabana to the hammer .
About twenty feet from the ground was a sign saying , “ Escalade Interdite . ”
On it were signatures .
“ The kids climb up and sign their names , ” Jeff said .
“ David also went barefoot on it . ”
He pointed at the top .
“ And at night sometimes he slept up there . ”
At risk of annoying everyone else by stealing too much real estate here , I could n't resist drawing attention to a very interesting paper in Science tonight by Tilman et al .
Here 's the abstract :
So basically , we should return much of the Midwest to prairie and then mow it regularly to make biofuels !
A few other fair - use snippets from the full paper ( which is behind a paywall alas ) :
We performed an experiment on agriculturally degraded and abandoned nitrogen - poor sandy soil .
We determined bioenergy production and ecosystem carbon sequestration in 152 plots , planted in 1994 , containing various combinations of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , or 16 perennial herbaceous grassland species ( table S1 ) ( 10 ) .
Species composition of each plot was determined by random draw from a pool of species .
Plots were unfertilized , irrigated only during establishment , and otherwise grown with low inputs ( 10 ) .
The 16 - species plots are the highest diversity , or the LIHD ( low - input , high - diversity ) , treatment .
All plots were burned in early spring to remove aboveground biomass before growth began .
Soil samples , collected before planting in 1994 and again in 2004 , determined carbon sequestration in soil .
Plots were sampled annually from 1996 to 2005 for aboveground biomass production .
The gross bioenergy yield from LIHD plots was 68.1 GJ ha - 1 year - 1 . Fossil energy needed for biomass production , harvest , and transport to a biofuel production facility was estimated at 4.0 GJ ha - 1 year - 1 ( table S2 ) .
Different biofuel production methods capture different proportions of bioenergy in deliverable , usable forms ( Fig. 2 ) ( 10 ) .
Cocombustion of degraded land LIHD biomass with coal in existing coal - fired electric generation facilities would provide a net gain of about 18.1 GJ ha - 1 as electricity ( 11 ) .
Converting LIHD biomass into cellulosic ethanol and electricity is estimated to net 17.8 GJ ha - 1 ( 12 ) .
Conversion into gasoline and diesel synfuels and electricity via integrated gasification and combined cycle technology with Fischer - Tropsch hydrocarbon synthesis ( IGCC -FT ) is estimated to net 28.4 GJ ha - 1 ( 10 , 13 ) .
Across their full life cycles , biofuels can be carbon neutral [ no net effect on atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases ( GHG ) ] , carbon negative ( net reduction in GHG ) , or carbon sources ( net increase in GHG ) , depending on both how much CO2 and other greenhouse gases , expressed as CO2 equivalents , are removed from or released into the atmosphere during crop growth and how much fossil CO2 is released in biofuel production .
Both corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel are net carbon sources but do have 12 % and 41 % lower net GHG emissions , respectively , than combustion of the gasoline and diesel they displace ( 14 ) .
In contrast , LIHD biofuels are carbon negative , leading to net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 across the full life cycle of biofuel production and combustion ( table S3 ) .
LIHD biomass removed and sequestered more atmospheric CO2 than was released from fossil fuel combustion during agriculture , transportation , and processing ( 0.32 Mg ha - 1 year - 1 of CO2 ) , with net life cycle sequestration of 4.1 Mg ha - 1 year - 1 of CO2 for the first decade and an estimated 2.7 to 3 Mg ha - 1 year - 1 for subsequent decades .
GHG reductions from use of LIHD biofuels in lieu of gasoline and diesel fuel are from 6 to 16 times greater than those from use of corn grain ethanol and soybean biodiesel in lieu of fossil fuels
To put this in context , here 's global land use :

Story Highlights • Hillary Clinton , John McCain and most others in Congress did n't read document
• Newspaper : Six senators , a few House members logged as reading report
• Most in Congress were briefed several times , read summary of report
• Report was wrong about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new biography of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has once again raised the issue of whether members of Congress read a key intelligence report before the 2002 vote to authorize war in Iraq .
Clinton did not read the 90 - page , classified National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq , according to " Her Way : The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton . "
For members of Congress to read the report , they had to go to a secure location on Capitol Hill .
The Washington Post reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of House members were logged as reading the document .
The Clinton biography , written by New York Times reporters Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. , summarizes the intelligence estimate , which combined reports of U.S. intelligence agencies about Iraq .
Clinton , a New York Democrat , was briefed on the intelligence report multiple times , a spokesperson told CNN .
Clinton is one of six presidential candidates who were in the Senate in October 2002 who voted for the resolution to authorize the invasion of Iraq .
Candidate and then - Sen . John Edwards " read and was briefed on the intelligence " while sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee , a spokesman said .
Edwards has called his vote for the 2002 resolution a mistake .
Another Democratic candidate , Sen. Joseph Biden , said he read the report .
A spokesman for presidential candidate Sen. Christopher Dodd said the Connecticut Democrat did not read the document , either .
Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain of Arizona also voted in favor of the resolution without reading the report .
A spokesman for McCain told CNN his boss was briefed on the document " numerous times , and read the executive summary . "
Other candidates were not available for comment Monday .
Misleading report
The National Intelligence Estimate concluded that the United States had " compelling evidence " that Iraq was restarting its efforts to develop a nuclear bomb and had concealed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons from U.N. inspectors after the cease - fire that ended the 1991 Persian Gulf War .
That was wrong , but that was n't established until after a U.S. - led army toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein 's government in April 2003 .
The intelligence report did contain passages that raised questions about the weapons conclusions , said John McLaughlin , then deputy director of the CIA .
" I think if someone read the entire report , they would walk away thinking the intelligence community generally thinks he has weapons of mass destruction , but there are quite a bit of differences , " he said .
McLaughlin , now a CNN contributor , said dissenting views by the State Department , Department of Energy and the Air Force made up about 10 to 12 pages of the report -- but critics say those dissents were not highlighted .
Biden , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said he held a closed session at which members could read the report along with top CIA officials .
( Watch Sen .
Biden say he could n't vote against funding the war and put troops in greater jeopardy )
Biden told CNN that he read the dissents in the report and he " spoke to the ones who dissented . "
Biden ended up voting for the resolution , but argued that he was casting a vote " to avoid a war . "
" It was a vote to give the authority to the president to avoid war by keeping the pressure on Saddam Hussein , " the Delaware Democrat said Monday .
He said Bush initially told Congress he would allow inspectors to certify whether Iraq had dismantled its weapons programs .
" The president misused the power we gave him under that resolution , " said Biden .
Bush said war was necessary because Iraq was deceiving weapons inspectors and had demonstrated its unwillingness to disarm .
A U.S. - led survey later concluded that Iraq had attempted to conceal some weapons - related research from the United Nations , but had abandoned its chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs in the 1990s .
I am growing increasingly tired of paying increasingly high " credit card surcharges " which are little more than a front for certain companies to make extra money at the consumer 's expense .
Although it is as a consumer faced with notices such as " use a credit card and you will be charged a minimum £ 4.95 surcharge " which prompts me to write this , let me give some background in my experience .
During the height of the dot com boom I was an e-commerce consultant .
When the market peaked in early 2000 I was in the middle of gaining e-commerce accreditation for the Scottish Tourist Board 's project Ossian .
Scottish Tourism employs about 8 % of the Scottish workforce , and the industry is worth approx £ 4.5 billion to the Scottish economy .
Following my stint there , through three separate e-commerce platforms I went on to be Project Manager for the tesco.com grocery site , the world 's most successful online grocer .
I wo n't bore you with further figures , you can read them here .
So I have a bit of an inside perspective on the whole credit card transaction fee nonsense .
These days , I 'm currently self employed and doing quite well.visitscotland.com when I was there only took 10 % of the value of a booking for automated sales ( via the web ) .
Therefore for a typical £ 40 online booking for a night in a cheap hotel , the actual value visitscotland.com would process would be £ 4 .
The remainder was paid direct to the establishment .
No credit card fee was charged by visitscotland.com .
Indeed if you compare this £ 4 charge it is n't that far off the core price of some Easyjet flights if you book far enough ahead .
Yet , Easyjet charge a minimum credit card fee of £ 4.95 for an online booking - a fee that visitscotland.com , also in the travel business , managed to do entirely without .
If it was n't for the government taxes , the credit card fee would be pretty much doubling the cost of some Easyjet flights .
Visitscotland.com incidentally did charge a 2.5 % credit card fee for self catering bookings via the contact centre after pressure from the industry , however for serviced accommodation bookings there was no fee yet both bookings were going through the same payment gateway ( SecureTrading ) .
Apart from putting the Self Catering industry in a bad light ( see bank of Self Catering Ltd ) , it is inconsistent that a £ 500 hotel booking should have no charge but a £ 500 self catering booking had a 2.5 % fee , yet the payment for the latter was often taken several months in advance .
When I was in Skye last year , the local shop Ragamuffin had a £ 50 minimum for a credit card transaction .
This would have been bad enough in the middle of Edinburgh where their other shop is , surrounded by banks and cashpoint machines and alternative methods of payment .
However , in my case I was in Armadale , Skye .
Approximately 40 minutes round trip by car ( if you have one ) to the nearest town ( Broadford ) where there is a cash machine .
So cash was at a premium as I did n't fancy spending my holiday driving up and down taking money out and clearly there were some things such as ice creams that I genuinely needed cash for .
Like many people , I do n't ordinarily carry a cheque book either as so few places accept them now , however you can see from this list ( PDF ) that for a business paying in more than one cheque at a time , the additional cost is a mere 25 p per cheque .
This 25 p is a charge I would happily pay if the alternative is a 40 minute car journey .
25 p is also a lot more reasonable than the £ 4.95 easyjet credit card charge - bearing in mind that cheques are a manual payment and credit cards are automated it certainly makes me question how reasonable a credit card charge should be .
I also do n't accept the concept of a " minimum fee " for a credit card transaction as the fees for credit cards are usually either a flat fee per month or a fixed percentage per transaction , meaning that 100 £ 1 transactions would cost the merchant the same as 1 £ 100 transaction in fees .
Let 's now look at the actual charges merchants pay that they use to justify these " minimum transaction amounts " , " credit card fees " and so on .
Here is a selection of popular e-commerce payment solutions .
At the high end , it 's 3.8 % per transaction but 1.5 % - 2.5 % is more typical and as the article shows , for a flat fee of £ 20 per month you can get away with no transaction charges at all .
Indeed this can be as low as £ 10 for a lower volume mail order set up .
For the top end , Tesco uses Commidea .
Commidea also caters for the smaller retailer and like Protx charges no fees per transaction , just a low monthly fee .
So with either system it does n't matter how much the customer spends .
Indeed , I would like to put small amounts on my card to keep all my business spending in one place .
JD Wetherspoon 's in Belfast however would n't let me put £ 4.99 for a meal on my business card due to their £ 5 minimum card fee .
Perhaps they are with the wrong payment system ?
Clearly there is a lot of variation in card charges to retailers ( merchants ) but a simple bit of shopping around can round these up into one simple , fixed fee .
Nowhere have I seen any card processing company that charges a minimum card fee of £ 4.95 , so there appears to be no justification for Easyjet 's excessive charges .
So consumers , if you feel that " minimum credit card transaction value " or " credit card surcharge " or the like are annoying you , just vote with your feet and shop elsewhere and give the retailer a copy of this posting .
After all , if the retailer chooses a more cost effective payment method , not only will we hopefully see minimum fees and surcharges disappear but retailers themselves will move to more cost effective solutions and make more money generally .

Stocks closed lower on Wall Street yesterday after a shortened holiday trading session that was soured by news of the dollar ’s woes .

“ To dismiss this as a technical correction is to overlook the structural reasons why the U.S. dollar is having a very hard time these days , ” said Hans Redeker , global head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas in London .
Economists say the United States is in a vulnerable position compared with its global competitors .
While the most recent data show that the trade imbalance tightened in September , the decline was largely a result of falling oil prices .
The deficit between what Americans import and export was a negative $ 586.2 billion for the first nine months of the year , and it remains on track to break last year ’s record of a negative $ 716.7 billion .
The biggest chunk by far represents imports from China .
The trade gap will be one of the major issues that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and other top Bush administration officials discuss next month when they travel to China .
Mr. Paulson , along with a delegation that will include Ben S. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , is expected to press Chinese officials on a number of economic issues , from cracking down on piracy to allowing the Chinese yuan to trade more freely in currency markets .
Analysts said that the dollar ’s drop yesterday , which was accelerated by orders from traders to sell automatically once it fell past $ 1.30 against the euro , reflected a growing anxiety over Chinese economic policy .
China ’s central bank holds a large amount of American currency , and speculation has intensified recently that it could begin selling off dollars to avoid being burned if the dollar collapses .

I ’ve often been asked about my process for tweaking photos .
I thought I ’d use one of my favorite photos and show how I took it from initial capture to final public display .
I had forgotten how far I had taken this image from its initial capture :
As with all tools , there are many ways to accomplish the same thing .
I found a set of techniques that work really well for taking a photo that does n’t have the best light or is n’t shot at the perfect time of day and amping it up .
You may have better or different techniques to accomplish similar things and I say to you things like , “ Keep the hope alive . ”
And : “ Awesome ! ”
I generally do n’t like writing Photoshop tutorials , because my assumptions about everything are usually wrong .
In this case , I wanted to write a fairly straightforward tutorial , but after showing a draft to Heather , decided to rework it substantially , with more screenshots and better explanations of the steps .
This is not a beginner tutorial for Photoshop .
This is an advanced tutorial .
I hope it does n’t frustrate you or confuse you .
Some assumptions
— You have access to Photoshop and know your way around some of the palettes .
In particular , the Layer Palette .
There are several buttons at the bottom of the Layer Palette .
There are two that I ’ll be making reference to ; 1 ) The New Layer / Duplicate Layer and ; 2 ) the Adjustment Layer button .
When I mention duplicating layers below , I mean you select the thumbnail / icon of the layer you want to duplicate and drag it to the New Layer button ( # 1 in the above illustration ) .
This duplicates the layer and positions it above the layer you clicked and dragged .
— You have a photo that you ’d like to tweak .
— You are n’t afraid to play around with sliders and settings .
Taking the picture
I might muck about with some settings on the camera , but I want to capture the vision in my head as close as I can while I ’m in the moment .
I might think about post - processing , but that ’s pretty rare .
I usually make a mental note of the kind of thing I want , click the shot and move on .
This is n’t always the best way to work , but it ’s how the image I ’m using in this tutorial evolved .
So here ’s our starter image :
I always keep a layer in Photoshop of my original file , untouched and at the bottom of the stack in the Layer Palette .
So the first thing I do is select the background layer and drag it to the New Layer button .
This creates a layer of the same image that I can edit , calm in the assurance that if I do anything untoward , I can revert to my original without too much pain .
After doing this , the Layers Palette looks like this :
The photo has pretty flat light and not a lot of mood .
I love the low angle and of the six shots I took of the building and hydrant , this image shows the most promise by far .
That pesky tall grass really is distracting .
In my first sharing of this photo , I left it in throughout the processing .
Big mistake .
It ’s out .
I ’m going to use the stamp tool and get rid of a few strands of tall grass .
Since this is optional on whatever you might be working on , I ’ll skip all the technique and screenshots , as that would likely be enough information to be its own tutorial .
After several hours of painstaking use of the stamp tool it ’s time to perform an Unsharp Mask :
This is an entirely subjective thing .
Use the three sliders to make your image sharper , without making it look like it came out of a digital camera circa 1997 .
Which would look like ass .
Avoid looking like ass .
I use the Amount and Radius settings to get what I want .
There are times when the Threshold slider can help , but for speed , it ’s all about a . 4 to .9 pixel radius and a setting between 80 % and 150 % on the Amount slider .
As with all the steps , the values you might use depend on your image resolution and degree of sharpness you want :
With that , we are here :
Note that because this is a screenshot of a large image , you might not see much difference between the previous image and this one ; when you do it yourself , you ’ll see a dramatic difference that will change how you look at photos .
Time to Blur
The image is still very flat and there is very little contrast .
Let ’s take the layer we did the work on and duplicate it by selecting the layer and dragging it to the New Layer button .
This will create the third layer in the image on top of the source / Background and the copy of the source we just finished working on .
The Layers Palette looks like this :
Apply a Gaussian Blur :
You ’ll want to vary this based on how large your source image is .
The larger the image , the higher you can set the blur .
Our image now looks like this :
Bear with me .
You ’ll take this layer and change it ’s layer settings in the Layer Palette .
We ’ll set the transparency mode to Multiply by clicking on the drop down menu that says “ Normal ” and selecting Multiply :
Still a little dark :
Do n’t panic yet .
Set the Opacity of this blurred layer to 33 % .
This is in the top section of the Layer Palette next to the transparency drop down menu :
I know .
Still a little dark , but we ’re building a foundation .
Of love :
This is where the tutorial will take a turn for the fourth dimension .
Masking images can be daunting and takes some time to get used to the concept and how layers can work for us .
Think of the layers as a sandwich .
The layer we will mask is the cheese layer of the sandwich .
We ’re going to take that cheese layer and turn it into Swiss cheese .
We ’ll use the mask to make holes in the image that will allow what is underneath to show through .
This step will rectify the darkness somewhat and is going to require some layer masking and painting on the masked portion of the layer .
To do this , we ’ll duplicate the blurred layer ( the layer I ’ve called “ blur ” ) and add a Layer Mask to this new layer , selecting “ Reveal All ” in the submenu :
The effect we ’re trying to get is to make the blacks darker and then mask out the parts of the image we want to keep light .
This is where the drama and focal points come into play .
In our case , the building and the hydrant are the two focal points we want to emphasize .
This is what I saw in my head when I took the shot and what I want to achieve with the rest of the steps .
Your Layer Palette should have a mask icon next to the thumbnail of the image :
I took this shot after I did the work , to show what a Layer mask icon in the Layer Palette looks like .
I used the brush tool and selected a basic brush with a blurred fall - off :
Make sure you select the mask icon in the Layer Palette before you start brushing , as you ’ll destroy your masterpiece and want to throw things .
Important : Masks are painted in grayscale , so I usually paint with black selected as the brush color and use varying flow rates and brush sizes to mask .
In this case , I ’ve painted black over the building and the hydrant .
You ’ll notice that it masks out the dark layer we just created and reveals the lighter layer underneath :
We ’ve started to make the image more dramatic .
Now we need to work with Colors , Curves and Levels .
We ’ll be using Adjustment Layers , which are your best friend when doing work like this .
Adjustment layers are non-destructive layers that sit in the palette wherever you ’d like and can make playing around a lot less time consuming ( reducing the number of Undos ) .
The Adjustment Layer button is at the bottom of the Layers Palette ( it ’s the half dark / half light one ) :
As you can see , there are a ton of options to play with .
We ’re going to start with Selective Color , as I want to bump up the yellows and reds :
Still not quite where it needs to be , but much closer .
I ’d share shots of the color selections I did , but it ’s always different for every photo .
So while you can see my settings , they would n’t necessarily apply to the image you might be working on .
Remember , it ’s non-destructive .
So tweak away .
After we ’re done , the Layers Palette looks like this :
We need to add some contrast , and I like using Levels for this , because I can control the blacks , whites and midrange with more precision than just using Brightness / Contrast .
We ’ll add another Adjustment Layer by clicking on the button in the Layer Palette and selecting “ Levels ” .
This looks just like the regular Photoshop “ Levels ” command under the image adjustments submenu .
Except this is non-destructive and as an Adjustment Layer , holds your settings should you want to tweak them later .
After we do the Level adjustments , our Layers Palette looks like this :
Which gives us :
The image is very close to being done .
But I want just a tiny bit more light on the hydrant and a hint of a vignette .
There are many ways to do this , but at the time I worked on this image , Photoshop did n’t have either Camera Raw or the Lens filters to add vignettes .
So I did it using Lighting Effects .
We ’ll take the blurred layer that is n’t masked and duplicate it .
So we ’ll be selecting the layer called “ blur ” , dragging it to the New Layer / Duplicate Layer button .
Once the layer is created , we ’ll drag it in the Layer Palette so that it is at the top of the palette , above the two adjustment layers we just made .
Our Layers Palette looks like this :
Then we ’ll select this layer and do the Lighting Effects :
I used these settings in the Lighting Effects panel :
Set the transparency on this layer to Overlay and the Opacity to 33 % :
We are almost there .
It still needs just a touch of lightening overall , and I like to use Curves to accomplish this .
We ’ll make a new Adjustment Layer by clicking the icon in the Layers Palette and selecting “ Curves ” .
A simple adjustment lightens up the image enough to recapture some of our highlights .
Our Layer Palette looks like this :
And boom .
We ’re there .
This concludes the Photoshop tutorial .

The use of 12 tone intervals in the music of many human cultures is rooted in the physics of how our vocal anatomy produces speech , according to researchers at the Duke University Center for Cognitive Neuroscience .
The particular notes used in music sound right to our ears because of the way our vocal apparatus makes the sounds used in all human languages , said Dale Purves , the George Barth Geller Professor for Research in Neurobiology .
Evaluate the tones yourself at The Purves Lab
It 's not something one can hear directly , but when the sounds of speech are looked at with a spectrum analyzer , the relationships between the various frequencies that a speaker uses to make vowel sounds correspond neatly with the relationships between notes of the 12 - tone chromatic scale of music , Purves said .
Purves and co-authors Deborah Ross and Jonathan Choi tested their idea by recording native English and Mandarin Chinese speakers uttering vowel sounds in both single words and a series of short monologues .
They then compared the vocal frequency ratios to the numerical ratios that define notes in music .
Human vocalization begins with the vocal cords in the larynx ( the Adam ’s apple in the neck ) , which create a series of resonant power peaks in a stream of air coming up from the lungs .
These power peaks are then modified in a spectacular variety of ways by the changing shape of the soft palate , tongue , lips and other parts of the vocal tract .
Our vocal anatomy is rather like an organ pipe that can be pinched , stretched and widened on the fly , Purves said .
English speakers generate about 50 different speech sounds this way .
Yet despite the wide variation in individual human anatomy , the speech sounds produced by different speakers and languages produce the same variety of vocal tract resonance ratios , Purves said .
The lowest two of these vocal tract resonances , called formants , account for the vowel sounds in speech .
" Take away the first two formants and you can't understand what a person is saying , " Purves said .
The frequency of the first formant is between 200 and 1,000 cycles per second ( hertz ) and the second formant between 800 and 3,000 hertz .
When the Duke researchers looked at the ratios of the first two formants in speech spectra , they found that the ratios formed musical relationships .
For example , the relationship of the first two formants in the English vowel / a/ , as in " bod , " might correspond with the musical interval between C and A on a piano keyboard .
" In about 70 percent of the speech sounds , these ratios were bang - on musical intervals , " Purves said .
" This predominance of musical intervals hidden in speech suggests that the chromatic scale notes in music sound right to our ears because they match the formant ratios we are exposed to all the time in speech , even though we are quite unaware of this exposure . "
No music , except modern experimental pieces , uses all 12 tones .
Most music uses the 7 - tone or diatonic scale to divide octaves , and much of folk music uses five tones .
These preferences correspond to the most prevalent formant ratios in speech .
Purves and his collaborators are now working on whether a given culture 's preference for one subset of the tones over another is related to the formant relationships that are especially prevalent in the native language of that group .
Purves and his collaborators also think these findings may help explain a centuries - old debate in music over which tuning scheme for instruments works best .
Ten of the 12 harmonic intervals identified in English and Mandarin speech occur in " just intonation " tuning , which sounds best to most trained musicians .
They found fewer correspondences in other tuning systems , including the equal temperament tuning commonly used today .
Equal temperament tuning , in which each of the 12 interval distances in the chromatic scale is made exactly the same , is a scheme that enables an ensemble such as an orchestra to play together in different keys and across many octaves .
Although equal temperament tuning sounds pretty good , it 's a compromise on the more natural , vocally derived just intonation tuning system , Purves said .
The group 's next study concerns our intuitive understanding that a musical piece tends to sound happy if it ’s in a major key but relatively sad if it's in a minor key .
That , too , may come from the characteristics of the human voice , Purves suggests .

But recent rains have reached the northern mouth of the lake , with hopes it will be transformed from a salty sink to a breeding site for huge numbers of waterbirds such as pelicans , silver gulls and banded stilts .
Wrightsair pilot Trevor Wright , who is based at William Creek , west of Lake Eyre , said it would take another two weeks to determine how much water would reach the lake .
" Whether the lake fills or not really depends on the rest of the tropical depression and the cyclones , but it's in a good position to start moving water into the lake , " Mr Wright said .
" I think it will be continuously flowing there for quite a while .
" There is quite a bit of water up the top end of the lake but the lake wo n't be filled at the moment - we definitely need follow - up rain and we have got to look at what is coming out of these cyclones and tropical depressions . "
Mr Wright said water flowing towards the lake , which is Australia 's lowest point , was moving faster than in the past .
" The water going down towards the lake is , I believe , faster than normal because with the drought , the animals have eaten out a lot of the vegetation in the creek beds so the water is actually moving quicker .
" It normally takes 21 days to go from the top of the lake to the bottom of the lake and looking at it this time , it 's actually moving quicker .
" What is really interesting is the water up the top end of Lake Eyre , the Warburton Groove which is the Diamantina ( River ) , the amount of people that are either talking about boating down these creeks .
" If you can visualise in your mind , a sail in between these two sand dunes , heading down the groove .
" I think we are going to get a lot of these experience seekers actually coming up and trying to go down the creeks .
" The creeks are quite fast flowing , they 're about three or four metres deep and in some areas you can probably water ski in them . "
It has been taboo for more than 500 years .
But from fcuk to Four Weddings and a Funeral , the f- word has become so commonplace it now seems acceptable in everyday conversation .
Is it no longer obscene ?
And if it is n't , what is ?
Jonathan Margolis investigates
The first time I heard the word fuck , I was seven .
My 12 - year - old brother asked me if I wanted to know the worst word in the world .
He whispered it to me and , although he was n't quite sure what it meant , we both loved the idea of a word so rude that it could barely be uttered .
And in suburbia in the 60s , you would not even breathe such a word .
I know my parents were aware of it from the war , and it was certainly in their secreted - away 1962 Penguin edition of Lady Chatterley .
But whereas today , any 12 - year - old from the dodgiest comp to Eton would say fuck if they so much as grazed a knee , I doubt my dad would have said it even if a flying saucer landed on the patio and a Martian laser - gunned the shed .
It was n't until 1970 , when I briefly encountered that rare bird in Ilford , Essex , a television director , that I realised it may indeed have been the worst word in the world for lower - middle - class people like us , but for the educated middle class , it was in everyday use .
The television bloke had been filming an item for BBC Nationwide nearby and asked to use our phone .
My mother was clearly enchanted by him .
He had long hair , the first pink shirt we had ever seen on a man , and said fuck several times in a brief call to his producer .
My mum , who had ideas above her station , seemed to resolve from that moment to say fuck several times a day as a way of showing that she was moving onwards and upwards .
Three decades on , the word is so commonplace that its shock value seems quite lost .
Kenneth Tynan saying it for the first time on television in 1965 caused considerable scandal , albeit without mention anywhere of what he said .
( It was : " I doubt if there are any rational people to whom the word fuck would be particularly diabolical , revolting or totally forbidden . " )
We did n't know it in Ilford , but by the time our trendy television man was using fuck so casually , the middle - class ( or at least literary ) hijacking of the word from workmen 's slang was well underway .
DH Lawrence , James Joyce , Henry Miller and Dylan Thomas had started the process , and now Doris Lessing , WH Auden , William Burroughs , John Updike and Iris Murdoch were joyously embracing the word .
Soon , the speech of barristers , cabinet ministers , academics and surgeons was splattered with fucks , as it still is today when they want to appear unsnobbish .
And , paradoxically , it is often ill - educated people who are the more loath to say it - for fear of appearing ill - educated .
In 1976 , the Sex Pistols famously used the word on Thames Today , infuriating presenter Bill Grundy .
And from the 1980s onwards , films have routinely contained a fusillade of fucks , with Hugh Grant 's opening salvo in Four Weddings and a Funeral a notable example .
Which made it little surprise that by 1997 , when several broadcasting organisations produced a ranking of words by severity , fuck only came in third , behind cunt and motherfucker .
If evidence were required that the word has in some sense come of age , the clothing company French Connection has recently opened a giant FCUK store almost next to Harrods .
A pseudo - anarchic gesture that would once have been the subject of anger and sensation , today this is not even noteworthy enough to be a bore .
It is a true non-event .
Why did fuck lose its sting ?
Has its diminution left us bereft of a useful , powerful expletive ?
If it has , is language the poorer for its emasculation ?
And is there an unspoken agenda that it is still rude when the speaker is working class ?
Or if it is used in a work of art , such as this year 's Gilbert and George exhibition , The Dirty Words Pictures , 1977 ?
There is a pervasive myth that in some hey - nonny - no idyll of yore , the word was lusty language , but not obscene .
But according to Jesse Sheidlower , the author of the 1995 American book , The F Word , fuck , which seems first to have appeared in a 1475 manuscript satirising the monks of Ely Cathedral ( " They , that are the monks of Ely , they are not in Heaven because they fuck the wives of Ely " ) , was always taboo .
This was the case even though shit , which dates to the ninth century , was perfectly acceptable .
So the softening of the word is entirely a modern business .
And for Charles Jones , professor of English language at Edinburgh University , it is no longer necessarily a swear word , and barely an incivility .
Jones gave evidence last year that helped Kenneth Kinnaird of Glasgow successfully appeal against a breach of the peace conviction after Kinnaird told an Edinburgh traffic policeman to fuck off .
Lord Prosser agreed that Kinnaird , 43 , was only using the " language of his generation " .
" For many working - class men , fuck seems to me hardly countable as an expletive , " says Jones .
" Rather it is used as a reinforcing adverb : ' It 's fucking cold / hot / terrible ' or whatever .
Some purists argue that this shows an inability on the part of these speakers to use ( or even to have ) more sophisticated vocabulary , but I doubt this .
In my view , nothing is regrettable in linguistic usage . "
John Ayto , editor of the Oxford Dictionary of Slang , concurs on the de-sexing of fuck .
" Fuck is a sexual term but realistically , it is almost never used that way .
The overwhelming amount of times it is being used in some figurative sense - ' I 'm fucking tired ' or ' We got fucked on that deal ' .
I think it would be too much to say that fuck does n't offend anybody .
It has n't finished the journey yet to becoming a milk - and - water word .
But its impact is diminishing at a rapid rate .
Young people tend not to think of it as offensive at all . "
The decline is a matter of shifting taboos , says Jean Aitchison , the Oxford professor of language and communication who is married to Ayto .
" In the last century , it was religious swearing that upset people , " she says .
" Then , in the mid-20th century , sexual swearing .
But these days people get far more upset about politically incorrect language : nigger , and even mad , are quite taboo .
Most kids say fuck a lot , but have n't a clue what it means .
They just know it gets adults upset , and so keep saying it - and I have upset teachers in the past by saying , ' Why do n't you just ignore pupils who say fuck ?
They 'll soon get tired if they get no response . ' "
" Ethnic slurs are regarded as the taboo , " agrees Ayto .
" Nigger is far more taboo than fuck or even cunt .
I think if a politician were to be heard off - camera saying fuck , it would be trivial , but if he said nigger , that would be the end of his career . "
Further verification that fuck is , well , fucked , comes from Andrea Wills , the BBC 's chief advisor on editorial policy .
" In research , 50 % or more people said the words that should never be broadcast are cunt , motherfucker , nigger , Paki and spastic .
Young women also do n't like whore , slag and twat .
But fuck was n't on the list . "
So not - on - the - list is it today , that Aitchison tells this story .
" A child upset its grandma by saying ' fucking knickers ' .
The child 's mother said , ' Do n't ever let me hear you say that in front of grandma again ' .
The child 's response ?
' When grandma 's here , should I say ' fucking trousers ? ' "
As well as liberalisation for its own sake , the fact has also dawned that , linguistically , fuck is a very flexible and interesting word .
According to an internet wit called Nick Lohr , who has an audiovisual tribute to fuck at www.fuck.addr.com/news/word/larry.html, we would all do well to use the word more in our speech .
It is , he contends , " the one magical word which just by its sound can describe pain , pleasure , hate and love - fuck falls into many grammatical categories , as a transitive verb , for instance : ' John fucked Shirley . '
As an intransitive verb : ' Shirley fucks . '
It 's meaning is not always sexual ; it can be used as an adjective , such as ' John is doing all the fucking work ' ; as part of an adverb : ' Shirley talks too fucking much ' ; as an adverb enhancing an adjective : ' Shirley is fucking beautiful ' ; as a noun : ' I do n't give a fuck ' ; as part of a word : ' abso - fucking - lutely ' or ' in-fucking - credible ' ; and as almost every word in the sentence : ' Fuck the fucking fuckers . ' "
The class issue remains an awkward one for fuck 's supporters .
The classier the accent , the more endearing ( and figurative , rather than aggressive ) it somehow sounds .
Hugh Grant carried it off with aplomb ( and a plum ) in Four Weddings and a Funeral , and when a BBC Radio 3 announcer recently let slip a fuck on air , it caused little stir ; the same station 's drama output is a secret treasury of fucks .
Yet when football manager Graham Taylor used it 32 times in a Cutting Edge documentary , it went down rather badly - especially with the popular newspapers , which remain squeamish about any word that might unsettle readers ; the Sun even avoids " orgasm " .
Most non-broadsheets , when it is unavoidable , opt for f**k , which lets them , as Jones puts it , be " daring and prissy simultaneously " .
On television , watershed rules on profanity have led to an odd inconsistency .
No channel will broadcast the word pre-9pm under any circumstances , even in supposedly realistic dramas such as EastEnders .
Yet , even though racially abusive language is generally regarded as more offensive today , it is possible to slip in a proscribed word before the watershed on social reportage grounds .
" In the current climate , racial language is very , very sensitive and one has to tread carefully , " says Prash Naik of Channel 4's legal and compliance department .
" But nigger and Paki are not prohibited pre-9 pm .
If they are used in a social documentary or a socially responsible drama such as Brookside , with an established reputation for tackling difficult subjects , it can then be justified as highlighting the issue of racial discrimination . "
Swearing is , it would seem , at a peculiar crossroads .
Fuck is thoroughly denatured .
Crap , bastard , bugger , sod , shit , bullshit and tosser ( although strangely not wanker ) are used on daytime television and radio .
Religious expletives , such as damn , hell and blimey , once as powerful as fuck , are not even thought of as vaguely impolite .
But Ayto is confident that we will survive the suburbanisation of fuck .
" I do n't think there 's any danger of running out of swear words .
We will make them up or regard different things as being more shocking and offensive .
There will always be a need to strike a blow at convention by using disapproved words . "
There will always be divisions , however , over what is disapproved .
As one middle - class west London mother said when I mentioned researching this article : " I 'd rather my children said fuck than toilet . "
Gates was on TV this morning from Las Vegas .
It was really interesting .
He says we will have these things in about 4 years .
WOW ... looks like Bill Gates was right a couple of years ago when he said " You have n't seen anything yet " ---- whaddya think these are ?
look closely n' guess what they could be ...

29 April , 2003 Update :
In order to prove the point , I have started building a low - cost cruise missile of my own on a budget of no more than US $ 5,000 .
The project will be documented here .
17 June 2002 Update :
Wired News now reports that the Bush administration wants to ban the export of some of the technologies I 've outlined here as having potential use in a low - cost cruise missile .
You Can Already Buy All The Bits
Cruise missiles such as the Raytheon Tomahawk have proven themselves as an extremely cost - effective method of delivering a wide range of ordinance with pin-point accuracy against targets that may be up to 1,000 miles from the launch point .
By using mil - spec GPS , highly sophisticated terrain recognition systems and a raft of other previously top - secret technologies , the cruise missile allows its owner to deliver a powerful offensive strike against an enemy with no risk to its own troops or vehicles .
However , during the past decade , huge strides have been made in commercializing much of the technology on which the cruise missile is based and it is my firm belief that building a low - cost , autonomous , self - guided , air - breathing missile with a significant payload capability is now well within the reach of almost any person or small group of persons with the necessary knowledge and skills .
Targeting / Guidance
As mentioned above , one of the key components of a cruise missile 's guidance system is a mil - spec satellite - based GPS system .
Today , compact , high quality , high accuracy GPS receivers are readily available for just a few hundred dollars .
The inclusion of an easily used computer interface in many of these units makes them well suited for use in a low - cost cruise missile ( LCCM ) .
While the GPS provides information necessary for tracking waypoints and identifying the final destination , smaller course corrections ( for stability ) can be provided by the solid - state gyro systems now readily available for use in model helicopters and aircraft .
Instantaneous measurement of altitude and groundspeed can be provided by a semi - forward looking radar and doppler radar units ( possibly built around components such as these and these .
This allows a the LCCM to fly lower than would be possible if relying solely on GPS and offers a degree of contour - hugging even when the exact nature of the terrain is not available .
The gyroscopic and radar - based systems could also provide an inertial backup guidance facility in the event that the GPS system was lost , blocked or simply turned off when an attack by such LCCMs was imminent or underway .
Onboard Computing
As Moore 's law continues to produce a rapid rise in the speed and fall in the cost of computer chips , we 've already reached the point where obtaining sufficient number crunching capability is no longer difficult or expensive .
Single - board computer systems are another readily available off the shelf component that can be recruited for use in an LCCM .
Even the sophisticated realitime operating systems necessary for supporting the type of software needed to interface the guidance / targeting systems to the control servos are just a download away .
Airframe
Since an LCCM would be designed to fly at subsonic speeds ( probably around 450 - 500 mph ) the aerodynamic design of such a craft is relatively simple and there is plenty of resource material available to assist in such an undertaking .
Indeed , the fact that so many very successful radio - controlled model aircraft have been designed and built from scratch by talented amateurs testifies to the viability of such an option .
LCCM - specific factors that need to be taken into account when designing and constructing the airframe include the need for a low heat signature and low radar profile .
The use of materials such as fiberglass and kevlar composites would go a long way towards reducing the radar profile of such a craft , as would the insight gained from a close inspection of the masking techniques used on the existing generation of stealth craft .
Experimentation with coatings containing finely ground ferrites may even offer some degree of radar absorbsion .
The heat signature of a suitable engine could be significantly reduced by judicious entraining of slipstream air to dilute and cool the jet exhaust prior to ejection behind the craft .
At the cost of some thrust , the jet efflux could also be channeled so that the engine itself is not visible even from a rear view .
Powerplant
The realization of just how practical an LCCM has become came to me when I was doing development on my pulsejet engines -- since they would make an ideal low - cost powerplant for such a vehicle .
The fact that the German V1 " flying bomb " , perhaps the first practical implementation of the cruise missile concept , was also powered by a pulsejet speaks volumes for the practicality of using such a powerplant today .
Traditional pulsejets would not be the best choice for an LCCM however as their very hot exhaust would make them an easy target for even the most primitive heat - seeking missile and their astonishingly poor fuel - efficiency plus limited reliability would reduce the LCCM 's practical range .
A small turbojet ( or the XJet ) engine with 100 lb - 500 lb of thrust however , would be the perfect powerplant -- offering a high level of reliability and longer ranges without the need for an excessive fuel - load .
Launch Facilities
Most existing hi-tech cruise missiles are designed for launch by way of a solid - rocket booster to get them up to flying speed , or they 're dropped from an aircraft already flying at speed and altitude .
The V1s of WW2 were launched using a catapult system powered by a mix of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide .
None of these systems would be required for an LCCM .
A simple launch attachment could be fitted to the roof of an SUV or truck that would allow the takeoff speed of around 70 mph to be achieved .
At that point the engine could be ignited and the craft released .
Using this method , a reasonable sized LCCM could be transported by road to a position within range of the desired target , unpacked , prep'd and then launched from a deserted stretch of roadway within a few minutes .
Payload
Cruise missiles can carry just about any payload required in the theater of war .
High explosives are the most common payload but probably the least attractive to a terrorist group -- since , to be effective , these explosives do require very accurate targeting and represent a higher level of risk during the transport and launch phase .
More attractive would probably be some form of biological agent ( anthrax , nerve gas , poison , etc ) or even some type of nuclear material .
the LCCM could be programmed to disperse its payload over a large area of high population with massive potential for death and injury in a manner that would be very difficult to defend against .
At What Cost
The electronics ( guidance / targeting , control systems , etc ) could be purchased for less than $ 2,000 .
An airframe , built using the type of foam - composite construction found in a number of home - built light aircraft would cost between $ 1,000 and $ 5,000 depending on the size of the craft .
The engine would cost between $ 500 and $ 150,000 depending on the type and size .
Turbojets / turbofans are significantly more expensive than pulsejets and would be far more likely to ring " warning bells " if they were purchased in quantity by someone without an established track record or presence in the aviation marketplace so a simple pulsejet would be the most prudent option for a terrorist group .
The total component costs for an LCCM ( less payload ) could be as little as $ 6,000 for the smallest , simplest version , with a larger , more sophisticated design still requiring little more than $ 10,000 worth of parts and materials .
The real costs would come from the integration of all these components and the development of the software required to link the guidance / targeting systems to the aircraft 's control systems .
However , suitable resources are available in many eastern - bloc countries and doubtless could be purchased on a " no questions asked basis . "
This development cost is also a one - off expense that would be effectively amortized across the number of individual units constructed .
There is even a very good chance that the development costs could be quickly recouped by selling the resulting design to other parties interested in constructing similar LCCMs .
The cost of the payload carried by the LCCM would depend entirely on nature of that material -- but it would appear that those bent on terrorism have little difficulty in obtaining explosives or biological warfare agents .
Why Worry ?
Personally , I 'm more than a little worried at the prospect of terror groups or others constructing and launching their own LCCMs .
To date , the most effective method terrorist groups have had at striking against military or civilian targets has been the suicide bombing .
With the massively increased levels of security and surveillance that have been implemented in the September 11 attacks , the viability of such attacks are now in question .
June 10 Update :
The assertion that a heightened level of security in the wake of Sept 11 has effectively thwarted the traditional " suicide " attacks planned by terrorist groups has been effectively verified by recent events in which the US foiled a dirty nuke plan and Morocco stopped a planned attack against US and UK warships in the straights of Gibraltar .
Could the effectiveness of such security measures now force al Quaeda to resort to more hi-tech tactics ?
Tactics including the use of low - cost cruise missiles that allow them to launch their attacks several hundred miles from the intended target ?
The very fact that so many people with known anti-USA affiliations were turning up to have flying lessons and simulator time was enough to ring alarm bells at the FBI -- when it comes to the LCCM we might not be quite so lucky .
An LCCM can be built with items that are so readily available that , even if a group decided to build hundreds of them , there would be no way of easily detecting their activities .
Although purchasing a number of turbojet or turbofan jet engines might pose a problem , pulsejets ( even a sophisticated design such as the X - Jet ) could be easily built from stainless steel using readily available tooling and machinery .
As someone with over 20 years experience in the design and construction of electronic control systems , realtime systems software , large model aircraft , and most recently , high efficiency pulsejet engines , I consider the design and construction of a simple yet surprisingly effective LCCM to be well within my own capabilities .
If I could do it then you can bet that there are many others who have the ability to do the same -- and not all will be friends of the West .
In fact , if I had the time and the money , I 'd love to build such a vehicle ( albeit without the lethal payload ) simply as a proof of concept .
If the LCCM concept was implemented by a terrorist group , they would likely carry out the design , development and testing work in a relatively safe , secure location within the borders of a friendly nation and then send the plans electronically ( probably using something as simple as encrypted email ) to agents operating in relatively close proximity to the intended target .
From there it would be a very simple task to purchase the required components and materials then fabricate and assemble the actual LCCM .
The completed units would be loaded onboard trucks hired or purchased for the purpose and transported to within striking distance ( 100 - 300 miles ) of a major city or military target .
From any number of widely dispersed locations within the launch radius , the LCCMs could be launched simultaneously so as to stretch the defense capabilities of the party being attacked .
Imagine the effect of just one such LCCM reaching central NYC on a warm summer 's afternoon , and dispensing a hundred pounds or more of highly radioactive material or anthrax spores in a fine dust across an area of ( say ) a square mile .
What Can Be Done About This Threat ?
Unfortunately there 's probably very little that can be done to reduce the magnitude of this potential threat .
Doubtless a country such as the USA has the technology to shoot down an LCCM -- but there 's a very good chance that multiple launches from dispersed points relatively close ( say 100 miles -- representing a flight time of just 12 minutes ) to the intended target would likely make it impossible for a defending force to deal with all the LCCMs launched .
A small ( say 5 - foot long ) target travelling at 500 mph , less than 200 feet above the ground while following an unknown and deliberately erratic course becomes an extremely difficult target to hit -- even if you 're ready and waiting for it .
Given that , with a radioactive or biological payload , it would only require a single LCCM to reach its intended target in order to inflict a damaging blow , the capability of defending against such a strike must be considered just modest at best .
While one could argue that driving a large truck to the intended target and then detonating whatever device was onboard remains a far simpler option for terrorists -- it must also be acknowledged that this is not a particularly effective way of dispersing a bio or nuclear agent .
Such a blast , especially in an area containing many high - rise buildings , would only provide minimal dispersal .
A air - drop could cover a much wider area with resultantly greater effect .
The fact that the September 11 terrorists were obviously considering just such an aerial dispersal through the use of crop - spraying aircraft is clear indication that they are very much aware of this .
In the 21st century , technology plays no favorites -- it is the slave of anyone who chooses to master it .
Representative John D. Conyers , the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee , said he hoped other witnesses would come forward to help lawmakers determine whether Justice Department prosecutors had been “ pawns in the game of politics . ”

Ms. Goodling refused to testify until she was given immunity from prosecution — not because she thought she committed any crime , her lawyer has said , but because she feared being vulnerable in the politically charged atmosphere over the firing of the attorneys .
Ms. Goodling said that in the course of her five years at the Justice Department , she interviewed hundreds of job applicants , most of them for positions subject to partisan political appointment .
“ But some were applicants for certain categories of career positions , ” she went on , alluding to workers who are supposed to function free of naked political considerations .
“ In every case , I tried to act in good faith , and for the purpose of ensuring that the department was staffed by well - qualified individuals who were supportive of the attorney general ’s views , priorities and goals , ” she said , before acknowledging that she might have gone too far in asking overtly political questions of some career applicants .
But Representative Bobby Scott , Democrat of Virginia , was not satisfied .
“ Did you break the law ? ” he asked .
“ Is it against the law to take those considerations into account ? ”
“ I believe I crossed the line , but I did n’t mean to , ” she replied .
And while she said she had interviewed hundreds of prospective employees , she said it was just not true that , as the White House liaison , she held “ the keys to the kingdom . ”
Nor , she said , did she recall having any conversations with Mr. Rove or with the White House counsel , Harriet Miers , about prospective United States attorneys .
D. Kyle Sampson , former chief of staff to the attorney general , compiled the list of prosecutors to be fired , Ms. Goodling testified .
Mr. Sampson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March that Mr. Gonzales himself had been deeply involved in the plans to fire the prosecutors , despite his assertions to the contrary .
All I can say is " good . "
I hope that all the misleading information is brought out -- and more importantly , repeated frequently -- so that it shames the military / Pentagon from trying these sick propaganda ploys with the lives and well being of our solidiers .
It has to be a stab in the heart to their families as they 're struggling to come to terms with shifting story lines .

CALIFORNIA / Hacking of governor 's computer suspected / Published comments had been taped , stored on office server
California Highway Patrol officials have opened a criminal investigation into " multiple " breaches and illegal downloads by outside hackers into the computers of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's office , after an embarrassing private taped conversation was leaked last week to the Los Angeles Times , administration officials told The Chronicle .
" There is an investigation conducted by the California Highway Patrol on how the tape obtained by the L.A. Times was acquired , " said a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
" This is a criminal matter that has been turned over to the CHP . "
The governor was criticized last week after the Times reported that during a conversation in March with Susan Kennedy , his chief of staff , and Gary Delsohn , his speechwriter , Schwarzenegger referred to Latinos and African Americans -- specifically Republican Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia , who is of Puerto Rican descent -- as having " hot " blood or a passionate temperament .
The Times reported that the conversation had been taped as part of Delsohn 's occasional practice to capture the governor 's speech patterns for his work .
After the Times story on the conversation appeared , Schwarzenegger apologized Friday for the remark , saying he " cringed " upon reading it in the newspapers .
Garcia , of Cathedral City ( Riverside County ) , defended the governor , saying she took it as a compliment that she was " passionate " on issues .
But Democrats , including the party 's candidate for governor , state Treasurer Phil Angelides , called the governor 's remarks an affront to minorities .
The leaked tape sparked concern among administration officials because they said the governor has never routinely taped conversations of his staffers .
Sources in the governor 's office said working materials such as the tape made by Delsohn were available to only a few individuals in the governor 's office , and there was immediate suspicion the tapes were obtained by someone hacking into the computers in the governor 's office , where the tapes were stored digitally .
According to a senior administration official who spoke Sunday with The Chronicle , a preliminary investigation showed that an outside individual or individuals had apparently hacked into the computer servers of Schwarzenegger 's office and downloaded the tapes .
" The state 's computer system was breached from individuals using outside computers " on three separate occasions -- Aug. 29 , Aug. 30 and Sept. 4 , the official said , describing the breach as " a very serious matter . "
Adam Mendelsohn , the governor 's communications director , referred all calls to the California Highway Patrol .
Tom Marshal , spokesman for the CHP , confirmed Sunday that an investigation is under way into the security of the computer system in the governor 's office .
Some experts said government computer systems are among the most vulnerable to outside hackers -- especially some systems used by California state agencies that are well known as antiquated .
" Government systems are penetrated on a regular basis , " said Bev Harris , executive director of Black Box Voting , a Seattle - based group concerned about electronic voting and hacking .
" There 's a lot of government offices that you would n't think would be vulnerable , but they have been penetrated , " she said , citing the Pentagon as having its computers recently breached by a hacker .
Harris noted that research her group did in California turned up a surprising number of government computer systems that were more than 10 years old with little protection .
" There are lots of very antiquated databases in California , " she said .
" It 's almost laughable what systems they are still using . "
The Los Angeles Times story regarding the leaked tapes was published on the paper 's Web site on Thursday and in the printed Times on Friday .
Officials said it was unclear if the investigation would also involve any Times staffers .
An administration source said that a service used to transcribe the governor 's conversations has been fully cooperative with the investigation and that there is " no reason to believe " that any of its staffers are involved in the leak .
Some Republican strategists , such as Jon Fleischman -- publisher of the popular FlashReport Web site -- have publicly speculated that Democratic operatives were behind the leak of the tapes .
But Democratic party officials , including senior strategist Bob Mulholland , told The Chronicle last week that he had nothing to do with either the leak of the tapes or any hackers who might be involved .
Mulholland , who has been involved in past headline - making " opposition research " projects in political campaigns , said the governor 's comments were " stupid , " but he had no responsibility for getting them before the public .
Many of my colleagues , faced with the reality that the war in Iraq is not going well , line up to place all the blame on the president .
The president " mismanaged " the war , they say .
" It ’s all the president ’s fault , " they claim .
In reality , much of the blame should rest with Congress , which shirked its constitutional duty to declare war and instead told the president to decide for himself whether or not to go to war .
More than four years into that war , Congress continues to avoid its constitutional responsibility to exercise policy oversight , particularly considering the fact that the original authorization no longer reflects the reality on the ground in Iraq .
According to the original authorization ( Public Law 107- 243 ) passed in late 2002 , the president was authorized to use military force against Iraq to achieve the following two specific objectives only : " ( 1 ) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq ; and ( 2 ) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq . "
I was highly critical of the resolution at the time , because I do n’t think the United States should ever go to war to enforce United Nations resolutions .
I was also skeptical of the claim that Iraq posed a " continuing threat " to the United States .
As it turned out , Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction , no al - Qaeda activity , and no ability to attack the United States .
Regardless of this , however , when we look at the original authorization for the use of force it is clearly obvious that our military has met both objectives .
Our military very quickly removed the regime of Saddam Hussein , against whom the United Nations resolutions were targeted .
A government approved by the United States has been elected in post - Saddam Iraq , fulfilling the first objective of the authorization .
With both objectives of the original authorization completely satisfied , what is the legal ground for our continued involvement in Iraq ?
Why has Congress not stepped up to the plate and revisited the original authorization ?
This week I plan to introduce legislation that will add a sunset clause to the original authorization ( Public Law 107 - 243 ) six months after passage .
This is designed to give Congress ample time between passage and enactment to craft another authorization or to update the existing one .
With the original objectives fulfilled , Congress has a legal obligation to do so .
Congress also has a moral obligation to our troops to provide relevant and coherent policy objectives in Iraq .
Unlike other proposals , this bill does not criticize the president ’s handling of the war .
This bill does not cut off funds for the troops .
This bill does not set a timetable for withdrawal .
Instead , it recognizes that our military has achieved the objectives as they were spelled out in law and demands that Congress live up to its constitutional obligation to provide oversight .
I am hopeful that this legislation will enjoy broad support among those who favor continuing or expanding the war as well as those who favor ending the war .
We need to consider anew the authority for Iraq , and we need to do it sooner rather than later .
The BBC 's interviewers are not as deferent as some in America .
Paxman is among the most aggressive .
What staggers me about this clip is Bolton 's point - blank view that the US had no responsibility to impose order after the invasion , and no responsibility for security within the country .
Bolton actually says that the only error Bush really made was not giving the Iraqis " a copy of the Federalist papers and saying , ' Good luck . ' "
Yes , he says he 's exaggerating for effect , but he is conveying the gist of the policy .
The casual recklessness and arrogance of these people never cease to amaze .
The world is theirs ' to play with - and the victims of predictable and predicted violence are left to help themselves :

Make Hip Hop Not War speaks truth to power at West Park Presbyterian Church in NYC .

After a quest lasting more than 70 years , botanists may finally have found what one leading textbook describes as “ the Holy Grail of plant biology ” – the molecular command that tells a plant it is time to flower .
The discovery may help scientists tailor crops to different latitudes – an especially valuable ability as global warming begins to shift climate zones towards the poles .
Researchers have known since the 1930s that the leaves of plants perceive the seasons by sensing the amount of daylight and , when the time is right , trigger flowering by sending some sort of signal to the shoot tip .
But the identity of this so - called “ florigen ” has remained mysterious .
Now two research teams have independently identified it .
Florigen , they say , is the protein produced by a gene called Flowering locus T , or FT .
One team , led by George Coupland at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne , Germany , and Colin Turnbull at Imperial College London in the UK , used genetic trickery to join the FT protein to a green fluorescent protein marker in Arabidopsis , or thale cress .

Onto this marker - enriched plant , the team grafted a mutant stem that lacked the FT gene and so was unable to flower by itself .
They observed that the fluorescent FT protein crossed into the mutant stem and triggered flowering .
“ It ’s pretty unambiguous , ” says Turnbull .
Another team , led by Ko Shimamoto at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Ikoma , Japan , used much the same technique to show the same thing in rice .
Finding the same florigen in two such distantly related species suggests the mechanism is common to all plants , says Jan Zeevaart , a plant biologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing , US .
The new results are not the FT gene ’s first turn in the limelight .
In recent years , several studies have shown that FT is turned on in leaf tissue at particular day lengths , and that the FT protein acts in the shoot tip to trigger flowering .
However , no one knew whether the FT protein or some other molecule was the flowering signal that shuttled from leaf to shoot tip .
Messenger shot
In 2005 , researchers in Sweden seemed to settle the question when they announced that messenger RNA from the FT gene was the mobile signal .
But this week , the Swedish team formally retracted this claim .
“ A guest researcher from China who had been invited to join our team manipulated the data to get false results , ” says Ove Nilsson at Umeå University in Sweden .
The Chinese researcher , Tao Huang , who is no longer at Umeå University , still stands by his results , says Nilsson .
With the flowering signal now firmly in hand , biotechnologists have the means to tinker with a plant ’s flowering time to adapt it to different conditions .
For example , farmers at higher latitudes might want to force crops to flower earlier so that they can mature their fruit before the first frost , suggests Brian Ayre , a plant biologist at the University of North Texas in Denton , US .

Federal prosecutors agreed Thursday to temporarily protect members of an adult industry trade group from strict new enforcement regulations .
But thousands of porn sites are still fair game , and their webmasters now face hefty prison terms if they do n't keep records proving that models and performers are over 18 .
" It would be a mistake to view this as anything other than a big victory " for porn webmasters , said J.D. Obenberger , an adult industry attorney based in Chicago .
He predicts that the Department of Justice wo n't actually prosecute anyone , pending court hearings this summer .
It was n't immediately clear how the agreement will affect the many websites that removed adult content or shut down entirely in anticipation of the new enforcement effort .
Affiliates of Rotten.com , including RateMyBoobies.com , and Fleshbot.com took down photos , as did some featuring celebrity nudity .
Even non-porn online publishers like PlanetOut.com , a gay website , temporarily removed all photos from its personal ads , even though it bans pictures with adult content .
Sister site Gay.com , which had allowed more explicit content , dropped personal ad photos , too .
A hearing had been scheduled Thursday afternoon in federal court in Denver for the online porn industry 's arguments against broader enforcement of the federal law known as 18 U.S.C. 2257 .
But it was cancelled after a last - minute agreement between the Free Speech Coalition industry trade group and federal prosecutors .
The agreement forbids prosecutors from targeting members of the coalition until Sept. 7 ; a hearing is scheduled for Aug. 8 to determine if the Free Speech Coalition actually has a valid case against the government .
Why were n't non-members of the coalition included ?
According to Obenberger , the judge did n't have the right to approve an agreement forbidding U.S. attorneys from prosecuting sites not involved in the case .
As of press time , Free Speech Coalition officials could n't be reached to confirm how many porn sites are members of the group .
At issue is the government 's right to make sure that anyone seen in an explicit pose on a U.S. - based website is legally an adult .
Under the law , photos and videos of everything from intercourse to masturbation are fair game .
Previously , the government only targeted people who actually produce sexually explicit content .
That 's why the boxes containing porn videos feature notes in fine print confirming that performers are of legal age .
But the new interpretation allows investigators to go after so - called " secondary producers , " including webmasters who buy or steal content from someone else .
Critics claim that the government could even target online museum exhibits or news coverage of the pictures from the Abu Ghraib scandal .
( Images created before July 3 , 1995 are exempt . )
The Justice Department 's new interpretation raises a slew of issues .
Adult performers fear their real names , addresses and ages will end up in the hands of countless webmasters who must now keep these records .
" We deal with stalkers now , " said Bill Rust , webmaster of Arikaames.com , a soft - core site featuring his wife .
" We 've had people who join the site and try to track her down , send cakes and candies to her parents ' house . "
Rust said he stopped providing the site 's content to hundreds of affiliates because he was n't willing to give out his wife 's personal information to comply with the new rules .
There 's another potential problem with the regulations .
According to Odenberger , the law would require websites to store every explicit image they ever post .
The government , he said , does n't realize " there are such things as 19 - year - old ( live web ) cam girls sitting in a trailer with $ 200 in their bank accounts , going online solely to support their child .
To require them to buy terabytes worth of storage puts down an impossible barrier between them and internet access . "
In court papers ( .pdf ) filed Tuesday , the U.S. Attorney General 's office argued that the new enforcement powers are necessary to combat child pornography .
The prosecutors dismissed the arguments of the Free Speech Coalition about privacy violations , free - speech restrictions and the heavy burdens of record - keeping .
" One plaintiff is an internet pornography publisher who is capable of publishing tens of thousands of pornographic photographs on more than 600 websites , but who somehow lacks the ' computer programming ability ' to store age - verification records electronically , " the prosecutors wrote .
They were apparently referring to plaintiff Dave Cummings , a 65 - year - old adult industry entrepreneur in San Diego who touts himself as the world 's oldest male porn performer .
Under the new regulations , sites that post his weekly sexual exploits would need to prove he 's over 18 .

Comment Killing penguins might be evil .
I 'm not 100 per cent sure .
I 've never thrown one to a killer whale and then decided how I felt about it .
Google might want to buy some penguins and start chucking .
The company needs to confront how it feels about penguin murder .
And you need to decide if Google should keep you up - to - date on its possible penguin killing .
The ad broker builds a ton of data centers – some of the biggest data centers in the world .
According to a recent study , the power needed to run and cool all of the data centers in the US equals the amount of energy needed to keep our color televisions glowing .
It takes about five 1000 MW power plants to fuel those servers here and 14 similar plans to power servers worldwide .
So , if you 're one of those types who believes in global warming , believes that humans have played a role in global warming , believes that global warming has contributed to the decline in penguins and thinks penguin murder is evil , then you might think Google evil – something the company tries not to be , according to its website .
Google drew our attention away from its penguin killing on Earth Day – 22 April – by linking to Earth Day related sites .
It provided the links from behind one of its modified logos , which this time depicted a Google glacier that appeared to be melting .
Click on the logo , and you get the Earth Day homepage , a quiz , and the US government 's Earth Day portal as the top three sites .
You also get an ad for Earth Day supplies from Oriental Trading Co. I 'm not sure how many penguins died so we could buy a Tissue Paper Earth Craft Kit , Globe Stress Ball , or Inflatable Valentine 's Day Guitar , but I 'm sure it was worth it .
The Oriental Trading
Co even sells 62 penguin items , so you can remember the cute little suckers after they 're long gone .
If you 're waiting for a point , you 're in luck .
I think one is on the way .
Word broke this month that Google has purchased 800 acres of land in Pryor , Oklahoma .
The company has yet to confirm plans for the site , but I 'm betting on a new data center rather than an amusement park ( in all fairness , you can never tell with this bunch – Ed ) .
Google Goes Glacial .
Shhhh .
Oklahoma proves a handy spot to have a data center since the state 's Governor signed a new law that affords the largest corporate energy users the right to keep their power consumption figures a secret .
Governor Brad Henry signed the energy law ( House Bill 1038 ) just a couple of days after news of Google 's land purchase reached the local newspapers .
Coincidence ?
Sure .
The lawmakers behind the bill denied having chats with Google around any legislation .
People familiar with the matter , however , did note that the law proves convenient for an entity such as Google that likes to keep as much information secret as possible .
If you 're a demanding type who needs evidence of Google 's secret ways , have a listen to head of strategic development Rhett Weiss .
He presided over a party celebrating yet another Google data center in South Carolina .
When asked about Google 's water and power usage , Weiss confessed : " We 're in a highly competitive industry and , frankly , one or two little pieces of information like that in the hands of our competitors can do us considerable damage .
So we can't discuss it . "
While still playing with Google 's colored balls , the South Carolina state legislature tweaked the state tax code to make sure that webby service providers do n't have to face taxes on electricity and capital investments in equipment when building large data centers .
That 's the same type of exemption afforded manufacturing companies .
Of course , it will take all of 200 workers to slave away on the text ads that bring Google more money than God .
The sweaty locals are sure to understand what I 'm missing .
Does Google kill more penguins than , say , Exxon ?
Probably not .
I think , however , we should demand a bit from our service providers , server makers , and consulting giants who have all jumped on the save energy bandwagon with such force .
No company on the planet makes greater claims to moral superiority than Google .
It pursues a " do n't be evil " policy , while ensuring staff eat , commute , exercise , and work under an umbrella of happiness .
Such a friendly , righteous presence should have no problems revealing its energy consumption to the citizens of the world .
Google , at best , provides a useful search service .
At worst , it 's an ad pusher with a money - losing side business in videos of fake , bad actors pretending to be real .
No such company can with a straight face claim that its energy consumption is a proprietary secret in this day and age ( I doubt a rival could do much with the energy info anyway without knowing more details about a given data center ) .
Our most demanding energy eaters should disclose their toll on the environment .
The penguins deserve such transparency , and so do you . ®
Growing up in the 1970s in Bradford , Zaiba Malik 's life was dominated by Islam and the lessons of the Qur'an .
But leaving home to go to university exposed her to a secular world and she abandoned the teachings of her father .
Then the London bombings happened ...
It 's been more than 20 years since I prayed in a mosque .
The last time was when , as a reluctant 12 - year - old , I was taken by my father to a makeshift prayer hall in Bradford .
I wanted to be at home watching Blue Peter , not surrounded by old women who , when they were n't reciting their prayers in Arabic ( a language I did n't understand ) were chatting away in Urdu ( another language I did n't understand ) .
Watching them carry out their ablutions was not a pretty sight , hawking spit and mucus as required by Islamic practice from their mouths and noses before being able to pray .
I also remember the ungodly smell : shoes had to be deposited on shelves outside the hall , but still the collective odour of 30 or so pairs of sandals and slippers lingered in the air .
I 'd heard stories of footwear going missing so , to avoid going home barefoot , I would hide my shoes behind a shelf .
Now aged 35 , worrying about my Nike trainers was the last thing on my mind ; it was July 8 , the day after the London bombings , and I found myself standing with a group of around 30 female worshippers at the East London mosque .
I had n't intended to take part in the Friday prayers - I had come as a journalist to talk to the women about Islam - but when a young girl asked me if I was going to join the kneeled congregation , I immediately replied yes .
It was partly out of respect , and partly embarrassment .
My memory of the da'wah , or prayer , was hazy .
My slightly unsuitable top kept riding up my back , exposing my flesh every time I bowed to the floor .
But recalling the Arabic that my father had taught me came easier than I expected .
Suddenly , tears started to roll down my cheeks .
I sneaked a glance at the other women .
They were all dry -eyed .
At first , I thought it was guilt , remorse at not having stepped inside a mosque for so long .
Then I realised - I was crying for my faith .
Islam was a way of life for these women and now that way of life was being analysed , debated , criticised and even distorted .
From the back of the hall came the sound of childish laughter .
Little girls , no more than three or four years old , were entertaining themselves as their mothers prayed .
They reminded me of the time I learned about Islam .
Then , there were no websites showing suicide bombers and no inflammatory clerics threatened with deportation .
Then , there was just my father and his kids sat at the kitchen table reading the Holy Book .
As a child , I was fascinated by my father 's copy of the Qur'an .
It was a ritual of my father 's to gently take it out of its cupboard , unwrap the sling of cream silk used to protect it , and place it on its wooden lectern , the ornate , jet - black Arabic scripture contrasting with the mint green pages .
Even before I knew anything about its content , I learned that there were strict rules governing the handling of the Qur'an .
You must wash your hands before touching it ; you must never place it on the floor ; you must never point your feet towards it ; you must always cover your hair while reading it .
Contained in its 114 surahs [ chapters ] were detailed instructions on how Muslims should conduct themselves from birth to death .
And so , from the age of about five , most afternoons and weekends for my sister and brother and I were taken up learning the Arabic verse .
I had no idea what it meant - Punjabi was the language we spoke at home - but I suppose my father wanted to make sure we knew how to recite the divine revelation in its most pure form , untainted by human translation .
Other children had fairy tales read to them ; my father told me of the miracles the Prophet Muhammad had performed , such as splitting the moon in two and feeding an entire army of soldiers with just scraps of food .
My father was an engrossing raconteur , and his joy and passion for the Qur'an was infectious .
He would frequently tell us of the test that Abraham faced when Allah asked him to sacrifice his son , Ishmael .
Because Abraham obeyed , when he brought down the blade on Ishmael , his son was saved , and in his place was a ram .
To commemorate this , Muslims hold an annual Feast of Sacrifice - the Eid al - Adha - in which Abraham 's obedience is re-enacted with the killing of a ram or goat .
On our street , for days before the festival , you would hear bleating coming out of neighbours ' back gardens .
Then , on the morning of Eid , the bleating would suddenly stop .
But , in addition to the gentle stories , there was also judgment .
In common with Christianity , Muslims also believe in the Apocalypse .
Once the horn has sounded on the Day of Judgment , I was told , a person 's sins will be weighed to determine whether he or she " shall recline on jewelled couches ... with fruits of their own choice and flesh of fowls that they relish " , or " dwell amidst scorching winds and seething water ; in the shade of pitch black smoke , neither cool nor refreshing " .
The threat of this cherubic 24 - hour surveillance was powerful , and meant that even beyond the gaze of my parents I did my best to be a good Muslim .
In the sweltering heat during the month of Ramadan , I never succumbed to the temptation of ice cream .
My father supplemented our Qur'anic education at home with excursions to the pictures .
Up until the early 1980s , Bradford had an Asian cinema .
At night it played Bollywood films , complete with the obligatory wet saris and suggestive glances , but on Saturday afternoons the projector beamed religious films re-enacting the birth of Islam to a smaller and more restrained audience .
Without ever seeing the Prophet Muhammad - portraying him would be a sin - the message was clear that Islam had brought order , justice and peace to an idolatrous and debauched land .
I can still remember watching one where a woman who had committed infidelity had ropes tied to her wrists .
Attached to those were two lines of men who pulled and pulled until the woman 's arms came out of their sockets .
If this had been a low - grade horror film with bad special effects , I probably would n't have been so frightened ; the consequences of going against Allah 's will were far more terrifying .
In many ways it was relatively easy for my father to practise Islam in the way he felt right .
Most of his friends were Muslim , for whom the local mosque also doubled as a social centre .
Most of his co-workers in the textile mills were Muslim , so nobody looked twice when he unfurled his prayer mat among the humming looms .
I , on the other hand , was the only Muslim in my school year , and like most teenagers , what I really wanted was to be the same as everyone else .
I found it mortifying to have to wear trousers underneath my regulation skirt , to sit in the library while the pupils sang Onward Christian Soldiers in assembly , to study French while they all studied the Bible in religious education .
There were few references to Islam in my life outside the family home , so I found it comforting when I discovered them , even in the most obscure places , such as the use of the word " Bismillah " in Queen 's Bohemian Rhapsody .
I still did n't know what it meant but I recognised it from the Qur'an .
And the line in the Jam's Eton Rifles - " Get out your mats and pray to the west " .
In time , I started to read the Qur'an in English , and discovered that what was haram ( forbidden ) and what was halal ( permitted ) was sometimes crystal clear .
No to gambling and committing suicide ; yes to a man having more than one wife and divorce .
But , as with other religious texts , there were grey areas .
My father had a record collection - mostly vinyl LPs of golden oldies from Indian cinema - that would be the envy of any DJ .
But though his children used his turntable , when it was n't blaring out Hindi lyrics , to listen to David Bowie and the Police , in our household music was halal yet dancing was not .
In the seven years I was at school I never went to a single school disco .
I , too , would sit motionless on the sofa at home and watch the turntable go round and round .
As a child I had used my father , a devout and well - respected man , as my yardstick .
Once I left home to go to university , that benchmark was gone .
Now I had to use my own judgment .
As someone who'd never even spent the night at a friend 's house , this was a big step .
No wonder my mother cried inconsolably as she dropped me and my luggage off .
Contained in my cheap suitcase were my law textbooks , the latest editions on jurisprudence , but no Qur'an .
Since adolescence my reading of it had almost stopped and my spare time had been taken up playing netball and performing in amateur dramatics .
Over the following months the words of the Holy Book , still resonant when I left home , became muffled .
I know some Muslims say that there is no compromise with Islam but even growing up in Bradford , with a very visible Islamic prescence , strict adherence to the Qur'an was a struggle .
Here , on the university campus , it became almost impossible .
I had been thrust into secularism , a concept I had little experience of even from my schooldays .
We grew up knowing that Jesus and Moses were recognised prophets and that the Bible and Torah were recognised texts , but this was the first real opportunity I had to mix with people of those faiths , and those with no faith .
I had little choice - yet again I was the only Muslim on my course .
For me going to university was n't so much a learning curve as a cliff drop .
I came across students who were devout church - goers , who injected drugs , some who were borderline alcoholics , cross-dressers and manic depressives .
Some I liked ; others I detested .
The Qur'an forbids homosexuality but I befriended a gay man .
And despite my associations , I still classed myself as a Muslim .
I was n't quite sure what the Qur'an and other Muslims would say about this .
Maybe that life on a secular campus had decelerated the flow of Islam in my veins .
No wonder I turned off the radio every time I heard REM's Losing My Religion .
But I know that I have n't lost my religion .
I may not always display outwardly signs of it by , for example , going to the mosque and fasting but I still have a deep connection with the faith of my parents .
Just over three years ago , my father passed away .
But after the initial grief , I found some comfort knowing that he had died peacefully , just minutes after saying his early morning prayers .
In Islam , when a person dies the soul is said to lie peacefully in the grave if a section from the Qur'an called the Yahsin , known as the Holy Book 's throbbing heart , is recited as many times as possible .
For 40 days my family read this chapter over and over again .
As I muttered the Arabic words , still not really understanding what I was reading , I was grateful that I could do something for my father and grateful that he had taught me the scripture .
He is buried in the Muslim section of the cemetery in Bradford .
In contrast to the higgledy - piggledy layout of the nearby Christian graveyard , the tombs of the Muslim dead all point towards Mecca .
Flowers , tinsel and flags , incongruously cheerful , relieve the melancholy headstones .
My father 's is black marble .
On it are the words , in Arabic : " In the name of Allah , the Compassionate , the Merciful . "
The first words my father taught me from the Qur'an .
Cities are considered by many to be a blessing and a curse .
Large cities generate considerable wealth , they are home to many high paying jobs and are seen as engines of innovation .
But cities also generate pollution , crime and poor social structures that lead to the urban blight that plagues their very existence .
Now a team of researchers , including an economist from Arizona State University , have studied the growth of cities in different parts of the world and have come up with general equations that can foretell their consumption of resources and their contributions to society .
The work has debunked the notion that cities act like biological organisms , that once they start they grow , and consume and contribute at predictable linear rates .
" It 's true that large cities have more problems , they are more congested , they create more pollution and they have more crime , " said Jose Lobo , and ASU economist in the School of Sustainability .
" But also because of their size , cities are more innovative and create more wealth .
Large cities are the source of their problems and they are the source of the solutions to their problems . "
The researchers working with Lobo -- Luis Bettencourt of Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , New Mex . ; Dirk Helbing and Christian Kuhnert of Dresden University of Technology , Germany ; and Geoffrey West of the Santa Fe Institute , Santa Fe , New Mex. -- detailed their findings in the article " Growth , innovation , scaling and the pace of life in cities , " in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
An on - line version of the article was published on April 16 , 2007 .
" Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities , " the researchers state .
" The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for predictive , quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development . "
This will require thinking about cities in new ways , they add .
The old way of thinking about cities is as if they are an organism , which consumes resources and grows in size .
Oftentimes , cities are referred to as its own ecosystem and many use the metaphor of it acting like a biological organism , Lobo said .
But the team found that this was a false metaphor .
" The one thing that we know about organisms whether it be elephants or sharks or frogs , is that as they get large , they slow down , " Lobo said .
" They use less energy , they do n't move as fast .
That is a very important point for biological scaling . "
" In the case of cities , it is actually the opposite , " he added .
" As cities get larger they create more wealth and they are more innovative at a faster rate .
There is no counterpart to that in biology . "
In fact , Lobo said , the larger the city the greater return on investment .
The researchers base their findings on data on the growth of cities ( large urban areas ) in the U.S. , Europe and China over the past 150 years .
They measured cities consumption of resources , ( such as water usage ) , requirements for infrastructure ( roads , transportation , lengths of electrical cable ) and then measured the creative output of these areas ( patents issued , " super creative jobs " generated , R&D employment , total wages ) .
The size of the cities were determined by population .
What they found were some general correlations of size and resource consumption that more or less fit the biological organism metaphor , meaning as the city grew in size it required less energy ( resources ) to sustain it in a proportion called sublinear scaling .
What was surprising to the team was when they measured creative output ( jobs , wealth generated , innovation ) as cities grew , the scaling of this output was not sublinear , but superlinear , meaning as the city grew its creative output grew faster and faster .
" It is n't like if you double the size of a city you double its creative output , " Lobo said .
" The increase you get in wealth creation is greater than the increase in size of the city . "
That ratio can range from 1.13:1 when measuring the gross domestic product in Germany , to 1.34:1 when measuring private R&D employment in the U.S .
" We are not saying that any large city is assured of prosperity forever , but if you look at the collection of cities , large cities have managed to out run their problems , " Lobo added .
" Large is smart . "
All of this points to the need of rethinking large cities , both in how they are managed and what they contribute to the greater good .
This is especially true today , as cities are on the brink explosive growth .
Today a little more than half of the world 's population live in large urban areas .
By 2030 , it is estimated to be two - thirds of the world 's population will be living in urban areas .
" Cities are really one of the most important innovations in humans history , " Lobo said .
" We need to think of them as being very human entities and as engines of creation .
We need a different perspective about cities , one that is away from thinking of large cities as a source of problems but as possible sources of solutions . "
" The practical application of this work is that the problem is not large cities , the problem is the conditions in which some of the people live in large cities , " Lobo added .
" Policies should be directed to making large cities more livable not making them smaller . "

As the voting began , two antiwar protestors stood in the gallery and implored lawmakers not to approve more money for the war .
“ Do n’t buy the war !
Do n’t buy the war ! ” one woman shouted again and again before being led away by police as the presiding officer of the House banged his gavel to order .

In passing the bill , Ms. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders labored to corral an often - fractious party and presented a near - unified front on the most forceful measure on Iraq that Congress has passed since the Democrats won control of Congress last year .
They predicted the outcome would be very close — and it was , with Democrats gaining 218 votes , the bare minimum needed if all 435 members voted .
( On Friday , three lawmakers did not vote and one essentially abstained . )
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , the chairman of the Democratic caucus , noted that each of the freshman Democrats who were elected last year on a wave of discontent supported the legislation .
“ Everybody came to the conclusion that more of the same — of no change — was not a viable option , ” Mr. Emanuel said .
Several of the Democrats who voted against the bill represent conservative Southern districts with large military populations and said they believed the legislation imposed too many conditions on the president .
They were joined in their opposition by liberal Democrats who objected to investing more money in a war that has taken the lives of more than 3,200 troops .
Two Republicans voted for the measure : Representative Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland , a former Marine Corps officer who was wounded in Vietnam , and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina , who called for a withdrawal nearly two years ago .
But the rest of the Republican caucus objected to the legislation on substance and principle .
Several lawmakers derided the total of nearly $ 24 billion in domestic spending — benefiting spinach growers and shrimp fishermen and peanut storage , among others — that Democrats put into the bill to make it more palatable to its members .
If you want to understand why the war is going so badly in Iraq , it may help to examine the recent reaction to " Hadji Girl , " the videotaped song about killing Iraqis by U.S. Marine Corporal Joshua Belile .
The song became controversial when the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) discovered it on the internet and objected to its lyrics .
" Hadji Girl " tells the story of a soldier " out in the sands of Iraq / And we were under attack " :
Then suddenly to my surprise
I looked up and I saw her eyes
And I knew it was love at first sight .
And she said …
Dirka Dirka Mohammed Jihad
Sherpa Sherpa Bak Allah
Hadji girl I ca n’t understand what you ’re saying .
The girl says that she " wanted me to meet her family / But I , well , I could n’t figure out how to say no .
/ Cause I do n’t speak Arabic . "
They visit her home , a " side shanty " down " an old dirt trail , " and as soon as they arrive ,
Her brother and her father shouted …
Dirka Dirka Mohammed Jihad
Sherpa Sherpa Bak Allah
They pulled out their AKs so I could see ...
So I grabbed her little sister and pulled her in front of me .
As the bullets began to fly
The blood sprayed from between her eyes
And then I laughed maniacally Then I hid behind the TV
And I locked and loaded my M - 16
And I blew those little fuckers to eternity .
And I said …
Dirka Dirka Mohammed Jihad
Sherpa Sherpa Bak Allah
They should have known they were fucking with a Marine .
The song is gruesome , to be sure , and CAIR complained that it celebrated the killing of Iraqi civilians .
The video shows Belile performing the song before a laughing , applauding audience of fellow soldiers at their base in Iraq .
Recognizing that the song could only bring bad publicity , U.S. military officials promptly issued a statement saying that it was " clearly inappropriate and contrary to the high standards expected of all Marines . "
Belile also apologized , saying the song was intended as " a joke " and that he did n't intend to offend anyone .
Pro-war pundits , however , actually rallied to the song 's defense .
The conservative Little Green Footballs weblog thought news reports about the video controversy were the " mainstream media disgrace of the month . "
There 's nothing wrong with the song , the Footballs said , because it does n't actually describe a soldier killing civilians : " the people who kill the ' little sister ' in this darkly humorous song are — not the Marines — but her father and brother , as they attempt to perpetrate an ambush . "
Some of the comments on LGF even called it " a wonderful song , " and attacked the " nutless Pentagon star - chasing bastards " for their " capitulation . "
Here are some of the other comments about the song , from Little Green Footballs and elsewhere :
" Damn it , we are in a fucking war !
Nobody whined about ' insensitivity ' to the fucking Japs and Jerries . "
" I expect more from the Pentagon .
The State Dept & the CIA are just a bunch of cucumber sandwich eating fools .
The Pentagon USED to be about waging war on our enemies .
Now they just want to kiss up to them . "
" I'm Proud of my fellow Marines in that video .
That is EXACTLY the espirit de corps needed , the HIGH MORALE needed in the middle of a combat zone where those self - same jihadists are trying to kill those Marines every single day .
" Insensitive ?
Marines insensitive ?
God I hope so .
We need them to kick ass and follow orders but we do n’t need them to be particularly sensitive .
A sensitive Marine Corps will be the death of this country . "
" One of the things CAIR did n't like was the phrase ' Durka Durka Mohammed Jihad , Sherpa Sherpa Bak Allah ' which makes fun of the Arab language .
To hell with CAIR and to hell with the Arab language .
...
And the Islamist pigs can keep going to hell . "
As these comments illustrate , defense for the song quickly turns into traditional conservative anger at what they see as censorious " political correctness . "
They have a right , they insist , to be insensitive and hostile to Arabs and Muslims .
I would argue , in fact , that this cultural xenophobia is the main theme of the song and that the violence in it is a secondary byproduct .
Let 's start with the title , " Hadji Girl . "
The term " hadji " ( also sometimes spelled " haji " or " hajji " ) is the Arabic word for someone who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , it has become a common slang term used to describe the locals .
According to a dictionary of war slang compiled by GlobalSecurity.org , the term is " used by the American military for an Iraqi , anyone of Arab decent , or even of a brownish skin tone , be they Afghanis , or even Bangladeshis " and is also " the word many soldiers use derogatorily for the enemy . "
Related terms include " haji mart " ( a small store operated by Iraqis ) or " haji patrol " ( Iraqi soldiers ) .
The term seems to have come into usage even before the war began in Iraq .
Its use was noted following a U.S. military investigation into the 2002 murder of two prisoners at the Bagram Collection Point in Afghanistan , by some of the same soldiers who later oversaw abuses at Abu Ghraib .
'' We were pretty much told that they were nobodies , that they were just enemy combatants , '' said one of the soldiers at Bagram .
'' I think that giving them the distinction of soldier would have changed our attitudes toward them .
A lot of it was based on racism , really .
We called them hajis , and that psychology was really important . ''
One of the prisoners beaten to death at Bagram was an innocent taxi driver named Dilawar whose only offense was that he happened to drive his taxi past the American base at the wrong time .
According to Corey E. Jones , one of the MPs who guarded him , the beatings intensified when " He screamed out , ' Allah ! Allah !
Allah ! ' and my first reaction was that he was crying out to his god .
Everybody heard him cry out and thought it was funny .
...
It became a kind of running joke , and people kept showing up to give this detainee a common peroneal strike just to hear him scream out ' Allah . '
It went on over a 24 - hour period , and I would think that it was over 100 strikes . "
The term " haji " is not simply an ethnic slur , like " gook , " " jap , " " jerry " or " nigger . "
All ethnic slurs entail hostile stereotypes , but " haji " is a specifically religious stereotype based on hostility toward Muslims .
In our 2003 book , Weapons of Mass Deception , John Stauber and I described the efforts that the Bush administration has undertaken to rebrand America in the eyes of Arabs and Muslims , spending hundreds of millions of dollars on projects including Radio Sawa , Al Hurra , a " Shared Values " campaign , and the Council of American Muslims for Understanding .
Through glossy brochures , TV advertisements and websites , the United States has sought to depict America as a nation of religious tolerance that respects and appreciates Islam .
These words , however , are constantly being undermined by the actual deeds and attitudes of the Bush administration 's most ardent supporters , including soldiers in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq .
While the White House has tried to frame the war in Iraq as a " war on terror , " its own supporters keep reframing it as a war against Islam .
This is a serious , if not fatal error .
Rather than fighting a few thousand actual terrorists , the United States is positioning itself in opposition to one of the world 's major religions , with more than a billion adherents worldwide .
Culture Shock and Awe
" Hadji Girl " also refers to another aspect of soldiers ' experiences in Iraq : the language barrier that prevents them from communicating effectively .
The refrain , " Dirka dirka Mohammed Jihad / Sherpa Sherpa Bak Allah , " is borrowed from the movie " Team America : World Police . "
According to filmmaker Matt Stone , the phrase is not real Arabic but a parody of " Arabic gibberish which they just go , you know , ' Dirka - dirka , Muhammad , Muhammad Ali . ' ...
And that , to me , is what terrorists sound like when I look at their little tapes that they release . "
This inability to comprehend the local language contributes to the soldiers ' inability to distinguish between friend or foe , forcing them to suspect that anyone — including the beautiful girl you just met , or her family — might be a terrorist .
These facts began to shape the relationship between U.S. soldiers and Iraqis early in the war , as Associated Press reporter Andrew England noted in September 2003 :
Young American soldiers — many carrying out operations they have little training for — find themselves in a hostile environment , unable to speak the local language or distinguish " the good guys from the bad guys . "
Most just want to survive and return home .
Some have grown to despise Iraqis , whom they call " Hajis , " scowling rather than waving as they pass locals along highways and dirt roads .
... " I hate the Hajis .
All of them are liars .
They injured one of my soldiers , " said one .
" You do n't want to know what I think about them , they shot at me one too many times , " said another .
It is worth noting that one of the few conscientious objectors who have actually served with the military in Iraq , Aidan Delgado , had a very different perspective of Iraqis because he did know how to speak the language :
It was tough for me to see brutality coming out of my own unit .
I had lived in the Middle East .
I had Egyptian friends .
I spent nearly a decade in Cairo .
I spoke Arabic , and I was versed in Arab culture and Islamic dress .
Most of the guys in my unit were in complete culture shock most of the time .
They saw the Iraqis as enemies .
They lived in a state of fear .
I found the Iraqis enormously friendly as a whole .
One time I was walking through Nasiriyah with an armful of money , nadirs that were exchanged for dollars .
I was able to walk 300 meters to my convoy -- a U.S. soldier walking alone with money .
And I thought : I am safer here in Iraq than in the states .
I never felt threatened from people in the South .
It would be a mistake to imagine that the casual brutality of " Hadji Girl " is coming from people who are simply evil or racist or cruel .
The soldiers occupying Iraq are normal men and women who , in other circumstances , would never commit the abuses that have been documented in Bagram and Abu Ghraib and that are now alleged in Haditha .
The situations in which this war has placed them — far from home , surrounded by a foreign language and foreign culture , carrying guns and fearful for their lives — have brought out behaviors that we would not see otherwise .
If American soldiers and Iraqis could meet under different circumstances , things would be different .
Here , for example , is how Iraqi blogger Salam Pax described his experience upon visiting the United States and having dinner with an American soldier :
You have no idea how strange it feels that we share so much in common .
When I told him I would never actually approach an American soldier on the street in Baghdad , he told me that if we were in Baghdad he would probably be talking to me with his gun pointing at me because he would be scared shitless .
Yet there we sat , drinking beers together .
America 's cultural isolationism and prejudices are exposed by " Hadji Girl , " but that 's only part of the story .
The war itself is encouraging these dark aspects of human nature , by bringing Americans and Iraqis together in an environment full of tension , fear , hatred and violence .
And if the war itself is creating these evils , how can it hope to end them ?
Rep. Charles Rangel ( D ) of New York says it 's hypocritical to " support the war and not support the draft " – to stand for the liberation of a foreign people but not the enslavement of one 's own .
Quite the verbal acrobat at age 76 , Mr. Rangel , the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , proposed this month a revival of conscription for all men and women between the ages of 18 and 42 , in part to sabotage the Iraq war and coerce a withdrawal .
Though his bill has little hope of making the books , Rangel has pinched a national nerve .
And though his grandstanding ploy is deeply flawed and divorced from the American heritage , it is also a timely reminder of a thinning American military and the crisis of American confidence it suggests .
" [ Had ] members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm 's way , " they would have rejected the war , Rangel says .
But in the same breath , ostensibly to make the idea more palatable , he admits that draftees could opt out of the bloody streets and register at " our seaports , our airports , in schools , [ and ] in hospitals " instead .
So , had Bush 's daughters been forced to read Dr. Seuss to kindergartners , maybe their father would n't have been so quick to the trigger .
That logic seems suddenly less glamorous – indeed , almost tragic – considering that both women are already meeting the draft 's standards ; Jenna Bush is an intern at UNICEF and Barbara Bush volunteers with African AIDS patients .
But even if the draft forced old Washington 's young aristocrats to share symbolically in a national burden , it would relieve their warmongering parents of an even heavier burden : the job to prove and advocate a case for war .
If wars are manufactured by rich white men , then an all - volunteer force at least gives poor black men the choice not to buy in .
In spite of its intents , the draft would exempt the hawks among the administration from public accountability .
Instead of being a check on the conscience of policymakers , the draft will remove every public obstacle from , and grant every public resource to , the cause of war .
Yet Rangel , so enchanted with his proposal , has attempted to pass off contradiction as nuance , arguing that the draft serves not only to undermine America 's war but also – watch his high - flying backflip – to ensure that the wars are successful as well .
" If we 're going to challenge Iran and challenge North Korea and then , as some people have asked , to send more troops to Iraq , we can't do that without a draft , " Rangel said .
Far from orienting America 's heart to surrender , Rangel is here bracing its stomach for victory in the war against terrorism .
It is a welcome display of machismo that says , " America 's going to win , by any means necessary . "
Rangel 's formulation is strangely well - matched with the stiff sensibilities of the macho military types , whose Protestant " America , right or wrong " patriotism enshrines faith over deed , country over idea – and , most dangerously , perhaps , country in spite of idea .
In a debate with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman , Gen. William Westmoreland , opposing an all - volunteer military , argued that he could not command " an army of mercenaries . "
Mr. Friedman responded swiftly : " General , would you rather command an army of slaves ? "
The great economist had foreshadowed the moral meaning of a practical calculation .
Do the means we use contaminate the ends we seek ?
Before the West began to trade crowns for ballot boxes in the 18th century , wars were the projects of kings aimed at power and executed by slaves and subjects .
The United States helped redefine war as the final expression of necessity , not the first instinct of greed .
It did this , in part , by tying the gory enterprise to the destiny of its people .
Wars would be fought only when citizens felt that the cause was worth dying for .
America has rightly trumpeted its role as the pioneer and ongoing press release of that experiment .
If there are not enough people to fight the coming American wars – and they are coming – on these terms , there are two potential explanations : one , the wars are not worth fighting ; or two , America will no longer fight wars worth fighting .
Rangel 's proposition assumes – and it is not the only indicator – that the second is true , that America is enveloped in a crisis of conscience and confidence , that in the face of a mortal enemy , America prefers sigh to skirmish .
But what amounts to a spiritual emergency eludes a physical cure .
To force men and women into uniforms is merely to postpone a solution with the hope that the problem wo n't get worse .
It will ; in post -1960s America , the draft may well turn a problem of low morale into American troops actually standing down .
The healing of America 's soul must start in the cabs and cornfields .
But the government can help by refurbishing hope in its citizens through a new era of good feelings .
Or – let 's not kid ourselves – a few months of benign neglect .

A disturbing view from inside FEMA
Worker : Decision - makers lack disaster experience
Programming note : Watch CNN TV all weekend to help identify and reunite children displaced by Hurricane Katrina with their families .
( CNN ) --
As Hurricane Katrina bore down on the Gulf Coast three weeks ago , veteran workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency braced for an epic disaster .
But their bosses , political appointees with almost no emergency management experience , did n't seem to share the sense of urgency , a FEMA veteran said .
" We told these fellows that there was a killer hurricane heading right toward New Orleans , " Leo Bosner , a 26 - year FEMA employee and union leader told CNN .
" We had done our job , but they did n't do theirs . " (
Watch video of the whistleblower )
Bosner 's storm warning came early Saturday , three days before Hurricane Katrina came ashore in eastern Louisiana .
" New Orleans is of particular concern because much of that city lies below sea level , " he warned in his daily alert to Homeland Security secretary Michael Chertoff , then - FEMA chief Michael Brown and other Bush administration officials .
" If the hurricane winds blow from a certain direction , there are dire predictions of what may happen in the city , " it said .
FEMA 's tepid response while Katrina 's victims grew desperate , suffered and died has been acknowledged and widely criticized .
The agency 's failure is a tragic element of the Hurricane Katrina story .
But , according to Bosner , FEMA 's troubles came as no surprise after its role and stature shifted when federal agencies were reshuffled in response to the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
Raised concerns
A longtime union leader , Bosner has been a whistle - blower before .
This time , he says , colleagues are quietly thanking him for speaking out .
A year ago he raised concerns that Brown was in over his head .
Brown stepped down earlier this month after he was removed from leading the government 's Katrina relief effort .
After resigning , he criticized local officials in an interview with The New York Times , saying the White House was n't at fault .
" I have nothing personal against Mike Brown , " Bosner told CNN .
" I feel badly about the guy .
But he took a job he was never trained for .
The man was a lawyer . "
FEMA , formerly an independent agency led by a Cabinet - level official , was among the 22 federal agencies shuffled into the Department of Homeland Security .
Brown was an undersecretary who answered to the secretary of Homeland Security .
Before joining the Bush administration in 2001 , Brown had spent a decade as the stewards and judges commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association .
The Washington Post reported earlier this month that the top three FEMA officials had ties to Bush 's 2000 presidential election campaign .
Five of eight top FEMA officials had no crisis management experience , the newspaper said .
Chertoff and Brown have legal backgrounds but scant emergency management experience .
Brown came to work for FEMA in 2001 as legal counsel to his friend , then - FEMA director Joe Allbaugh , who was Bush 's 2000 campaign manager .
Brown assumed the top job when Allbaugh left FEMA in 2003 .
Chertoff is a former federal prosecutor and appellate court judge .
As a prosecutor , he was involved in developing legal strategies for dealing with terrorism following the September 11 attacks .
He was appointed Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in February by a 98-0 Senate vote .
Chertoff worked from home the day Bosner first warned of the hurricane 's catastrophic potential for New Orleans , CNN's Tom Foreman reported .
Chertoff also has been criticized for writing a memo the day after Katrina struck , delegating authority to Brown and deferring to the White House rather than taking charge .
Chertoff has not commented , but a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said he was in touch with Brown the weekend Katrina approached New Orleans .
The homeland security spokesperson also defended the memo , saying it merely put in writing procedures already in place .
But the national disaster plan states that Homeland Security is in charge of the response to disasters like Katrina .
Clamoring for reform
Committees in the House and Senate are looking into FEMA and the government 's flawed response , and officials are clamoring for reform .
Former President Bill Clinton , who revamped FEMA during his administration , is among them .
( Watch video of Clinton on FEMA )
" Clearly , the FEMA response was slow and there are lots of reasons that I think that happened , " Clinton told CNN on Friday .
" I believe that there should be some reorganization there . "
Clinton , and a national group of state disaster officials , say anyone who heads FEMA should be required to have emergency management credentials .
Clinton added that the FEMA chief should answer to the president .
" It 's sort of the standard thing , " Clinton said , " but when an emergency strikes , that person becomes the most important person in the federal government . "
The National Emergency Management Association , a non-profit association of state directors of emergency services , also lists crisis management qualifications as a must for the next FEMA head .
In a posting on its Web site , it also called for the the FEMA chief to answer directly to the president , rather than to the secretary of Homeland Security .
Bosner agrees .
He wrote a memo in 1992 that raised red flags about FEMA and helped lead to reform during the Clinton administration .
" FEMA 's biggest problem is that too few people in the agency are trained to help in emergencies , " he wrote .
" We have good soldiers but crummy generals . "
For the rest of the 1990s , FEMA improved , Bosner said .
But since 2001 the agency has again become demoralized and experienced disaster experts have left .
" At FEMA ... we have actually slid backwards , " he said .
A hard drive containing sensitive information including social security numbers and bank account information on 100,000 Transportation Security Administration employees has gone missing from its headquarters and the FBI has been notified , according to a 7 p.m. EST press release from the agency .
The external hard drive contained 100,000 archived employment records – including name , social security number , date of birth , payroll information , bank account and routing information of individuals employed by the agency from January 2002 until August 2005 .
The agency said it learned about the missing drive Thursday but was n't sure if the hard drive was simply misplaced in the office or stolen .
The Secret Service is contributing its forensic help , but the press release makes no mention of whether the drive , housed at the TSA 's Office of Human Capital , was encrypted .
Last June , the Office of Management and Budget ordered that all federal mobile computers and devices containing sensitve information be encrypted .
While the directive does n't specify , presumably that order ( . pdf ) includes external hard drives .
TSA said it was starting to notify affected individuals and is lining up a free year of credit monitoring services for individuals " as necessary . "
While the TSA 's announcement stressed it has " zero tolerance for employees not following policies on data protection and will take swift disciplinary action , including dismissal , against individuals found to be in violation of our procedures , TSA 's web policy privacy practices are already under scrutiny by one Congressional committee , following THREAT LEVEL 's reporting of flaws in an online watchlist redress system .
And it comes at a time when millions of Americans are moving to these places .
Since 1990 , more than eight million homes have been built in Western areas that foresters call “ the urban - wild land ” interface , also the focus of recent federal firefighting efforts .
The fear is that what happened to Summerhaven is a taste of things to come .
As heat - stressed ecosystems provide fuel at the edges of new homes , catastrophic fires could become the new normal .
Dr. Swetnam compares it to new developments in hurricane - prone areas in the Southeast .
Others say the projections are overly alarmist , and note that fuel buildup is a legacy of fire repression , not necessarily higher temperatures .
They also say the higher reaches of the West may simply be evolving into less alpine settings , and could resemble life that exists at lower elevations .
Still , there is a broad consensus that much of the West is warmer than it has been since record keeping began , and that changes are happening quickly , particularly in places like the sky islands .
“ The West has warmed more than any other place in the United States outside Alaska , ” said Jonathan T. Overpeck , a University of Arizona scientist and co-author of the recent draft by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , released last month in Paris .
A trip up to any one of the 27 sky islands shows the ravages of heat on the land .
The forests are splotched with a rusty tinge , as trees die from beetle infestation .
Frogs with a 10,000 - year - old pedigree have all but disappeared .
One of the sky islands is the world ’s only habitat for the Mount Graham red squirrel , an endangered species down to its last 100 or so animals .
Fox News and the other pro-war media outlets are now facing the day of reckoning .
The United States is slowly losing the war in Iraq .
More important for the pro-war media , pro-war consumers of soap are becoming anti-war .
When a true believer switches sides on a major belief , he does not want to hear people spouting the belief that he has now abandoned .
He wants to hear something else .
Today , millions of Americans are abandoning faith in Bush ’s wars .
If those media broadcasters that openly defend this abandoned belief do not change , they will lose market share .
People will simply stop listening .
But , as I will show , they dare not change .
Johnny - one note broadcasters are especially vulnerable to changing audience tastes .
They cannot change their note to match their audience ’s new preferences .
This is bad for advertising revenues .
Because the Iraq war is the dominant issue politically today , the outwardly pro-Republican media cannot avoid it .
Like the bums of the month in Joe Louis ’ era , they can run , but they can not hide .
One by one , listeners will tune out .
Maybe they will turn to satellite radio’s ad - free niche - audience music .
They will not tune in to Air America Radio , let alone All Things Considered .
They will just stop listening to politics .
They will turn off Rush Limbaugh ’s self - proclaimed EIB ( Excellence in Broadcasting ) network .
Day by day , the EIB network is rolling over IEDs .
Improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) are cheap , low - tech , and unstoppable .
They are not going to go away .
Instead , we are going to go away .
Bush ’s wars are being visibly lost in the battlefield that counts : public opinion polls .
This points to the next great battle : voting booths in November .
If the Democrats re-capture the House , the investigations will begin .
The Democrats will use the investigative power of Congress the way insurgents use IEDs .
Bush and his subordinates have been confined for over a year to giving their pro-war rally speeches inside American Legion halls , military bases , and the $ 1,000 - per- plate rubber chicken Republican Party lecture circuit .
They dare not appear in public to give their “ stay the course ” message .
This was what Lyndon Johnson faced in 1967 .
He was gone in 1969 .
EARLY RATINGS
In the early stages of any war , the Administration and its media cheerleaders have things easy .
Once any nation enters a war , the public closes ranks .
Critics of the war are frozen out , one way or another .
There are the usual excuses : “ We must support our troops . ” “ Do n’t give comfort to the enemy . ” “ We ca n’t just cut and run . ”
They are all some version of this one : “ My country , right or wrong . ”
But if the war drags on , and there are no clear - cut victories , the voters reconsider .
The cost of war rises .
A fundamental law of economics then asserts itself : “ When the cost of anything rises , less of it is demanded . ”
Simultaneously , the promised benefits of the war retreat into the distance .
Another law of economics reasserts itself : “ Future benefits are discounted compared to present benefits . ”
There are no present benefits , except for the defense industry .
Costs today are rising relentlessly .
Benefits are being pushed into the distant future relentlessly .
We have passed the turning point .
Estimating the cost - benefit ratio , voters have begun to cut and run .
Our troops will not be far behind .
POLITICAL REALITIES
This war is closely associated with the Republican Party .
For three years , most Democrats in Congress have served as Gunga Din served in the movie .
He was a faithful bugler in a loin cloth , always hoping to be promoted into the regular army .
But , unlike Mr. Din , Democrats have watched from the political sidelines as the parading Republican troops marched into the political trap set by the natives in Iraq .
They did not sound the alarm in 2003 .
Gunga
Din sounded a warning in the movie , and he was shot to ribbons by the natives for his courage .
The Democrats are now content to let the Republicans get shot to ribbons by the voters .
Then they will announce the end of Bush ’s war and bring the troops home .
If they do n’t , then a New Model Army of Republicans will .
There is this thing about getting shot to ribbons .
Politicians prefer to have the troops shot to ribbons , not politicians .
The Administration has a policy of banning photos of caskets draped in flags .
No such media ban exists for the political battlefield .
The remains of those who fall on political battlefields are given front - page coverage .
The victims do n’t even get caskets .
When it comes to post - battle politics , we are treated to the equivalent of Matthew Brady ’s display of photos from the battlefields of Antietam .
Politicians like to think of themselves in a pose : right hand over their hearts , standing at attention beneath the flag .
Far be it for me to challenge their degree of commitment to the flag .
They revere the flag as it flies high above Capitol Hill .
It shows which way the wind is blowing .
The voters have the right to change their minds .
Politicians therefore have the right to change their minds .
But Fox
News does n’t get to change its collective mind .
Neither does Rush Limbaugh .
RE -POSITIONING IS EXPENSIVE
Fox News , Rush Limbaugh , and The Weekly Standard are all trapped on the battlefield .
They are surrounded .
They are outnumbered .
They are praying for a replay of Rorke ’s Drift , but it is looking more like Isandlwana every day .
They staked their claim to leadership by following close behind George Bush .
These days , this position of responsibility resembles a job at Disney World , where the kid with the rolling trash can trails the parade of elephants .
These days , when Fox News gets a scoop , it ’s a really big scoop .
These people have defined themselves as supporters of Bush ’s wars .
They did this self - consciously , and they gained high audience share for their efforts .
This is called market positioning .
Unlike political positioning — let alone political posturing — market positioning is almost impossible to switch after the market changes .
In marketing , this is called the USP : the Unique Selling Proposition .
Once a company defines itself in terms of a particular benefit , it will lose market share if it attempts to switch .
It builds its client base in terms of its USP .
If it abandons its USP , it will be abandoned by its clients .
Here is the problem :
It is extremely risky to switch if new potential clients want a different benefit .
If the existing client base is committed to the old positioning , the company is unable to switch without suffering huge losses .
Consider Hillary Clinton ’s marketing dilemma .
She is trying to re-position herself on the war in Iraq : from gung - ho to Gunga Din .
Kerry tried this and lost .
Now he has switched completely .
Why not ?
He has nothing to lose at this point .
Hillary has taken up Kerry ’s fallen flag , tattered as it is .
Here is the hope of hope of the Republican Party : she will not be able to make the switch successfully , but will get the nomination .
Even better , Biden will get the nomination .
This will help keep antiwar voters and “ enough is enough ” voters from having a significant choice .
The Republicans can then run McCain , who will be in “ discreet retreat ” mode , and the Democrats will not be able to point the finger and say , “ Flip - flopper ! ”
But for Fox News and the cheerleaders , this is a defeat .
They ran up their ratings with pro-war rhetoric .
Now they find that this rhetoric is about as safe as a tour bus in Baghdad .
If a Republican wins in 2008 , and the pull - out begins in 2009 , it will be a nightmare for the Foxes of this world .
They will not be able to blame a Democrat for cutting and running .
They will have to swallow the castor oil of a military pull - back .
And , as it goes through their system , doing what castor oil does to the intestinal track , they will have to stand at attention in full public view as the flag goes by — away from Iraq .
It will be a long parade .
Think of the pain !
Think of the squirming !
CONCLUSION
Inevitably , cheerleaders on one side in any game find themselves performing when the score is relentlessly increasing for the opposition .
The war in the Big Game in Iraq is an away game .
The stands on the loser ’s side are starting to thin out .
Nevertheless , the cheerleaders must yell just as loudly in a losing effort as a winning effort .
They must jump up and down with equal vigor as before .
But their efforts have no effect on what is happening on the field .
Cheerleaders soon graduate and get on with life .
Fox News will also get on with life .
The troops buried in their unphotographed caskets will not get on with life .
For them , their Nielsen ratings will remain the same : zero .
They are in a tie with tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians .
For all of them , this ratings war had high stakes .
For politicians buying votes and broadcasters selling soap , it did n’t .
I am glad that I was never a cheerleader for this war .
By the way , this does not make me a cheerleader for the other side .

In my post earlier today , I analyzed my recent social security statement and found that the government was giving me a - 0.8 % ( yes , that is negative ) rate of return on my forced savings .
You can read that post for the methodology , which I admit was simplistic ( I have a day job , after all ) but I still think is pretty accurate .
There is not getting around the fact that the government is forcing
a retirement program on you that is such a ripoff that a private company would likely get
prosecuted for offering it .
One of the arguments I have seen go back and forth , and that I refer to in that post , is whether Social Security is a retirement plan or a welfare program ( its a floor wax and a desert topping ! )
One of the reasons this argument comes up so much is that its defenders take both sides of the question , depending on whom they are arguing against .
If you argue that as a welfare program , Social Security is terribly inefficient and pays too many benefits to richer workers , they argue it is a retirement program with premiums and you can't cut benefits to anyone who has paid in .
Argue as I did in this post that it is the worst retirement program in all of America , and its defenders say that you can't analyze it that way because there are welfare benefits embedded .
So I wondered , could I solve this with numbers ?
I stared at my belly button for a moment , and decided that 6.5 % was a good conservative private return number that I would be willing to plan my retirement around .
I plugged this number into my spreadsheet ( Download socialsecurity4.xls ) and found that my social security premiums , invested privately , would yield an annuity at 67 of $ 11,699 per month , or an amount 5.89 times larger than social security is currently promising me for the same inputs .
This tells me that only about 17 % ( 1/5.89 ) of my taxes in social security are going to my own retirement .
The other 83 % are going to a huge welfare program , either directly , as payments for someone else 's retirement , or indirectly , through the inherent government inefficiency you accept when you provide intellectual welfare ( I define " intellectual welfare " as the government doing something for you because it does n't trust you not to screw the task up if you did it yourself -- in this case , the task is saving for retirement ) .
Postscript :
As pointed out in my postscripts and the comments to the original post , taxes , inflation , spouse survival , etc. all complicate the analysis , but most of the effects work both ways .
For example , Social Security provides some benefits to surviving spouses I do n't include .
That potentially understates the value of the SS package .
However , as pointed out in the comments , private savings would be inheritable by my family in the case of my early death , and would dwarf SS survivor benefits in most cases .
Ditto for disability benefits .
I ’ve mentioned over and over and over again that I ’m not a programmer , but a econometrician .
Today we put that to good use .
1 . The problem
I can think of two ways of producing the list of divisors of a number :
divisors x = [ y | y <- [ 1..x ] , ( gcd x y ) == y ]
fdivisors x = [ y | y <- [ 1..x ] , x `mod` y == 0 ]
Intuition would tell us the second one is faster , but is that really a fact ?
2. Generating data
To test that , we devise two tests :
test1p n = ( n , sum $ map ( length . divisors ) [ 1..n ] )
test2p n = ( n , sum $ map ( length . fdivisors ) [ 1..n ] )
Now in good old GNU R , I produce a list of random numbers between 50 and 10000 and paste them over my code .
testdata = [ 3476,1856,3234,1080,369,2951,4930,4820,2270,2023,4613,3345,2252,2100,1187,643,3657,1493,4043,2439,4706,4885,2328,4294,4923,4427,4892,4147,4134,1215,586 ]
Now I ’m going to engage in some code generation .
produce = putStrLn $ concat $ map wrap testdata where
wrap n = " test1 p " ++ show n ++ "
test2 p " ++ show n ++ "
"
I run produce in GHCi and paste the results on a text file .
Next I add the following two lines to the beginning of said file :
:l trigs.hs
: set +s
where trigs.hs is the name of my Haskell code file .
We save everything to produce.raw and on a shell window , I type
ghci < produce.raw
This will produce a few dozens of lines like
* Trigs > ( 3657,30578 )
( 33.58 secs , 565482232 bytes )
* Trigs > ( 1493,11140 )
( 8.95 secs , 291860752 bytes )
* Trigs > ( 1493,11140 )
( 5.60 secs , 94533060 bytes )
After everything is said and done , a couple of regexes turns the results into CSV format .
We add a line in the beginning naming the columns and switch back into GNU R .
3. Loading and plotting data
This line of R code will load our data into the system :
data<- read.table ( " ~/repos/comparealgos.csv " , header =TRUE , sep= " , " )
Let ’s take some plots .
plot (n , time )
plot(n , bytes )
The intuitive story of ( a ) running time depending on the size of n and ( b ) the `mod` algorithm being faster than the gcd one seems to hold .
But let ’s put numbers into this .
4. Linear regression analysis
In a nutshell , linear regresion analysis is about fitting data to an equation ( possibly a system of multiple equations in more sophisticated models ) and performing statistical tests of whether the fit means anything .
The first model we ’re going try to fit is the following :
where is 0 for the gcd algorith and 1 for the mod algorithm , and accounts for serendipity .
Note the quadratic term : with this single term , we can both screen for more - than - linear and less - than - linear growth of time on n .
Another way to look at this is to differentiate :
As we see , is a constant effect of scale , while is an effect that varies on the size of n .
If is negative , we have a smaller effect as n grows and vice - versa .
It ’s also interesting to look at :
where is the expected value .
In this model , the effect of changing algorithms is supposed to be constant for any .
Let ’s run this on GNU R :
model < - lm ( time~n + I( n ^ 2 ) +f , data=data )
summary ( model )
This will give us
Call : lm ( formula = time ~ n + I ( n ^ 2 ) + f , data = data ) Residuals : Min 1Q Median 3Q Max - 12.2097 - 7.6267 - 0.5312 7.7528 12.6358 Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t value Pr( > |t| ) ( Intercept ) 1.190e+01 5.042e+00 2.361 0.0222 * n - 9.796e-04 3.860e-03 - 0.254 0.8007 I ( n^2 ) 3.618e-06 6.534e-07 5.537 1.14e-06 *** f - 2.265e+01 2.273e+00 - 9.968 1.79e-13 *** --- Signif . codes : 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '. '
0.1 ' ' 1 Residual standard error : 8.35 on 50 degrees of freedom Multiple R- Squared : 0.9386 , Adjusted R-squared : 0.9349 F-statistic : 254.9 on 3 and 50 DF , p-value : < 2.2e - 16
The estimate column holds the value for the parameters defined on the equation above .
The t value column is a measure of how far the parameter is from zero given its uncertainty .
If the regression residuals follow a gaussian normal distribution , 1.96 ( or - 1.96 ) is a good critical value for considering the variable in question significant ; in any case , values above 3 tend to indicate an important relationship .
The effect of is apparently zero , but is significant and positive — which means the algorithm grows more - than - linearly on size .
The effect of is very strongly negative , which indicates the second algorithm really tends to be faster .
We can run , just for kicks , the same regression for memory usage .
The algebraic analysis remains the same .
Call : lm ( formula = bytes ~ n + I ( n ^ 2 ) + f , data = data ) Residuals : Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -624215565 -421792810 -1493863 425410175 622244685 Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t value Pr( > |t| ) ( Intercept ) 6.368e+08 2.753e+08 2.313 0.02485 * n - 2.654e+04 2.107e+05 - 0.126 0.90027 I ( n^2 ) 9.829e+01 3.567e+01 2.755 0.00816 ** f - 1.250e+09 1.241e+08 - 10.075 1.25e-13 *** --- Signif . codes : 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '. '
0.1 ' ' 1 Residual standard error : 455900000 on 50 degrees of freedom Multiple R- Squared : 0.8419 , Adjusted R-squared : 0.8324 F-statistic : 88.77 on 3 and 50 DF , p-value : < 2.2e - 16
Compare the multiple value between the two regressions .
The statistic measures how closely the model fits the data .
One way to look at this is to affirm that apparently memory usage is also determined by something else we have n’t mentioned — this evidently being the size of the divisor list .
5 . A better model
Let ’s revise our equation .
We ’ve added an additional “ interaction ” term .
To see what this means , let ’s look at expected values again :
In this new model , the effect of changing algorithms is allowed to vary with the size of as well .
Let ’s estimate this model :
Call : lm ( formula = time ~ n + I ( n ^ 2 ) + f + f:n , data = data ) Residuals : Min 1Q Median 3Q Max - 4.56081 - 1.30100 0.09815 1.67459 4.00706 Coefficients : Estimate Std. Error t value Pr( > |t| ) ( Intercept ) - 5.622e+00 1.377e+00 - 4.083 0.000164 *** n 4.451e-03 9.600e-04 4.636 2.66e-05 *** I ( n ^2 ) 3.618e-06 1.592e-07 22.723 < 2e -16 *** f 1.240e+01 1.362e+00 9.100 4.19e- 12 *** n:f -1.086e-02 3.856e-04 - 28.163 < 2e -16 *** --- Signif . codes : 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '. '
0.1 ' ' 1 Residual standard error : 2.035 on 49 degrees of freedom Multiple R- Squared : 0.9964 , Adjusted R-squared : 0.9961 F-statistic : 3418 on 4 and 49 DF , p-value : < 2.2e -16
Now all the coefficients are indeed very significant , including the linear term on .
This gives us the following formulas for predicting the running time of both algorithms on a given :
An interesting observation : the coefficient for being positive means that the running time of the GCD algorithm starts lower ; on the other hand , MOD will quickly outrun it ( solve a simple inequality to find ranges of if you ’re so inclined ) .
Conclusions
I might return to this topic if it arises enough interest .
For the time being , I tried keeping it short and sweet , even if it meant glossing over all the relevant theoretical details .
Discussion is appreciated , etc. etc.
Oh , and remember this all was run on an old G4 mac mini , on the interpreter ( not compiled / optimized ) , all while browsing and IMing at the same time .
Do n’t just benchmark this on JRuby on your dual Opteron and say your language leaves my language biting the dust .
Story Highlights • MSNBC and CBS to suspend Don Imus for two weeks
• Imus apologizes on the Rev. Al Sharpton 's radio show
• Sharpton , National Association of Black Journalists urge firing
• Imus made remarks about Rutgers women 's basketball team
Adjust font size :
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- MSNBC and CBS Radio are suspending Don Imus for two weeks after the radio host described the Rutgers University women 's basketball team as " nappy - headed hos , " the networks said Monday .
The suspensions start April 16 , and MSNBC's " future relationship " with Imus depends on " his ability to live up to his word , " according to a statement from NBC News .
The cable news channel simulcasts a television version of Imus ' radio show .
" His dedication -- in his words -- to change the discourse on his program moving forward , has confirmed for us that this action is appropriate , " the statement said .
( Watch Imus on the Rev. Al Sharpton 's show )
Shortly afterward , CBS announced plans to suspend its broadcast of Imus ' radio program for the same two weeks .
The flap began Wednesday , the day after Rutgers lost the NCAA women 's title to Tennessee .
Imus told listeners , " That 's some rough girls from Rutgers . "
" Man , they got tattoos , " he said .
" That 's some nappy - headed hos there , I 'm going to tell you that now . "
Imus apologized for the remark Friday and repeated the apology Monday , telling listeners , " I 'm embarrassed that I did that . "
" I'm a good person , but I said a bad thing , " he said .
" But these young women deserve to know that it was not said with malice . "
( Watch how some say " sorry " is n't enough )
Imus : ' No excuse ' for remark
Imus went on civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton 's syndicated radio show Monday and said there was " no excuse " for his remark .
" I 'm not thinking it 's a racial insult that 's being uttered at somebody at the time .
It 's in the process of trying to rap and be funny . " he said .
But he added , " I wish I had n't said it .
I 'm sorry I said it . "
( CNN 's Jeanne Moos on the Apology Hall of Fame )
For Sharpton , the apology was not enough .
He told CNN's " The Situation Room " on Monday , " We want him fired . "
" He hit a lot of us where we live , " he said .
" A lot of us that have condemned a lot of the language and gangster rap and a lot of language on the radio and said to kids , ' You have to quit using negative words . '
How do we go back to tell our kids to clean up their words when you can call some exemplary young women this , and we say nothing and extract no punishment to protect their integrity and self - esteem ? "
The National Association of Black Journalists has called for the veteran " shock jock " to be fired as well .
Brian Monroe , the group 's president , said Imus and his sidekicks have a long history of making crude racial and sexual comments .
" The only consequence we can imagine , that suits the words that he said , is for him to hang it up , " Monroe said on Sharpton 's program .
Also Monday , speaking at a demonstration outside NBC 's studio in Chicago , Illinois , the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Imus ' mistake goes beyond an insult .
" This was not a slip of lip .
This was a point of view , " he said .
On the Rutgers campus , Imus ' words have been met with outrage .
University President Richard McCormick called the remarks " disgraceful , disgusting and racist . "
" [ The women 's basketball team ] represented Rutgers in an exemplary fashion of which we are extraordinarily proud , and then he says that .
Why , why , why , why , why ? " McCormick said .
New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine further condemned Imus ' words and said , " There is absolutely no excuse for his conduct , and he is right to apologize .
Only the Rutgers women 's basketball team , however , can decide to accept his apology . "
The Rutgers women 's basketball team is expected to hold a news conference Tuesday morning .
McCain : ' I 'm a believer in redemption '
But Imus ' show continues to draw top - level guests from the world of politics -- and one of those , Republican presidential contender Sen .
John McCain , said Monday he would continue to appear on the show .
" I'm a great believer in redemption , " the senator from Arizona told reporters in Phoenix .
" Whether he needs to do more in order to satisfy the concerns of people like the members of that team , that 's something that 's between him and them . "
But syndicated columnist Clarence Page said candidates may need to answer for their appearances on the show , " just as if they belonged to a country club that discriminates . "
Howard Kurtz , media critic for The Washington Post and host of CNN's " Reliable Sources , " said Imus is known for his comedy , but , he said " the problem is ... his comedy too often strays into the offensive . "
Kurtz , whom Imus once called a " boner - nosed , beanie - wearing Jew boy , " said Imus may now understand that his remarks about the Rutgers team crossed the line .
" Imus should be held accountable for some of these offensive things that he says , but there is also a good side to Don Imus , and I do n't think that should be completely obliterated in all of this chest thumping , " he said .
Security flaw in RealVNC 4.1.1
.
Update ( June 2006 ) : We have created a vulnerability testing tool .
It is free , and can be downloaded from here
Update ( 05/10/2006 ) –
We have contacted the RealVNC team .
Quickly they released a new version that fixed the security issue .
If you are running WinVNC 4.1.1 I suggest you get to www.realvnc.com today and update your software .
Update ( 05/08/2006 ) –
We have installed RealVNC 4.1.1 on as many fresh computers as possible .
We wanted to make sure this is a real problem – indeed it is .
Every single time we were able to access the machine without a valid password .
We are still trying to see what is different about our viewer that exposes this flaw .
We are currently developing a new product that would allow users to remotely install VNC , and manage current VNC installations .
Our viewer is totally 100 % new code that we created from the VNC spec and not from the open source Real VNC source tree .
I got a big surprise today when I was testing the viewer code : I was able to view the remote machine without the proper password !
It had to be some type of mistake , so I installed Real VNC 4.1.1 on a test machine :
I set the password to a really huge value that I could not have possibly left in our code by accident .
Got back on the development machine and clicked connect :
Instantly I had a view of the remote machine !
I started to wonder how widespread this flaw was so I downloaded TightVNC , and UltraVNC .
They are immune .
Both of them reject my connection right away .
Then I downloaded RealVNC 4.0 and installed it on another fresh test machine .
Same thing as Tight and Ultra – I get disconnected right away .
So it looks like a flaw is in the current RealVNC 4.1.1 authentication process .
I am not going to give any clues as to what it is until I can figure it out totally , and promptly let the RealVNC team know so they can resolve the issue .
Please note that I have only tested this on the windows versions of the above software .

There 's a problem with tool design in the free software and academic community .
The tool designers are usually people who are building tools for some larger goal .
For example , let 's take the case of someone who wants to do web hacking in Scheme .
His Scheme system does n't have a sockets interface , so he sits down and hacks one up for his particular Scheme implementation .
Now , socket API 's are not what this programmer is interested in ; he wants to get on with things and hack the exciting stuff -- his real interest is Web services .
So he does a quick 80 % job , which is adequate to get him up and running , and then he 's on to his orignal goal .
Unfortunately , his quickly - built socket interface is n't general .
It just covers the bits this particular hacker needed for his applications .
So the next guy that comes along and needs a socket interface can't use this one .
Not only does it lack coverage , but the deep structure was n't thought out well enough to allow for quality extension .
So he does his own 80 % implementation .
Five hackers later , five different , incompatible , ungeneral implementations had been built .
No one can use each others code .
Olin Shivers wrote a paper about the regular - expression system for scsh .
The wisdom of the preamble alone makes the document worth reading :
This is the current situation for socket libraries in Common Lisp , and I have my own personal 80 % solution .
I 've heard more than one hacker say they 're working on a 100 % solution ; I hope at least one comes to fruition .
There 's more great stuff .
The " Discussion and design notes " section provides rationale for the features present in the system , and also discusses features intentionally absent from the system , giving a detailed survey of existing regular expression engines in the process .
For example :
SRE notation does not provide lazy repeat forms , of the kind found in perl .
Lazy repeat forms have problems .
In principle , a regexp does n't specify a matching algorithm , it specifies a set of strings .
Lazy submatches violate this principle .
Providing lazy submatches forces a particular matching algorithm : an NDFA - based backtracking search engine -- you can't use a fast DFA no -backtracking engine .
I chose to restrict the notation to keep it algorithm - independent .
It makes me wish all library authors :
surveyed the field of existing solutions as thoroughly
grasped the problem space beyond their immediate need
provided rationale for intentionally missing features
This is above the normal stuff that people should do just to achieve a reasonable baseline of quality , like fully document the public interface .
To paraphrase Chris Rock , some library authors are proud of stuff they 're just supposed to do .
" This library is fully documented . "
What do you want , a cookie ?
You 're not supposed to release undocumented code , you low - expectation - having motherfucker !
( Not that I 'm any better . )
Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model .
It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning .
I ’ve created a table ( below ) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning .
The point here is not simply “ woe unto us ” .
There are several implications which seem important .
Here is a summary what is wrong with various frameworks for learning .
To avoid being entirely negative , I added a column about what ’s right as well .
Name Methodology
What ’s right
What ’s wrong
Bayesian Learning
You specify a prior probability distribution over data - makers , P( datamaker ) then use Bayes law to find a posterior P( datamaker|x ) .
True Bayesians integrate over the posterior to make predictions while many simply use the world with largest posterior directly .
Handles the small data limit .
Very flexible .
Interpolates to engineering .
Information theoretically problematic .
Explicitly specifying a reasonable prior is often hard .
Computationally difficult problems are commonly encountered .
Human intensive .
Partly due to the difficulties above and partly because “ first specify a prior ” is built into framework this approach is not very automatable .
Graphical / generative Models Sometimes Bayesian and sometimes not .
Data - makers are typically assumed to be IID samples of fixed or varying length data .
Data - makers are represented graphically with conditional independencies encoded in the graph .
For some graphs , fast algorithms for making ( or approximately making ) predictions exist .
Relative to pure Bayesian systems , this approach is sometimes computationally tractable .
More importantly , the graph language is natural , which aids prior elicitation .
Often ( still ) fails to fix problems with the Bayesian approach .
In real world applications , true conditional independence is rare , and results degrade rapidly with systematic misspecification of conditional independence .
Convex Loss Optimization Specify a loss function related to the world - imposed loss fucntion which is convex on some parametric predictive system .
Optimize the parametric predictive system to find the global optima .
Mathematically clean solutions where computational tractability is partly taken into account .
Relatively automatable .
The temptation to forget that the world imposes nonconvex loss functions is sometimes overwhelming , and the mismatch is always dangerous .
Limited models .
Although switching to a convex loss means that some optimizations become convex , optimization on representations which are n’t single layer linear combinations is often difficult .
Gradient Descent Specify an architecture with free parameters and use gradient descent with respect to data to tune the parameters .
Relatively computationally tractable due to ( a ) modularity of gradient descent ( b ) directly optimizing the quantity you want to predict .
Finicky .
There are issues with paremeter initialization , step size , and representation .
It helps a great deal to have accumulated experience using this sort of system and there is little theoretical guidance .
Overfitting is a significant issue .
Kernel - based learning
You chose a kernel K( x , x ’ ) between datapoints that satisfies certain conditions , and then use it as a measure of similarity when learning .
People often find the specification of a similarity function between objects a natural way to incorporate prior information for machine learning problems .
Algorithms ( like SVMs ) for training are reasonably practical — O ( n2 ) for instance .
Specification of the kernel is not easy for some applications ( this is another example of prior elicitation ) .
O( n2 ) is not efficient enough when there is much data .
Boosting
You create a learning algorithm that may be imperfect but which has some predictive edge , then apply it repeatedly in various ways to make a final predictor .
A focus on getting something that works quickly is natural .
This approach is relatively automated and ( hence ) easy to apply for beginners .
The boosting framework tells you nothing about how to build that initial algorithm .
The weak learning assumption becomes violated at some point in the iterative process .
Online Learning with Experts
You make many base predictors and then a master algorithm automatically switches between the use of these predictors so as to minimize regret .
This is an effective automated method to extract performance from a pool of predictors .
Computational intractability can be a problem .
This approach lives and dies on the effectiveness of the experts , but it provides little or no guidance in their construction .
Learning Reductions
You solve complex machine learning problems by reducing them to well - studied base problems in a robust manner .
The reductions approach can yield highly automated learning algorithms .
The existence of an algorithm satisfying reduction guarantees is not sufficient to guarantee success .
Reductions tell you little or nothing about the design of the base learning algorithm .
PAC Learning
You assume that samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution D . You think of learning as finding a near - best hypothesis amongst a given set of hypotheses in a computationally tractable manner .
The focus on computation is pretty right - headed , because we are ultimately limited by what we can compute .
There are not many substantial positive results , particularly when D is noisy .
Data is n’t IID in practice anyways .
Statistical Learning Theory
You assume that samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution D . You think of learning as figuring out the number of samples required to distinguish a near - best hypothesis from a set of hypotheses .
There are substantially more positive results than for PAC Learning , and there are a few examples of practical algorithms directly motivated by this analysis .
The data is not IID .
Ignorance of computational difficulties often results in difficulty of application .
More importantly , the bounds are often loose ( sometimes to the point of vacuousness ) .
Decision tree learning Learning is a process of cutting up the input space and assigning predictions to pieces of the space .
Decision tree algorithms are well automated and can be quite fast .
There are learning problems which can not be solved by decision trees , but which are solvable .
It ’s common to find that other approaches give you a bit more performance .
A theoretical grounding for many choices in these algorithms is lacking .
Algorithmic complexity Learning is about finding a program which correctly predicts the outputs given the inputs .
Any reasonable problem is learnable with a number of samples related to the description length of the program .
The theory literally suggests solving halting problems to solve machine learning .
RL , MDP learning Learning is about finding and acting according to a near optimal policy in an unknown Markov Decision Process .
We can learn and act with an amount of summed regret related to O ( SA ) where S is the number of states and A is the number of actions per state .
Has anyone counted the number of states in real world problems ?
We ca n’t afford to wait that long .
Discretizing the states creates a POMDP ( see below ) .
In the real world , we often have to deal with a POMDP anyways .
Flash vs. Ajax :
It 's time to expand your toolbox
20 MAR
I ’ve decided not to write the obligatory SXSW wind down post as all your favourite bloggers already have and there ’s no point in adding to the pile but I ’d like to talk about one particular topic that came up in Jonathan Boutelle ’s Ajax or Flash :
What ’s right for you ?
panel .
In the panel he talked , quite generally , about the relative advantages of each platform , examined services like You Tube , Slideshare and several others and essentially came to the conclusion that both have their place and are not mutually exclusive .
In fact , it seems that hybrid Flash / Ajax applications have the best of both worlds and that developers who ’s skills lie in both Flash and Ajax will become more and more valuable .
For quite a large proportion of my career I ’ve been a Flash developer starting round about Flash 4 with my final commercial work being done with MX 2004 .
I was even a beta tester for MX at one point .
In fact , thinking about it I ’ve probably spent an equal amount of time working with Flash as I have with JavaScript but of late , and mostly since the Web Standards movement took hold , I ’ve been working in the field of HTML / CSS / JS ( for front end work ) almost exclusively so this panel struck a cord with me .
I left the room with a mission : update my Flash knowledge by learning about ActionScript 3 and Flex 2 but more importantly examine more fully how Flash can fit in with more modern ( read : trendy ) web development trends like REST , semantics and friendly URLs and how this can all interface with JavaScript and HTML …
Flash has some really quite incredible features that we struggle with implementing with HTML / CSS / JS : Sound , Dynamic vector drawing , Sockets , local storage , video .
I could go on .
Why the hell are we struggling with < canvas > and VML ?
Comet is essentially a hack while XMLSockets are built in to Flash … and then you have Red 5 .
To add to this , Apollo has just been released which is looking pretty interesting .
See what I mean ?
The sweet spot for JavaScript and Ajax has always been for those small , progressive enhancements rather than for creating rich interfaces .
It seems to me that the more you head in that direction with JavaScript the more serious limitations you encounter .
Browser JavaScript is never fast , has memory leak issues , browser bugs , CSS bugs and all manner of other tom foolery that , when you get to the stage of building something like for Google Maps get ’s really time consuming and messy .
There are many efforts ( WHATWG , Tamarin etc etc ) that are working toward solving many of these problems but for now and for the foreseeable future we are stuck with em .
This , I think , is when it ’s time to bring out Flash .
Not for the whole app of course , but used in conjunction with HTML / CSS / JS .
Flash however is not without it ’s problems .
I lost interest with Flash mainly for these reasons :
Monolithic applications :
Flash apps tend to exist at one URL , fail to respond to the back button well and generally work within their own environment in the browser rather than working with the browser .
, fail to respond to the back button well and generally work within their own environment in the browser rather than working with the browser .
Bad programming environment : Working on a Flash app with more than one person was always a pain in the arse .
Because a lot of the app was contained inside one or more FLA files which could only be opened by one person at a time and it was a binary file version control was a pain .
files which could only be opened by one person at a time and it was a binary file version control was a pain .
Controls did n’t work enough like browser controls :
The in - built components helped a bit but Flash select boxes , scroll bars and other widgets just did n’t look or act the same .
Bad for usability .
Accessibility no-no : Previously SWFs where essentially a black box to assistive technologies and event MX components seemed to have trouble with keyboard focus and tabbing .
* Limited and tedious interface with JavaScript : Getting data in and out of the SWF was possible but never easy .
was possible but never easy .
ActionScript is heading toward Java :
Oh man , do n’t get me started .
As ActionScript develop it becomes less and less dynamic .
` You get native classes and packages but type annotations ?
I suppose you get a performance boost but really .
Static types are for stupid people … we do n’t need em
It ’s not open source
After re-examining these many are solvable , avoidable or have been solved recently .
Solving the first problem is probably the most interesting of the lot .
We all know the internet works best when it ’s used as a linked web of resources .
To do this each resource in the flash application needs it ’s own URL even if these all just point to the same SWF .
I ’ve not seen this done but I ’ve got some ideas on how this could be achieved .
What I ’m thinking is that rather than a Flash app having one end point , eg. flashpaint.com it can have an end point for each document that can be favourited , linked to and all that shit eg : flashpaint.com / pictures / dans-bum .
If we architected an application like this it would be easy to use the end point to provide different formats eg. flashpaint.com/pictures/dans-bum.svg etc .
The bad programming environment problem is solved for us .
Flex 2 is all text based and although a bit XMLy for my liking is n’t bad .
You can even get a Textmate bundle for it .
Most importantly you can lob it all in version control .
Better .
Accessibility has also been greatly improved of late , I do n’t yet know the details , but I do know it ’s no longer a black box .
The interface to JavaScript has been improved too with the Flash / Ajax bridge ( stupid name aside ) but I think this can be improved further .
It ’s all a bit heavy on code and complex but sure it can be streamlined some .
Unfortunately though , ActionScript continues it ’s journey away from the land of dynamism but on the upside you do get E4X and all kinds of other nice stuff and we ca n’t do much about it .
Even JS 2 is going this way .
Then finally , there ’s the whole open source thing .
Where do we start ?
I ’ll start by saying that I ’m not a religious person neither spirtually or technically .
I ’m a pragmatist and while I normally work in open source with its many benefits I can take a bit of proprietary action if need be .
I ’ve heard many members of the web standards and ajax communities basically strike Flash off on this point alone which to me is just insane .
It may be proprietary but it ’s got a great community around it ( and a great OS community for that matter ) so that works for me .
No , it ’s not a standard , but really , what have standards done for us anyway ?
The power of the ‘ web standards ’ movement was , in my opinion , more about moving back to semantic HTML and the separation of content and presentation rather than about valid code and standards anyway .
I say drop your prayer book and use the best tool for the job .
So yeah , I ’ll be looking in to Flash and Flex then .
I might even write about it .
But then it seems other people already are which is cool .
So what do y’all reckon ?
Am I barking up the wrong tree ?
PS .
That comment about Static typing was totally unqualified and slightly stupid statement .
I like it though .
It ’s the kind of thing you ’ll catch me saying after 5 pints at Pub Standards .

About the art of Justin Mullins
For many people , their main experience of mathematics is sheer blind terror .
Show them an equation and cold beads of sweat appear on their foreheads as they succumb to the icy grip of fear .
For others , the experience is quite different .
Some are bemused or irritated ; others feel a surge of curiosity and a powerful sense of achievement when the hieroglyphics have been conquered .
Then there is the sense of beauty , elegance and power that mathematics conveys .
Many mathematicians have remarked on this exquisiteness as well as on its inevitable counterpoint : a tortured ugliness that is sometimes almost suffocating .
All this points to an extraordinary but rarely remarked upon role for mathematics : as a vehicle for social , emotional and cultural exchange .
That ’s where my interest lies .
I am not interested in mathematics as it is often portrayed : as a silver thread of logic that leads from hypothesis to proof .
This is a kind of ivory castle of mathematics , a perfect but ultimately unreachable world .
For me , mathematics is a human activity — at times it is awe inspiring and mind blowing but it is also infuriating , puzzling , unsatisfactory and often wrong ( at least when I think about it ) .
Reuben Hersh describes it refreshingly in his book
What is mathematics , really ?
“ Mathematics must be understood as a human activity , a social phenomenon , part of human culture , historically evolved , and intelligible only in a social context . ”
My work attempts to capture this element of mathematics .
I often use it to remember people , things and important moments .
I try to use it to capture vignettes of ordinary moments , to create portraits of people I know or snapshots of mathematical landscapes that have inspired or terrified me .
I too know the icy grip of fear !
For me , it is an emotional experience , indeed it is a roller coaster ride .
Let me say upfront that I am not a mathematician .
I lay no claim to the equations I have selected in my work .
Those are the discoveries of the philosophers and scientists who spend their lives exploring the mathematical world and revealing its great wonders .
For me they are like the great explorers returning from distant shores with tales of fantastic lands and magical creatures .
If mathematicians are explorers , then my role is that of a photographer who retraces their steps .
During my journey , I photograph what I find .
By that I mean I frame it , record it and later present it .
There is nothing particularly special about this process .
In the same way that an ordinary photograph is a snapshot of an area of outstanding natural beauty , a mathematical photograph is a snapshot of mathematical beauty .

In Response to a Popular Islam Basher
Before I delve into the main subject of this post , let me make this clear : I am not a ' Muslim extremist ’ .
I support freedom of thought and expression and I value constructive criticism .
I am writing this post as a critique only .
In the recent months , an egregiously outspoken critic of Islam has gained a heap of media attention and mass popularity for her anti-Islamic views .
In a public speech , Wafa Sultan , the Islam basher , said , “ There is no moderate Islam at all because Islam is different from any other religion . ”
She continued , “ They believe the Quran is the absolute word of God and we ’re not supposed to play with it or change it . ”
I ca n’t understand what she means by saying ‘ there is no moderate Islam because Islam is different from any other religion ’ .
Does this mean homogeneity breeds moderation ?
How ?
I believe we must celebrate our differences and should try to use them as grounds for amity , not divide ..
As far as Quran ’s being the absolute word of God is concerned , yes , Quran is the absolute word of God .
That ’s what the Muslims believe .
And I can’t find anything wrong in it .
And , of course , no Muslim is supposed to ‘ play with it or change it ’.
I ca n’t find anything wrong with this either .
On the contrary , I think if the Muslims were supposed to change the word of God , the Muslim ‘ terrorists ’ or ‘ extremists ’ would most certainly do so to legitimize their actions and hence , gain a wider popular support among ‘ devout ’ Muslims .
Who would want that ?
Also , to the best of my knowledge , no one in any other religion is allowed to ‘ change ’ the text of a sacred book or ‘ play ’ with it in any other form .
For Muslims , Islam is a ‘ complete code of life ’ .
This means it is a complete social , political and religious system which can enable a Muslim society to run autonomously and without any ideological support from outside .
This also means that in a Muslim state , politics and religion are intertwined .
Nonetheless , almost all of the ‘ problems ’ seen in Islamic countries have nothing to do with Islam ; rather , they are caused by local tribal traditions and cultures confused to be Islamic .
Forced marriages , or mandatory circumcision of girls , for example , have nothing to do with Islamic principals .
Likewise , torture or rape of women are strictly forbidden in Islam .
These phenomena have become characteristic of Islam because they are practiced frequently in Muslim countries .
Dr Sultan is , as some people speculate , currently enjoying a position of popularity and fame in an atmosphere of immunity .
She will continue to enjoy these privileges as long as she keeps bashing Islam .
She may appear to be a hero championing the cause of free speech in an oppressively censuring society , but it is said that she may be doing so just to further her personal objectives .
Her case is more or less like that of Ayan Hirsi Ali , a Dutch ex-Muslim politician and a fierce critic of Islam .

Carbon offsets do not cut pollution , MPs were told
The public is being " seriously misled " by companies peddling carbon offset schemes , campaigner Jutta Kill told the environmental audit committee .
The schemes did not reduce emissions and simply gave industry a " licence to pollute " elsewhere , she argued .
People should give money directly to climate charities instead , she said .
Under carbon offsetting schemes , air passengers pay to fund tree planting and other environmental projects in developing countries .
The practice has become a badge of honour for politicians on all sides - amongst others - over the past year , as they compete to prove their green credentials .
' Inefficient '
But campaigners giving evidence to the Commons environmental audit committee , chaired by Tory MP Tim Yeo , questioned the value of offsetting as a way of tackling climate change .
Jutta Kill , of the Forests and the European Union Resource Network ( FERN ) , was the most vehement opponent of the practice , arguing it probably did more harm than good .
It is very hard to convey to people that when they are buying an offset they are not actually neutralising their impact on the global environment
Ruth Davis , RSPB
Guide : Carbon offsets
Carbon offsetting was " an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing emissions , " she argued , and its effects were impossible to verify .
In addition , " More than half " of the money given to companies selling carbon offsets went on research and administration costs , " benefiting not the climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry " .
' Straightforward donations '
" We believe it is worse than nothing because it creates the illusion , or the impression , in the public that action is being taken , while we are not really addressing the task at hand , significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions , " Ms Kill told MPs .
People would be better off making " straightforward donations " to climate projects through established charities .
" This is a serious issue of misleading the public , if you are not telling people that what you are buying is something that is not very viable .
" And those that have set up this offset market are fully aware of this fact , " she told the committee .
' Fossil fuels '
Larry Lohmann , of environmental and social think tank The Corner House , argued offsets perpetuated the myth that tackling climate change was a " matter of individual choices " .
" I think this is a particularly pernicious type of miseducation in the area of climate change because if there is one lesson that the scientific analysis of the climate change problem teaches us it is that systemic change is required .
We believe that once action has been taken there is a potential role for offsetting
Brian Samuel , Energy Saving Trust
" It is not a matter of individual choices within a given set of limited options , " he told the MPs .
Ending the " mining and use of fossil fuels " was far more important , he argued .
" Offsets are slowing down social change of the type which is necessary in the south , in the countries in which the offset projects are actually being constructed .
" Contrary to hype , they are actually reinforcing the reliance on fossil fuels in those countries rather than trying to bridge away from that , " he added .
' Scepticism '
Ruth Davis , head of climate change policy at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) , also questioned the value of offsets , saying the way they were being marketed was " harmful " .
" Our major scepticism about the role voluntary offsets play is the overall message that is associated with them , " she told the committee .
" It is very hard to convey to people that when they are buying an offset they are not actually neutralising their impact on the global environment .
" They , I think quite understandably , believe what they are doing is buying something which means they are relieved from the responsibility of further action . "
Offsetting schemes also undervalued the environmental cost of carbon emissions , she argued , and companies offering them often had " very high " profit margins and did not properly explain what they were selling .
" There are many people who are buying offsets who do n't understand what they are buying .
" They are not buying an emission reduction and they are not buying neutrality , " she told the MPs .
It would be better to " give people an opportunity to make a contribution that would help people manage climate change either here or abroad , " she added .
' Coherent '
Brian Samuel , of the Energy Saving Trust also questioned the role of carbon offsetting , but said they could work in conjunction with other initiatives .
" We believe that once action has been taken there is a potential role for offsetting , " he said .
The committee is expected to take evidence next week from companies offering carbon offsetting services .
It is also hoping to take evidence from airlines and ministers from the department for rural affairs before producing a draft report in early May .
Conduct
Among other issues , it is looking at whether there should be more robust legislation of the carbon offset market , including a compulsory accreditation scheme .
It is also examining whether customers were getting enough information to make clear choices about offsetting and whether the science behind it is " sufficiently coherent " .
Last month , the government announced a voluntary code of conduct for carbon offsetting schemes to bring " greater clarity " to the industry .
Launching the scheme , Environment Secretary David Miliband said offsetting " is n't the answer to climate change " .
" The first step should always be to see how we can avoid and reduce emissions , " he said .
But offsetting has a role because " some emissions ca n't or wo n't be avoided " , he added .
A Pentagon spokesman , Lt. Col. Todd Vician , said Sunday that the military disputes Mr. Padilla ’s accusations of mistreatment .
And , in court papers , prosecutors deny “ in the strongest terms ” the accusations of torture and say that “ Padilla ’s conditions of confinement were humane and designed to ensure his safety and security . ”
Image
In the videotape , Mr. Padilla 's feet were shackled .
“ His basic needs were met in a conscientious manner , including Halal ( Muslim acceptable ) food , clothing , sleep and daily medical assessment and treatment when necessary , ” the government stated .
“ While in the brig , Padilla never reported any abusive treatment to the staff or medical personnel . ”
In the brig , Mr. Padilla was denied access to counsel for 21 months .
Andrew Patel , one of his lawyers , said his isolation was not only severe but compounded by material and sensory deprivations .
In an affidavit filed Friday , he alleged that Mr. Padilla was held alone in a 10 - cell wing of the brig ; that he had little human contact other than with his interrogators ; that his cell was electronically monitored and his meals were passed to him through a slot in the door ; that windows were blackened , and there was no clock or calendar ; and that he slept on a steel platform after a foam mattress was taken from him , along with his copy of the Koran , “ as part of an interrogation plan . ”
Mr. Padilla ’s situation , as an American declared an enemy combatant and held without charges by his own government , was extraordinary and the conditions of his detention appear to have been unprecedented in the military justice system .
Philip D. Cave , a former judge advocate general for the Navy and now a lawyer specializing in military law , said , “ There ’s nothing comparable in terms of severity of confinement , in terms of how Padilla was held , especially considering that this was pretrial confinement . ”
Ali al - Marri , a Qatari and Saudi dual citizen and the only enemy combatant currently detained in the United States , has made similar claims of isolation and deprivation at the brig in South Carolina .
The Pentagon spokesman , Lieutenant Vician , said Sunday that he could not comment on the methods used to escort Mr. Padilla to the dentist .
Blackened goggles and earphones are rarely employed in internal prison transports in the United States , but riot gear is sometimes used for violent prisoners .

Key to the Bush administration ’s approach to immigration reform is the controversial guest worker program , which preserves the flow of cheap , low - skilled labor to American businesses while limiting the potential costs to employers and taxpayers .
Under the program , there will be no children to educate ( since guest workers wo n’t be allowed to bring their families with them ) , no old - age entitlements to dole out ( since workers will have to return home after working here for a maximum of six years ) , not even any health care to pay for ( since these low - wage workers will be required to purchase health insurance ) .
The very existence of this program as a central tenet of the Kennedy - Kyl legislation , the bi-partisan immigration compromise that has drawn attacks from the left and right and inspired some of the most overwrought rhetoric in recent memory , points to the essential hypocrisy of the anti-immigrant stance .
It appears their goal is not to keep out immigrants , who are indispensable to the U.S. economy , but rather to control and exploit them more effectively .
Why give them the opportunity to become citizens — or even permanent residents — if we can get what we need from them and then send them packing ?
Though it ’s been cast by the Bush administration as a novel way to solve the nation ’s immigration problem , guest worker programs are nothing new in the United States .
In fact , such programs have a uniformly sordid history that goes back nearly a century .
“ Emergency ” guest worker programs were launched in response to labor shortages during both World War I and World War II and lingered long after the troops had returned home .
At its peak in the 1950s , the notoriously exploitative Bracero Program ( bracero translates to unskilled laborer ) imported nearly a half - million temporary agricultural workers from Mexico .
In its concise history of guest worker programs , the Center for Immigration Reform notes : “ Citizen farmworkers in the Southwest simply could not compete with braceros .
The fact that braceros were captive workers who were totally subject to the unilateral demands of employers made them especially appealing to many employers .
It also led to extensive charges of abuse of workers by employers as most of the provisions for the protection of braceros ’ wage rates and working conditions were either ignored or circumvented . ”
What could be better for business than a workforce that works for next to nothing , drives down wages for everyone else , ca n’t protest or unionize , then goes away when you ’re done with them ?
As currently envisioned , the guest worker program would grant immigrant - workers two - year visas that are renewable three times ( provided they return to their home countries in between each two - year stint ) .
The original Kennedy - Kyl proposal estimated that 3.6 million guest workers could be employed in the U.S. within a decade .
Whether that target remains viable after the Senate and House get through tearing the bill apart is another matter altogether .
Just yesterday , the Senate fought off an amendment , by a one vote margin , that sought to end the guest worker program after five years — this only after Ted Kennedy appealed to Senator Daniel Akaka , the Hawaii Democrat , to change his vote .
The Senate also defeated an amendment that aimed to kill the part of the bill that would give illegal aliens who entered this country before January 1 , 2007 the right to apply for an eight - year visa .
As it stands , liberal Democrats , led by California ’s Barbara Boxer and South Dakota ’s Byron Dorgan , want to kill the guest worker provision outright , and they are joined in this sentiment by organized labor and most immigrants ’ rights groups .
But since they do n’t have the votes , they keep hacking away at the program piecemeal .
After losing a vote earlier this week to axe the program , they succeeded Wednesday in reducing its size , from 400,000 workers to 200,000 , in a bipartisan vote of 74 to 24 that also included concessions to Republicans , including a measure proposed by South Carolina ’s Lindsey Graham that requires mandatory prison sentences for illegal immigrants who are caught re-entering the country .
Some immigration advocates seem ready to overlook the program ’s obvious flaws , viewing it as a small price to pay in exchange for the legislation ’s promise to grant legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants now living in the United States , provided they jump through the required hoops .
( The legalization plan , one of the bill ’s most controversial provisions , roundly condemned by some Republicans as providing amnesty to illegals , survived a challenge in the Senate on Thursday . )
But if we ’re letting them stay , it ’s not because we ’re doing illegal immigrants a favor , it ’s because we could n’t survive a day without them .
These 12 million undocumented workers , who are for the most part employed , are only filling an obvious need .
They are vital to the profits of American agribusiness ( which also stands to be a primary beneficiary of the guest worker program ) and form the backbone of the low - cost workforce in the service industries .
( They are actively sought out by American companies for the purpose of breaking unions . )
Illegal immigrants also work at army bases as cooks and janitors .
Not only do these undocumented immigrants fight our wars , grow our food , care for our children and elderly , and serve us in a hundred ways every day , but they have also become an integral cog in American economic growth .
According to a February 2007 study by New York ’s Center for an Urban Future , immigrants are more likely to be self - employed than non-immigrants , spurring growth in new businesses from food manufacturing to health care .
“ Immigrant entrepreneurs are now the entrepreneurial sparkplugs of cities , ” according to Jonathan Bowles , the Center ’s director .
“ While immigrants have a long history of starting businesses in the U.S. , their contributions have grown in recent years thanks to an explosion of immigration and their high rates of business formation .
They are an incredible asset for cities that has only begun to be tapped for economic development , ” Bowles said .
It may , in fact , be the very success of recent immigrants that has some people nervous .
It ’s one thing to have them picking artichokes or cleaning bedpans , and another to have them nipping at the heels of the already insecure and debt - ridden middle class .
This , again , speaks to the backhanded appeal of the guest worker program , which promises to keep immigrants in their place — and can always be expanded to meet the demands of various low - wage industries .

Imagine a black hole swallowing Earth , ending life in an instant .
It 's not only the stuff of pulp sci - fi novels but , scientists say , a looming possibility .
" It would be a bad day for the solar system if we got visited by a black hole , " says Neil deGrasse Tyson , director of New York 's Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History .
In our vast galaxy there are billions upon billions of stars , each of which is at a different point in its life cycle .
Citing the law of averages , some scientists believe at least one star dies every day .
And in death , stars occasionally give birth to black holes ; when a massive celestial body 's core collapses , it creates an immense gravitational pull not unlike an invisible cosmic vacuum cleaner .
As it moves , it sucks in all matter in its way -- not even light can escape .
" If you shoot a nuclear weapon right into a black hole , the effect would be smaller than a pinprick compared to the enormous gravitational pull of a black hole itself , " explains Michio Kaku , professor of theoretical physics at City University of New York .
A black hole lies in the heart of every large galaxy .
A monstrous one sits in the center of our own Milky Way .
Astronomers say probably more than 10 million black holes inhabit the cosmos .
Hell Breaking Loose
Initially , scientists believed we had nothing to fear , because black holes were thought of as fairly stationary .
" Then , in the year 2000 , all hell broke loose , " Kaku says .
" At that point , we had conclusive evidence that there are wandering black holes -- nomads , renegades -- right next to us in our own backyard of a galaxy . "
Fortunately , scientists say the probability of a black hole heading straight toward Earth and swallowing us whole is highly unlikely .
But what would happen to us if one entered our solar system and came close to Earth ?
Although scientists have n't directly observed a black hole ( since a black hole swallows light ) , they have observed the effect of a black hole on surrounding material .
Astronomers say the first sign of a black hole 's approach would be subtle changes in the night sky .
The gravity from a black hole would distort Earth 's orbit and we'd begin to notice differences in the orbits of other planets and stars in the galaxy .
The closer a black hole gets to Earth , the worse the disruptions would become .
But even from a billion miles away from our solar system , a black hole would still cause a disruption in Earth 's orbit , leading to changes in our tides .
If a rogue black hole ever closed in on our solar system and crept up next to Earth , the resulting havoc would seem like the wildest science fiction .
Either Earth would career out of its orbit , spinning out of the solar system , or in the opposite direction , toward the sun , and we 'd suffer a deadly warming .
In either scenario , a black hole closing on Earth would cause our home planet to be literally ripped apart and swallowed whole .
" In a contest between a black hole and the Earth , " Tyson says , " Earth would lose .
It 's that simple . "

Aside from Rudy Giuliani's torturous explanation of his views on abortion , it was easy to discern after Thursday 's debate that the candidates running for the Republican presidential nomination are staunch advocates of life , namely when it comes to abortion .
In fact , they were passionate on the issue , and some made it clear that nothing is more important than life itself .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney : " Well , I 've always been personally pro-life . "
When asked about the Terri Schiavo case , he replied : " I think the Congress 's job is to make sure that laws are respecting the sanctity of life . "
California Rep. Duncan
Hunter evoked the memory of a late president to explain his position : " Ronald Reagan said , on the question of life , ' When there 's a question , err on the side of life . ' "
Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback was the most eloquent on the subject : " I believe life is one of the central issues of our day , and I believe that every human life at every phase is unique , is beautiful , is a child of a loving God , period . "
He later added : " Her life is sacred .
Even if it's in that difficult moment that she 's in at that point in time , that life is sacred , and we should stand for life in all its circumstances . "
On stem cell research , Brownback said , " It is not necessary to kill a human life for us to heal people . "
That last line caught my attention because that is often something we hear from victims rights groups , law enforcement and prosecutors when someone is put to death for committing a crime .
But if you take the candidates at face value , then why hold the same view when it comes to the death penalty ?
Now , for the purposes of getting everything out in the open : I 'm pro-choice .
Does that mean I 'm marching in the streets advocating abortion ?
No .
For me , it comes down to a woman choosing .
And just like Giuliani , the former mayor of New York City , I hate abortion and prefer for women not to make that choice .
Will some suggest that this is counter to my Christian faith ?
Absolutely .
But it is a difficult position , and one that I have wrestled with and continue to do so .
Yet I also support the death penalty .
There are individuals who should lose their life for committing heinous crimes .
And yes , I have struggled mightily , and would certainly say that my position has softened on this issue , just like it has on being pro-choice .
But even with all that , it 's still important to at least philosophically explore the issue of being a staunch pro-life advocate , yet stop the moment the child is born .
" I believe that every human life at every phase is unique , is beautiful , is a child of a loving God , period . "
Those are the words of Brownback , but does not that person -- even that hardened criminal -- fall under the same banner ?
Folks , it 's hard to say on one hand that every life -- at every phase -- is important , but then say , " Send them to the death chamber ! "
Those two are diametrically opposed to each other .
And I 'll be the first to tell you that many Christians -- especially right - wing conservatives -- are staunch anti-abortion advocates on Monday .
And on Tuesday , if there is an execution , they are right there supporting that one as well .
It would have been nice had debate moderator Chris Matthews forced the candidates to deal with this issue .
But let 's also expand the pro-life dialogue .
Where do the Republican candidates stand on funding Head Start for children ?
Is that not part of the development of human life ?
Are we going to see Republican candidates seek to change Medicaid laws to allow dentists to better care for those who get government assistance ?
Or are we willing to see another case like Deamonte Driver , a 12 - year - old Maryland boy who died because his family lost their Medicaid , and the boy 's abscess , which might have been cured with an $ 80 tooth extraction , led to his brain becoming infected ?
Are the Republican candidates going to vigorously fight for expanded pre-natal care for mothers in many inner cities around America , where the infant mortality rate rivals that of some Third World countries ?
What is needed -- on both sides -- is a full - scale discussion on what it really means to be pro-life .
Life is indeed precious .
And just as I have tussled with my personal views on being pro-choice and supportive of the death penalty , the pro-lifers should really examine whether they are as passionate about life beyond the womb .

3D pentomino solver program Some time around 1999 , I bought a plastic pentomino set at a game store .
The kind with twelve pentomino shaped plastic pieces that you have to arrange in a 6x10 rectangle .
On bringing it home , I immediately dumped the pieces out , and found myself unable to arrange the pieces back in the 6x10 rectangle .
I spent hour trying to solve it .
Worse yet , somebody else solved it on me !
I eventually ended up writing a program to solve it for me .
The program was a great success , on a P3 700 , it could compute all 5000 odd unique solutions to the puzzle in under two minutes .
It had not occured to me that there could be that many solutions .
over 20,000 solutions if you count flipping the whole puzzle .
Ever since , computerized heuristics for physical puzzles have fascinated me .
I subsequently decided to try a greater challenge : 3d pentominos .
And by 3d pentominos , I did n't just want to take the flat mentominos and make them out of five cubes .
I also included the non -flat pentominos ( I guess this does stretch the term " pentomino " a bit ) .
At any rate , my pieces comprised of any unique shape you could make if you glued five cubes together at their faces in various patterns .
Some of the 3d " pentomino " pieces
It turns out there are 12 flat pentominos , and 17 non - flat 3d shapes .
This makes for 29 pieces in all .
Because 29 is prime , this did n't make for a lot of ways to arrange them in a box .
So I added an extra five cubes , in the form of a 1x1x2 plus a 1x1x3 cube piece .
Having those extra pieces really helps when solving the puzzle by hand .
With the addition of the extra five cubes , the number of cubes is 29 * 5+5 , which is 150 .
This divides nicely into several factors .
I decided that the challenge should be to put the pieces in a box the size of 10x5x3 cubes .
The box to put the pentominos in I made a box that these will fit in fairly exactly .
The inside of the box is actually 1.5 milimeters bigger in each direction than what the sizes of the pentominos add up to , to allow for imprecisions and size changes in humidity .
The basic cube size is 18 mm .
At this point , I had n't written my computerized 3d pentomino solver yet .
However , I did manage to solve the puzzle several times .
The addition of the 1x1x2 and 1x1x3 pieces actually makes the puzzle reasonable to solve by hand if you save them till last .
At least I managed to solve a few times , where I have yet to ever solve the 2d pentomino problem by hand once .
I also have yet to see anybody else hand solve the 3d pentomino set ( my pride is regained ! ) .
the trick to solving it is to not solve it bottom up , but to start on the narrow side of the box , and work your way to the other side .
Also helps to save the pieces that are easy to place till the end , especially the 1x1x2 and 1x1x3 .
Around August of 2002 , I finally started working on a solver for the 3d pentomino puzzle .
I started out by writing an ascii graphics 3d cube pieces renderer .
+----+ / /| +----+ | | | | | | +----+ | |/ /| + + +----+ | / /| | +----+----+ | | | | | +--| | + | |/ +----+----+
Sample ASCII rendered pentomino
Next step was the solver heuristics .
This turned out to be much harder than the 2d solver program .
There are more than twice as many pieces , with more than twice as much room to put them in , and a maximum of 24 orientations , vs. only 8 orientations in 2d .
I also had to modify the heuristics somewhat , so that the solver would be smarter in terms of backing further out of stupid piece placements once it detected them .
With the 2d puzzle , stupid placements became apparent much more quickly , so I did n't have to be as smart about backing out of them fast .

A solution to the puzzle However , just printing the finished solution still did n't make it clear how the solution actually fit together , because many pieces would be hidden from view .
So I then had to write more code to actually generate assembly instructions for any one solution .
I did this by sorting the pieces by some arbitrarily chosen measure of Z order , and then showing the partially assembled solution , and the piece to be placed next at each step .
The piece shown separate is the next piece to be placed , and the shaded piece in the partial solution is where that piece is to be placed .

You can look at a Sample Solution with assembly instructions of the whole puzzle here .
This is basically what my program spits out for a solution .
Its very satisfying to assemble a solution like this , especially when you know how hard it is to solve by hand .
I have also given away several pentomino sets like the one I made as gifts .
Having a ready solution to actually pack it up with helps - it would be unconvincing to give a puzzle away in an unsolved state , and I can't solve the puzzle at will - its very much a matter of luck .
The puzzle is very tempting .
If its lying on the table unassembled , there are few people that wo n't attempt to put the pieces back in the box .
You can downlowd the 3d- pentomino .c source code here .
Compiles fine with Microsoft visual C or Gnu C compilers , run under Windows and Linux unmodified .
Should run on just about any system that has a C compiler , as it does all of its output in ascii .
You can also play with my 2D pentomino solver I mentioned 2d- pentomino .c .
After I wrote that one , I looked on the web and found other 2d pentomino solvers , but none was as fast as this one .
Also note that the 2d pentomino solver uses unaligned access , so it wo n't work on computers based on the Dec Alpah or ARM architecture , both of which are extremely rare for general purpose comuters .

DaimlerChrysler pulls out of Iran , weekly reports dpa German Press Agency
Published : Monday February 12 , 2007 Stuttgart , Germany - DaimlerChrysler is pulling out of Iran because of growing US pressure to end business investment there , a German weekly newspaper , Wirtschaftswoche , reported Monday in its online edition .
The weekly said the German - American company would next week give up its 51 - per-cent equity in Setareh Iran , its local distribution company .
A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart declined to comment .
Setareh was the exclusive distributor in Iran of Mercedes - brand vehicles , the weekly said , adding that pressure from Washington had grown for it to cease doing business in Iran , such as forbidding use of US parts in any vehicle sold inside Iran .

There have been lots of explanations recently of the dangers of JSON or JavaScript remoting .
This post is about what you can do to protect your scripts .
The Problem
The issues have been explained before , so I 'm going to assume some knowledge of the problem .
If you 're not sure , some stuff to read :
The Solutions
So what are the solutions ?
I think there are 3 options .
Each has their pros and cons :
Use a Secret in the Request Force pre-eval ( ) Processing Force POST requests
This post is a shortened version of the detailed description of what DWR does
If you are interested in the options DWR takes and how you can configure it , you should read page .
1. Use a Secret in the Request
If you can only support one of these protections , this is the one to chose .
Including a secret in the request allows the server to reject the request as invalid before any actions take place .
It is common to include the secret in the URL , however this is a slightly vulnerable position for a secret since it is likely to turn up in web server log files and so on .
It is possible to use cookie values like PHPSESSIONID or JSESSIONID read using Javascript as the secret .
The browsers cross-domain rules should prevent attackers from discovering this cookie .
However this method will stop working as people begin to switch to using HttpOnly cookies .
So it is better to start with a separate secret .
2. Force pre-eval () Processing
Since < script > tag remoting does not allow you to process the JSON or Javascript before it is eval ( ) ed you can protect your JSON by forcing it to be manipulated before eval ( ) .
All 3 of these techniques will prevent your request from being pure JSON , however you may rank security above purity .
There are 3 ways to do this :
Wrap the JSON in a comment .
For example , /* { ' data ' :' protected ' } */ .
When this is eval ( ) ed , there will be no result , however if you have fetched the data using XHR or iframe , you can do some string manipulation before eval ( ) to remove the leading /* and trailing */.
This method is good for plain JSON , however if you are using Javascript which could contain /* comments */ , then you should not use this technique because comments in Javascript do not nest .

Prefix the script with ' while ( 1 ) ; '
Since this is an infinite loop , if causes browsers to hang , and maybe give an error message .
Either way the script does not get executed .
There is a potential vulnerability that some browser may allow you to override the action of while using something like this : ' function while ( ) {} '.
However I do n't know of any such browser .
Google use this method to protect data in GMail . ' while ( 1 ) ; ' is possibly better than ' while ( true ) ; ' in case there are any browsers that allow you to redefine truth .
' Since this is an infinite loop , if causes browsers to hang , and maybe give an error message .

However I do n't know of any such browser .
Google use this method to protect data in GMail . ' ' is possibly better than ' ' in case there are any browsers that allow you to redefine truth .
Prefix the script with ' throw new Error ( " message " ) ; '.
This is a neat solution in that it allows you to explain what is wrong to users that get the message by mistake .
DWR uses this method .
It is potentially vulnerable to some browser allowing an attacker to redefine the Error or String constructors to prevent the throw from happening , however this does not work on any browser that I know of , and it 's hard to see how it could happen .
3. Force POST Requests
Since browsers use GET to process < script > tags , you can prevent < script > tags from working by denying GET requests for some JavaScript resource .
This is the most common solution , however it is also perhaps the weakest .
Firstly XHR - POST does n't work with older versions of Safari , so some support for GET is often useful .
More importantly future versions of Firefox are touted to include cross -domain XHR support .
While we do n't have exact knowledge of how this will happen , it would be foolish to base your security plans on this technique holding up .
Finally , we 're working in an environment where new possibilities are popping up every day - betting your security on a system that works more by fluke than design is n't a great idea in my opinion .
By default DWR denies POST requests for belt and braces security , however this is customizable to allow support for older versions of Safari .
PATNA , India ( Reuters ) - Villagers at a wedding in eastern India decided the groom had arrived too drunk to get married , and so the bride married the groom ’s more sober brother instead , police said Monday .
“ The groom was drunk and had reportedly misbehaved with guests when the bride ’s family and local villagers chased him away , ” Madho Singh , a senior police officer told Reuters after Sunday ’s marriage in a village in Bihar state ’s Arwal district .
The younger brother readily agreed to take the groom ’s place beside the teenage bride at her family ’s invitation , witnesses said .
“ The groom apologized for his behavior , but has been crying that word will spread and he will never get a bride again , ” Singh said by phone .
It 's common knowledge that a proper exercise regimen can do wonders for the body .
Only recently , however , have psychologists and gerontologists aggressively applied the same principle to the mind .
Among people who work with older adults , the concept of " cognitive fitness " has become a buzzword to describe activities that stimulate underutilized areas of the brain and improve memory .
Proponents of brain - fitness exercises say such mental conditioning can help prevent or delay memory loss and the onset of other age - related cognitive disorders .
" Most people 's idea of fitness stops at the neck , " said Patti Celori , executive director of the New England Cognitive Center .
" But the brain is the CPU of our body , and most people do n't do much to keep it as fit as possible . "
The NECC runs one of a growing number of programs that work with older adults to improve cognitive abilities .
Activities include computer programs designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain , replication of geometric designs using boards with pegs and rubber bands , and visual and auditory memory exercises .
Some of the other programs are Maintain Your Brain , initiated a year ago by the Alzheimer 's Association ; Mind Alert , run by the American Society on Aging ; and other regional programs such as the Center for Healthy Aging in Kent , Ohio .
For do - it - yourself types , a plethora of books have been published on getting the brain in shape .
Paula Hartman - Stein , a geropsychologist at the Center for Healthy Aging , recommends The Better Brain Book , by David Perlmutter and Carol Colman , and The Memory Bible by Gary Small .
One purpose of mental exercises is to reinforce the idea that " in aging , not everything is downhill , " said Elkhonon Goldberg , a Manhattan neuropsychologist and author of The Wisdom Paradox , which examines how some people grow wiser with age .
" There are gains that are subsequent and consequent to a lifelong history of mental activity and mental striving , " Goldberg said .
He also believes brain exercises can benefit adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment , and he has developed computer puzzles designed to help them stimulate different areas of their brain .
It 's not clear how much targeted brain exercises can prevent the onset of cognitive disorders in older adults .
But some findings indicate that high cognitive ability is tied to a lower risk of Alzheimer's .
One of the most extensive and widely cited investigations on the subject , the landmark Nun Study , tracked 100 Milwaukee nuns who had written autobiographies in the 1930s .
More than 50 years later , scientists gave them cognitive tests and examined the brain tissue of nuns who died .
Those who demonstrated lower linguistic ability in the autobiographies were at greater risk for Alzheimer 's disease .
A similar study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association surveyed 801 older Catholic nuns , priests and brothers .
The results linked reading newspapers and participating in other brain - stimulating activities with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's .
A 2000 National Research Council report commissioned by the National Institute on Aging found some brain exercises were worthy of government funding .
But skeptics question whether beginning an active regimen of brain teasers late in life will do much to prevent brain disorders .
Research to date provides scant evidence that mental exercise can stave off dementia , wrote Margaret Gatz , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California , in an article published by the Public Library of Science .
Gatz wrote in an e-mail that she would be more convinced if researchers randomly assigned cognitive training , then followed study subjects over several decades .
She also said she was concerned that too much emphasis on the benefits of mental fitness could stigmatize Alzheimer 's patients .
" If mental exercise is widely believed to prevent ( Alzheimer 's disease ) , then individuals who do become demented may be blamed for their disease on the grounds of not having exercised their brains enough , " she said .
Still , supporters of cognitive - fitness programs are pushing for greater recognition from the federal government .
During December information - gathering sessions leading up to the White House Conference on Aging , conference representatives said several speakers have made a case that brain health ought to be promoted in much the same way that physical fitness is today .
Few people see much downside in pursuing brain - stimulating activities , said Nancy Ceridwyn , special - projects director at the American Society on Aging .
Puzzles , spelling practice , memory exercises or book discussions do n't pose much harm .
That said , Ceridwyn is n't convinced that all the brain exercises being offered today are practical .
She wonders whether workbooks that ask adults to do pages of math problems to get their brains in gear might be unnecessarily torturing people in their twilight years .
" How many people are going to get up and say , ' I 'm excited about doing my multiplication tables today ' ? " she said .
" Not many . "
According to the New York Times , by way of Raw Story , the immigration bill currently wending its way through Congress “ would require employers to re-verify the identity of every single person currently employed in the United States .
Not only would it place a considerable burden on both government and business , but the verification system currently being tested has shown a significant rate of error . ”
Of course , the New York Times does not bother to suggest a solution for this supposed problem .
Congress critter David Bonner , however , has proposed that the Social Security Administration require SS cards “ contain an electronic signature strip that contains an encrypted electronic identification strip , unique to that individual , ” according to Bonner ’s web page .
Neither Bonner ’s scheme or the one included in the “ immigration proposal with traction in Congress ” specifies “ what the biometric would be , but it could range from a simple digital photo to a fingerprint or even an iris scan , ” notes Wired News .
As to be expected , the American Civil Liberties Union is clueless .
“ Do we really think the migrant workers are going to show up at the pickle farm and the farmer is going to demand ID and have a laptop in the field to check their ID ? ” said ACLU legislative counsel Tim Sparapani .
It has nothing to do with pickle farmers or illegals streaming across the border in search of jobs that pay such dismal wages precious few Americans will take them .
Rather , it has to do with eventually making sure every American — indeed , every person on the planet — has his or her papers in order .
Of course , papers are so yesterday , so the idea is to capture biometric data on every person , beginning with workers .
It will begin with an SS card and eventually a subdermal microchip , as cards are easily lost or stolen .
It appears the effort to attach a biometric SS ID card to current “ immigration reform ” ( i.e. , across the board amnesty for illegal immigrants ) is a way to cut off Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy at the pass , as Leahy plans to introduce a bill to repeal the Real ID Act .
“ Under the Act , states and federal government … would share access to a vast national database that could include images of birth certificates , marriage licenses , divorce papers , court - ordered separations and medical records for more than 240 million Americans with no requirements or controls on how this information might be used , ” writes James Parks on the AFL - CIO Now Blog .
“ The database also could contain detailed information on the name , date of birth , race , religion , ethnicity , gender , address , telephone , e-mail address and Social Security numbers for every American . ”
Mr. Parks neglected to mention such cards would likely also contain biometric information such as retinal scans , fingerprints , DNA data and RFID tracking technology .
As Orwellian as retinal scans , fingerprints , DNA data , and RFID tracking technology sounds , it is simply a matter of selling the scheme to the docile , fear - conditioned masses .
Get them used to swiping a biometric card in order to get a job or a driverâ€™s license and it will only be a matter of time before they will be convinced an identity theft proof biochip for the same purpose is the next logical step .
“ Over half of the population now supports some form of national identification , ” writes Charlotte Twight for the Cato Institute .
“ If Americans accept a National ID system as they accepted SSNs , and if the intrusiveness of such a system expands as did government - mandated SSN usage , ten years from now the idea of a national microchip system may not seem as alien and repugnant as it does today .
As with SSNs , people will get used to it . ”
And for those unable to get used to it , there is the prospect of starvation , as no doubt a “ smart ” microchip will eventually be used for financial transactions — or more to the point , if you refuse to be scanned , you will not be allowed to buy food in the Brave New World envisioned by our neoliberal corporate rulers .
The web analytics space is not an easy one to navigate as there are numerous companies and product types which will fit your needs differently .
In order to help find the way through it all , I ’ll map out the options as they currently stand .
Please let me know if I ’m missing an application you think should be listed .
I ’ll check it out and add it .
The Freebies
There are numerous free solutions out there , and they range from very useful to “ you paid for what you got ” .
As you might expect , the free solutions lack a lot of the power of the paid ones , and they usually do n’t offer much support .
If you do n’t have any money to spend on analytics or you ’re new to it and want to get some experience before paying for a solution , then going with a free package is a great way to go .
Analog –
One of the oldest web analytic packages available .
Analog is free , and runs off of your log files .
It can require quite a bit of customization , and is pretty cut and dry for what it offers .
I used Analog for years , but find it just is too old school and a pain to work with to really be a great option these days .
AWStats – An improvement on Analog , but still a logfile - based solution .
There are a few nice things about logfile packages , such as the fact that they work with users who have javascript or cookies disabled .
However , the storing of logfiles can take up a lot of disk space , requires that you manage the files , and the analytics package takes usually can take time to analyze large files .
AWStats is an improvement on some other options , it provides some graphs , and it ’s nice that it also can do streaming and email statistics from their log files .
Google Analytics –
The new kid on the block that made the biggest splash in 2005 .
Google Analytics was formerly Urchin until they were purchased by Google .
Urchin was formerly not free , but months after acquiring them Google opened it up to the world .
Presumably to help drive people to use Adwords since it ties in with Analytics so well .
Google Analytics is the most powerful free application .
It provides a wealth of statistics , a usable interface , and a lot of ecommerce statistics which are not common in free applications .
It ’s tie in with Adwords is handy if you do a lot of advertising there .
It also uses a javascript tag to report the data so you ’re not dealing with hosting your own logfiles .
The downside is that the data is often 12 hours behind , so it ’s not useful for looking at up to the minute stats .
SiteMeter – A previously popular solution for bloggers and small websites , Sitemeter has a free version that just requires you put their colorful logo at the bottom of your site .
If you leave your data open , others can click to see your stats .
This has some cool social aspects to it , and for those selling advertising it can be helpful .
Overall , the application seems pretty old at this point , and does n’t provide a wealth of data in the free version .
However , it is simpler than Google Analytics , and you do n’t have to mess with logfiles .
Webalizer – Similar to AWStats and Analog , Webalizer is a logfile analysis solution that is free .
It has some customizable charts and provides all the basics , but like the others I do n’t feel that it really measures up to the ease of use of Google Analytics or Sitemeter .
Blog Specific or the Cool Guys
The rise of blogs has lead to many application developers in all industries to start making blog - specific applications .
Analytics is no exception and in the last year we ’ve seen a few solid entries in the blog analytics space .
Blogs tend to be simpler than some regular websites , and they do n’t usually need ecommerce statistics .
These applications focus on blogs , so if you ’ve got a standard blog , you may want to look here .
Blogbeat – Blogbeat is a newish application aimed at the blogging market .
It ’s been a bit overshadowed by all the buzz about MeasureMap , especially with MeasureMap being purchased by Google .
While it ’s not quite as pretty as MeasureMap , it feels just about as simple and perhaps a little bit more useful .
I would n’t hesitate recommending people use Blogbeat .
Like MeasureMap , it focuses on stats for your blog posts , referrals , links out , and searches .
It has a free 30 day free trial , and it ’s not too spendy after that .
Installation was a breeze , so give it a try .
Mint – Perhaps the first analytics application aimed at blogs , Mint is a one man show run by Shaun Inman .
Do n’t let the low employee count fool you , Mint is a nice application .
It has a cost of $ 30 per site , but that ’s not too spendy if you care about your stats .
The interface is very AJAXy and cool , and you host the data on your own instead of giving it over to a third party like with most analytics applications .
It also has an API so developers can build on it , very cool .
One problem though , is you need to be able to host it on a server running Apache , PHP , and mySQL .
A great application though from a one - man army .
MeasureMap –
The darling of the blog analytics space with it ’s recent Google acquisition before it ’s even out of it ’s private beta .
MeasureMap was developed by a four - person team from information architecture / visual design powerhouse Adaptive Path .
It ’s definitely pretty and smooth , and it ’s very blog - focused with post stats , referrals , links out , and comment stats .
I ’ve been playing with it for a few weeks and enjoy it , but sometimes miss some of the details of other applications .
It ’s still early on , so MeasureMap will most likely add more features depending on what Google does with it , which I think is integrate it with it ’s Blogger platform .
Installation was easy as it asks your blogging platform and gives you specific instructions based on that platform .
They also have an “ Events ” feature coming out soon , as well as a developers API .
Currently it ’s free if you can manage to get an invite .
Low Cost Solutions
If you ’ve got a serious small business web site , but do n’t want to go the free route with something like Google Analytics , you might consider one of these low cost solutions .
They are on par or better than Google Analytics , and your data is safe from Google , and because you pay you get support and near real time data .
Hitbox Professional – The lighter version of analytics application HBX ( profiled below ) , Hitbox is an affordable solution at around $ 26.95 a month depending on volume , and it gets you most of the basic to intermediate stats a user would want , from an analytics leader in public company WebsideStory .
Hitslink – A stats app that ’s been around a while from Net Applications .
Hitslink is a solid mix of a typical web analytics application with simplicity and some more advanced stats like ecommerce and setting conversion goals .
It ’s not flashy , but it gets the job done at an economical price .
A 30 - day trial is available and installation was very easy for me .
Visitorville –
This is one of the most unique analytics solutions available .
It ’s best described as web analytics meets the Sims .
It has a 3D and 2D world where your analytics are mapped to an interface like you ’re in a Sims - like video game .
For very visual people this is a really fun way to check out your stats , and it has some great realtime features where when a visitor arrives to your site they arrive to the building ( page ) in a bus ( the referrer ) .
So , you see someone arrive to a building via a Google bus if it ’s a Google search referral .
It also has ecommerce stats and page overlay features , making it a pretty darn complete application .
The price is pretty cheap , so if you think you ’d be into a very visual view of your stats , give it a shot .
The Big Guns
If you ’ve got a serious web business , you need serious data .
When you ’re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month from your web presence you ’re losing money by NOT using one of these applications to know exactly how your users are behaving on your site .
These applications can really be used to test and improve your site , but you ’ll have to pay for their superior features and support .
Clicktracks –
The originator of the “ page overlay ” analytics technique , Clicktracks has always had a different user interface and style delivering analytics data to it ’s user .
For some people their interface style is a huge favorite , for others such as myself I just could n’t get into it that much .
I can see how some would love it , but perhaps my years of standard analytics interfaces lead me to want something else .
I do like how they offer both a hosted ASP solution and a software solution if you want to keep the data on your own server (s ) .
Pricing is spendier then the low - cost solutions , but it ’s also cheaper than the most of the other big gun analytics providers .
E -commerce data is a big part of the mix if you want it to be , so I think Clicktracks fits well as a user - friendly small business ecommerce solution .
Coremetrics – A long time player who I ’ve never had the chance to use .
I demo’d it years ago , so I ca n’t really say much as I ’m sure they ’ve iterated quite a bit since then .
They have a lot of big clients , and their feature list looks very powerful .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and is usually negotiable but comes from a baseline of usage .
Fireclick – Another full - powered application I have n’t had the chance to use .
Like Coremetrics they have an impressive client list and have a nice looking feature set .
The Fireclick Index is a report that features a dozen key performance indicators to track your key metrics all from one report .
They also feature an Excel plugin and a site overlay tool to see your data while viewing your site .
Pricing is not listed and most likely negotiable .
HBX – A superpower web analytics application from public company WebsideStory .
One of the leaders in all kinds of types of analytics reporting .
HBX was one of the first to implement setting up custom funnels to track conversion on goals , they ’ve had a site overlay for a long time , have a great plugin with Excel called ReportBuilder , introduced user segmentation early on , integration with PPC advertising , and have been using AJAX and other “ web 2.0 ” technologies before the term even existed .
They have an impressive client list , and I ’ve also had the pleasure of attending their user forum where they did a great job educating and also talking to their customers to get help on where to take their product .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and is negotiable .
Omniture – A web analytics company based out of Utah that ’s been on fire over the past couple of years signing big clients like eBay , Microsoft , and AOL .
I have n’t used Omniture , but have heard very good things about their SiteCatalyst solution for it ’s power in user segmentation and ecommerce statistics .
They also have a Data Warehousing feature that allows real time reporting combined with the flexibility of having good access to old data .
Pricing is n’t cheap , and once again is negotiated with a salesperson .
Visual Sciences – A web analytics company that ’s been in “ stealth ” mode for a long time , they ’ve long been talked about as having a disruptive technology compared to their competitors .
They were just purchased by WebSideStory which should make for a very interesting application in the future as they make HBX and Visual Sciences merge or work together somehow .
Webtrends –
The granddaddy of serious web applications , Webtrends has been around forever and been sold a few times along the way .
Their now on their 7th version of their application , and they boast a big client list .
Some new features include a conversion view from five points , bookmarking and sharing of analytics , a unique first - party cookie solution , and more .
Unlike some of the other power applications , they do offer a free trial , but pricing is n’t cheap .
RSS Analytics Solutions
Most of the web applications are n’t tracking RSS feeds ( yet ) .
A couple of quality RSS companies that provide a number of services also provide RSS analytics .
Feedburner – Feedburner reports on a few basic feed stats for free like your total feed circulation , and for just a few dollars a month you can update to the Pro stats package to get more stats like what RSS items were viewed , how much , and what ones got clicks to your site .
You can also see what feed readers people are using .
Pheedo – Pheedo ’s stats are more aimed at RSS advertising , but you can get stats on your feed circulation and how much revenue you ’re generating from your ads .
Conclusion
There ’s so much to be gained from analytics .
Start out by trying a few of these applications that fit your site and see what you can learn .
You might be surprised .

“ A Letter Written to One Person , for the Benefit of All ”
Dear Guy in my Political Science Class ,
. : I understand you ’re a conservative ; you made that perfectly clear on the first day of class .
Your blog even boasts proudly of this fact in its title , Too Conservative .
I understand that you have disagreements with our professor .
I also understand how odd it feels to come to a predominantly conservative and Baptist campus only to find out your political science professor is a liberal Jewish woman .
. : I used to enjoy your little interruptions .
I thought they were quaint .
They provided me a glimpse into the past of how men of previous generations viewed the way society ought to be , and I ’ve enjoyed that , at least on an anthropological level .
You ’ve even corrected the professor on some non-trivial points , and that ’s always appreciated .
You ’re certainly more enjoyable than that other guy .
You know the one I ’m talking about : the anarcho - capitalist whose muddled thoughts match perfectly his muffled speech .
. : But the more I think about it , the more I ’m convinced you ’ve become a parody .
It ’s an interesting phenomenon among conservatives , so do n’t feel too embarrassed if my conclusion is incorrect and you do indeed believe the things you say .
I ’m claiming that you ’re a clever parody because , on balance , it ’s the most charitable thing I can do .
I also think you ’re hilarious , in a Stephen Colbert kind of way .
. : I found it funny — and the rest of the class did as well — when you said Ann Coulter was a scholar .
And the reason your statement was funny is that implicit in your description of Miss Coulter lies a hilarious denigration of the most literate group of people in our society .
But I ’m sure you ’re well aware of that ; you made the joke , after all .
When asked by our professor what the peer - reviewed scholarly literature ’s consensus was on Miss Coulter ’s book , Treason , you jokingly referred to George W. Bush ’s enthusiastic endorsement .
Again — highly amusing .
When she asked if anyone had seen Good Night , and Good Luck , you mimicked perfectly the stereotypical conservative response : “ You mean that agenda - pushing movie by Hollywood liberal George Clooney ? ”
. : I do n’t know why or when you decided to become a parody — I could have sworn you were sincere in your beliefs at the beginning of the semester .
Now that I think about it , your earlier statements were even more brilliant than the ones you made today .
“ What if the little brat was lying ? ” I remember you say during the discussion on child testimony .
Your character ’s invariable distrust of all things that were n’t adult , white , straight , or male worked towards a subtle sort of charm .
I fell for it , too .
You made me believe that other people could seriously think that way .
. : But maybe you really are a conservative ; maybe you ’re just annoyed by the soft - thinking , jingoistic philosophy that modern conservatism has become , and you ’re trying to change that with humor .
It is possible to be an intelligent conservative and to criticize the lazy thinkers within your ranks .
Even Jon Stewart makes fun of democrats sometimes .
. : But now that you ’ve made it obvious that you ’re just a parody , I think the magic is gone .
You were more effective when your comments were merely ill - informed and only subtly unreasoned .
Making outrageous statements like “ If you ’re friends with a commie , then you ’re a commie ” will blow your cover , and people wo n’t fall for it anymore .
Yours Truly ,
That Other Guy in Class

Scandal Cheat Sheet Apr 2 , 2007 The Purgegate Primer
Here ’s the problem with modern political scandals :
Many of the journalists and media outlets follow the case for months — while it ’s still under the radar of the American public .
Then , when the scandal attracts a great deal of attention , the articles presuppose an audience as versed in the minutiae of the case as its authors .
Readers interested in the big picture are left to piece together the backstory themselves .
This has been especially true of “ Purgegate , ” the controversy surrounding the dismissal of eight U.S. Attorneys .
The coverage has been so devoted to the Bush administration ’s bungled response to the allegations that many are left to wonder what the original allegations were .
Further obfuscating matters is the fact that , as of yet , none of the key players are asserting that any specific crime was committed ( though some of the White House ’s critics think there may be some “ obstruction of justice ” charges at the end of this particular rainbow ) .
And yet this incident , dismissed by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as “ an overblown personnel matter , ” is threatening to become one of the biggest blows to the Bush administration yet .
And I ’ll bet you a beer that Gonzales resigns by Walpurgisnacht .
When that happens , I suspect a lot of people are going to say , “ What the hell was that all about ? ”
And so , a primer .
Note :
This is not meant to be an encyclopedic reference on the debacle ; instead , I intend to give you just enough context to understand the additional revelations ( and resignations ) that will undoubtedly follow .
Some Key Facts
The United States Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the United States , and head of the Department of Justice .
The president nominates the Attorney General , but he or she must be confirmed by the Senate .
The current Attorney General is Alberto Gonzales .
The US Attorneys are the attorneys that represent the Federal Government at the judicial district level .
The president nominates the U.S. Attorneys , but each must be confirmed by the Senate ; the president is free to fire any U.S. Attorney at any time for any reason .
There are 93 U.S. Attorneys .
Title 28 , section 546 of the United States Code is the statute governing the appointment of interim U.S. Attorneys in the case of a vacancy ( due to a firing , resignation , death , etc. ) .
Interim U.S. Attorneys are not subject to Senate confirmation .
Until recently , this statute stipulated that interim U.S. Attorneys could serve a maximum of 120 days .
Now they can serve indefinitely .
Background
On March 9 , 2006 , Title 28 , section 546 of the United States Code was modified .
It happened when the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 was signed into law by President Bush .
Unbeknownst to just about everyone , a provision had been tucked into the bill abolishing the 120 - day limit on interim U.S. Attorneys , thereby allowing them to serve indefinitely , without ever having to receive Senate confirmation .
The provision was inserted into the bill by the office of Senator Arlen Specter .
Specter was offended when some reporters described the controversial provision as having been “ slipped in ” ( “ I do not slip things in , ” he said ) , but later admitted that even he did not know about the revision until long after the bill had become a law .
Apparently a counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee , Brett Tolman , had put the verbiage into the bill at the behest of the Justice Department .
It is unknown how many Senators knew of the provision when they voted on the bill , but , given that Specter himself was unaware of it , the number could be as low as zero .
In December 2006 , eight U.S. Attorneys were fired , and interim U.S. Attorneys appointed in their places .
“ Performance - Related ”
Many scandals hinge on a single phrase ( “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman , ” “ significant quantities of uranium from Africa , ” etc. ) .
Much of the Purgegate brouhaha , however , can be attributed to two words : “ performance - related . ”
By January of this year , some Democratic Senators were looking askance at the U.S. Attorney firings .
They noted , for instance , that one of the fired attorneys , Carol Lam , was responsible for putting Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham behind bars .
Seeking answers , they summoned Deputy Attorney General Paul J. McNulty to Capitol Hill on February 7 , and asked him why the eight had been dismissed .
McNulty ’s response is pretty much universally recognized , on all sides of this debate , as a colossal blunder .
Or , specifically , his blunder was to respond at all .
Presidents can remove U.S. Attorneys by fiat , and are not obligated to account for their decisions .
If McNulty had simply said that , and if everyone else in the Administration had stuck to the script , it is unlikely that this story ever would have gotten legs .
It probably would have made headlines , then quickly been relegated to the inside pages , and eventually dropped .
Instead , McNulty said that the U.S. Attorneys had been fired for “ performance - related ” reasons — thereby giving the story both legs and roller skates .
The problem was twofold .
First , it was easy as pie to dig up the records of the fired U.S. Attorneys ; lo and behold , six of them had recently received positive evaluations .
This gave the appearance that the Deputy Attorney General was lying , had something to hide , or both .
The second unintended side effect of McNulty ’s statement was worse :
The dismissed U.S. Attorneys got pissed .
Bear in mind that all were Republicans and loyal servants of the Justice Department .
While presumably unhappy about getting the heave - ho , they acknowledged that they served “ at the pleasure of the president , ” and stepped aside without complaint .
Now , suddenly and despite their compliance , they found themselves publicly bad - mouthed .
Most felt they had to defend themselves — after all , nothing complicates a job search like having your former employer go on CSPAN and announce you ’d been sacked for “ performance - related ” reasons .
And so , one by one , the fired U.S. Attorneys came forward to tell their sides of the story .
February 8 : “ US Attorney Rebuts Claim Performance Led to Firing ” ; February 9 : “ Fired Prosecutor Disputes Justice Dept. Allegation ” ; and so on .
The Plot Thickens
On February 23 , hoping to quell the growing discord , Gonzales ’s assistant , Richard A. Hertling , sent a letter to Congress .
“ The Department of Justice rejects any suggestion that U.S. Attorneys were asked or encouraged to resign for the inappropriate ‘ political reason ’ of interfering with any public corruption case , ” he said .
He further stated that , to the best of the Justice Department ’s knowledge , no one “ lobbied for ” any of the firings , and specifically named Karl Rove as someone who played no role in the decisions .
On March 1 , the McLatchy Washington Bureau carried an article alleging that , prior to his firing , U.S. Attorney David Iglesias had been contacted by two Republican Congressmen regarding a pending corruption case against Democrats ; according to Iglesias , he felt pressured to issue indictments before the November election .
Both Congressmen later admitted to making the calls , but denied exerting pressure .
On March 6 , speaking before Congress , Iglesias reiterated his claims .
Another fired U.S. Attorney , John McKay , said that he was also contacted by Republicans regarding ongoing investigations .
In the days the followed , it was revealed that these complaints were relayed by Karl Rove , contradicting the Justice Department ’s early claim that he had played “ no role . ”
At this point , the White House went into full damage - control mode .
March 12 : Kyle Sampson , Gonzales ’s chief of staff , abruptly resigned , saying he had failed to fully inform the Justice Department of the White House ’s role in the firing .
: Kyle Sampson , Gonzales ’s chief of staff , abruptly resigned , saying he had failed to fully inform the Justice Department of the White House ’s role in the firing .
March 13 : The White House released a bunch of emails documenting the extent to which it had participated in planning the firings .
Later that day Gonzales held a press conference , in which he first took responsibility for the firings , and then said that he had no knowledge of how they came about ( “ I was not involved in any discussions about what was going on . ” )

Later that day Gonzales held a press conference , in which he first took responsibility for the firings , and then said that he had no knowledge of how they came about ( “ I was not involved in any discussions about what was going on . ” )
March 14 : President Bush spoke publicly about the burgeoning scandal .
“ Mistakes were made , ” he said , echoing a phrase Gonzales used the day before .
“ And I ’m , frankly , not happy about it , because there is a lot of confusion over what really has been a customary practice by the presidents . ”
Gonzales the Pariah
At this point you may be asking : “ What ’s going on here ?
If the president is free to fire any U.S. Attorney for any reason , why is this such a big story ?
And why was Bush admitting that mistakes were made ? ”
Ah , but reread what Bush said — specifically , what he is unhappy about : the publicity rather than the practice ( which he characterized as “ customary ” ) .
The fact that this became a “ big story ” is the mistake , made by the Attorney General .
Gonzales is in a bad position here .
Either he was involved in the firing , in which case , according to his critics , he put politics ahead of law enforcement ( i.e. , his job ) , or he was n’t involved in the firings , in which case :
Who the hell is running the Department of Justice , anyhow ?
Gonzales apparently concluded that , all things considered , option two was the lesser evil , and so claimed to have not been a party to the planning discussions .
Wrong answer .
On March 19 , the Justice Department released 3,000 more pages of emails relating to the Purgegate scandal , and on March 23 they released even more .
One of the documents describes a November 23 , 2006 , meeting in which Gonzales and his top aides explicitly coordinated the firings .
On March 28 , The National Review ( “ America ’s most widely read and influential magazine and website for Republican / conservative news , commentary , and opinion ” ) published an editorial concerning Gonzales entitled “ Time to Go . ”
On March 29 , Kyle Sampson , Gonzales ’ former chief of staff , testified before Congress .
When asked about Gonzales ’s prior statements , Sampson said : “ I do n’t think the attorney general ’s statement that he was not involved in any discussions of U.S. attorney removals was accurate . ”
Gonzales is scheduled to testify before the Senate on April 17 .
Ask not for whom the bell tolls , Alberto .
It tolls for thee .
Performance or Politics ?
So were the eight U.S. Attorneys fired because of performance or politics ?
That ’s the question Democrats want people asking , having insinuated that the former is a legitimate reason , while the latter is “ improper . ”
Ultimately , though , it is a false distinction .
U.S. Attorneys are political appointees , and the idea that any aspect of their service ( hiring , duties , firing ) would remain untainted by politics is naive .
Furthermore — and this is the case Sampson made during his testimony — one possible “ performance - related ” reason why a U.S. Attorney might be fired is if he or she , in the opinion of the president , is insufficiently supporting the White House ’s policies and priorities .
The real question is : Were some of these U.S. Attorneys ( e.g. , Carol Lam ) removed because they were pursuing corruption charges against Republicans , or viewed as too soft on Democrats ?
If that were the case , you could then argue that these firings constitute obstruction of justice .
But , as with all allegations requiring proof of intent , this charge will be very difficult to substantiate .
While there is some fairly damning evidence to support that hypothesis , as of yet no smoking gun has been found .
Until Democrats find one — or give up trying — expect the scandal to continue .
FAQ
I recently asked my readers to send me specific questions they had about the scandal .
Here are my answers .
How is this different from Clinton firing 93 U.S. Attorneys at the start of his term ?
One thing that defenders of the Bush administration like to point out is that Bush only fired eight U.S. Attorneys , while Clinton fired 93 .
The implication is :
If firing eight is bad , firing 93 must be an order of magnitude worse .
However , two factors set the firings apart .
First , they happened mid-term .
All recent Presidents ( i.e. , not just Clinton ) have typically replaced all U.S. Attorneys ( i.e. , 93 ) at the start their first term , just as they appoint a new Secretary of State , Secretary of Defense , etc .
( More details can be found in this article . )
This was unusual in that it happened more than two years into Bush ’s second term .
Second , the U.S. Attorneys fired by Bush in Purgegate were people he himself had appointed .
Clinton fired all 93 U.S. Attorneys to get rid of George H.W. Bush ’s appointees , just as G.W. Bush got rid of everyone Clinton appointed within a few months of taking office .
There ’s nothing inherently improper about a President removing his own appointees , but it ’s certainly not customary .
What ’s up with the woman who pled the fifth ?
Does that prove that something illegal took place ?
On March 26 , Monica Goodling , one of Gonzales ’s senior counselors , refused to testify before the Senate , instead invoking her Fifth Amendment right .
According to a letter sent by her lawyer , she is not doing so because she has committed any crime , but because she fears she may be prosecuted for telling the truth , if someone else contradicts her testimony , or the Senate just flat - out does n’t believe her .
Call it the “ Libby Gambit . ”
It ’s anyone ’s guess as to whether this claim of protection would survive the scrutiny of the courts , but my hunch is she ’ll be offered immunity before we find out .
What ’s the deal with all the White House system emails ?
It has recently come out that many people in the White House have been using Republican National Committee email accounts to discuss matters such as this , presumably because Congress cannot subpoena such correspondence , as it can White House email .
But as one legal blogger points out , this might blow up in their faces , as such emails might therefore be exempt from claims of executive privilege .
For scandal connoisseurs like me , this perfectly illustrates why Purgegate has been such a treat :
Nearly everything the principal players have done to mitigate the damage has somehow made things worse .
For example , Gonzales uses the phrase “ mistakes were made ” to avoid having to specify what the mistakes were and who made them , but in doing so links this case and Watergate in the minds of those familiar with the phrase .
It ’s like every time they put their hands behind their backs to cover their asses , they get punched in the gut .
Bush says this is a “ partisan fishing expedition . ”
Is it ?
Well , yes — albeit one that seems to be landing a fair amount of grouper .
Though I doubt little beyond Gonzales ’s resignation will come of this , Democrats will probably try and use this scandal as a springboard for a number of other investigations into allegations that the Bush Administration systematically abused its power for political gain .
In fact , they are currently working overtime to connect this scandal to the budding GSA PowerPoint Controversy .
How much is Bush within his rights to assert executive privilege ?
If Congress opts to subpoena Karl Rove or former White House Counsel Harriet Miers ( who helped coordinate the dismissals ) , Bush will almost certainly invoke executive privilege , thereby putting the executive and legislative branches of government on a collision course .
Trying to figure out what happens afterwards is like arguing over whether Batman or Wolverine would win in a fight .
Going into the legal intricacies would double the length of this article , but MSNBC has an exhaustive Q&A here , and NPR explored the issue in this report .
The question of executive privilege may indeed prove to be the most contentious , interesting , and consequential element of the entire scandal .
Were Republicans as farcical in their hectoring of Clinton as the Democrats are now ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Joycelyn Elders .

Facebook NEW YORK 
Nobody likes to talk about it , but everybody knows it 's here : tax season .
And a big question many taxpayers face is whether to file by paper or electronically .
Some taxpayers fear that if they file electronically , they will face the ultimate horror : an audit .
But tax experts say that electronic filing actually can decrease the number of errors you may make .
" I have n't seen numbers to back up the IRS 's contention that there are fewer errors when you e-file , " says Scott Estill , a former IRS senior trial attorney and author of Tax This !
An Insider 's Guide to Standing Up to the IRS .
" But it 's intuitive that e-filing would mean fewer errors . "
And as for being audited , he says , they can only audit from 1 to 1.5 % of all returns , which means " you have a 99 % [ chance ] of not being audited . "
Mr. Estill hit on the crux of arguments for and against e-filing :
On the one hand , the IRS contends that tax returns sent electronically are 20 % more accurate than paper returns .
Errors on paper returns can be due to inaccurate Social Security numbers , failure to sign the return , and , even by the IRS 's own admission , mistakes by agents transferring handwritten information into its data systems .
" We use electronic scanning and bar codes to turn handwritten forms into electronic format , " says Nancy Mathis , spokeswoman for the IRS .
" Filing by hand can trigger a desk audit – a verification audit for discrepancies if you do n't write legibly or if the numbers do n't add up . "
On the other hand , some tax preparers wonder if e-filing is the quickest route to an audit .
Paper returns may sit on an IRS shelf longer .
" I 'm asking taxpayers to be prudent , " says John Giacchetti , CPA and principal of his own tax - preparing firm in New York .
" Do n't sacrifice your own interests by doing what 's on the Bureau 's agenda , in this case , speeding your form through their systems . "
Others are equally suspicious .
" E - filing would increase your exposure to an audit because it 's analyzed instantly for a discrepancy , whereas for manually written returns , less than half are put into this algorithm the IRS has for red flags , " says Jonathan Park , who blogs at mymoneyblog.com .
" You think every handwritten form is looked at ?
To cut corners , the IRS can't look at them all .
But it costs nothing to look at something that 's already in the computer . "
Another argument in favor of filing through the mail goes like this :
The more money the IRS saves from people e-filing – or the fewer clerks dealing with paper forms – the more money the agency has to hire new auditors .
But then again , additional auditors would help close the tax gap – the estimated $ 345 billion in uncollected taxes that keeps eluding the IRS due to big - time cheating and tax evasion , says William Henry Jones , senior tax manager at Marks Paneth and Shron , LLP , in New York .
Last year , 73.3 million of the 135.7 million tax returns processed were e-filed .
You can also file for an extension electronically .
" TV loves to show people scrambling at the post office , running to get their forms sent before the tax deadline at midnight , " Mr. Jones says .
" Unless they 're looking for a date or their 15 minutes of fame , I can't understand why they'd be there when you could be e-filing on your couch in your underwear . "
The combination of adding direct deposit makes e-filing even better , he says .
" You 'll get your federal refund in a week and a half or less , and your state refund in two weeks or less . "
A new wrinkle in the direct - deposit program this year lets taxpayers specify up to three accounts that their refunds can be sent to – like checking , savings , and retirement accounts .
" This is great , " Jones says .
" It means one less thing to think about – and you can even make a painless IRA contribution this way . "
Another great addition is Free File .
Found on the IRS website ( www.irs.gov), this free software is designed to help lower - income people feel comfortable filing their own taxes without hiring a professional tax preparer .
This public / private partnership was developed by 24 providers , including the big three : H&R Block 's TaxCut , Intuit 's TurboTax , and 2nd Story Software 's TaxACT .
The service , launched in 2003 , is open to most taxpayers making $ 52,000 or less .
" This offers 70 % of the nation 's taxpayers – 95 million people – a way to e-file , " says Ms. Mathis at the IRS .
This year , participating companies agreed to remove offers from their tax software that , for a fee , would advance taxpayers the amount they anticipate in a refund .
" We wanted to be able to say , ' Free is truly free , ' " says Bert DuMars , director of electronic tax administration for the IRS , in a telephone press conference .
For some people , the ads for the loans " tainted Free File in some way . "
" The income could have been capped at $ 100,000 for Free File , " laments author Estill .
" But it was the lobbying by tax - pro behemoths that prevailed on Congress to put the limit at $ 52,000 , complaining that if Free File took in too many folks , it would cut into their business . "
The largest growth in e-filing is among those who prepared their own returns , says the IRS 's Mathis .
Some 20.3 million such taxpayers used e-file last year , a 19 % increase over 2005 .
The ability to use software and e-file free of charge pleases some taxpayers .
" I do n't think that e-filing would any more or less trigger a red flag , " says Joseph Puma , an IT director for Sandler Capital Management in New York .
Mr. Puma has already filed his 2006 taxes using the online version of TurboTax .
" The software shows if you 've made errors so you can correct them – and it corrects others for you . "
He adds that the TurboTax 's protections guarantee – that calculations are accurate – makes him feel secure enough that he is n't concerned about audits .

Cassini has snapped some stunning shots on its meanderings through the Saturnian system , but this one is a corker , even by its high standards .
The image , courtesy of NASA 's JPL , shows the moons Dione and Tethys facing each other across Saturn 's rings , Dione in the foreground some 860,000 km from Cassini .
Tethys is a further 640,000 km distant .
The picture was taken in natural light using Cassini 's narrow angle camera on 22 September this year .
Dione and Tethys were discovered in 1684 by Giovanni Cassini .
The larger of the two moons , Dione is 1,126 km across and is the densest moon of Saturn after Titan .
It is thought to be mainly water ice around a rocky core .
Its surface is heavily cratered in places , mostly on its trailing hemisphere - the side facing away from its direction of motion , contrary to scientists expectations .
Researchers now think the moon used to spin in the other direction , but was hit by an impactor big enough to change that over .
Tethys is not much smaller , measuring 1,071 km in diameter .
Scientists think it is composed almost entirely of water ice , and that the cracks across its surface were caused by its liquid interior welling up through the frozen crust . ®

Venezuela accuses CNN of linking Chavez to Al - Qaeda
David Edwards
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This
Venezuela said Monday it was filing charges against US cable network CNN for linking President Hugo Chavez to Al - Qaeda , and against a Venezuelan TV network for encouraging Chavez 's assassination .
The move comes one day after popular TV network RCTV went off the air after the Chavez government yanked its broadcast license .
Information Minister William Lara presented at a press conference what he said was CNN footage displaying pictures of Chavez juxtaposed with those of an Al - Qaeda leader .
CNN also aired a story about the Venezuelan protests , but used images taken in Mexico of an unrelated story , Lara said .
" CNN broadcast a lie which linked President Chavez to violence and murder , " Lara said .
CNN issued a statement late Monday in which they " strongly deny " being " engaged in a campaign to discredit or attack Venezuela . "
The news network acknowledged a video mix - up , and " aired a detailed correction and expressed regret for the involuntary error . "
Regarding the Al - Qaeda leader , the networks that " unrelated news stories can be juxtaposed in a given program segment just as a newspaper page or a news web site may have unconnected stories adjacent to each other . "
The Venezuelan government also filed charges against local network Globovision for what they said was indirectly encouraging Chavez 's murder by airing footage of the 1981 assassination attempt on the late pope John Paul II .
" In my view , this television network , in this specific part of its programming , committed the offense of incitement to assassination , against the Venezuelan head of state , " Lara said .
The charges comes amid protests against Chavez 's shutdown of RCTV , a privately - owned broadcaster of popular comedy and drama shows that was boldly critical of Chavez .
After 54 years on the air , RCTV went black at midnight Sunday after the government refused to renew its license .
It was promptly replaced by TVes , a state - backed " socialist " station which began broadcasting cultural shows .
On Monday several people were injured as police in Caracas fired rubber bullets and tear gas to put down a demonstration against the RCTV shutdown .

The National Association of State Boards of Education will elect officers in July , and for one office , president - elect , there is only one candidate : a member of the Kansas school board who supported its efforts against the teaching of evolution .
Scientists who have been active in the nation ’s evolution debate say they want to thwart his candidacy , but it is not clear that they can .
The candidate is Kenneth R. Willard , a Kansas Republican who voted with the conservative majority in 2005 when the school board changed the state ’s science standards to allow inclusion of intelligent design , an ideological cousin of creationism .
Voters later replaced that majority , but Mr. Willard , an insurance executive from Hutchinson , retained his seat .
If he becomes president - elect of the national group , he will take office in January 2009 .
The group , based in Washington , is a nonprofit organization of state school boards whose Web site ( www.nasbe.org) says it “ works to strengthen state leadership in educational policymaking . ”
China has tried to blind US spy satellites : report
STAFF WRITER
China not only has the capability of blinding US spy satellites , but it has tried to do so , a weekly defense publication reported on Friday .
Sources told the US - based Defense News that China had " fired high - powered lasers at US spy satellites flying over its territory , " but were unable to confirm when and how many times such attacks had taken place , or whether they had been successful .
The sources did not explain when the attacks first took place , but said that there had been several attacks over the past few years , Defense News said .
" Lasers of sufficient power could blind electro - optical satellites " such as some of the types used by the US military , the report said .
The report also said that US military officials had not expressed alarm at the attacks , describing them as a " predictable and understandable " part of efforts to counter the US ' space advantage .
Details of the attacks have not been made public because of efforts by the Bush administration to " not anger Beijing , " the newspaper reported .
The US currently has " three large optical reconnaissance satellites of the three - decade [s ] - old Keyhole - series by Lockheed Martin .
The loss of any would hurt US space capabilities , " sources told Defense News .
The weekly quoted sources as saying that the anti-satellite capabilities were evidence of China 's focus on an asymmetric military strategy in the event of a conflict with the US .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
A new aquatic vehicle that can take passengers beneath the surface of the water , revolve 360 degrees and stand upright like a dolphin , may be released as early as next year , according to its developer .
Thomas " Doc " Rowe , creator of the so - called " bionic dolphin , " said he hopes to get the watercraft in resorts in 2007 and thinks the vehicle could have a broad array of applications in the future , including rescuing people in harsh ocean conditions .
" There 's going to be a lot of utility found in this besides having a good time , " he said , adding that the government of Bermuda has expressed interest in using the dolphin , which can travel 300 miles without refueling , as a water taxi .
But it takes more than an appealing idea to get a product to market .
" It 's an interesting concept , but this is n't the first time somebody has come up with a far - out idea , " said Roger Hagie , director of public affairs for personal watercraft maker Kawasaki Motors Corp .
Powered by a 425 - horsepower Corvette engine , the bionic dolphin can cruise the water 's surface at up to 55 mph .
Passengers wear a four - point seat belt similar to those found in race cars .
Constructed of a combination of materials that includes Kevlar -- the material used in bulletproof vests -- the dolphin is built to withstand rough conditions , including 200 mph winds .
Rowe said he hopes that getting the dolphin in resorts next year will lead to opportunities before a wider audience .
But several hurdles so far have kept Rowe 's dream from becoming a reality .
For one , the dolphin needs regulatory approvals before it can be sold .
That 's proven to be a challenge , because it does n't fit any preset categories .
Designers of water vessels file an application with the U.S. Coast Guard before they can sell their products to the public , according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Angela McArdle .
At present , makers have to designate whether their product is an underwater or above - water vehicle , and the bionic dolphin fits neither category very well .
" There 's no in - between option , " McArdle said .
While regulatory approvals pose one hurdle , cost is another .
A custom - built dolphin is n't cheap , selling for around $ 350,000 .
Rowe said that he hopes once the scale of production increases , prices could fall to around $ 120,000 for a two - seater .
But that still far exceeds the average $ 9,500 consumers spent for a personal watercraft in the United States last year , according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association .
Despite the challenges , Rowe , who has been working on the dolphin since 1988 , shows no signs of losing faith in his creation .
He recently took it on a cross-country tour .
" We covered 23 states , and every stop along the way , we were stopped with questions .
That 's very good to hear , " he said .
It ’s no secret that the newspaper business is in serious trouble .
Circulations are plummeting and advertising revenue is in a free - fall .
It ’s widely agreed that the Internet is to blame , so you might think that newspapers would embrace new technology and work to establish strategic partnerships with companies that could help them deliver news in the manner that their readers prefer it .
Instead many in the newspaper business seem to be waging an ongoing battle against all things new media .
They ’re responding in a way that media dinosaurs have traditionally responded to any new threat — with lawsuits and name calling .
A few weeks back I noted that would - be Tribune Co. owner Sam Zell does n’t seem to understand the value of search engines .
He ’s not the only one .
A number of European news services have been fighting Google , Yahoo , and Microsoft over links to European news websites .
Apparently these publications prefer to limit their readership to the small number of individuals who might actually type the paper ’s URL into their web browser .
Since advertising revenue on the Internet is directly related to the number of visitors a website receives , suing Google probably is n’t the best business decision .
Earlier this week Google came to a partial agreement with Belgian publisher Copiepresse .
According to news reports Google has agreed not to cache Copiepresse ’s stories .
Presumably the Copiepresse technical staff will also receive training in the use of no - cache meta tags .
The result of the agreement is that Copiepresse ’s stories wo n’t be featured on the high profile Google News page — although they will show up in search results .
The news agency has indicated that the lawsuit still stands and will not be withdrawn until there is a complete agreement ( translation : we will continue to sue Google until there is no chance that readers will ever find our website by using the most popular search engine on the planet ) .
I do n’t mind the fact that Copiepresse wants to kill its own business so much as I object to the genuine hostility this publisher is demonstrating towards the Internet in general and its readers specifically .
For example , Copiepresse and other publishers have been complaining about the act of deep - linking ( linking to individual stories as opposed to the newspaper ’s home page ) .
Apparently we ’re all supposed to come in through the home page and click around until we find the news we ’re looking for .
That sounds suspiciously like wrestling with the Sunday LA Times while trying to find Part III of the Calendar section .
That ’s just not the way things work on the Internet and it ’s not the way readers want to find their news .
The irony here is that , in the unlikely event that deep - linking would ever be banned , newspapers would have to make serious improvements to their onsite search engines .
Many publishers would likely end up buying Google search appliances , all because they ’re afraid Google might make a buck by linking to the latest news .
If the revolt of newspaper publishers against the Internet is n’t bad enough , now journalists are jumping into the battle .
This weekend columnist David Bullard detonated a small - scale nuclear device in the blogosphere with a column that , among other things , claimed that bloggers “ are the sort of wackos who gun down their fellow students at university ” .
Bullard goes on to fantasize about creating a website called printrevenge.com where he can publish the names and addresses of anonymous bloggers .
Apparently his motto is “ if you ca n’t beat ’em , stalk ’em ” .
Fortunately , the domain name appears to be safely in the hands of sympathetic bloggers and there will be no print revenge this time .
While it ’s likely that Bullard ’s column was intended partially in jest , the underlying vitriol towards new media is consistent with the actions of publishers suing search engines and fighting the battle against deep - linking .
This is an industry in a state of denial over how rapidly and completely their world is changing .
They act as if , some day , the Internet and bloggers will simply go away and we ’ll return to the good old days newsprint and the occasional special afternoon edition .
Those days are over and the Internet is n’t going away .
But someday soon newspapers just might .
Never missing the opportunity to take advantage of a tragedy , Fred Phelps and his gang of haters at Westboro Baptist Church plan to picket the funerals of those killed in the Virginia Tech shootings , according to a message on their website ( which I have n’t linked on purpose ) :
“ WBC will preach at the funerals of the Virginia Tech students killed on campus during a shooting rampage April 16 , 2007 .
You describe this as monumental horror , but you know nothing of horror — yet .
Your bloody tyrant Bush says he is ‘ horrified ’ by it all .
You know nothing of horror — yet .
Your true horror is coming .
‘ They shall also gird themselves with sackloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads ’ ( Eze. 7:18 ) .
Why did this happen , you ask ?
It ’s simple .
Your military chose to shoot at the servants of God today , and all they got for their effort was terror .
Then , the LORD your God sent a crazed madman to shoot at your children .
Was God asleep while this took place ?
Was He on vacation ?
Of course not .
He willed this to happen to punish you for assailing His servants . ”
No doubt they ’ll blame the shootings on the gays as well .
But as many people have noted , the more these nuts trot themselves out , the more a symbol of the need for tolerance they become .

私自身 はDRMが嫌いだ。 DRMがモノポリーの道具でしかないのは明々白々。 権力の一局集中を高めることしかできない道具なんて、なくなった方がいい。
だが、ソフトウェア・ライセンスによって対抗するという方針には、
多少疑問を抱いている。 一体どのぐらい法的効力を持つのか、 私にはまだ確信が持てないからだ。
グーグルが奪う 「 本質を考える力 」 より、
最近，筆者はグーグルなどの検索エンジンの普及が大学教育に大きな影響を及ぼし，大学教育の表層化が始まったと考えている。学生はその時点で注目されている技術やトピックス，最新情報の入手に汲々（きゅうきゅう）としている。しかも，それらの技術情報は検索エンジンを使って得られたものが大半で，本質的な技術情報ではなく，表層化された技術情報である。
Google、及び、その他の検索サービスがその傾向を後押ししたことは間違いないと思う。
しかし、表層化はそれ以前から始まっていたのではないか。
表層化は、手段と目的、と関係する。 コンピュータの歴史は、まずコンピュータを人間にとって使えるものにすることが重要であった。
コンピュータは道具でありながら、同時に目標そのものでもあった。
まだ道具して熟れていなくて、 内部を知ることなく利用することは難しかったからだ。
だが、やがてコンピュータは小型、廉価、手軽な道具となり、
それをブラックボックスとして取り扱うことが許容できる段階に達した。
これこそ、本来道具が行き着くべき果てであり、
道具としてのコンピュータが、手段と目的の逆転から解放されたと言える。
もちろん、専門家が対象をブラックボックス扱いするのはよろしくない。
それが嶋さんのおっしゃりたいことなのだろう。 ただ、私はこれが「 Googleによって引き起こされたこと」とするには違和感を抱かざるを得ない。
技術は一般人にとって手段であり、手段の中身を見る必要性がないのは良いことであり、
人は、よほどの変人を除いて、必要性のないことはやりたくないのが当然ではないか。
だから、表層化は技術の辿る一般的な過程であって、 特に「○○が原因で起こった」とは言えないと思う。
実のところ、似たことはGoogleが誕生する以前から、 とりわけBSDファンから叫ばれていた。
Linuxを中心に起こっ た「 HOWTO 文化」だ。 何も理解せず、ただ書いていることを辿れば、
「 大体」やりたいことがやれる。 おかげで、ちっとも分かってない人ばかりになって、
他人のサーバに迷惑をかけていても気付きもしない、と。
私もHOWTO文化はあまり好きではないが、 残念ながら、その有用性は認めざるを得ない。
時間のない人間にマニュアルをしっかり読みこなせと言っても、
どだい無理な話だろう。 そんな人がやるんじゃないと言われそうだが、
現実問題、一人の人間が全部に精通するのは不可能に近いし、
ある程度分かった上でHOWTOを活用するのは別に悪いことではないと思う。
それに、結局そういう声はもはや聞かれなくなった。
数の趨勢に負けたのだろう。 ソーシャル・ブックマークの類では、
あいもかわらず、煽り記事、オタク・ネタとHOWTOの嵐だし、 深い内容が上位ランキングされることは全く見られない。
閑話休題。 Google絡みだと、 If It 's Not in Google , Does Your Website Really Exist ?
という記事があった。 これを書いている人はちょっとアレな人だが、
この記事は興味深い点を突いている。 ものすごく適当にまとめると、
Googleからのトラフィックは70%を占め、
ウェブの入口となっている。 JavaLobbyではspamが原因でGoogleから外され、 一日一万人以上あったアクセスが失われた。 Googleは競合他社を圧倒しているから、 Googleになければ、サイトが存在しないのと同じではないか。
Googleが悪事を働いているようには見えないが、 Microsoftでさえ、これほどの影響力を持ったことはない。 これはちょっとやばいんじゃないか。
というような話。 私もこの見解に共感してしまう。 正直にいって、この状況は恐ろしい 。
確かに 、Googleは総じて良いことをやっている企業だと思う。
Summer of Codeをはじめとして、 私にとって 、Win-Winの関係にある （私の存在 がGoogleにとっ てWinであるかどうかは多分に疑問だが）。 非常に便利なツールを提供してくれるし、 そのやり方が不公平だとは全く感じない。 しかし、それでもなお、一社がここまで牛耳ってしまうという事実には、 戦慄せざるを得ないのである 。
だが 、Googleがなぜここまで独占的状況に持ち込めたのだろう。
多くの専門家が分析を行っているから、 私のような素人が言及するのは薮蛇かもしれないが、
Googleを支える 「 Early Adopters 」の視点から言うと、 インターフェースの簡潔さに尽きる。
これほど単純なことが、ここまで差を付けると誰が想像しただろうか。
単に他が重すぎるというだけの理由で敬遠されるとは。
それ以外のこと、検索精度、レコード数、検索ワードの推測、
などなどは二の次だと思っている。 私がYahoo!やGooやAltavistaなどを検索に使わなくなったのは、
ごちゃごちゃしすぎで、余計なものが多く、
かつ、それによってインターフェースの反応が悪すぎるからだった。
逆に、インターフェースがGoogle並だったら、 今でも使っていたのではないかと思う。
では、一体どうして競合他社はGoogleのように簡素化しないのか。 全く同じデザインを採用するのは権利関係でまずいのかもしれない。
しかし、単純化するだけで権利に抵触するとは思えないから、
やれない理由が分からない。 こんなに使いにくいインターフェースでいつまでもユーザが付き合ってくれると思うなんて、
ほんと、大丈夫なんだろうか。
ところで、 佐渡さん が
既にオープンソース運動の初期に知り合った欧米のハッカーの連中は、一部の変人(ESRとかPerensとか)と自分で事業を起こしたような人間、あとは
RHとIBMを除いて、そのほとんどがGoogleに入社してしまっている。後藤先生のGoogle入社は、日本でもその流れが決定的になりつつあるなと予感させる出来事である。
と書いておられるが、 正直、佐渡さんも案外ふつーの受け止め方をする人なんだなと思った。
Googleがうなるほどキャッシュを持っていて、 エンジニアを採用しまくっていることはよく知られている。 当然採用される人が出てくるんだが、 採用されたのはニュースになるが、 採用されなかったのはニュースにならないから、 やたらとみんな入社しているイリュージョンが出来上がっている気がする。
確かにオープンソース黎明の連中は結構Googleに移籍してしまったが、
私の知っている、オープンソースなんて造語ができる以前からの、
フリーソフトウェア開発者たちは、あんまりしてない。
日本、それ以外を含めて、 誘われたけど辞退した人や、誘われても行かないと表明している人を何人も知っている。
どうして彼らが行きたくないのか、それを論じても誰のためにもならないので、 割愛する。 しかし、世界が一点に萎んでしまわないのは良いことだ。
I teased this one in my bookaholic post , so I figured I might as well get around to reviewing it .
The book is The Multiplex Man , by James P. Hogan .
I ’m not even sure where I first heard about this one ( a libertarian blog somewhere , probably ) , but I picked it up used from Amazon for a very nice price , so there was n’t a lot of risk in trying it .
The book describes a time in the not - so - distant future .
The Western powers ( US and Europe ) , driven by the environmentalists , have begun to clamp down on capitalism as a waste of resources , while the remnants of the old Soviet Union have embraced unbridled capitalism and are rapidly expanding ( even into space ) .
The governments of the West have built up enormous propaganda about the dangers of those capitalist nations to control their own citizens , and the people fear that capitalism in the East will collapse , leading to an attack by the East on the West .
Thus , they rule their people through fear of an unlikely enemy .
In this world you find Richard Jarrow , a government history teacher who ’s bought the lie — hook , line , and sinker .
But one day something strange happens .
He goes to the doctor , is put to sleep for some routine tests , and then suddenly wakes up 6 months later , 1000 miles away from his home , in a strange hotel room .
And in a different body .
Furthermore , he tries to head back to his home , only to find out that Richard Jarrow died a mere month after his last memory .
Confused and disoriented , particularly by the fact that he has gained incredible fighting ability , he goes on a search to find out exactly what ’s going on .
He soon determines exactly whose body he ’s inhabiting , and starts to see that there are forces of the Eastern capitalist countries who want to use him to further their own ends .
Not to mention that the former fiancee ’ of the body he ’s inhabiting wants the original inhabitant ’s personality back .
As he starts down the eventual road to the climax of the story , you see how various personalities inside him all start to meld together and fall apart , and you watch as his own psyche starts shorting out .
To go any farther would give too much of the plot away , so I ’m not going to do that .
The book itself reminded me of a suspense - thriller much like Robert Ludlum ’s Jason Bourne series .
You have a man who is n’t quite sure who he is or why he ’s capable of doing what he can do , unsure who to trust and how to survive his situation .
It ’s a bit more sci - fi than the Bourne series , though , and again to get into the details would give away too much of the plot .
Last , for the libertarians in the bunch , it ’s certainly got a dystopian vision that is distrustful of state control , sees the government as the enemy , and views unbridled free - market anarchist capitalism as the driving force of prosperity .
As a suspense - thriller novel , it is a bit formulaic at times .
You have the protagonist , trying to figure out exactly what is going on in a world that seems to threaten him from every direction .
You have the supportive female , who distrusts him at first but grows to push him to his destiny .
You ’ve got shadowy government figures all around , and you ’re never sure which of them is working to help the protagonist and which is not .
However , to call it formulaic does n’t make it a bad book .
Hogan throws in twists and turns in places that I had n’t seen coming , and in general it ’s an engaging read .
I ’d say that if you ’re looking for a new author to check out , and you ’re into the suspense - thriller genre , it ’s certainly worth a look .
If you like the Bourne series from Ludlum , and you ’re a libertarian , I think you ’ll like this quite a bit .
This is a decent novel with libertarian themes , but not to the extent that it beats you over the head with it .
As I ’ve said with a few other books , this one wo n’t win any awards , but it ’s definitely a nice book to while a few hours away .
Me either .
The paper , around in one version or another since 1867 , may not have knocked down a lot of Pulitzers , but with its vigorous political reporting and thoughtful cultural coverage , it has served as a center for civic life in Minneapolis and beyond .
The Star Tribune was not a great paper , but then my first car , a very used ’ 64 Ford Falcon , was n’t great either .
I still have a great deal of affection for both .
There are two ways to look at the sale : the second - biggest newspaper operator in the country , with its stock dropping in the wake of the Knight Ridder deal , dumped a paper with near 20 percent profit margins in what looked like a fire sale because big papers are doomed .
Or , more brightly , a private equity firm saw an opportunity for a savvy investor who could operate the property without the quarter - to - quarter franticness that comes with making Wall Street happy .
It is a cliché of the media business that the assets go up and down the elevator every day .
In Minneapolis , many of those assets are pals from my days of working as a reporter and editor at a weekly there , so I wondered :
Who would be controlling their professional destinies , bottom feeders or benefactors ?
Private equity owners are often viewed with suspicion , in part because they have limited investment horizons and tend to milk properties for cash flow , clean up the balance sheet and then flip the property to what is technically known as a “ greater fool . ”
The sale of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News by McClatchy to a local group of investors has resulted , after a sharp downturn this summer , in a great deal of strife and talks of significant layoffs .
I talked to OhSang Kwon , one of the partners in Avista Capital Partners .
“ We do n’t want to rule out anything , but the idea that we bought this paper with a quick exit in mind or that we were going to cut our way to profitability is not correct , ” he said .
“ I do n’t have the hubris to say that we have the answers — we are new to the newspaper business — but the old way was not working .
Maybe it is time for a different approach . ”
Maybe it is .
Tomorrow , The Wall Street Journal , which is owned by Dow Jones & Company , will hit my doorstep in a smaller size and with a different approach , pushing much of the so - called commoditized news — the daily reports and incremental articles that everyone has — to the Web and filling the physical paper with more analysis and deeper reporting .
Google , which has been dining to some degree on ads diverted from newspapers , announced last week that it is expanding a program to sell newspaper advertising using its own auction approach .
As I sat at the kitchen table , I marveled at the low price of a newspaper that had once preoccupied the conversation around my dinner table .
Then I looked at the four papers on the table and the empty chairs that surrounded them .
Before my second cup of coffee , the rest of my household had already started the day in a way that had nothing to do with the paper artifacts in front of me .
Maybe I was the greater fool .
Space - Efficient Scheduling of Parallelism SCANDAL Project
Many of today 's high level parallel languages support dynamic , fine - grained parallelism .
The language implementation typically requires an efficient scheduling algorithm to assign computations to processors at runtime .
However , in an attempt to expose a sufficient degree of parallelism to keep all processors busy , schedulers often create many more parallel threads than necessary , leading to excessive memory usage .
Further , the order in which the threads are scheduled can greatly affect the total size of the live data at any instance during the parallel execution , and unless the threads are scheduled carefully , the parallel execution of a program may require much more memory than its serial execution .
This research involves finding theoretically space - and time - efficient scheduling algorithms for multithreaded programs , including programs with nested parallelism and synchronization variables .
In addition to proving the space and time bounds of the resulting parallel schedules , we demonstrate that they are efficient in practice .
We have implemented a runtime system that uses our algorithm to schedule threads in computations with nested parallelism .
Recently , we added this space - efficient scheduling technique to the native Pthreads library on Solaris , and studied the performance of 7 dynamic or irregular parallel benchmarks written using Pthreads
We show how simple , yet provably good modifications to the library can result in significantly improved space and time performance .
( click here for the paper ) .
With the modified Pthreads library , each of the parallel benchmarks performs as well as its coarse - grained , hand - partitioned counterpart .
These results demonstrate that , provided we use a good scheduler , the rich functionality and standard API of Pthreads can be combined with the advantages of dynamic , lightweight threads to result in high performance .

US Politics Politicization , Propaganda and the Rule of Law By Ryan McGreal
Published May 15 , 2007
The vast litany of scandals hanging around the Bush White House like a bad smell leaves many people scratching their heads , wondering why no one in the administration has been impeached and why no politician seems to be pursuing it ( other than Dennis Kucinich , of course ) .
Why were the Republicans willing and able to impeach President Clinton on such frivolous grounds when Bush continues to be president after much more serious " high crimes and misdemeanors " ( the grounds for impeachment under Article II , Section 4 of the US Constitution ) ?
The Clinton impeachment was a witch hunt , pure and simple , pursued with relentless , single - minded zeal by the Republican Party .
Through a myriad of bogus scandals , the GOP attack machine managed to get President Clinton on the stand , where he was asked whether he had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky .
He denied it ( later claiming that he did n't believe oral sex was included in the definition of " sexual relations " ) , and that lie under oath was the basis for the year - long impeachment brouhaha that eventually acquitted him of perjury and obstruction of justice .
It 's clear that Clinton 's impeachment was an act of politicization .
The GOP kept digging in the dirt and throwing mud at Clinton until something - in this case , trying to cover up a marital infidelity - stuck .
The grounds were clearly spurious and the affair actually hurt the Republicans ' popularity among Americans .
( Ironically , Clinton 's popularity reached a peak of 73 percent during the scandal , and a majority of Americans opposed his impeachment . )
A Much Stronger Case for Impeachment
Eight years later , the case against President Bush is much stronger than the case against Clinton ever was .
After the Republicans lost control over the House and Senate in the 2006 Congressional election , the Democratic Majority gained the power to conduct investigations into the Bush Administration 's legitimate abuses of power .
As a senior Democrat explained in March , " We 've only had subpoena power for the last six weeks and every tree that we 've barked up so far has had a cat in it .
Imagine where we 'll be after six months . "
This could potentially mean the Democrats are waiting for the right time to launch impeachment proceedings against senior members of the Bush administration , but other than Kucinich , no one is willing to support the notion .
There are a number of possible reasons for this :
President Bush is more use to the Democrats politically if he remains in power .
As long as he stays on as president , the thinking goes , he will continue to poison the well for Republican candidates for office .
After the backfiring of the Republican impeachment proceedings against President Clinton , the Democrats are afraid of a repeat performance .
The Democrats are biding their time , waiting for the most politically damaging opportunity to launch impeachment .
There is probably some truth to all of these , but there 's another reason that has n't been discussed much : the case against Bush is too complicated .
A Complicated Case
This helps to explain why it was so much easier for the Republicans to push their much weaker case for impeachment against Bill Clinton : their narrative was easy to follow .
President Clinton dishonored the presidency by having an affair and lying about it .
It 's simple , straighforward , and plays well to an audience already primed for moralistic scolding .
The case against President bush , by contrast , is a lot more involved , even if it 's also a lot more substantial .
At every step , it 's necessary to peel back layer after layer of mendacity and obfuscation to get at who did what and under what circumstances , and the White House is digging in its heels at every turn , claiming " executive privilege " as it refuses to honour subpoenas or hand over evidence .
The complexity of the issues also provides hundreds of opportunities for partisans to drive wedges into the discussion and sidetrack it on tangents about microscopic details , motivations , and conflicting accounts .
For example , it 's not simple to make the case that there 's a difference between a president replacing attorneys at his " pleasure , " as nearly all Presidents do on taking office , and replacing attorneys to obstruct justice , as the Bush administration has apparently done .
It 's not simple to prove that Dick Cheney manipulated the prewar intelligence and strong - armed the CIA into endorsing a conclusion with which it did not agree .
It 's not simple to prove that Doug Feith cooked the books to create a case for invading Iraq at the Office of Special Plans or that most of his ' evidence ' came from a convicted fraudster and from testimonies obtained under torture .
It 's not simple to prove that US chief weapons inspector David Kay was talking rubbish when he said , " We were all wrong " about whether Iraq still had a WMD program .
And so on and so on .
It takes time to go through all the evidence , to pick out the thousands of data points in the various media reports and connect the dots into a coherent picture .
Certainly the US newsmedia themselves have done a piss - poor job of it , and they 're far more qualified to do the research and perform the analysis than the average person sitting at home .
Finally , now you know why the Bush Administration is so adamant about resisting Congressional efforts to get any officials to testify under oath about anything .
It also explains why Attorney General Alberto Gonzales recently said a variation of " I do n't recall " 64 times when he was on the stand .
At this point , portraying oneself as hopelessly incompetent beats lying under oath or - even worse - telling the truth .

Republican puts out ' action alert ' claiming Rice will be subpoenaed Wednesday Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday April 24 , 2007 Print This Email
This A spokesman for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has suggested , on the day before a House Committee is threatening to issue a subpoena for her cooperation with an investigation into the evidence used to build the case for the Iraq War , that she had more important things to do than testify before Congress Meanwhile , a Republican Congressman sent out an " action alert " Tuesday claiming that " we 've gotten word that Waxman will issue a subpoena to Secretary Rice tomorrow morning , " adding that such a move could allow the GOP to show how Democrats are " trying to win the political war for themselves no matter its effect on Americas efforts to promote peace and democracy abroad . "
" I can only assume that members of Congress would rather have the secretary of State be focused on issues of war and peace , " said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack in a press briefing today , and then listed her obligations over the next month .
He added , " So she can be doing those things , or she can be testifying before Chairman Waxman 's committee about an issue that has been about as investigated as an issue can possibly be investigated . "
He was responding to an inquiry regarding whether or not Rice would agree to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform prior to the Memorial Day recess , as requested by Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
Chairman Waxman is scheduled to have a hearing tomorrow to consider issuing a subpoena to compel Rice 's cooperation with his probe .
McCormack further dismissed the question of how the case for the Iraq War was built as too old to be worthy of concern .
" I 'm not quite sure what these questions about her job four years ago , and a four - year - old controversy that has been thoroughly investigated , have to do with her current - day duties , " he said .
But , he maintained that the State Department 's response to Waxman 's questions would ward off any need for a subpoena or testimony .
" Congressman Waxman has had a series of questions for Secretary Rice , and we started out at the -- some 50 - plus questions .
I think we 've narrowed it down to about three , and we will be providing a response to those last three questions , I expect , later this afternoon to Chairman Waxman and his committee , " he added .
Subsequently , Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - SC ) issued an alert via his " Theme Team " saying that Waxman 's plans could offer Republicans a political opportunity .
" This could be a great place for us to get our foot in the door in showing that Waxman is unecessarily issuing the subpoena and , in doing so , is standing in the way of Dr. Rice doing what we all agree is necessary  building and improving on international support for our efforts worldwide , " wrote Chris Crawford , who works for the Congressman , in an e-mail to bloggers .
The email continues , " Waxmans actions border on harassment and will prevent the Dr. Rice from completing those duties entrusted to her office . "
" The subpoena threatens to disrupt a busy and important schedule including trips to a NATO conference on Afghanistan , the Iraq Neighbors Conference in Egypt , and facilitating talks between Israel and Palestine , " the " Theme Team Action Alert " states .
" Is Mr. Waxman more concerned with getting press or is he trying to save the diplomatic limelight for Speaker Pelosi ? "
McCormack 's full exchange with reporters in today 's State Department press briefing can be found below .
# Q Sean , Congressman Waxman is having a hearing tomorrow to decide whether to subpoena Secretary Rice .
Any comments on that ?
MR. MCCORMACK : Right .
Well , this has been an ongoing story for some time .
Congressman Waxman has had a series of questions for Secretary Rice , and we started out at the -- some 50 - plus questions .
I think we 've narrowed it down to about three , and we will be providing a response to those last three questions , I expect , later this afternoon to Chairman Waxman and his committee .
Look , I can only assume that members of Congress would rather have the secretary of State be focused on issues of war and peace .
You know , just to go over her calendar a little bit in the coming months here , she 's going to be leaving tomorrow for Oslo for a NATO foreign ministers ' meeting , where she 's going to talk about issues like Kosovo and Afghanistan and the support for our NATO allies ' efforts to -- to efforts to stabilize Afghanistan .
She 's going to be traveling to the Middle East for the Iraq neighbors ' conference and the International Compact for Iraq .
She 's also going to -- in May going to be traveling to the Middle East to meet with Israeli and Palestinian officials to see if we can find a way forward to try to bring peace to that region .
She 's going to be traveling to Moscow to talk to Foreign Minister Lavrov about issues related to Iran and U.S. - Russia relations .
So she can be doing those things , or she can be testifying before Chairman Waxman 's committee about an issue that has been about as investigated as an issue can possibly be investigated .
And all the answers are out there in a number of different commission reports , whether that 's in Department of Defense inspector general reports or the Silberman - Robb commission .
So these -- this is a four - year - old issue that has been as investigated as any in the past four years .
If you can find one that has been more investigated on the national security front , that -- more than this one , I 'm certainly open to ideas .
But I do n't think you 're going to find one .
Q
So are you saying if she is subpoenaed , that she wo n't appear ?
MR .
MCCORMACK : Well , we 'll deal with that question if we actually get to that point .
I would hope that Chairman Waxman , when he has an opportunity to review the response from the State Department , that -- Q This -- MR. MCCORMACK : -- this afternoon -- that he 'll see that all of these questions have been in fact answered , answered before .
I know that , you know , for example , the questions on Niger uranium -- seems to be a focus of Chairman Waxman in this regard -- are questions that were answered by Senator Levin at the end of Secretary Rice 's confirmation process .
And we had provided answers to , I think , almost precisely the same questions , in detail , to Senator Levin .
Q So you -- MR. MCCORMACK : So we 'll be providing all the information .
Secretary Rice is committed to providing the Congress the information it needs to do its job .
She is -- spends a lot of time up on the Hill , spends a lot of time with members of Congress , talking about various issues .
She 's up there today , talking to members of the Finance Committee .
And that 's not unusual , to find her up there , or having members of Congress down here to work on issues related to foreign policy or the State Department .
Q
So it 's your view that a rational , right - thinking mind would see that your answers , to be provided this afternoon , would obviate any need for a subpoena .
MR .
MCCORMACK : ( Laughs . )
The -- ( chuckles ) -- I think we 're -- Q
Just a simple a yes or no .
MR .
MCCORMACK : -- we 're giving the thorough answers .
We 're giving complete answers .
And certainly we -- I do n't think it -- I think it would be hard for a member of Congress to take a look at the body of information that we have provided on a four - year - old issue and decide that this is worthy of a subpoena for the secretary of State .
Q ( Off mike . )
You 're willing to provide , you know , these thorough , complete answers in writing .
Why is the secretary unwilling to talk about it publicly in front of his committee ?
MR .
MCCORMACK : Well , she has talked about these issues in public .
She 's talked about these issues with members of the media .
She has answered questions to commissions on this .
It really gets down to a matter of , exactly what are the motivations here , where I just have to say that I 'm mystified as to the motivations .
You have an issue related to Niger uranium , as we have said , as I have talked about , that has been investigated , you know , up , down and all around .
The answers are out there .
Secretary Rice 's personal views on the matter , her personal connection as national security advisor at the White House is a matter of the public record .
So I 'm not sure what these questions about a four - year - old issue have to do with her job as secretary of State .
The questions , as I understand it , really center around her duties as national security advisor .
And the questions have been asked , have been answered , many , many times over .
So I 'm not sure what any of this has to do with her job as secretary of State .
So you know , again , I can't tell you the motivation here .
Q
Do you think , I mean , is he just trying to , Congressman Waxman , trying to score some political points ?
Are you willing to say that ?
MR. MCCORMACK : Libby , you know , you should ask Chairman Waxman .
I 'm not sure .
You know , I know Secretary Rice has a lot on her plate as secretary of State .
And I 'm not quite sure what these questions about her job four years ago , and a four - year - old controversy that has been thoroughly investigated , have to do with her current - day duties .
Q
She says that she did not -- has not clarified publicly what she knew personally about the Niger claim and when it went into the speech .
That 's what his response has been to all the pages you 've sent .
MR .
MCCORMACK : Those very same questions were asked by Senator Levin as part of her confirmation process .
Those answers were provided , prior to the Senate voting on her confirmation .
So it is a matter of public record with the Senate .
And she has also talked about this issue many times over in public , talked to a lot of journalists about it .
So there 's a massive public record on this issue , including Secretary Rice 's remembrances on the issue and her involvement in her former capacity as national security advisor .
If you have ever wondered why your eyes start glazing over as you read those dot points on the screen , as the same words are being spoken , take heart in knowing there is a scientific explanation .
It is more difficult to process information if it is coming at you in the written and spoken form at the same time .

The strong showing of Democrat Barack Obama in early trial heat polls for the 2008 presidential election raises anew the question of whether the American public is ready to support an African American candidate for president .
Recent polling points to two significant shifts on this question .
The first is that an ever larger majority of the public indeed says that they are willing to vote for an African American for the nation ’s highest office .
The second is that polls conducted in campaigns pitting white and black candidates against each other are doing a better job of accurately predicting the outcome of the election now than in the past , suggesting that hidden biases that confounded polling in biracial elections in the 1980s and early 1990s are no longer a serious problem .
With Obama poised to declare his candidacy for president this weekend , recent national polling finds that although he trails Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination , he does nearly as well as Clinton in general election matchups against the frontrunning Republicans , narrowly leading John McCain and running roughly even with Rudy Giuliani .
More generally , the vast majority of Americans tell pollsters that they are willing to vote for a qualified African American candidate for president .
In a Newsweek poll conducted last year , just 3 % said they would not do so .
This was not always the case .
Gallup has asked a version of this question since 1958 .
Most recently , in 2003 , 92 % said they would vote for a black candidate for president while just 6 % said they would not .
But in 1958 , a majority of 53 % said they would not vote for a black candidate ; even as recently as 1984 , 16 % told Gallup they would not do so .
Can polls that show the public willing to vote for a black candidate be taken at face value ?
It is undoubtedly true that racial attitudes in the U.S. have become more tolerant over the past five decades , and African American candidates have won high office in many states .
But it is also true that the expression of racist attitudes is less socially acceptable now than in the past .
This may lead some people to tell pollsters that they are more tolerant than they actually are .
Election Polls in the 1980s and 1990s Missed the Mark in Biracial Elections
Problems with pre-election polls in several high - profile biracial elections in the 1980s and early 1990s raised the question of whether covert racism remained an impediment to black candidates .
White candidates in most of these races generally did better on Election Day than they were doing in the polls , while their black opponents tended to end up with about the same level of support as the polls indicated they had .
This phenomenon was first noticed in the 1982 race for governor of California , where Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , a black Democrat , narrowly lost to Republican George Deukmejian , despite polls showing him with a lead ranging from 9 to 22 points .
The next year , African American Democrat Harold Washington barely won his race for mayor of Chicago against Republican Bernard Epton .
Pre-election polls taken within the last two weeks of the campaign showed Washington with a 14 - point lead .
Three highly visible races in 1989 and 1990 also followed this pattern , though in two instances at least one late poll signaled a close race .
Virginia Democrat and African American Douglas Wilder edged white Republican Marshall Coleman by less than one percentage point to become the nation ’s first elected black governor .
But two of three polls conducted just days before the election showed Wilder leading by double - digits ; a third poll had him 4 points ahead .
Even an exit poll conducted on Election Day showed Wilder winning by 10 points , while accurately tallying the vote in the other two statewide races .
Unlike most exit polls that use an anonymous written ballot to collect voters ’ responses , this one had interviewers asking voters face - to - face how they voted , a situation that might increase the pressure to provide a socially desirable response .
Also in 1989 , Democrat David Dinkins , an African American , won victory over Republican Rudy Giuliani in the race for mayor of New York by a slight two points , despite leading by 18 points in a poll conducted by the New York Observer a week before the election .
In the following year , another prominent election featured African American Democrat Harvey Gantt in a bitter race against Republican Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina .
Two of three independent polls conducted just before the election showed Gantt leading Helms , but Helms prevailed by six percentage points on Election Day .
Race was an issue in the campaign as evidenced by a Helms campaign television advertisement featuring a fictional white job seeker who lost out to a minority candidate because of a racial quota .
The ad charged that Gantt supported hiring quotas .
In 1992 , black Democrat Carol Moseley Braun won a 10 - point victory over Republican Richard Williamson in a race for a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois .
But polls taken just days before the election showed her with a lead ranging from 17 to 20 points .
Interestingly , in the Democratic primary , Moseley Braun trailed incumbent Sen .
Alan Dixon by a wide margin in two polls taken just a week before she won the election .
2006 Polls More Accurate
Last year ’s midterm elections featured several important races that pitted black and white candidates against each other .
Unlike the experience of the 1980s and 1990s , pre-election polls in most of these campaigns performed well , and there was little evidence of a “ hidden ” vote for the white candidate .
Although African American candidates lost four of the five statewide races that featured black vs. white candidates , the late pre-election polling tended to mirror the final outcome .
1 Black Republican candidates for governor lost by wide margins in Ohio ( by 23 points ) and Pennsylvania ( 20 points ) , but the average of the final independent polls in each state showed similar margins ( 21 and 23 points , respectively ) .
An African American Democrat , Deval Patrick , won the Massachusetts governor ’s race by a landslide ( 56 % to 35 % ) over a white Republican Kerry Healey .
Two pre-election polls slightly underestimated Healey ’s support , but these were conducted about two weeks before the election .
Black candidates also lost in two key Senate races — Maryland and Tennessee — but there was no clear evidence of a hidden vote for the white candidate in either state .
The more complicated case was in Maryland , where Republican Lt. Gov. Michael Steele , who is African American , lost his Senate bid to Democrat Benjamin Cardin by 10 points , about the same margin as in a Washington Post poll conducted 10 days before the election .
Two other polls , however , showed the race to be much closer .
But these polls also underestimated the Democratic vote in the race for governor in which both the Democrat and Republican candidates were white .
Both polls showed the two candidates running neck - and - neck , but on Election Day the Democrat , Baltimore Mayor Martin O’Malley , beat incumbent Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich by seven points .
The race for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee was perhaps the most closely watched of all the biracial elections last year .
Black Democrat Harold Ford , Jr. narrowly lost to white Republican Bob Corker , 51 % to 48 % .
There were many pre-election polls in this race , and three of the final four polls actually overstated Corker ’s lead .
Taken together , the accuracy of the polling in these five biracial elections suggests that the problems that bedeviled polling in the 1980s and early 1990s may no longer be so serious .
This change is not a result of broader improvements in the methodology of election polling ; most election polls in the earlier period were competently done and generally performed well in predicting election outcomes .
The experience of the 2006 elections indicates that racism may be less of a factor in public judgments about African American candidates than it was 10 or 20 years ago .
It is true that the African American candidate lost in four of the five statewide races examined , but three of these were Republicans running in a bad year for Republicans .
In each of these three cases , the other major statewide race pitted two white candidates ( for the U.S. Senate in Ohio and Pennsylvania and for governor in Maryland ) , and the Democratic candidates ’ margin of victory was similar to those in races involving a black Republican .
It is also the case that black candidates in these races tended to do as well among whites of their party as white candidates did in other states .
For example , the National Election Pool exit poll — which is conducted with an anonymous ballot and thus less likely than a telephone or face - to - face interview to elicit a socially desirable but erroneous response — found that 91 % of white Democratic voters in Tennessee chose Harold Ford , about the same level of support that white Democrats in Virginia gave Jim Webb ( 92 % ) .
This is also about the level of support that white Republicans in Maryland gave African American Michael Steele ( 94 % ) .
No one would deny that race still matters in U.S. politics .
For the past half century , the political parties have been increasingly divided in their positions on racial issues , and that , in turn , has affected voters ’ decisions to call themselves Republicans or Democrats .
But this review of exit polls and electoral outcomes in several recent elections suggests that fewer people are making judgments about candidates based solely , or even mostly , on race itself , and that relatively few people are now unwilling to tell pollsters how they honestly feel about particular candidates .
In such an environment , the high standing of Barack Obama in presidential polling — or , for that matter , of Colin Powell prior to the 1996 presidential election — represents a significant change in American politics .
Notes
1 The Senate contest in Mississippi matched a black Democrat ( Fleming ) and a white Republican ( Lott ) , but almost no public polling was conducted in the race .

Air quality is acceptable ; however , for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution .
0 - 50 Good Air quality is considered satisfactory , and air pollution poses little or no risk .
AirCompare provides comparisons of air quality based on factors that have been shown to increase risk from air pollution .
These factors can include life stages ( children and older adults ) , specific health conditions ( heart or lung disease ) , and increased likelihood of exposure from being active outdoors .
The Air Quality Index ( AQI ) is the official index for air quality across the United States .
The AQI ranges from 0 to 500 .
The higher the AQI value , the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern .
When AQI values are between 101 and 150 , or code orange , members of sensitive groups may experience health effects .
This is because they are more likely to be affected at lower air quality levels than everyone else .
For example , children and older adults , people with lung disease , and people who are active outdoors ( outdoor workers ) are at greater risk from exposure to ozone .
Older adults and children , and people with heart or lung disease are at greater risk from exposure to particle pollution .
Everyone is more likely to be affected when the AQI values are above 150 , or code red and higher .

Problems with letting every element be a link
One of the more frequently cited features of the XHTML 2 Working Draft is that the href attribute now applies to every element .
People generally seem to appreciate this as it appears simpler and saves several keystrokes .
Even though one of the design goals of HTML 5 is remaining backwards compatible people still suggest this on the WHATWG mailing list .
There ’s another reason for not doing it though ; it actually makes things more complex .
If you want every element to become like a you would n’t just make href a global attribute , but target , ping , rel , media , hreflang and type as well ( attributes currently allowed in HTML 5 on the a element ) .
This makes all those other elements a little bit more complex , as suddenly they have a whole new bunch of attributes that apply to them .
It also creates problem for the input element as that already has a type attribute of which the semantics are completely different .
Similarly the form element has a target attribute related to submission and not related to linking .
Which brings up a related point , namely that the a element has some activation behavior by default .
This activation behavior is basically triggered when you click the link or use some other mechanism to invoke it .
Suddenly this applies to all elements .
However , there are other elements that already have activation behavior : < input type=checkbox > .

( SPACE.com ) --
The discovery of three distant supermassive black holes in proximity to one another is giving astronomers a glimpse into the chaotic early years of the universe .
Known as quasars , these incredibly bright objects are thought to be powered by gas falling into enormous black holes situated in the centers of galaxies .
Although smaller than our solar system , a single quasar can outshine an entire galaxy of a hundred billion stars .
Roughly 100,000 quasars have been observed in recent years , some of them double quasars .
But this is the first time that three quasars have been found so near one another .
The three quasars are separated by about 100,000 to 150,000 light years -- about the width of our Milky Way .
" Quasars are extremely rare objects .
To find two of them so close together is very unlikely if they were randomly distributed in space , " said study leader George Djorgovski , an astronomer at Caltech .
" To find three is unprecedented . "
The discovery , made using the European Space Observatory 's Very Large Telescope and the W.M. Keck Observatory Hawaii , was reported here today at the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
A science paper on the research has been submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters .
One of the quasars in the triplet , called LBQS 1429-008 , was discovered in 1989 by a team of astronomers led by Paul Hewett of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge , England .
Hewett 's team later spotted what appeared to be a faint companion to their quasar , but they dismissed it as a visual illusion created by gravitational lensing , whereby light traveling towards Earth from distant galaxies is bent by the gravity of massive objects -- such as star clusters , dark matter clumps or other galaxies -- in their path .
Sometimes , this can create mirror images of a galaxy in one or more different places in the sky .
But the new observations have revealed a third , even fainter companion to Hewett 's quasar duo and , equally important , the lack of any galaxy that could possibly serve as a lens .
This makes it highly unlikely that gravitational lensing is responsible , the researchers say .
" We just could not reproduce the data , " said study team member Frederic Courbin of Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland .
" It is essentially impossible to account for what we see using reasonable gravitational lensing models . "
The team also observed small differences in the properties of the three quasars that are best explained if the quasars are physically distinct objects .
Double quasars are thought to form when two galaxies , each containing their own supermassive black holes , merge together .
While the amalgamation of two black holes is thought to just create a larger black hole , the merger of three black holes is expected to be more violent and interesting .
" Three is so much better than two because the dynamics of three gravitationally interacting bodies is chaotic , as opposed to the much more regular motion of two bodies simply orbiting each other , " said Frederic Rasio of Northwestern University in Illinois .
Rasio was not involved in the triple quasar observations , but his team has done recent theoretical work showing that interactions between three supermassive black holes might occur as frequently as a few times per year within the observable universe .
Rasio's work also predicts that triple quasar encounters could eject one or more of the bright objects straight out of the host galaxy .
These " naked " quasars are then destined to wander alone through the universe .
The triple quasar discovery provides astronomers with a rare glimpse into an early , and much more chaotic , period of the universe .
The quasar trio is located about 10.5 billion light years away in the Virgo constellation .
This means light from those quasars that astronomers now see were emitted when the universe was just over 3 billion years old .
During that early epoch , the universe was a much smaller space ; galaxies were also smaller and collided much more frequently .
" Quasars are believed to be powered by gas falling into supermassive black holes , " Djorgovski said .
" This process happens very effectively when galaxies collide or merge , and we are observing this system at the time in the cosmic history when such galaxy interactions were at a peak . "

Aide suggested using Patriot Act to avoid appointment process
• Attorney general says firings were justified but " mistakes were made "
• E-mail lists attorneys " in the process of being pushed out "
• Alberto Gonzales ' chief of staff resigns amid furor over firing of 8 U.S. attorneys
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Tuesday " mistakes were made " regarding the firing of eight U.S. attorneys and he accepts responsibility for the ordeal .
Gonzales said the lawyers should have been told why they were being fired and admitted the explanations initially given to Congress about the matter were " incomplete . "
" As we can all imagine , in an organization of 110,000 people , I am not aware of every bit of information that passes through the halls of justice , nor am I aware of all decisions , " he said at a Tuesday afternoon news conference .
" That is a sorry excuse , " Sen .
Charles Schumer , D - New York , said minutes later on the Senate floor .
Schumer said Gonzales should resign .
" Did the attorney general not know that eight U.S. attorneys were to be fired ? "
Schumer said .
" If he did n't know , he should n't be attorney general , plain and simple .
...
The buck stops with the attorney general . "
However , Gonzales said he was not stepping down .
" I 'm committed to doing my job -- and that is what I intend to do here on behalf of the American people . "
The Bush administration has said the firings -- seven in December and one months earlier -- were routine personnel matters that were the result of poor performance .
However , Democrats accuse the administration of trying to dictate to the prosecutors , who are supposed to be nonpartisan .
Several of the prosecutors who were fired have said they were being pressured to move more quickly on investigations into voter fraud .
Democrats are examining e-mails they say prove the White House was far more involved in the firings than it has acknowledged .
( Full story )
The key e-mails are from the Gonzales ' chief of staff , who resigned amid growing criticism Monday , the Justice Department said Tuesday .
An e-mail from D. Kyle Sampson to former White House counsel Harriet Miers dated January 1 , 2006 , read , " You have asked whether President Bush should remove and replace U.S. Attorneys whose four - year terms have expired .
I recommend that the Department of Justice and the Office of the Counsel to the President work together to seek the replacement of a limited number of U.S. Attorneys . "
On September 13 , 2006 , Sampson e-mailed Miers lists of federal attorneys " In the Process of Being Pushed Out " and those " We Now Should Consider Pushing Out . "
Sampson proposed using a provision of the anti-terrorism Patriot Act to circumvent the standard appointment process .
A provision added in 2006 allows the president to appoint interim federal prosecutors who can serve indefinitely without Senate confirmation .
By skipping the Justice Department 's normal personnel system , Sampson told Miers , " we can give far less deference to home - state senators and thereby get ( 1 ) our preferred person appointed and ( 2 ) do it far faster and more efficiently , at less political cost to the White House . "
Schumer said the revelations " proved beyond any reasonable doubt that there has been an unprecedented breach of trust , abuse of power and misuse of the Justice Department .
And that is very serious and very important , " said Schumer , referring to the e-mails .
Schumer also warned the White House against making Sampson " the next fall guy . "
" Today 's staff resignation does not take heat off the attorney general .
In fact , it raises the temperature .
Kyle Sampson will not become the next Scooter Libby , " said the senator , referring to Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff who was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury last week in an investigation into the exposure of a CIA agent .
( Watch Schumer call for Gonzales to step down )
Sen . Edward Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , said Gonzales " has exhibited a lack of candor with Congress and disdain for the rule of law and our constitutional system , " and called his resignation " long overdue . "
Schumer and Kennedy are on the Senate Judiciary Committee , which has held hearings about the firings .
White House spokesman Tony Snow confirmed it was Miers who came up with an idea to remove all the federal prosecutors and bring in " fresh blood " at the beginning of President Bush 's second term .
( Watch a congressman explain how e-mails suggest White House involvement in firings )
Snow said Miers ' proposal was a suggestion , not a recommendation , to fire all the federal prosecutors .
Bush made " no recommendations on specific individuals , " he said .
Snow said Gonzales , who served as White House counsel in Bush 's first term , still has the president 's confidence .
And Gonzales defended the ultimate decision to remove those prosecutors .
" Again , all political appointees can be removed by the president of the United States for any reason , " he said at the end of his news conference .
" I stand by the decision , and I think it was the right decision . "

Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2007 April 17
Explanation : Planet HD 209458 b is evaporating .
It is so close to its parent star that its heated atmosphere is simply expanding away into space .
Some astronomers studying this distant planetary system now believe they have detected water vapor among the gases being liberated .
This controversial claim , if true , would mark the first instance of planetary water beyond our Solar System , and indicate anew that life might be sustainable elsewhere in the universe .
HD 209458 b is known as a hot Jupiter type system because it involves a Jupiter - type planet in a Mercury - type orbit .
Although spectroscopic observations from the Hubble Space Telescope are the basis for the water detection claim , the planetary system is too small and faint to image .
Therefore , an artist 's impression of the HD 209458 b system is shown above .
Research into the atmospheric composition of HD 209458 b and other extrasolar planets is continuing .

They feel helpless .
You are our last best hope .
Please be courageous and stand up , and hand the bill back to the President with this message from the American people who he long ago stopped serving or listening to .
You see , that ’s why no one can hold up a protest lacard that he see any longer .
We live in a fascist dictatorship and we were hoping that together , you would stop this madman from killing us all and raping what is left of our standing as a nation .
We still stand by you even in this rough spot .
You have done a lot and you deserve a thank you .
You have done a lot to oppose Bush and expose his anti-American anti- Constitution policies .
You ’re about to get a spanking from your base and Keith Olbermann in particular speaks truth to power .
But you have to know that you must do everything you can to stop this madman and to bring his criminal empire to an end .
If you fail to act , it will be much much worse .
For the soldiers .
For America .
For the Democrats .
Please please keep fighting .
Think this bill over again .

A rich array of marine life was found in the cold , deep waters
In pictures
Scientists have found more than 700 new species of marine creatures in seas once thought too hostile to sustain such rich biodiversity .
Groups of carnivorous sponges , free - swimming worms , crustaceans and molluscs were collected .
The findings , published in the journal Nature , could provide insights into the evolution of ocean life in this area .
Dr Katrin Linse , an author of the paper and a marine biologist from British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , said : " What was once thought to be a featureless abyss is in fact a dynamic , variable and biologically rich environment .
" Finding this extraordinary treasure trove of marine life is our first step to understanding the complex relationships between the deep ocean and distribution of marine life . "
New to science
The research formed part of the Andeep ( Antarctic benthic deep - sea biodiversity ) project , which is the first comprehensive study of Antarctic marine life .
It is designed to fill the " knowledge vacuum " that surrounds the fauna that inhabit the deeper parts of the Southern Ocean .
The first sampling expedition ( Andeep 1 ) took place in 2002 Andeep 2 took also took place in 2002 Andeep 3 took place in 2005
During three research expeditions that took place between 2002 and 2005 , an international team collected tens of thousands of specimens from the Weddell Sea , from depths of between 774 and 6,348 m ( 2,539-20,826ft ) .
The samples were taken from diverse settings , including the continental slope , the abyssal plain and channel levees .
The researchers found the area to be teeming with lifeforms ; well over 1,000 species were recovered , and many were completely new to science .
For example , they spotted 674 species of isopod ( a diverse order of crustaceans ) , most of which had never previously been described ; more than 200 polychaete species ( marine worms ) , 81 of which were found to be new species ; and 76 sponges , 17 of which had previously been unknown .
Lead author of the paper , Angelika Brandt , who is based at the Zoological Institute and Zoological Museum , University of Hamburg , Germany , said : " I initiated the Andeep project because such a vast area of the Southern Ocean had never been explored .
" We thought we might find some novel species , but previous research had suggested deep - sea diversity this far south would be poor , so we were very surprised to find such enormous diversity . "
The findings could help to shed light on the evolution of ocean life in this area , Professor Brandt told the BBC News website .
By comparing the species that are found in the deep - sea and those found in the shallower waters surrounding Antarctica , scientists will be able to better understand how climate and the environment these animals live in drove past evolutionary changes .
They ’re not ready to talk about all their ideas , but I think there are two big ways that libertarian paternalism can work its magic .
The first has to do with bureaucracy .
No matter how lofty the aims of a government program , it usually wo n’t make a difference if people can’t understand it .
Five years ago , the Charlotte - Mecklenburg Schools , the largest district in North Carolina , started a school choice program , giving parents a bigger say over where their children went to school .
But finding good information about schools , like their average test scores , sometimes seemed like an unpleasant exam in its own right .
Parents often had to wade through a Web site filled with acronyms like EOC , EOG , ABC and AYP .
Last year , at the urging of an economist named Justine Hastings and two other Yale researchers , the Charlotte schools conducted a little experiment to see if this complexity mattered .
Along with their school choice applications , a few thousand parents were also mailed a sheet of paper listing a single test score — the average of the math and reading scores — for each school they could apply to .
And guess what ?
These parents were much more likely than others to apply to schools with high scores .
They were starting to create the feedback loop that is the whole point of school choice .
Unfortunately , Charlotte has n’t drawn the obvious lesson from the experiment and continues to make good information hard to find .
This same sort of complexity has plagued Medicare Part D , the new prescription drug benefit .
Almost one - quarter of low - income people eligible for a subsidy are n’t getting it because they have not signed up for the program at all .
“ It ’s sufficiently complicated that people sort of throw up their hands and say , ‘ I ca n’t deal with it , ’ ” said Joseph Newhouse , a Harvard economist .
Likewise , there are almost seven million children without health insurance who are eligible for the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program but are not in it .
A few proposals to make it easier for children to be signed up are now working their way through Congress .
In every one of these cases — school choice , Medicare , health insurance — the government can help people make good choices by tearing down bureaucratic hurdles .
The second big nudging strategy puts up hurdles — in front of bad choices that are otherwise easy to make .
This is what Dr. Gropper did in his intensive care unit .
Other hospitals have undertaken similar efforts in the last decade , and as a result , the national pneumonia rate has fallen .

ROFL I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP , LOOK :
This story I am about to tell you is so fucking weird , I have no idea how to classify it , but it deals with EG , so you can all relate to it .
Here goes :-------------------------------Friday , after I got out of work , I went to my mailbox to find a note that I have to sign for a certified letter or package .
I figured the ride home from work today ( Monday ) would be a good time to pick it up , and I did just that .
I received a letter for which I had to sign 3 different documents for .
I walked outside , opened it up , and was AMAZED at what I read : Did n't make any sense to me .
It looked official too , from " Shannan Hannah " , which also had a symbol next to it , making it looks like a law firm or something .
I read on : WTF ?????
I totally knew right then what this letter was referring to :
Then it goes on stating the Im sitting in my car reading this thing , thinking of this thread , wondering what the hell this letter is ?
I read on : By now I'm ROFLING .
This can't possibly be real .
The telephone number is all zero's .
It 's not from an attorny or a court .
All it is , is a letter demanding money .
The bitch actually took the time to look me up , made the letter , AND EVEN SPENT $ 6.49 TO SEND IT CERTIFIED !!!!!!-------------------------Dear
Toppy , I'm sorry you feel the way a pre-pubescent teenage girl would feel after you were banned from EG for 1 day by yours truly .
Thanks for making me feel special with the time and effort you put into your wonderful letter .
Not only were you banned a day , but I made you spend time and effort , probably some gas , writing utensils , supplies , and six dollars and forty - nine cents in shipping and handling .
Because of your efforts , this letter goes on my wall next to Christmas Cards from 2005 , and just above my bowling pin .
Sincerely , EURA *FAG
JUNE 22 -- The FBI has subpoenaed records related to the online sales of a teddy bear carrying the message " Bush Kills Arabs Dead , " apparently as part of a probe into who delivered one of the plush toys to the Michigan home of a federal magistrate , The Smoking Gun has learned .
But , TSG has discovered , the Detroit U.S. Attorney 's grand jury investigation will find that the teddy bear , pictured at right , was n't some sort of a threat , but rather a gag gift purchased by a friend of Mona Majzoub , the federal magistrate .
Last July , a court panel selected Majzoub , a 55 - year - old Arab American lawyer from Detroit , to fill an open magistrate 's slot .
The teddy tale began in late January , when two Michigan men spotted the stuffed bear for sale in an online store connected to georgewbush.org , a parody site critical of the president and his administration .
One of the men , Michael J. Brady , is a 59 - year - old lawyer who chairs the Michigan bar 's criminal law committee .
The other web surfer , George Gish , is a retired court administrator and friend of Majzoub's .
In a TSG interview , Brady said that Gish , 64 , thought the bear would make a perfect gift for his friend Mazjoub , who Gish wanted to needle for her support of Bush and the Iraq war .
Brady , who ordered the bear and had the item sent to Gish 's Southfield home , said he believed his friend " took it to her house and left it on her porch . "
Brady noted that he did not know whether Gish told Majzoub he was responsible for the gift , adding that his friend believed Majzoub would immediately realize who was responsible for the prank .
That may have been a miscalculation on the part of Gish , pictured left , who could not be reached for comment .
Because on May 24 , a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to the California company that maintained the online store offering the 11 - inch teddy bear .
The subpoena sought a list of customers ( and their addresses ) who purchased the $ 15.99 item , known as product # 8632701 .
In a June 7 response sent to FBI agent Angela Ryan , the company , CafePress.com , reported selling only one of the teddy bears during the period specified in the subpoena ( October 2003 to February 2004 ) .
A CafePress invoice provided to the FBI records the sale of the item to Brady and the delivery of the teddy bear to Gish .
The firm provides print on demand services to thousands of web sites and small companies that want to offer personalized merchandise , but do not want to deal with the hassle of storage and order fulfillment , according to Maneesh Jain , CafePress 's co-founder .
Jain told TSG that FBI agents did not describe the nature of the bureau probe , just that they were looking into a " teddy bear transaction . "
Citing grand jury secrecy rules , prosecutor Sheldon Light , whose name appears on the subpoena and who heads the U.S. attorney 's general crimes unit , declined comment on a " pending investigation . "
Ryan did not return a phone message left at the Detroit FBI office .
While advertised as a " great companion for those cold winter mornings , " the " Bush Kills Arabs Dead " teddy bear was delivered to Majzoub at a time when such items -- and their pointed messages -- could easily be misconstrued by investigators monitoring threats of all kinds .
Shared responsibility
Together , we have a chance to serve the American people by solving the complex problems that many do n't expect us to tackle , let alone solve , in the partisan environment of today 's Washington .
To do that , however , we can't play politics as usual .
Democrats will control the House and Senate , and therefore we share the responsibility for what we achieve .
Now that you won , you are responsible for everything I fucked up and will fuck up , but you should not be nasty like we were when we had all the power , because that would not be nice .
That mix of whiny contempt and breathless arrogance is quite typical of this administration .
I believe
I believe that when America is willing to use her influence abroad , the American people are safer and the world is more secure .
When we bomb the shit out of furners , we scare the shit out of the rest of the world , and that 's good .
I believe that wealth does not come from government .
It comes from the hard work of America 's workers , entrepreneurs and small businesses .
Money comes from workers , and stays with companies and their shareholders , as it should be , because we destroyed the government 's ability to have a sane economic policy .
I believe government closest to the people is more responsive and accountable .
The federal government , and this administration , is not accountable .
I believe government plays an important role in helping those who can't help themselves .
It 's not their fault if big corporations cannot help themselves exploiting people , and we certainly played a big role in helping them do that .
Yet we must always remember that when people are hurting , they need a caring person , not a government bureaucracy .
I 'll just point again to my very ideological diary : I do n't do charity .
Charity is useful and a good thing , but it should not be necessary .
Government can be caring enough , if it 's competent and has given the necessary objectives by the representatives of the people .
I 'm glad to see Dubya say the opposite , personally .
But what an amazing list of admissions .
He 's bragging about it all .
No shame .
No regrets .
No intention to change anything .
Iraq
In the days ahead , I will be addressing our nation about a new strategy to help the Iraqi people gain control of the security situation and hasten the day when the Iraqi government gains full control over its affairs .
Ultimately , Iraqis must resolve the most pressing issues facing them .
We can't do it for them .
But we can help Iraq defeat the extremists inside and outside of Iraq - - and we can help provide the necessary breathing space for this young government to meet its responsibilities .
If democracy fails and the extremists prevail in Iraq , America 's enemies will be stronger , more lethal , and emboldened by our defeat .
Leaders in both parties understand the stakes in this struggle .
We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war .
I 'll tell you what I will decide to do in Iraq , and you can either support me , or be responsible for defeat .
Note : I 'm still a bit stunned to see the word " defeat " in his text .
It 's about blame shifting , of course , and it does not seem to have an impact on actualt policy making , but it 's still remarkable that it 's perceived now as a possible outcome in the White House .
Maybe they 're not absolutely delusional ...
Tax cuts good .
( Democratic ) Earmarks bad
It is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues .
Because revenues have grown and we 've done a better job of holding the line on domestic spending , we met our goal of cutting the deficit in half three years ahead of schedule .
By continuing these policies , we can balance the federal budget by 2012 while funding our priorities and making the tax cuts permanent .
In early February , I will submit a budget that does exactly that .
The bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the American worker , good for the American taxpayer , and good for the federal budget .
Now is not the time to raise taxes on the American people .
I 'll continue to do my thing .
It 's good for my base .
Taxes would be bad for my base .
Unhappy about it ?
Tough shit , commie .
One important message I took away from the election is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to slip into legislation billions of dollars of pork - barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by Congress .
I 'm glad Senator Robert Byrd and Congressman Dave Obey -- the Democrats who will lead the appropriations process in the new Congress -- heard that message , too , and have indicated they will refrain from including additional earmarks in the continuing resolution for this fiscal year .
But we can and should do more .
It 's time Congress give the president a line - item veto .
And today I will announce my own proposal to end this dead - of - the - night process and substantially cut the earmarks passed each year .
The election was not about Iraq , no , it was about Congress being corrupt ( as an institution , not because it was full of corrupt Republicans ) .
The solution , of course , is to cut the power of Congress , to give ME more , and it has nothing to do with the fact that this power and these earmarks would go to others than my friends .
" Bipartisanship " ( do it my way )
Our Founders believed in the wisdom of the American people to choose their leaders and provided for the concept of divided and effective government .
The majority party in Congress gets to pass the bills it wants .
The minority party , especially where the margins are close , has a strong say in the form bills take .
And the Constitution leaves it to the president to use his judgment whether they should be signed into law .
That gives us a clear challenge and an opportunity .
If the Congress chooses to pass bills that are simply political statements , they will have chosen stalemate .
Let the minority party decide what 's in your bills .
If you do n't , those bill will be " political " and will be vetoed by me - but I will blame you for bringing ineffectiveness and " stalemate " to Washington .
These are not the words of someone willing to be conciliatory .
This is defiant , petulant , arrogant posturing - unfortunately backed by a lot of institutional power .
The challenge is clear .
Bush will be a resolute obstacle to anything sane the Democratic Congress will try to do , and will continue to do his things as if nothing had happened in November - while using the opportunity of Democrats being " in power " to blame them for everything .
There can be no compromise .
This is a declaration of war .
Which should be good news , right ?
Bush is unable to win any war .
Time to wage this one .
Mr Arar was imprisoned in Syria for almost a year
Maher Arar was detained in the US while returning to Canada from Tunisia .
He has dual Syrian - Canadian citizenship .
A Canadian government inquiry cleared him of any involvement in terrorism .
Syria denies that he was tortured .
PM Stephen Harper said Mr Arar would receive $ 10.5 m ( US $ 8.9 m , £ 4.54 m ) compensation , and urged the US to drop him from its list of terror suspects .
" On behalf of the government of Canada I would like to apologise to you ... and your family for any role the government may have played in the terrible ordeal that all of you experienced in 2002 and 2003 , " Mr Harper said .
Mr Arar had sought $ 37 m ( US $ 31.3 m , £ 16 m ) in a civil suit .
The Canadian inquiry that exonerated Mr Arar said it was probable that US authorities were acting on information provided by Canadian authorities .
It also supported Mr Arar 's claims to have been tortured during his time in Syria .
Post - traumatic stress
In 2002 Mr Arar was returning from a family holiday in Tunisia when he was stopped by US officials as he changed planes in New York .
He was deported to Syria where he spent nearly a year in prison .
Since then the 36 - year - old software engineer has suffered from depression and post - traumatic stress disorder .
The head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police resigned over the case late last year .
The BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto says the case has left the Canadian government in sharp disagreement with the US .
Despite repeated calls from Canada to drop Mr Arar from its security watch list , the US refuses , saying it has reasons of its own to keep him on the list .
As the world transitions from fossil based energy systems to a larger portfolio of renewables , the tradeoffs between energy quantity , energy quality and environmental impacts will increasingly need to be compared using meaningful metrics .
Wind energy seemingly provides high returns , high quality energy ( electricity ) with minimal large scale environmental impacts .
This is a guest post by Cutler Cleveland .
Dr. Cleveland is a Professor at Boston University and has been researching and writing on energy issues for over 20 years .
He is Editor - in - Chief of the Encyclopedia of Earth , Editor - in - Chief of the Encyclopedia of Energy , the Dictionary of Energy and the Journal of Ecological Economics .
He has particular interest and expertise in the field of net energy analysis .
ENERGY RETURN ON INVESTMENT ( EROI ) FOR WIND ENERGY
Wind energy is one of the fastest growing energy systems in the world .
In Europe and the United States , wind - powered generating capacity increased by 18 percent and 27 percent , respectively , in 2005 alone .
While the rate of increase is impressive , wind still accounts for less than one percent of the world 's electricity generation .
The surge in wind energy is due to a combination of factors , including reduction in the cost of wind turbines , volatile prices for conventional forms of energy , the demand for non-carbon forms of energy to mitigate the effects of climate change , and generous government subsidies such as feed - in tariffs in Europe and the production tax credit in the United States .
One technique for evaluating energy systems is net energy analysis , which seeks to compare the amount of energy delivered to society by a technology to the total energy required to find , extract , process , deliver , and otherwise upgrade that energy to a socially useful form .
Energy return on investment ( EROI ) is the ratio of energy delivered to energy costs .
In the case of electricity generation , the EROI entails the comparison of the electricity generated to the amount of primary energy used in the manufacture , transport , construction , operation , decommissioning , and other stages of the facility 's life cycle ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1
Comparing cumulative energy requirements with the amount of electricity the technology produces over its lifetime yields a simple ratio for energy return on investment ( EROI ) :
EROI = ( cumulative electricity generated ) / ( cumulative primary energy required )
This article reviews 112 wind turbines from 41 different analyses , ranging in publication date from 1977 to 2006 .
This survey shows average EROI for all studies ( operational and conceptual ) of 24.6 ( n=109 ; std. dev=22.3 ) .
The average EROI for just the operational studies is 18.1 ( n=158 ; std. dev=13.7 ) .
This places wind energy in a favorable position relative to conventional power generation technologies in terms of EROI .
Methodological Issues
System Boundary
The choice about system boundaries is perhaps the most important decision made in most net energy analyses .
One of the most critical differences among the diverse studies is the number of stages in the life cycle of an energy system that are assessed and compared against the cumulative lifetime energy output of the system .
These stages include the manufacture of components , transportation of components to the construction site , the construction of the facility itself , operation and maintenance over the lifetime of the facility , overhead , possible grid connection costs , and decommissioning .
Energy systems have external costs as well , most notably environmental and human health costs , although these are difficult to assess in monetary and energy terms .
No study as yet attempted to assess the environmental costs of wind energy in energy terms .
Methodology
Three types of net energy analysis techniques are used to calculate the net energy derived from wind power : process analysis , input - output analysis , and a hybrid analysis .
The assumptions , strengths , and weaknesses of these approaches are discussed here .
Operating Characteristics
Many analyses must make important assumptions regarding the operating characteristics of wind turbines .
These include power rating , assumed lifetime , and capacity factors .
Changes in the assumptions made about these factors , or deviations in actual operating conditions from assumed conditions can have a significant impact on results .
Conceptual versus Empirical Studies
Some studies use the theoretical or ideal operating characteristics of a wind turbine that are derived from simulated or assumed costs and operating conditions , e.g. , a wind turbine of a given power rating , costing a certain dollar amount , in a location with an assumed wind power density , with an assumed capacity factor , and so on .
Of course , actual operating conditions always deviate from assumed conditions .
Empirical analyses rely on actual costs , operating conditions , and energy outputs , and thus provide a better metric of an energy system 's contribution to a nation 's energy supply .
This article focuses primarily on empirical studies based on actual operational data .
Results
The above table provides the detailed technical results of the wind studies .
The data include the year and location of the study , key technical assumptions such as load factor , power rating and lifetime , system boundaries , the type of net energy method used , and the EROI .
The table also distinguishes between studies based on actual performance of a wind system and conceptual studies based on theory or simulations .
The average EROI for all studies ( operational and conceptual ) is 24.6 ( n=109 ; std. dev=22.3 ) .
The average EROI for just the operational studies is 18.1 ( n=158 ; std. dev=13.7 ) .
Discussion
EROI and Turbine Size
One of the striking features of the studies is that the EROI generally increases with the power rating of the turbine ( Figure 2 ) .
This is probably due to several reasons : first , smaller wind turbines represent older , less efficient technologies .
The new turbines in the megawatt ( MW ) range embody many important technical advances that improve the overall effectiveness of energy conversion .
Although larger turbines require greater initial energy investments in materials , the increase in power output more than compensates for this .
Figure 2 : EROI vs. wind turbine power rating .
Second , larger turbines have a greater rotor diameter , which determines its swept area , which probably is the single most important determinant of a turbine 's potential to generate power .
A turbine with respectable power rating but a rotor diameter so small that it can't capture that power until the wind speed reaches very high velocities will not produce a reasonable annual energy output .
Again , larger rotors require greater initial energy investments in materials , but the increase in power output more than compensates for this .
These conclusions are consistent with the finding that commercial wind farms have moved towards larger turbines that are less expensive with regard to installation , operation , and maintenance .
The greater cost efficiency of larger turbines is largely attributed to economies of scale and learning by doing .
Accordingly , under a similar assumption , larger turbines have a greater efficiency in respect to EROI .
Another reason that larger turbines have a larger EROI is the well - known " cube rule " of wind power , i.e. , that the power available from the wind varies as the cube of the wind speed .
Thus , if the wind speed doubles , the power of the wind increases 8 times .
New turbines are taller than earlier technologies , and thus extract energy from the higher winds that exist at greater heights .
Surface roughness -- roughness determined mainly by the height and type of vegetation and buildings -- reduces wind velocity near the surface .
Over flat , open terrain in particular , the wind speed increases relatively fast with height .
Influence of Production Country
EROI is affected by the location of a turbine 's manufacture and installation .
An anaysis of the EROI of conceptual wind turbines produced and operated in Germany and Brazil shows a range of 5 to 40:1 .
Such a large range in wind turbine EROIs is a function of differences in the energy used for transportation of manufactured turbines between countries , the countries ' economic and energy structure , and recycling policies .
Production and operation of an E - 40 turbine , standing 44 meters high in a coastal region in Germany requires approximately 1.39 times more energy , or 3.9 times more input energy per kWh of output energy , than the production and operation of the same turbine in Brazil .
This assumes that Brazil 's conversion efficiency in the electricity generation system being above 90 % is the main reason for the difference in energy inputs , showing that the production scenario has a greater influence upon the magnitude of input energy than site conditions or transportation .
Comparison with other power systems
The EROI for wind turbines compares favorably with other power generation systems ( Figure 3 ) .
Baseload coal - fired power generation has an EROI between 5 and 10:1 .
Nuclear power is probably no greater than 5:1 , although there is considerable debate regarding how to calculate its EROI .
The EROI for hydropower probably exceed 10 , but in most places in the world the most favorable sites have been developed .
Figure 3 : EROI of various electric power generators .
Challenges facing wind energy
Does the high EROI for wind power presented here guarantee that wind will assume a major role in the world 's power generation system ?
There are a number of issues surrounding wind energy that require resolution before that happens .
The dramatic cost reductions in the manufacture of new wind turbines that characterized the past two decades may be slowing .
Part of the slowing may be due to transient factors such as short - term increases in raw material prices ; unfavorable exchange rates ; insufficient global and domestic manufacturing capability ( exacerbated by short - term uncertainty in government subsidy policies ) ; and exercise of market power by the consolidating manufacturing industry .
It also is possible that the industry is experiencing diminishing returns to cost reductions via learning - by - doing .
The uncontrolled , intermittent nature of wind reduces its value relative to operator - controlled resources such as coal , gas , or nuclear generation .
Intermittency impacts include the seasonal and diurnal match or mis-match to regional energy demands ; the contribution of wind energy to capacity reserves for meeting regional reliability requirements ; and the lost value to wind plant owners in surplus generation that occurs when wind power saturates the flexible dispatch portion of grid operations .
Wind energy also affects the overall reliability of the electric power system , which is represented in part by the system reserve margin -- that is , a margin of total installed capacity above projected peak load .
The capacity credit of an isolated wind plant is generally equal to its capacity factor during the system 's peak load period , which normally is less than an operator - controlled source .
As more wind capacity is added to a system within a finite geographic area , it becomes increasingly likely that an " outage " at any given facility will be temporally correlated with an " outage " at a nearby ( or even not - so nearby ) plant .
This tends to reduce the average capacity credit for a wind plant as more such facilities are added in a region .
Much of the wind resource base is located in remote locations , so there are costs of getting the wind from the local point - of - generation to a potentially distant load center .
This cost is distinct from the cost of simply interconnecting the site to the nearest transmission line .
Even at the relatively low current levels of wind penetration on regional grids , long - distance transmission has already proven to be a significant issue for new wind development in some regions .
For example , wind plants in Texas have had to curtail output during hours when regional trunk lines are at physical capacity , and Minnesota and California are currently examining ways to alleviate transmission congestion as more development is proposed in their best wind resource areas .
These costs are not reflected in most EROI analyses .
The remoteness of the wind resource base also generates the cost of developing land with difficult terrain or that which is increasingly removed from development infrastructure ( such as major roads , rivers , or rails capable of transporting the bulky and heavy construction equipment ) .
To the extent that local roads or bridges cannot accommodate blade shipments in excess of 50 meters ( over 160 feet ) length or nacelle shipments of 50 tons or more , they must be upgraded , rebuilt , or ( retroactively ) repaired as a part of the plant development process .
Little is known about the extent of these costs .
At about 6 or 7 megawatts per square kilometer of net power potential , wind plants are necessarily spread - out over a significant land area .
Thus , wind plants must compete with alternative uses of these land resources .
In some cases such as agricultural land , multiple simultaneous use is possible .
In other cases the competition is stiff .
The value of some lands for other types of development ( such as urban or housing development ) has limited and will limit wind power location options .
This is especially true when the land is a signficant source of aesthetic and / or recreational value .
Another issue confronting wind energy is the uncertainty of future government subsidies .
Much of the recent growth on wind energy around the world has been made possible by government subsidies such as the wind energy Production Tax Credit ( PTC ) in the United States and feed - in tariffs and renewable portfolio standards in Europe .
While there is strong support in many nations for such support , shifting political winds can create uncertainty for manufacturers and utilities .
For example , the wind PTC in the United States was scheduled to expire on December 31 , 2005 , but was extended to December 31 , 2007 by a federal energy bill .
The PTC provides a 1.9 cent - per - kilowatt - hour ( kWh ) tax credit for electricity generated with wind turbines over the first ten years of a project 's operations , and is a critical factor in financing new wind farms .
The inconsistent nature of this tax credit has been a significant challenge for the wind industry , creating uncertainty for long - term planning and preventing faster market development .
There is also concern about the impacts of wind energy on birds and bats .
Early research on the avian impacts of wind energy at places such as Altamont Pass , California , suggested that the wind turbines killed significant numbers of raptors and other birds .
In 2004 , a large number of bats were killed by a wind farm in West Virginia .
The issues surrounding avian and bat mortality have just begun to be studied , so the full potential risk is largely unknown .

This series of essays on the construction , deployment and use of search technology ( by which I mean primarily “ full - text ” search ) was written between June and December of 2003 .
It has fifteen instalments not including this table of contents .
This may be a weblog , but the following are not in reverse chronological order , they ’re in the order I wrote ’em , which I suspect is the right order to read ’em .
Backgrounder ·
This is the first of a series on search , by which I mean full - text search .
Anyone who uses computers now uses search pretty well every day , so this is an important chunk of our technology spectrum .
This piece covers the business and history angles ; future instalments will explain how search engines work and the interfaces to them .
I plan to conclude with a description of the next search engine , which does n’t exist yet but someone ought to start building .
The Users · Herewith Chapter Two of the search travelogue .
Between late 1994 and early 1996 I was occupied full - time and then some building and running one of the first Web search engines , the long - departed Open Text Index .
There were n’t many million - hits - a - day sites back then .
When you ’re running that kind of thing , you spend a lot of time watching your logs to figure out what your users are doing and what makes them happy .
There are two lessons that loom larger than all the others put together .
Basic Basics ·
In this ongoing safari through the Search hinterland , I had thought next to talk about popular features of search engines and their costs and benefits and so on .
But I think that everything else I want to cover will be easier if there ’s a shared view of the machinery making it all go .
So here is a tour through the basics of search - engine engineering .
Precision and Recall · Searching is a branch of computer programming , which is supposed to be a quantitative discipline and a member of the engineering family .
That means we should have metrics : measures of how good our search techniques are .
Otherwise , how can we ever measure improvements in one system or the differences between two systems ?
“ Precision ” and “ recall ” are the most common measures of search performance .
But they ’re not as helpful as we ’d like .
Intelligence ·
Here ’s the problem : searching for words is n’t really what you want to do .
You ’d like to search for ideas , for concepts , for solutions , for answers .
Instead , your typical search engine moronically sorts through its postings , and tries to solve your problems by looking at which words appear where , and how often , and so on .
What we ’d really like is an intelligent search engine .
This essay is mostly about why we ’re not likely to get one any time soon .
Squirmy Words ·
In this , the sixth instalment of my search saga , a survey of the fuzzy edges of words and their meanings and the ( surprisingly moderate ) consequences for search systems .
UI Archeology ·
This chapter of the On Search saga is a side - trip ; a look at an unusual search user interface I built a dozen years ago .
One of the reasons it did n’t catch on back then was that there was n’t enough XML in the world .
Now that there is , maybe this bit of legacy code will provoke an idea or two .
Just maybe , it contains some ideas that will be useful to the folk who are wondering how to make the power of XPath and XQuery useful to ordinary people .
Stopwords · Here ’s a Google search for a famous phrase , to be or not to be ; give it a try and see what happens .
When you look at word frequencies , it appears that there are a few words that appear unreasonably often and carry unreasonably little information .
They are called “ stopwords , “ and this ( brief ) eighth bead in the On Search necklace considers them .
Metadata ·
In the Web ’s early years , the overwhelming favorite among search engines was Yahoo .
Today it ’s Google .
Neither has actually had better text search technology than the competition .
They won because they used metadata effectively to make their services more useful .
In this ninth On Search , a survey of what metadata is , where it comes from , and how to use it .
I18n · The “ On Search ” series resumes with this look at the issues that arise in search when ( as you must ) you deal with words from around the worlds written in the characters that the people around the world use .
I18n stands for “ internationalization . ”
Result Ranking ·
If you ’re searching a big database , unless you ’re lucky you ’re usually going to get a lot more matches to any given query than you want to look through .
So it really matters what order that result list is in .
Google got to be famous in large part because they do a good job on this ; the stuff near the top of their list is usually about what you want , and if you do n’t see what you need near the top of the list , it may not be out there .
Herewith some remarks on how to go about sorting result lists .
In general , the news is not very good ; however , there are some promising techniques that are under -explored .
Interfaces · Herewith an investigation of how search software ought to interact with the outside world .
I ’ll start with a look at the current state of the art , and propose another ( I think better ) approach .
This is , I think , the third - last On Search piece , so a few words at the meta level about that .
XML · Searching is all about text , and the proportion of all the world ’s text that is XML keeps getting higher and higher .
So if you ’re going to do search , at some point you ’re going to have to think about searching XML .
Herewith a survey of some of the issues and problems ( which , like other essays as we approach the end of On Search , contains opinions among the reportage ) .
Robots · Robots — also known as spiders — are programs that retrieve Web resources , using the embedded hyperlinks to automate the process .
Robots retrieve data for all sorts of purposes , but they were invented mostly to drive search engines .
Herewith a tour through Robot Village .
Intel CPUを搭載し たMacでWindows XPの起動を可能にするツールが登場した。といっても「 Windows XP on an Intel Mac」プロジェクト の 「 XOM 」 のことではなく、リリースしたのは本 家Apple Computer（以下 、Apple）。この「 Boot Camp」はまだβ版だが、いずれ正式に次期Mac OS X“ Leopard ” に付属するとなれば期待してしまう。さっそくこれを使ってみたので速報という形で紹介しよう。
まずは必要なものを用意する
まず今回の試用で必要なもの列挙する。
Intel CPUを搭載したMacintosh。ここでは1.83GHz
Intel Core Duo搭載の17インチiMac（MA199J/A）を使用した。
Mac OS X v10.4.6。まだアップデートしていない場合には「ソフトウェアアップデート」を使う。
Boot Campソフトウェア。公式サイトからダウンロード。
ファームウェアアップデータ。ここから、使用する機種にあったものをダウンロードしておく。
内蔵HDDドライブに5Gバイト以上の空き容量。今のところ外付けHDDドライブなどにはインストールできない。
ブラン クCD1枚。ドライバディスクに使う。
できればプリンタ。作業方法のドキュメントを印刷しておかないと、作業中はMacで見ることができない。ほかにマシンがあるならそれを使ってもいい。
Microsoft Windows XP SP2のインストールCD（*1）。HomeでもProfessionalでもOK。ここではProfessionalを使った。
インストールか らWindows XP 起動までの手順
1.Boot Campのインストール
ダウンロードし たBoot Campソフトウェアのイメージファイルをマウントさせると、その中身は下の画面のようになっている。すでにちゃんと日本語化されているのだ。この「インストールの前にお読みください.app」がインストールの手順書になる。可能ならプリントアウトしておこう。
ここから「BootCampAssistant.pkg」をダブルクリックすると「 Boot Campアシスタント 」 が「ユーティリティ」フォルダにインストールされる。でも、筆者の場合インストールされたアシスタントを起動すると次のエラーが出てしまった。
2.ファームウェアアップデート
そこで、ファームウェアアップデートをかけることになる。これは、ダウンロードしてインストールすると、確認後アップデートツールが起動して書き換えの準備まで一気にしてくれる。あとは画面の指示に従ってシャットダウンした後、電源スイッチを押しっぱなしで起動させると、いかにも書き換えていますというプログレスバーの画面になる。書き換えが終わると自動的に再起動する。
3.Boot Campアシスタントの実行
ファームウェアが新しくなったら今度は「 Boot Campアシスタント」はちゃんと起動する。うまく起動すれば最初の画面に続いてこの画面になる。
ここで行うの はWindows XPをインストールした後で必要になるMacintoshのハードウェア用ドライバディスク「
Macintosh Dreivers CD 」の作成だ。 「 すぐに作成」を選んで、空のCD-Rをドライブに入れて「続行」を押すとディスクが作成される。作られたCDはもちろんISO9660（Joliet）フォーマットだ。
4.インストール用のパーティションの作成
次はパーティションの作成を行う。
このアシスタントでは、HDDの内容を保持したままでパーティションを切り直すことができる。ただし、内蔵HDDにしか使えないし、すでにパーティションが切ってあるものにも使えない。筆者の場合その点は大丈夫だったのだけどその次ではまった。「パーティション作成」をクリックすると下のエラーがでてしまうのだ。
これはその人の環境によるところのようで、ほかにインストールした人の話を聞くとたいていは問題なく先に進めるようだ。かなり悔しい。
動かせないファイルっていうのは多分swapfileなんだろうと勝手に思って、ターミナルを叩いてswapfileを作り直させたりしたのだけど、だめだった。仕方がないのでディスクの内容をバックアップし、再フォーマットしてリストア。もちろん、こういう危ないツールのβ版を使うときには、まずバックアップをとっておくというのが鉄則なのだ。さぼりそうになったのでちょうどいい（でもこの作業に3時間くらい費やしてしまった）。
リストア後は問題なく切り分けられた。なお、Windows XP用のパーティションサイズはデフォルトでは5Gバイトなのだけど、これではちょっと窮屈だ。分割線を左にドラッグしてすこし容量を増やしておいた方がいいだろう。筆者は10Gバイトにしてみた。切り分けが終わると下の画面になる（*2）。
* 1SP2以前のインストールCDしかない場合にはこの方法（WinFAQ）でSP2適用済みのCDを作ることができる。ただしこの作業にはすでにWindowsが起動しているマシンが必要だ。
* 2「 Boot Campアシスタント」では、切ったパーティションを元に戻すこともできる。この場合Windowsパーティションの内容は失われる。

The Graffiti Research Lab has officially renamed The Verizon Communications Corporation in a ceremony supervised by the U.S. Department of Homeland Graffiti to celebrate the July 9th FISA Legislation granting telecommunication companies retroactive immunity from legal action in cases of warrantless and unconstitutional wiretapping .
Under its new name , The National Security Administration , the behemoth telecom will enjoy a greater degree of freedom from assault by litigious U.S. citizens when breaking the law and capitulating to the Bush administration .
Thank god for liberal senators like Barack Obama who are looking out for the little guys like AT&T , BellSouth and other major telecom companies .
When asked about the FISA provision , NSA / Verizon chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg , said , “ This is a big new step for our company and our investors . ”
He continued , “ Now we ARE the government , so fuck you … try to stop us !
Mwahaha ! ”

WIGGLY LINES
DAVID LANCE GOINES
1986
THE designer is , in effect , setting tasks for other people .
If the designs are good , the tasks will be performed correctly .
If the tasks are presented improperly , they will be performed poorly , not at all , or quite differently from what may have been the original intent .
People are rather lazy and tend to do things in the simplest way , rather than the most complicated or difficult .
This quality should not always be catered to , but it is necessary to accept its influence on action and thought .
The eye is lazy , doing the least amount of work necessary to attain a given end , and if the work is too difficult , it might not get done at all .
The designer should , so far from placing stumbling blocks in the path of the eye , make its task as easy and pleasant as possible , so that his work will be effective .
What is easier to look at will be looked at in preference to something that is harder to look at .
Images are perceived at boundaries and vertexes ( vertexes are where boundaries meet ) .
Boundaries and vertexes are where the chromatic data change , and the ratios of reflectance are measured by the receptors in the eye .
If you stare fixedly at a regular image , such as a piece of graph paper , you will notice that some of the lines begin to disappear .
This is an example of the phenomenon of stabilized images on the retina .
If an image is held steady on the retina , it vanishes , to be replaced by a peculiar feeling of blindness called the " empty field . "
The vanishing is due mainly to the fact that each cone in the eye adjusts itself to the light on it .
Receptors are designed to signal to the brain only change , not a steady state .
1
Vision is good as long as the eye or the image moves about .
When the eye rests , vision deteriorates .
You have no doubt observed that motion makes things that are otherwise invisible highly noticeable , especially out of the corners of your eyes , or in poor light .
This demonstrates that boundary and vertex information is crucial for seeing .
The eye or image must move so that individual receptors can experience boundary crossings .
Obviously , if the number of boundaries and vertexes is increased , the visibility of an image increases proportionately .
Consider two pieces of string laid out to span a given distance .
One is nearly straight and the other wiggly .
Neither is a straight line , but each implies a delineation or series of boundaries .
In string number one , the minimum clean line is represented , and in number two , a rough line .
It is plain that in line number two there is more string ; more to look at .
Given a choice between a rough line and a clean one , the former is to be preferred .
Since there is more of it , it is easier to see .
A hard , sharp line is also a hard , sharp contrast ; a sort of visual barrier where the eye might be inclined to stop , rather than continue .
A rough line eases the transition from one area to another .
People are more likely to climb stairs than to scale walls .
Some typefaces are easier to read than others .
The concept of rough and clean lines can be useful in evaluating legibility .
Serif type is easier to read than sans - serif .
Extra information is provided by the serif , and its horizontal thrust improves legibility .
Caslon can be read quickly , with high comprehension , for long periods of time .
The vertical emphasis of a sans - serif face impedes legibility .
Helvetica gives you a headache .
Things set in Caslon get read , things set in Helvetica get looked at .
The blackletter of Gutenberg 's 42 - line Bible set a precedent for German type design which persisted well into the twentieth century .
Fraktur and Schwabacher types are gratuitously hard to read .
They have a pronounced vertical emphasis , and hordes of little spiky doo - dads poking out of every nook and cranny .
A page set in blackletter is a formidable barrier to legibility .
The signal to noise ratio is just too low .
These faces persisted in Germany , the birthplace of the Bauhaus , for so long after they had been rejected everywhere else , that one is inclined to become suspicious .
Reading is made so difficult that , although people certainly can read , they might choose not to do so .
It could be said that German type design created a literate but non-reading public .
German typography encouraged the populace to let scholars do the reading and politicians do the thinking .
People who can read but do n't , and in consequence can think but do n't , might find themselves kindly disposed toward the kind of state that calls itself a National Socialist Republic , but is n't .
The avant - garde of German design rejected the old - fashioned bramble thicket of blackletter and set out to create new typefaces .
The faces designed in the 1920s by the Bauhaus and related schools are the sans - serifs that we have come to associate with modernity and progress .
They are plain and severe , of apparent uniform weight , and without extraneous details such as serifs .
It might be thought that these new designs are as far from the dark medieval types of Gutenberg as one could possibly get , but , as far as the appearance of the page and levels of legibility and comprehension go , they are exactly the same , if not worse .
Instead of spikes and curlicues , they have hard sharp corners .
The vertical emphasis is even greater than that of blackletter .
The horizontal emphasis provided by the serif , which improves legibility , is missing .
There is less differentiation between letters than in a serif face , and within the letters themselves , there is less differentiation of the top half from the bottom half .
These letters are not called " Gothic " for nothing , you know .
It appears that the thornbush of blackletter has been exchanged for the much more modern barbed - wire entanglement of sans - serif .
In mitigation of these criticisms , it may be true that a reader , born and raised with a given range of typefaces , will find them comfortably legible .
That another reader , unfamiliar with those faces , might find them bizarre and illegible , is not necessarily a valid complaint .
It would be difficult to put this to a test , as blackletter has completely gone out of fashion and there are likely few or no readers nurtured entirely on sans - serif .
Despite this possibility , it remains true that , all things being equal , legibility and comprehension are greater in text set in conservative old - style or transitional faces , than in text set in the most handsome sans - serif .
Even the modern calligraphic faces of Herman Zapf err in the same directions as their equally calligraphic blackletter grandparents , and are neither as legible nor as suitable for extended reading as the Italianate Romans .
The calligraphic influence on modern type design shows the desire of calligraphers for rhythm and uniformity , sacrificing legibility in the process of seeking over much uniformity .
The letters of Caslon are irregular : comparing the ascenders , descenders and finals of letters one sees that they are all different .
In Stone , Lutecia or any of Zapf 's faces , these elements are uniform .
Legibility suffers , but the page looks nice .
In designs dependent on hard , sharp contrasts , the slightest imperfection is annoying and obvious .
With rough lines , imperfection , wear and dirt are less noticeable , often not bothersome , and occasionally enhancing .
Helvetica is continually struggling toward self - sabotage , and is occasionally thwarted by expert craftsmen .
Usually , however , it gracelessly succeeds .
The handcut Caslon of Benjamin Franklin 's time received so much hard wear that it would have been sent to the hell box with pleasure by the printers who used it , but they had nothing else .
These pages retain a charm and legibility , nonetheless , that has an undeniable appeal .
By contrast , improperly printed Helvetica , particularly in the smaller sizes , is simply unreadable .
Those same elements that make a typeface pleasant to look at and easy to read , apply as well to architecture .
The heavy , intricate detail of carpenter Gothic and Victorian buildings is a rough line .
The mass of detail resolves at a slight distance into an interesting , soft transition from one element to the next .
One difference between a nice neighborhood and a depressing row of dwelling units , is street trees .
Trees soften and break up the otherwise sterile line of roads and buildings .
The straight line of artifact is modified by the rough line of nature .
A feeling of warmth and intimacy is created by a rough texture or line .
A hard , perfect surface or line feels cold and remote .
The more intimate with , or closer one is to the manufacture ( either theoretically , as in buying a handmade item , or psychologically , if one knows who made it and how ) , the better one likes it .
The more distant , either in sensation or in reality , the less one is inclined to like it .
The smooth , featureless , white wall does not appear to change as it is approached .
No new detail is resolved , and a sense of scale is hard to get .
A brick wall , wood shingle house or carpenter gothic house resolves into intricate detail as it is approached , giving the viewer a sense of scale .
The sense of proportion is distorted by uniformity .
The uniformity provided by corporate structures , faceless gigantic buildings , and the anonymity of Helvetica , can also remove a sense of scale from the viewer .
Dirt , wear and imperfection add more information to both the smooth , white wall and the rough , intricate wall .
These forces of time and humanity , disregarded by the Bauhaus , must be considered in the real world .
Things that do n't have to be perfect to look good , look good longer .
Things that are dependent upon perfection are offensive when imperfect .
People stand in awe of smooth , featureless perfection , but it worries them and makes them feel inferior , as if it is throwing their humanity at them like a sneer , and demanding that they wash their hands before approaching ( which indeed they must , if the perfection is to remain untarnished ) .
Sometimes a smooth white wall gets humanized anyway , and then it looks tacky .
In a rough line , such as a brick wall , there is more information , it shows the dirt less , and it is prettier .
A modern typeface or building , committed to being unlike anything old - fashioned , bears an uneasy relation to the future .
It can not afford to grow old at all , let alone grow old gracefully .
Its very newness is its trump card , and often this precludes design which foresees aging well .
Thus we see typefaces , furniture , buildings and clothing fashions which have no chance to wear out or show the dirt , as their design is so extreme that they become ludicrous and dated in months or a few years .
Extreme clothing fashions change frequently and at small expense ( and large pleasure ) to the wearer .
An unfashionable " yesterday 's newspaper " building or typeface cannot be so casually discarded .
Intense contrasts are harder on the eye than soft transitions .
Type printed by photo - offset lithography is completely flat on the page , whereas type printed by letterpress is indented , with a little ridge of ink squeezed out around it , making a slight shadow around the letter .
An offset page looks flat and dull in comparison to a letterpress page , and the harsher contrast between paper and type is more tiring to the eye .
The pleasant , slightly sculptured feeling of a letterpress page also enhances the pleasure of reading .
Bright primary colors are immediately captivating , but as they lack complexity or subtlety , they soon grow wearisome and irritating .
A bright color is like a loud automobile horn or an explosion .
It quickly captures the interest , but if sustained is unbearable .
To imagine that a huge wall or corridor painted in a primary color is modern or in the spirit of the twentieth century because it is simple and plain and pares away inessentials , is to live in the fevered dreams of a lunatic .
Tertiary colors are like complex chords , rather than the pure note of the primary or the simple harmony of the secondary .
The complex harmonics have a lesser immediate impact , but can be pleasing for long intervals .
Small children are allegedly unable to distinguish subtle shades of color .
As they learn and mature , greater complexity becomes intelligible and attractive .
The use of harsh primaries and secondaries is calculated to appeal to the childlike aspect , rather than to the adult , or to the primitive , rather than the sophisticated and civilized .
2
Whenever reasonable , complementary colors should be employed , as they satisfy the eye .
The eye demands the complement .
When you see a red square , and look fixedly at it and then away , you will see a square , green afterimage .
This goes on within the eye continually ; everything has an afterimage .
Providing the complement satisfies a sub-visual demand and makes things more pleasant , that is , easier to look at .
Important information should shout .
Information that is not so immediate , nor of interest to everyone , should be more calmly presented .
Most design should be rather quiet , if only out of consideration for others .
The designer should be a good neighbor .
She should not throw wild parties on week nights , he should not play his stereo too loudly or too late in the evening .
He should mow his lawn , and she should design things that enhance the community , rather than diminish it .
He should not design crummy things that everybody else gets stuck with .
A design that is easier to look at than others , will be more successful than its competition .
A loud , harsh design will get attention first , but the design that is easiest to live with will be looked at more often and for a longer time .
Posters , signs , and billboards are usually designed up close , and viewed from a distance .
If they are designed full size or larger , design decisions will be made on the basis of head motions rather than small eye movements .
When the image is seen at viewing distance , as opposed to working distance , it may look imbalanced or clumsy .
If the design is done at working distance , but at viewing size , this problem will not arise .
The work will be more harmonious and intelligible , having neither excessive detail that turns into mud nor lines that are weak .
Here is a rule of thumb .
One and one half inches sketch height at a working distance of eighteen inches , equals two feet of finished poster height at a viewing distance of 25 feet .
Thus a design sketch of one and one half inches height will lead to a clear , easily understood poster or sign , two feet tall at 25 feet distance , four feet tall at 50 feet distance , eight feet tall at 100 feet , and so on .
Billboards are not only viewed at a distance , but at speeds of 25 to 60 miles an hour .
Therefore , they must be even simpler and clearer .
Eye motion must be kept to an absolute minimum , not only to make the design work , but to prevent the motorist from looking too long at the billboard and not looking at the road .
It 's a good way to lose customers - permanently .
If an element can not be incorporated into the small sketch , then it should n't go in , as it will turn to mud at thirty feet .
Obviously , designs should never be reduced , as that weakens the line and destroys the ratio of figure to ground .
Although reduction sharpens things up and hides irregularities , sharpness and regularity are not intrinsically good or desirable , whereas balance and intelligibility are .
People like intricacy , complexity , and variety .
The completely - finished , perfect thing has no room in it for the " me . "
It is a flat statement admitting no further discussion ; it is rude ; it makes people angry .
There are three participants in every event , no one of which is more important than the others , and all of which must have equal weight for that thing to be endurable : the designer , the thing itself , and the audience .
Designs meant to be looked at for prolonged stretches should be strong , to capture the eye ; have subtle colors and soft contrasts to prevent the eye from tiring ; and have interesting elements to look at and think about .
Leave room in the design for the user , viewer , or listener .
The audience is as important as the performer .

(2) Jorge Frascara in his article " The ABC's of Teaching Aids , " discusses his intrigue with children 's preferences for illustration styles .
He organized a test that involved the preparation of four pairs of illustrations .
The subject was a giraffe and a calf in front of a tree .
Pair # 1 showed one version with natural colors and the other with intensified colors .
Pair # 2 showed one version with natural forms and the other with simplified and schematic contours .
Pair # 3 presented the object in the same color and shape , but one of the scenes included additional elements such as trees , clouds and two more animals .
Pair # 4 showed one illustration having lights and shades and soft edges while the other had flat surfaces and hard edges .
Over 400 children , aged seven to eleven were used as subjects .
Upon the presentation of each pair , they were asked to indicate which of the two illustrations they liked better .
Children across elementary school levels prefer complex illustrations ( 83 % ) over simple ones .
They also prefer intense colors ( 69 % overall , 76 % excluding eleven - year - old boys , who showed a preference rate of only 31 % ) over natural ones ; natural forms ( 86 % ) over geometrical simplifications ; and shaded drawings with soft edges and atmospheric effects ( 66 % ) over flat surfaces and hard edges .
Only 11 year - old boys preferred natural colors ( 69 % ) and sharp edges ( 56 % ) .
The youngest boys were the least inclined to prefer natural shapes ( 64 % as opposed to 91 % for the rest of the group ) , while the oldest girls were most decidedly in favor of them ( 100 % ) .
Many of the illustrators in the 1950s and 1960s made abstract and simplified illustrations for children 's books since small children tend to paint that way .
But children do not necessarily like what they themselves do and are quite able to recognize and enjoy different levels of skill in the representation of reality .
Complex , realistic illustrations not only attract children , but they also develop their curiosity and perceptual skills .
It is also the case that simple illustrations require less skill and thus are cheaper for the publisher , who is always interested in saving money .

Have you seen this drive ?
The FBI -- you know , the people in charge of your " permanent record " -- is offering up to $ 25,000 for information leading to the return of a missing " Iomega hard drive . "
Apparently , the drive contains personal information on " at least a half - million people . "
It was reported missing from the Birmingham , Alabama Veterans Administration Medical Center where it was used by an employee in medical research to backup data .
That 's right , medical research .
So if you 've seen the drive then by all means , let us know .
We do n't want the reward , we 're just curious about the super - soldier hallucinogens developed by the VA 's hippy chemists back in the late 60 s ... that 's all .

Soldier 's mom digs in near Bush ranch Senator sees ' echoes of Vietnam ' in vigil to meet president SPECIAL REPORT Interactive :
Who 's who in Iraq Interactive : Sectarian divide Timeline : Bloodiest days for civilians Coalition Casualties Special Report YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS George W. Bush Military Iraq or or Create Your Own CRAWFORD , Texas ( CNN ) --
A mother whose son was killed in Iraq says she is prepared to continue her protest outside President Bush 's ranch through August until she is granted an opportunity to speak with him .
Later , in a TV interview , a Democratic senator from California said the episode evokes images that were commonplace during the Vietnam War .
Cindy Sheehan 's 24 - year - old son -- Army Spc. Casey Sheehan of Vacaville , California -- was killed in Baghdad 's Sadr City on April 4 , 2004 .
The Humvee mechanic was one of eight U.S. soldiers killed there that day by rocket - propelled grenades and small arms fire .
( Full story )
They are among the 1,829 American troops , including 31 this month , who have died in Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in March 2003 .
The president -- who is spending a nearly five - week - long working vacation at his Texas ranch -- said in a speech Wednesday that the sacrifices of U.S. troops were " made in a noble cause . "
( Full story ) Sheehan said she found little comfort in his comments .
" I want to ask the president , why did he kill my son ? "
Sheehan told reporters .
" He said my son died in a noble cause , and I want to ask him what that noble cause is . "
Sheehan said hers was one of a group of about 15 families who each met separately with the president one day last June .
" He would n't look at the pictures of Casey .
He did n't even know Casey 's name , " she told CNN Sunday .
" Every time we tried to talk about Casey and how much we missed him , he would change the subject . "
Sheehan said she was so distraught at the time that she failed to ask the questions she now wants answered .
" I want him to honor my son by bringing the troops home immediately , " Sheehan told reporters Saturday .
" I do n't want him to use my son 's name or my name to justify any more killing . "
Sheehan , who co-founded the anti-war group Gold Star Families for Peace , led about 50 demonstrators near the Bush ranch Saturday .
Some protesters were with the group Veterans for Peace , which was holding a convention in Dallas .
The protesters stopped their bus miles from the ranch in Crawford , and walked less than a half - mile before being stopped by local law enforcement officials .
A message on the Gold Star Families Web site says , " We want our loved ones ' sacrifices to be honored by bringing our nation 's sons and daughters home from the travesty that is Iraq IMMEDIATELY , since this war is based on horrendous lies and deceptions .
" Just because our children are dead , why would we want any more families to suffer the same pain and devastation ? "
The message also urges Bush to send his twin daughters , Jenna and Barbara , to Iraq " if the cause is so noble . "
The site says the group is made up of families of soldiers who have died as a result of war , primarily in Iraq .
Joe Hagin , White House deputy chief of staff , and Stephen Hadley , national security adviser , met with Sheehan for about 45 minutes Saturday , according to White House spokesman Trent Duffy .
Sheehan said that the two men " were very respectful . "
" They told me the party line of why we are in Iraq , " she said .
" I told them that I do n't believe that they believed that . "
Duffy said Saturday that " many of the hundreds of families the president has met with know their loved one died for a noble cause and that the best way to honor their sacrifice is to complete the mission . "
Bush has refused to provide a time frame for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq , saying American forces will return home when Iraqis can take care of their own security .
" President Bush wants the troops home as soon as possible , but the U.S. will not cut and run from terrorists , " Duffy said .
Sheehan elicited sympathy from both sides of the political spectrum on Sunday .
" What you 're seeing with that mom trying to meet with President Bush is echoes of Vietnam , " said Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat .
" Because no one is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel . "
" I think the president ought to meet with this mother , " said Sen. George Allen , a Virginia Republican .
" What I would say to her is her son will always be remembered as a great hero and a patriot , advanced freedom in Iraq and the Middle East , has made this country more secure . "
Boxer said her own message would be different : " I would tell her to do everything she could to spare other families this grief , to get us off this cycle of violence . "
Recent surveys have shown decreasing public support for the war .
In a Newsweek poll released Sunday , 64 percent of those asked said they do not believe the war in Iraq has made Americans safer , and 61 percent said they disapprove of the way the president is handling the war .
The telephone poll of 1,004 adults was taken from Tuesday to Thursday last week and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points .

You Don't Love Me Yet by Jonathan Lethem Walls tumbling down
Jonathan Lethem satire blurs the lines of artistic ownership
The February issue of Harper 's Magazine featured an article by novelist Jonathan Lethem titled " The Ecstasy of Influence , " in which he issues a manifesto calling for " open source " culture , based on the share - and - share - alike underpinnings of jazz and the Internet .
He suggests that the very idea of " intellectual property " is preposterous and proposes that art is better suited to a " gift culture " in which creators freely borrow from others works .
" Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master , " he writes .
" That is to say most artists are converted to art by art itself .
...
Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced .
Invention , it must be humbly admitted , does not consist of creating out of void , but out of chaos . "
On his Web site , Lethem has been putting his theory into practice by offering the rights to a handful of his own short stories for a dollar .
It 's a program he calls " the Promiscuous Materials Project . "
In addition , he 's running a contest to give away the film rights to his new novel You Don't Love Me
Yet so long as the winner agrees to return the rights to the public domain after five years .
The new novel itself explores questions of proprietary ownership via a Los Angeles rock band coping with stardom .
First , let 's introduce the band .
Lucinda , bassist , answers phones for a faux " complaint line " that 's part of a performance art experiment run by a former lover .
Lead singer Matthew has kidnapped a kangaroo from the zoo where he works and is hiding it in his small apartment .
Denise , the drummer , is relegated to a dead - end day job at a porn emporium .
Bedwin , the band 's reclusive muse and guitarist , rarely ventures into daylight and instead spends his days compulsively watching Fritz Lang 's Human Desire on his VCR looking for discrete visual clues .
As the novel opens , Lucinda and Matthew have just broken up , threatening to break up the band , which is already struggling to produce a playlist that goes beyond the five clichéd songs the four have already written and played to death .
What initially appears to be a fanciful tale of slacker sex and introspection — the kind of quirky setup seen in a dozen indie comedies — quickly becomes something deeper : a critique of artistic inspiration and ambition .
After Lucinda begins a mystifying phone relationship with a man she calls " the Complainer , " a talker with beguiling tales of romantic misadventures , the band 's fortune changes .
The stories serve as the raw material for a series of new songs — Dirty Yellow Chair , Secret From Yourself and Monster Eyes , the last a likely hit that also provides the band with a name .
The band is invited to play at a highbrow happening .
Dubbed " Aparty , " it has a farcical twist :
The band is expected to play silently while headphone - wearing party goers dance to their Walkmans ( it is the early ' 90s , thus no iPods ) .
Aparty — apart , a party , get it ?
Fortunately , the organizer 's absurd plans are thwarted , and Monster Eyes plays a full - volume set , one that leads to its big break : a chance to showcase its talent on the absurdly named Fancher Autumnbreast 's radio show , a local music kingmaker who has launched numerous careers and appears based on the real - life Nic Harcourt , a famous DJ on Los Angeles ' KCRW .
But here 's the dilemma :
The songs technically do n't belong to the band , since they originated with the Complainer 's calls .
Carl —
Lucinda discovers the Complainer 's real name after impulsively becoming his lover — is upset and demands to become part of the band , which throws the quartet into disarray .
This somewhat absurdist plot is Lethem 's way of illustrating his theory that art is not created in a vacuum , that it does not arise sui generis from its creator .
Besides embodying an agenda , the novel offers real pleasure , particularly in the witty way Lethem depicts the milieu of the L.A. art / rock scene : a gaggle of aging record producers are " unyouthful men in youthful clothes " ; a local alternative weekly is titled " The Echo Park Annoyance " ; perhaps best of all , he proffers a number of clever , hipster coinages , such as " Astronaut Food " as a metaphor for the meager sustenance one gets from an unfulfilling relationship .
In this lovely sentence he describes a middle - aged man 's body hair : " His hair , white at his throat , darkened below the curve of his stomach , as though night 's setting had recorded itself across the field of his body . "
The book 's jacket may feature a stern - looking Lethem posing with a guitar — the very picture of artistic ennui — and promise " a romantic farce . "
But this slick , entertaining novel offers a relationship with the writer and his characters far more satisfying and serious than mere " Astronaut Food . "
Edward Nawotka is a Houston - based freelance writer and books columnist for Bloomberg News .
DIMSDRIVE performed internet - based research involving 5,274 people in September of last year to find out which country ’s citizens would people most want to marry .
It is not stated whether or not the people interviewed were single or not .
The Asia versus the West split is quite noticeable in the men , but really striking amongst the women .
I previously translated statistics regarding international marriages in Japan that shows that the ideals being expressed here do not seem to be realised .
On a slight tangent , I watched the last episode of an NHK English learning program which features an English - speaking Western blonde angel that prods a clueless office worker along the path to success at her job getting a date with her transferred from New York colleague , the ideal tall , muscular , tanned , well - coiffured white executive .
The angel ’s job was done because the glaikit Misaki finally pulled her man .

Q : Other than Japanese , which country ’s people do you think would be good to have as a partner ( husband or wife ) ?

However for women there is a marked difference ; about 74 % in total choose the West ( over 40 % for the USA alone ) versus a mere 7.4 % for the East , a massive ten to one vote for Europe and the USA .
Next , looking at the detailed age breakdown , it ’s only in the teenage girls group that the USA fails to top the charts , losing out to France and Korea , and equal with the UK .
For men in their twenties , American women are preferred over the second - placed Korean women by almost 60 % , and the Chinese are back in fifth , gaining just over a third of the number of votes of the USA .
However , the older men get , the stronger the charms of the Asian neighbours become , with the gap at its smallest being just a mere three votes .
Similarly , for men in their forties and over , Chinese women cut the gap from a third to about a half of the USA score .
For women , as they get older ( ignoring the over sixty bracket which has a very small sample size , so may be rather inaccurate ) the attraction to American men only get stronger ; in their twenties , Americans get just under a quarter of the vote , but by their fifties , it surpasses three in ten .
Despite the charms of the disturbingly Harry Potter - like Bae Yong Joon Korean men do not seem to be particularly favoured by the middle - aged demographic .
These two main trends noted above are perhaps reflections on Japanese society as much as on foreign stereotypes .
The younger men hold images of themselves as charming the sophisticated Western woman , but as they age ( and visit dodgy hostess bars … ) they come to realise that perhaps only Asian women could accept their typical Japanese behaviour .
For women , after having been around Japanese men for many , many years , they too may come to realise that the Western stereotypes of politeness and chivalry are the only things that could satisty them in marriage .

The pet food company that recalled 60 million cans of contaminated dog and cat food repeatedly made harassing phone calls to pet owners who had lawyers and said they did n't want to talk , even after a judge ordered the firm to leave them alone , court records show .
Lawyers from six firms representing clients who claim their pets were harmed by Menu 's pet food asked a federal judge in New Jersey Wednesday to stop Menu from " bullying " people who had called the company since the recall was announced March 16 , according to their court filing .
U.S. District Judge Noel Hillman in Camden , N.J. , agreed with the plaintiffs , describing the calls as " aggressive , " according to a transcript of the hearing obtained by USA TODAY .
" It 's one thing for two people to sit down at the table and voluntarily agree to settle their case .
It 's another thing to harass people on weekends through automated phone calls , " Hillman said to Edward Ruff of Pretzel & Stouffer , Menu 's lawyer .
Hillman ordered Menu Foods to have no contact with anyone who believes their animal was injured by its product unless a lawyer representing them is involved .
Ontario , Canada - based Menu Foods has hired Crawford & Co. , an insurance adjustor in Atlanta , to contact pet owners who called the company to report animal illnesses or deaths , according to the hearing transcript .
At a previous hearing on Friday , May 18 , the judge had cautioned Menu and Crawford that they should not contact people who had joined one of the lawsuits against the company .
Legally , Menu cannot contact those plaintiffs directly but must go through their lawyers .
But in affidavits presented in court Wednesday , pet owners said they received calls that weekend from Crawford representatives who pressed them to answer questions even after being told the owners had hired lawyers .
In some cases , the pet owners also received multiple calls from Crawford 's computerized phone banks after telling representatives they were represented by attorneys , according to the affidavits .
" Menu 's representatives asked owners to sign releases which waived their right to get advice from a lawyer , " said attorney Jay Edelson in an interview .
His Chicago - based firm Blim & Edelson represents more than 600 pet owners .
" It appears that the company was engaging in a cynical strategy , designed to settle some of the strongest claims cheaply and induce pet owners to give up information it might be able to use to defend against others , " Blim & Edelson said in a letter Friday that was sent to clients and posted on Internet blogs for pet owners .
Ruff said in court that he told his clients about the judge 's instruction after the May 18 hearing , but because it was the start of a holiday weekend — May 21 was Victoria Day in Canada — the message may not have been fully communicated , according to the transcript .
Hillman was unyielding .
" It seems to me that Menu Food is out to do whatever Menu Foods wants to do in a way that could adversely impact the rights of possible members of the class action suit , " he said , according to the transcript .
Calls to Ruff 's office seeking comment Friday were not returned .
Operators at Crawford directed USA TODAY to call back Tuesday after the holiday .
Menu posted a notice on its website after the hearing , saying it could not have direct contact with individual pet owners " for the time being " because of the court order .
" In light of the order , we regret that we cannot communicate with you at this time .
As soon as the court permits , we intend to resume efforts to resolve claims directly with pet owners .
We will post additional information when we are able , " the notice says .
Since mid-March , Menu has recalled wet pet food products sold under more than 100 brand names , including Procter & Gamble 's Iams and Wal - Mart's Ol ' Roy .
The Food and Drug Administration has linked the contamination to wheat flour imported from China that was tainted with the industrial chemical melamine .
The FDA 's investigation also has revealed melamine - tainted wheat flour was mixed into pet foods made by other companies , and animal feed and fish feed .
Although the FDA has not provided an official count of pet deaths associated with the recall , it has said unconfirmed reports received from pet owners total more than 4,000 deaths .
Menu is facing dozens of lawsuits stemming from the recall .
This week a federal multi-district litigation panel will meet in Las Vegas to determine which district court will hear the cases against Menu .
The panel is expected to announce a decision by mid-summer .

This morning , I found out that thousands of dollars of charges had been made on two of my credit cards in the past two days .
Now , the identity thieves are sitting in jail .
This is how it happened .
It involves identity theft , a careless thief , one pissed - off Ovid and lots of luck .
I mentioned earlier that it took me less than an hour to find them , but it really depends on when you start counting .
Maybe two hours is more accurate .
Eh , who cares ?
They 're caught .
And where I have times listed , these are the times pulled off of my cell phone .
8:02 AM .
I get a call on my cell phone from a number I do n't recognize , but I did n't get to the phone in time .
Calling back gives me a recorded message informing me that " the subscriber you have dialed is unavailable or has traveled outside their service area . "
That seemed odd because they had called me a few seconds ago .
~10:00 AM .
I receive a call on my home phone .
I almost did n't answer it , but it turns out it was the Discover Card Fraud Unit informing me that $ 2100.00 in charges had been made on my card in the past two days and had I made them Well , no .
I typically do n't go on spending sprees like that , but Discover was very helpful and honestly , I did n't even think about calling the police .
I was actually just happy that Discover was treating me fairly ( I gotta say , Discover 's always been good to me ) and I assumed that this was some online scam the police could n't do anything about .
11:04 AM .
My cell phone rings .
It 's that strange number again .
Turns out that it 's a Visa fraud unit calling me and thousands of dollars in charges had been made on my card in the past two days and had I made them ?
Well , no .
But this time I know I could be serious trouble .
We start talking and they told me that Costco.com put through charges on my account despite the fact that the expiration date was wrong !
( Note that in my earlier rant , I was confused about the expiration dates .
Now I know what 's going on . )
They also mentioned something very interesting .
It seems that just this morning , the thieves made a purchase at a Denny 's Restaurant at zip code 97232 .
Now I 'm pissed .
In fact , I 'm so mad about this that the obvious does n't sink in for a bit .
I have interesting information .
You do n't have breakfast mail - ordered .
These thieves were at that restaurant and that 's a local zip code .
Since my ' net connection went down this morning , I calledand asked him if he could look up that Denny 's for me .
He did .
I know exactly where that Denny 's is and it's not far from where I live .
told me to call the police right away and perhaps I should have , but I also know that speed is everything .
Whoever served the food might be hopping off shift .
If they 're still at the restaurant , maybe they 'll remember the order .
It 's a longshot , but it 's the best I 've got .
12:00 noon .
I hop in the car and drive down to Denny 's and ask to speak to the manager .
I apologized for bothering him during the lunch rush and then explained what was going on .
I pulled out my Visa .
" This card was used here this morning .
Someone has seen the thief .
I know your registers store the day 's credit card transactions .
Is there any way you can look up this number and tell me who served them ?
"
The manager , Pat , said he'd be happy to help .
As I sat and waited , I called the police .
They said they'd have someone call me .
Great .
In Portland , the police department is so strapped that unless it 's a person - to - person crime , it 's pretty low priority .
Pat came back and told me he found the order .
It seems that it was a phone order for carryout so he did n't have a signed receipt .
However , he had something better .
He gave me a description of the guy who picked up the order .
He was a skinny blond kid , early twenties , t- shirt , dark - colored slacks and maybe 5 and half feet tall .
Did he have any tattoos or other distinguishing marks ?
No .
Were there logos or anything on his clothes ?
Do n't remember .
Did he say anything , have an accent ?
Not much and no .
Pretty normal .
Great .
This guy has described half of Portland 's youth .
Nothing .
Is there anything else you can remember ?
" Oh , yeah .
He said he was staying at the Red Lion .
" I looked out the front window .
There was the Red Lion Inn .
Could my thief really be that stupid ?
I knew this was a dead - end , but again , I had nothing else .
I thank Pat , walk towards the Red Lion , and then remember I forgot a crucially important question .
I ran back to the restaurant .
" He was here when we first opened .
6 A.M. " Getting to the Red Lion front desk , I quickly explain what 's going .
They tried looking my name up to see if I was registered as a guest , but nothing came up .
I described the guy but no one seemed to remember him .
I asked if there was anyone there who might remember what their customers might look like that early in the morning .
They called the lady who worked the morning shift and put me on the phone .
I described the guy .
No , she informs me .
That describes tons of people who were there .
She does n't remember anyone who specifically might match that description .
I thanked her and was about to hang up when she said " sorry .
We were pretty busy last night . " " No .
He would have been here this morning .
6:00 AM . " " Oh !
I know who you 're talking about .
He has a roommate and they 're in room 327 .
" How the hell this lady remembered the guy and which room he 's in , I 'll never know , but I 'm completely blown away at my stroke of luck .
Do I have my thief ?
The people behind the desk start rooting around for information and we get the smoking gun .
They have a registration through hotels.com for the guys in room 327 .
The room is in their name .
The billing is in mine .
12:19 PM .
I call the police again .
They want to know how I know the guilty part is in the room .
I explain that I do n't , but I have proof that he 's registered as a guest .
They tell me they 'll send an officer .
I go back to the front desk and am waiting , chatting with the folks there and trying to get more information .
It seems they frequently use the computer in the hotel lobby , one of them had a Minnesota birth certificate faxed to him there and the hotel staff thought they were strange .
They were also repeat customers , but it turns out they registered under different names , previously .
Then the conversation fell silent .
I knew something was up and a young man walked past me to get to the computer .
The manager on duty frantically pointed at him as he walked past and I knew this was one of them .
It was all I could do to stop myself from turning around and confronting the guy .
Instead , I asked if they had any literature about convention rates .
The manager whispered to me that if I want to make a quiet call , I can use their office .
I followed her and walked past the guy sitting at the computer .
His back was to me , so he did n't notice anything .
12:41 PM .
I call the police again .
I ask when the officers would get there and explain that at least one of the thieves is accounted for .
At this point , the manager returns to the office and tells me the other one is in the lobby .
One of the other front desk people takes my phone and gives a long description and pace nervously for quite a while .
Meanwhile , the thieves leave the lobby and head back to their room .
~12:50 , I poke my head out in time to see police officers going up the stairs .
The head maintenance man tells me that he 's stationed people near the exits to see where the guys go if they flee .
As it turns out ( I found out later ) , as the officers were heading towards their room , one of them walked out and was trying to leave at just that moment .
The officers stopped this person and entered the room .
There was drug paraphernalia ( needles ) lying around and in searching the room , they found yet another piece of damning evidence .
Credit card companies will sometimes send out " checks " that you can use to make a cash advance .
One of them had one of my Visa checks in his pocket .
Signed .
Shortly afterwards , the police led the two thieves by me .
They were in handcuffs and I had the biggest grin on my face .
Dumb luck and persistence paid off .
Interesting side notes : One of the thieves looks very familiar .
It 's bugging me , but I can't place him .
One of the police officers gave a maintenance guy a plastic Coke bottle filled with syringes to dispose of .
Is n't that supposed to be evidence ? : I am told that a police report should be ready by Monday .
I 'll get it as soon as I can , scan it and post it . : to " droop " : sorry about deleting your entry about syringes .
I 'm on a laptop and the irritating trackpad and I do n't play well together .
Just to address your concerns , though , I 'd like to mention that the hotel informed me they had proper sharps disposal , so no needles were being thrown in the trash .

The Original Macintosh : 2 of 2 Creative Think Author : Andy Hertzfeld Date : July 1982 Characters : Alan Kay , Bill Budge Topics : Inspiration Summary : A seminar with Alan Kay Alan Kay , in
the PARC days
In July of 1982 , while I was in the midst of writing the Control Manager part of the Macintosh toolbox , my friend Bill Budge invited me to a computer industry seminar called " Creative Think " , where interesting people gave purportedly inspiring talks .
It was organized by Roger van Oech , a consultant who had written a book about creativity entitled " A Whack On The Side Of The Head " .
I usually avoided both creativity seminars and industry schmooze - fests , but my friend Bill had somehow finagled free tickets and I thought it would be worth it just to see him .
Carver Mead gave an interesting talk on newly emerging VLSI technology , and some old chip industry veterans recounted amusing war stories , but the last talk of the day was the one that mattered to me .
It was given by Alan Kay , the inventor of Smalltalk and the Alto , and the driving force behind Xerox PARC .
I had read about Alan , and been inspired by his article in the September 1977 issue of Scientific American , but I had never seen him before in person or heard much about him .
Alan 's speech was revelatory and was perhaps the most inspiring talk that I ever attended .
I grew increasingly excited as he made one brilliant , insightful remark after another , and took out my notebook to write as much of it down as I could .
Alan was articulating the values behind the work that I was doing , even though he was n't aware of it , in a way that really resonated with me .
After I got back to my office in Cupertino , I transcribed it onto a single page , and copied it to give out to the rest of team .
I still have those notes , so I thought it would be interesting to reproduce them here , as an example of some of the thinking that inspired our efforts .
Alan Kay 's talk at Creative Think seminar , July 20 , 1982
Outline of talk : Metaphors , Magnetic Fields , Snobbery and Slogans
The best way to predict the future is to invent it .
Humans like fantasy and sharing :
Fantasy fulfills a need for a simpler , more controllable world .
Sharing is important - we 're all communication junkies .
We have an incredible bandwidth disparity ( easy to take in , hard to give out ) ; our devices have the reciprocal disparity ( hard to take in , easy to give out )
Metaphors :
Computer as medium ( like clay or paint )
Computer as vehicle
Computer as musical instrument
Magnetic Fields :
Find a central metaphor that 's so good that everything aligns to it .
Design meetings are no longer necessary , it designs itself .
The metaphor should be crisp and fun .
Smalltalk is object - oriented , but it should have been message oriented .
Snobbery :
Turn up your nose at good ideas .
You must work on great ideas , not good ones .
Appreciate mundanity : after all , a pencil is high technology
One goal : the computer disappears into the environment
The computer should n't act like it knows everything .
The whole notion of ' programming language ' is wrong .
Slogans :
Better is the enemy of best
Relative judgements have no place in art
Systems programmers are high priests of a low cult
Point of view is worth 80 IQ points
Good ideas do n't often scale
Remember , it 's all software , it just depends on when you crystallize it .
People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware .
Final advice : content over form , go for fun .

BAGHDAD , April 2 — A day after members of an American Congressional delegation led by Senator John McCain pointed to their brief visit to Baghdad ’s central market as evidence that the new security plan for the city was working , the merchants there were incredulous about the Americans ’ conclusions .
“ What are they talking about ? ” Ali Jassim Faiyad , the owner of an electrical appliances shop in the market , said Monday .
“ The security procedures were abnormal ! ”
The delegation arrived at the market , which is called Shorja , on Sunday with more than 100 soldiers in armored Humvees — the equivalent of an entire company — and attack helicopters circled overhead , a senior American military official in Baghdad said .
The soldiers redirected traffic from the area and restricted access to the Americans , witnesses said , and sharpshooters were posted on the roofs .
The congressmen wore bulletproof vests throughout their hourlong visit .
“ They paralyzed the market when they came , ” Mr. Faiyad said during an interview in his shop on Monday .
“ This was only for the media . ”
THE DRIVE UP INTERSTATE 84 , through the verdant amphitheatrical sweep of the Columbia River Gorge to the quaint Oregon town of The Dalles , seems a trek into an alluring American past .
You pass ancient basalt bluffs riven by luminous waterfalls , glimpsed through a filigree of Douglas firs .
You see signs leading to museums of native Americana full of feathery and leathery tribal relics .
There are farms and fisheries , vineyards arrayed on hillsides , eagles and ospreys riding the winds .
On the horizon , just a half hour 's drive away , stands the radiant , snowcapped peak of Mount Hood , site of 11 glaciers , source of half a dozen rivers , and home of four - season skiing .
" I could live here , " I say to myself with a backward glance down the highway toward urban Portland , a sylvan dream of the billboarded corridor that connects Silicon Valley and San Francisco .
Then , as the road comes to an end , the gray ruin of an abandoned aluminum plant rises from a barren hillside .
Its gothic gantries and cavernous smelters stand empty and forlorn , a poignant warning of the evanescence of industrial power .
But industry has returned to The Dalles , albeit industry with a decidedly postindustrial flavor .
For it's here that Google has chosen to build its new 30 ‑acre campus , the base for a server farm of unprecedented proportion .
Although the evergreen mazes , mountain majesties , and always - on skiing surely play a role , two amenities in particular make this the perfect site for a next - gen data center .
One is a fiber - optic hub linked to Harbour Pointe , Washington , the coastal landing base of PC - 1 , a fiber - optic artery built to handle 640 Gbps that connects Asia to the US .
A glassy extension cord snakes through all the town 's major buildings , tapping into the greater Internet though NoaNet , a node of the experimental Internet2 .
The other attraction is The Dalles Dam and its 1.8 ‑ gigawatt power station .
The half - mile - long dam is a crucial source of cheap electrical power – once essential to aluminum smelting , now a strategic resource in the next phase in the digital revolution .
Indeed , Google and other Silicon Valley titans are looking to the Columbia River to supply ceaseless cycles of electricity at about a fifth of what they would cost in the San Francisco Bay Area .
Why ?
To feed the ravenous appetite of a new breed of computer .
Moore 's law has a corollary that bears the name of Gordon Bell , the legendary engineer behind Digital Equipment 's VAX line of advanced computers and now a principal researcher at Microsoft .
According to Bell 's law , every decade a new class of computer emerges from a hundredfold drop in the price of processing power .
As we approach a billionth of a cent per byte of storage , and pennies per gigabit per second of bandwidth , what kind of machine labors to be born ?
How will we feed it ?
How will it be tamed ?
And how soon will it , in its inevitable turn , become a dinosaur ?
One characteristic of this new machine is clear .
It arises from a world measured in the prefix giga , but its operating environment is the petascale .
We 're all petaphiles now , plugged into a world of petabytes , petaops , petaflops .
Mouthing the prefix peta ( signifying numbers of the magnitude 10 to the 15th power , a million billion ) and the Latin verb petere ( to search ) , we are doubly petacentric in our peregrinations through the hypertrophic network cloud .
Just last century – you remember it well , across the chasm of the crash – the PC was king .
The mainframe was deposed and deceased .
The desktop was the data center .
Larry Page and Sergey Brin were nonprofit googoos babbling about searching their 150 - gigabyte index of the Internet .
When I wanted to electrify crowds with my uncanny sense of futurity , I would talk terascale ( 10 to the 12th power ) , describing a Web with an unimaginably enormous total of 15 terabytes of content .
Yawn .
Today Google rules a total database of hundreds of petabytes , swelled every 24 hours by terabytes of Gmails , MySpace pages , and dancing - doggy videos – a relentless march of daily deltas , each larger than the whole Web of a decade ago .
To make sense of it all , Page and Brin – with Microsoft , Yahoo , and Barry " QVC " Diller 's Ask.com hot on their heels – are frantically taking the computer - on - a- chip and multiplying it , in massively parallel arrays , into a computer - on - a- planet .
The data centers these companies are building began as exercises in making the planet 's ever - growing data pile searchable .
Now , turbocharged with billions in Madison Avenue mad money for targeted advertisements , they 're morphing into general - purpose computing platforms , vastly more powerful than any built before .
All those PCs are still there , but they have less and less to do , as Google and the others take on more and more of the duties once delegated to the CPU .
Optical networks , which move data over vast distances without degradation , allow computing to migrate to wherever power is cheapest .
Thus , the new computing architecture scales across Earth 's surface .
Ironically , this emerging architecture is interlinked by the very technology that was supposed to be Big Computing 's downfall : the Internet .
In the PC era , the winners were companies that dominated the microcosm of the silicon chip .
The new age of petacomputing will be ruled by the masters of the remote data center – those who optimally manage processing power , electricity , bandwidth , storage , and location .
They will leverage the Net to provide not only search , but also the panoply of applications formerly housed on the desktop .
For the moment , at least , the dawning era favors scale in hardware rather than software applications , and centralized operations management rather than operating systems at the network 's edge .
The burden of playing catch - up in this new game may be what prompted Bill Gates to hand over technical leadership at Microsoft to Craig Mundie , a supercomputer expert , and Ray Ozzie , who made his name in network - based enterprise software with Lotus and Groove Networks .
Having clambered well up the petascale slope , Google has a privileged view of the future it is building – a perspective it 's understandably reticent to share .
Proud of their front end of public search and advertising algorithms , the G - men hide their hardware coup behind an aw - shucks , bought - it - at - Fry 's facade .
They resist the notion that their advantage springs chiefly from mastering the intricate dynamics of a newly recentralized computing architecture .
This modesty may be disingenuous , of course , but amid the perpetual onrush of technological innovation , it may well be the soul of wisdom .
After all , the advantage might turn out to be short - lived .
BACK IN 1993 , in a midnight email to me from his office at Sun Microsystems , CTO Eric Schmidt envisioned the future : " When the network becomes as fast as the processor , the computer hollows out and spreads across the network . "
His then - employer publicized this notion in a compact phrase :
The network is the computer .
But Sun 's hardware honchos failed to absorb Schmidt 's CEO - in - the - making punch line .
In which direction would the profits from that transformation flow ?
" Not to the companies making the fastest processors or best operating systems , " he prophesied , " but to the companies with the best networks and the best search and sort algorithms . "
Schmidt was n't just talking .
He left Sun and , after a stint as CEO of Novell , joined Google , where he found himself engulfed by the future he had predicted .
While competitors like Excite , Inktomi , and Yahoo were building out their networks with SPARCstations and IBM mainframes , Google designed and manufactured its own servers from commodity components made by Intel and Seagate .
In a 2005 technical article , operations chief Urs Hölzle explained why .
The price of high - end processors " goes up nonlinearly with performance , " he observed .
Connecting innumerable cheap processors in parallel offered at least a theoretical chance for a scalable system , in which bang for the buck did n't erode as the system grew .
Today , Schmidt 's insight has been vindicated , and he 's often seen on Google 's Mountain View , California , campus wearing his comp-sci PhD 's goofy dimpled grin .
The smile has grown toothier since he announced the plant in The Dalles , a manifestation of what he trumpets as " some of the best computer science ever performed . "
When it 's finished , the project will spread tens of thousands of servers across a few giant structures .
By building its own infrastructure rather than relying on commercial data centers , Schmidt told analysts in May , Google gets " tremendous competitive advantage . "
The facility in The Dalles is only the latest and most advanced of about two dozen Google data centers , which stretch from Silicon Valley to Dublin .
All told , it 's a staggering collection of hardware , whose constituent servers number 450,000 , according to the lowest estimate .
The extended Googleplex comprises an estimated 200 petabytes of hard disk storage – enough to copy the Net 's entire sprawling cornucopia dozens of times – and four petabytes of RAM .
To handle the current load of 100 million queries a day , its collective input - output bandwidth must be in the neighborhood of 3 petabits per second .
Of course , these numbers are educated guesses .
One of the unstated rules of the new arms race is that all information is strategic .
Even the once - voluble Chairman Eric now hides behind PR walls .
I had to battle hoards of polite but steadfast flacks to reach him , but he finally replied to my queries with a cordial email .
Cloud computing , he confirmed , has indeed succeeded the old high - performance staples : mainframes and client - server , both of which require local - area networks .
This is very much last year 's news .
" In this architecture , the data is mostly resident on servers ' somewhere on the Internet ' and the application runs on both the ' cloud servers ' and the user 's browser .
When you use Google Gmail , Maps , Yahoo's services , many of eBay 's services , you are using this architecture . "
He added : " The consequence of this ' architectural shift ' is the return of massive data centers . "
This change is as momentous as the industrial - age shift from craft production to mass manufacture , from individual workers in separate shops turning out finished products step by step to massive factories that break up production into thousands of parts and perform them simultaneously .
No single computer could update millions of auctions in real time , as eBay does , and no one machine could track thousands of stock portfolios made up of offerings on all the world 's exchanges , as Yahoo does .
And those are , at most , terascale tasks .
Page and Brin understood that with clever software , scores of thousands of cheap computers working in parallel could perform petascale tasks – like searching everything Yahoo , eBay , Amazon.com , and anyone else could shovel onto the Net .
Google appears to have attained one of the holy grails of computer science : a scalable massively parallel architecture that can readily accommodate diverse software .
Google 's core activity remains Web search .
Having built a petascale search machine , though , the question naturally arose :
What else could it do ?
Google 's answer : just about anything .
Thus the company 's expanding portfolio of Web services : delivering ads ( AdSense , AdWords ) , maps ( Google Maps ) , videos ( Google Video ) , scheduling ( Google Calendar ) , transactions ( Google Checkout ) , email ( Gmail ) , and productivity software ( Writely ) .
The other heavyweights have followed suit .
Google 's success stems from more than foresight , ingenuity , and chutzpah .
In every era , the winning companies are those that waste what is abundant – as signalled by precipitously declining prices – in order to save what is scarce .
Google has been profligate with the surfeits of data storage and backbone bandwidth .
Conversely , it has been parsimonious with that most precious of resources , users ' patience .
The recent explosion of hard disk storage capacity makes Moore 's law look like a cockroach race .
In 1991 , a 100 - megabyte drive cost $ 500 , and a 50 - megahertz Intel 486 processor cost about the same .
In 2006 , $ 500 buys a 750 - gigabyte drive or a 3 - gigahertz processor .
Over 15 years , that 's an advance of 7,500 times for the hard drive and 60 times for the processor .
By this crude metric , the cost - effectiveness of hard drives grew 125 times faster than that of processors .
But the miraculous advance of disk storage concealed a problem :
The larger and denser the individual disks , the longer it takes to scan them for information .
" The little arm reading the disks can't move fast enough to handle the onrush of seeks , " explains Josh Coates , a 32 - year - old storage entrepreneur who founded Berkeley Data Systems .
" The whole world stops . "
The solution is to deploy huge amounts of random access memory .
By the byte , RAM is some 100 times more costly than disk storage .
Engineers normally conserve it obsessively , using all kinds of tricks to fool processors into treating disk drives as though they were RAM .
But Google understands that the most precious resource is not money but time .
Search users , it turns out , are sorely impatient .
Research shows that they 're satisfied with results delivered within a twentieth of a second .
RAM can be accessed some 10,000 times faster than disks .
So , measured by access time , RAM is 100 times cheaper than disk storage .
But it 's not enough to reach users quickly .
Google needs to reach them wherever they are .
This requires access to the Net backbone , the long - haul fiber - optic lines that encircle the globe .
In the last decade , the speed of backbone traffic has accelerated from 45 Mbps to roughly a terabit per second .
That 's a rise of more than 20,000 times .
Google interconnects its hundreds of thousands of processors with gigabit Ethernet lines .
The expense of placing gigantic data centers near major fiber - optic nodes is well worth the expense .
Wasting what is abundant to conserve what is scarce , the G - men have become the supreme entrepreneurs of the new millennium .
However , past performance does not guarantee future returns .
As large as the current Google database is , even bigger shocks are coming .
An avalanche of digital video measured in exabytes ( 10 to the 18th power , or 1,000 petabytes ) is hurtling down from the mountainsides of panicked Big Media and bubbling up from the YouTubian depths .
The massively parallel , prodigally wasteful petascale computer has its work cut out for it .
THE FASTEST - GROWING search engine – besides Google – is n't Microsoft or Yahoo or AOL .
It 's Ask.com , which has seen its total searches grow 20 percent this year .
Like Google , Ask.com has built a petascale computer out of commodity CPUs , hard disks , and RAM chips .
And while Google does n't permit outsiders to ogle the hardware inside its data centers , Ask.com is eager for the attention .
The East Coast branch of Ask.com 's machine occupies a 500,000 - square - foot concrete structure at the end of a long and winding suburban road .
The driveway runs a gauntlet of pylons bearing heavy gray power lines and festooned with smaller yellow fiber - optic cables .
The windowless facility crouches behind a 10 - foot - high chain - link fence in a drab tan camouflage that suggests military - level security .
The building holds the central nervous system of not only Ask.com , which occupies more than half the space , but also other well - known information technology companies .
Corporate logos are conspicuously absent .
The facility is run by telco giant Verizon .
It was designed not for supercomputing but for communications , steering photons through glass threads and mostly copper switches toward their telephonic destinations .
MCI , a Verizon acquisition , built it to accommodate UUNet , the premier high - end Internet service provider .
Arriving at a diminutive brown door discreetly designated MAIN ENTRANCE , I pass inside to be vetted by earnest security guards .
Metal gates clank behind me as I step into a sirocco of lukewarm air blowing up from the floor .
A sudden roar of machinery – fans , air conditioners , and power supplies all whirring together in a tangle of white noise – assaults my ears .
The few workers attending to the endless rows of cabinets protect their eardrums with hulking orange muffs .
These cabinets once held as many as eight UUNet routers apiece .
Now each 10 - foot frame houses 42 black Dell PowerEdge servers , interconnected by a Rastafarian tangle of wires – tens of thousands of computers in total .
Hovering above the cabinets like a midday emanation over Death Valley , a shimmering haze of heat signifies an awesome consumption of power .
If it 's necessary to waste memory and bandwidth to dominate the petascale era , gorging on energy is an inescapable cost of doing business .
Ask.com operations VP
Dayne Sampson estimates that the five leading search companies together have some 2 million servers , each shedding 300 watts of heat annually , a total of 600 megawatts .
These are linked to hard drives that dissipate perhaps another gigawatt .
Fifty percent again as much power is required to cool this searing heat , for a total of 2.4 gigawatts .
With a third of the incoming power already lost to the grid 's inefficiencies , and half of what 's left lost to power supplies , transformers , and converters , the total of electricity consumed by major search engines in 2006 approaches 5 gigawatts .
That 's an impressive quantity of electricity .
Five gigawatts is almost enough to power the Las Vegas metropolitan area – with all its hotels , casinos , restaurants , and convention centers – on the hottest day of the year .
So the annual operation of the world 's petascale search machines constitutes a Vegas - sized power sump .
In the next year or so , it could add a dog - day Atlantic City .
Air - conditioning will be the prime cost and conundrum of the petascale era .
As energy analysts Peter Huber and Mark Mills projected in 1999 , the planetary machine is on track to be consuming half of all the world 's output of electricity by the end of this decade .
Google 's Hölzle noticed the high electric bills after taking his post in 1999 .
At 15 cents per kilowatt - hour , power dominated his calculus of costs .
" A power company could give away PCs and make a substantial profit selling power , " he says .
( At The Dalles , the huge protuberances on top are not giant disk drives , climbing to the rooftop for a smoke while the RAM below does the work , but an array of eight hulking cooling towers . )
The struggle to find an adequate supply of electricity explains the curious emptiness that afflicts some 30 percent of Ask.com 's square footage .
Why is the second - fastest - growing search engine one - third empty ?
" We ran out of power before we ran out of space , " says search operations manager James Snow , a ponytailed refugee from an IBM acquisition .
Not only does the Verizon facility lack a cheap power source , it struggles to get any further power at all ; designed for the more modest needs of Internet switching , the building has already maxed out the local grid .
Consequently , Ask.com 's Sampson has followed Google 's trail to the Columbia River , where he 's scoping out properties .
Perhaps by moving farther up the river into the Washington headwaters he can get even cheaper power than Google will get in The Dalles .
Microsoft and Yahoo are a few steps ahead of him , building me - too data centers in Quincy and Wenatchee , Washington , respectively .
There they can take advantage of rock - bottom electricity prices as well as dark fiber laid by the Bonneville Power Administration .
Patterning itself on Ronald Reagan 's cold war strategy against the Soviet Union , Microsoft is headed toward spending two dollars on data centers and online services for every dollar spent by Google .
As Microsoft Live operations chief Debra Chrapaty tells me , her company " added a Google " last year in search capability .
Microsoft 's power consumption has risen 10 times in the last three years as it has come to serve Hotmail 's 260 million users , MSN Messenger 's 240 million , and Live 's 320 million .
Chrapaty projects a further tenfold rise in the next five years as the company 's nine data centers , most scattered around the US , are joined with others around the globe .
With a great sucking sound audible in Redmond as the Windows desktop disappears into the cloud , Microsoft has no choice but to damn the expense and forge ahead .
The catch - up crew at Ask.com may be wise to hold out for alternatives beyond the remote corners of the Pacific Northwest .
After all , hydropower is a limited and localized resource , while nuclear power promises centuries of nearly limitless energy that can be produced almost anywhere .
China is moving forward with plans to build as many as 30 new nuclear plants ; perhaps the next wave of data centers will be sited in Shenzhen .
UNTIL HUMANKIND devises an inexhaustible font of electricity that can be situated wherever it 's most convenient , the best hope for cooling overheated data centers is to make computers themselves more efficient .
The dire state of data center economics ( as well as customer demand for portable computers with a reasonable battery life ) has driven chipmakers to throw all their weight behind efforts to design low - power chips .
AMD 's Opteron CPU , debuted in 2003 , consumed significantly less power than its predecessors , reversing the trend toward higher speed and greater power consumption that had held since the microprocessor was invented .
The Opteron upgrade this past summer brought an additional 30 percent reduction in power usage .
Intel , introducing its competing Core architecture , recently acknowledged that the market now values energy efficiency over clock speed .
But with the Internet 's expansion and the migration of desktop applications online , these improvements wo n't be enough to avert a meltdown .
An even more daunting roadblock stands ahead : Further dramatic gains in efficiency may be physically impossible without radical breakthroughs in chip design .
Microsoft 's Craig Mundie bluntly describes the predicament .
" We have now run into a brick wall , " he says .
" What brought all of us faster computing was raising the CPU 's clock rate , which increased power consumption .
Raising the clock rate without consuming more power was only possible because we could lower the voltage .
We can't do that anymore because we 're down into electron volts .
If you can't lower the voltage , you can't raise the clock rate without using a lot more power . "
If CPUs wo n't run much cooler , maybe the rest of the computer can be redesigned to keep power consumption to a minimum .
That 's the goal of Andy Bechtolsheim , who 's plotting the compact , low - power future of the data center from his workbench at Sun.
Bechtolsheim has fundamentally reconceived the way computers are put together , coupling CPUs directly to drives , angling drives for maximum air flow , and connecting fans directly to motherboards .
He aims to bring data center computing capacity to the back office – without oversize air - conditioning trolls on the roof .
Some industry vets believe that Bechtolsheim does n't count much in the era of cloud computing .
He counted , though , back in 1998 when he supplied the first outside money for Brin and Page .
Prior to that , he had made successive fortunes as Sun 's founder and employee number one , as a major early investor in Microsoft , and as progenitor of Granite Systems , an inventor of gigabit Ethernet switches ultimately snapped up by Cisco .
Cisco , Google , Microsoft , and Sun give him sort of a royal flush , making him perhaps the supreme investor - entrepreneur in Silicon Valley history .
Speaking at double data rate in a German accent , Bechtolsheim acknowledges that the move from search to more ambitious services plays to Google 's advantage .
" To deliver video , maps , and all the rest on the fly , optimized for a specific customer 's needs , to get the maximum benefit for the advertiser – that requires tremendous hardware , storage , and memory .
It takes hundreds of computers free to each end user .
The next tier down does n't have the economics to build this stuff . "
I ask , " So is the game over ? "
Bechtolsheim 's reply : " Only if no one changes the game . "
Earlier this year , Sun presented new products that can dispense the entire Internet from a few bread boxes – using , curiously enough , industry - standard AMD Opteron processors , cheap hard disks , and industry - standard RAM .
The Sun Fire X4600 is a modular hybrid data server and storage facility .
Stacking 655 of these machines together , the Tokyo Institute of Technology created a 38 - teraflop machine that has been recognized as one of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
And with 1 - terabyte drives , available next year , Bechtolsheim will be able to pack the Net into three cabinets , consuming 200 kilowatts and occupying perhaps a tenth of a row at Ask.com .
Replicating Google 's 200 petabytes of hard drive capacity would take less than one data center row and consume less than 10 megawatts , about the typical annual usage of a US household .
Leaning back in his chair in a Sun conference room , Bechtolsheim observes , " The last few years have been disappointing for people who want to accelerate progress in technology .
But now the world is moving faster again . "
FOR THE MOMENT , at least , the power of massive parallelism has far outstripped the promise of alternative computing architectures .
But reliance on massively parallel computing may come to define the limits of what can be accomplished by a computer - on - a- planet .
Two decades ago , Carver Mead , the former head of computer science at Caltech and key contributor to several generations of chip technology , pointed out that a collection of chips arrayed in parallel can't do everything a computer might be called upon to do .
" Parallel architectures , " he noted , " are inherently special - purpose . "
Hölzle admits as much .
Since he arrived at Google , he says , the company has been through six or seven iterations of its search software and perhaps as many versions of the hardware backend .
" It 's impossible to decouple the two , " he explains .
" The search programs have to fit with the hardware systems , and the hardware systems have to work with the software . "
All previous parallel architectures , from Danny Hillis ' Thinking Machines to Seymour Cray 's behemoth supercomputers to Jim Clark 's Silicon Graphics workstations , have fallen before this problem .
Their software and hardware became too specialized to keep up with the pace of innovation in computing .
Scalability is also an issue :
As the number of processors grows , the balance of activity between communications and processing skews toward communications .
The pins that connect chips to boards become bottlenecks .
With all the processors attempting to access memory at once , the gridlock becomes intractable .
The problem has an acronym – NUMA , for nonuniform memory access – and it has never been solved .
Google apparently has responded by replicating everything everywhere .
The system is intensively redundant ; if one server fails , the other half million do n't know or care .
But this creates new challenges .
The software must break up every problem into ever more parallel processes .
In the end , each ingenious solution becomes the new problem of a specialized , even sclerotic , device .
The petascale machine faces the peril of becoming a kludge .
Could that happen to Google and its followers ?
Google 's magical ability to distribute a search query among untold numbers of processors and integrate the results for delivery to a specific user demands the utmost central control .
This triumph of centralization is a strange , belated vindication of Grosch 's law , the claim by IBM's Herbert Grosch in 1953 that computer power rises by the square of the price .
That is , the more costly the computer , the better its price - performance ratio .
Low - cost computers could not compete .
In the end , a few huge machines would serve all the world 's computing needs .
Such thinking supposedly prompted Grosch 's colleague Thomas Watson to predict a total global computing market of five mainframes .
The advent of personal computers dealt Grosch 's law a decisive defeat .
Suddenly , inexpensive commodity desktop PCs were thousands of times more cost - effective than mainframes .
In this way , the success of the highly centralized computer - on - a- planet runs counter to the current that has swept the computer industry for decades .
The advantages of the new architecture may last only until the centripetal forces pulling intelligence to the core of the network give way , once again , to the silicon centrifuge dispelling it to the edges .
Google has pioneered the miracle play of wringing supercomputer performance from commodity CPUs , and this strategy is likely to succeed as long as microchip progress remains in the doldrums .
But semiconductor and optical technologies are on the verge of a new leap forward .
The next wave of innovation will compress today 's parallel solutions in an evolutionary convergence of electronics and optics : 3 - D and even holographic memory cells ; lasers inscribed on the tops of chips , replacing copper pins with streams of photons ; and all - optical networks in which thousands of colors of light travel along a single fiber .
As these advances find their way into an increasing variety of devices , the petascale computer will shrink from a dinosaur to a teleputer – the successor to today 's handhelds – in your ear or in your signal path .
It will access a variety of searchers and servers , enabling participation in metaverses beyond the ken of even Ray Kurzweil 's prophetic imagination .
Moreover , it will link to trillions of sensors around the globe , giving it a constant knowledge of the physical state of the world , from traffic conditions to the workings of your own biomachine .
Such advances promise to transform the calculus of storage , bandwidth , and power that gives centralization its current advantage .
As the redoubtable Bell Labs engineer turned giga - investor Andy Kessler tells me , " It 's sure to happen .
It always has .
Because all the creativity , customer whims , long tails , and money are at the network 's edge .
That 's where chipmakers find the volumes that feed their Moore 's law margins .
That 's where you can find elastically ascending revenues and relentlessly declining costs . "
Amid the beckoning fantasies of futurism , the purpose of whatever comes next – like that of today 's petapede – will be to serve the ultimate , and still the only general - purpose , petascale computer : the human brain .
The brain demonstrates the superiority of the edge over the core :
It 's not agglomerated in a few air - conditioned nodes , but dispersed far and wide and interconnected via myriad sensory and media channels .
The test of the new global ganglia of computers and cables , worldwide webs of glass and light and air , is how readily they take advantage of unexpected contributions from free human minds , in all their creativity and diversity .

WHEN they introduced the Mazda 3 sedan and four - door hatchback - cum - wagon in 2003 , the Mazda people had a spiel that went something like this :
“ The kids these days !
They want everything !
They ’re paying 16 grand but they want a mini-Mercedes , so that ’s what we have to give them .
Even though , back in our day , entry - level cars had cardboard steering wheels , and if you wanted a sunroof you had to wait for a rust hole to form above your head  which usually took only a couple of weeks . ”
The basic Mazda 3 really does offer everything you ’d reasonably need in a daily driver : tasteful , high - quality interior design and materials ; plenty of space ; and high - end options like a Bose stereo and a navigation system .
The 3 is based on the same platform as the Volvo S40 , and it drives like a more expensive car ; quiet and refined on the highway , composed and willing on twisty roads .
When people tell me they ’ve bought a Mazda 3 , I congratulate them heartily .
The stock 3 , even with its wimpiest engine , is a car that encourages enthusiastic driving .
In fact , a couple of years ago I was banned from the test - drive area at a Mazda Rev It Up autocross event when I got a bit too frisky with a 3 sedan and committed flagrant orange - cone - icide .
So , I ’m not a fan of static typing .
It ’s okay in the likes of Haskell which does type inferencing and generally goes out of its way to reduce programmer pain , but Java ?
C# ?
No ta .
It ’s awfully tempting to conclude that anyone who chooses to use those languages deserves to be pointed out and laughed at .
It ’s especially hard to resist that temptation , when a C# blogger plays right into my hands by describing the following code :
Pattern findGamesPattern = Pattern . With.Literal ( @ " " ) ;
as " a very nice regular expression wrapper which allows you to define a regex using a readable syntax exposed via a very elegant fluent interface " .
It seemed so self - evidently silly that I read back in his blog to see if he was taking the piss .
Depressingly , he appears to be serious .
Ah well , I shall at least resist the temptation of supplying his name and URL .
Worse , he ’s using this regular expression ( Rendered in Perl ’s /x style , which ignores whitespace and allows comments in the body of the regex )
qr/ /msx to parse XML ( one of the canonical no nos that one ) .
Badly .
For instance , it will match this drivel :
stuff
but it wo n't match this perfectly valid xml :
On reflection , that might not be matched for a couple of reasons - it depends whether ` Anything` includes ` "
" ` .
All of which is beside my main point .
The sheer wordiness of the ‘ fluent ’ regex wrapper serves merely to obfuscate the intent of the pattern .
You are tempted to conclude that , if it has that many words in it , it must be correct .
This is n’t so much fluent as effluent .
Meanwhile , in that bastion of ‘ line noise ’ that is Perl , Damian Conway ’s Perl Best Practices recommends writing all but the most trivial of regular expressions using the a standard set of switches ( msx ) and using whitespace to break the pattern up into logical chunks with comments where necessary .
Given that almost everyone uses PCRE nowadays , you can follow the same good practice in your language of choice .
Yes , the regular expression language is terse .
Yes it can be opaque until you take the time to learn its grammar .
But there are n’t that many rules to learn .
The language is n’t complex , only some of the things that people use it for .
What is fluency then ?
An interface is n’t fluent because it ’s wordy .
Fluency is about writing message protocols that make it easy for the user to solve her problem and clearly express her intent in the same bit of code .
Frankly , plain old regular expressions are a damned sight more fluent in all their terseness than the above bad joke .

A useful print reference is DNA Computing by Paun , Rozenberg and Salomaa ( Springer , 1998 ) .
1 . What is DNA ?
DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid ) is the molecular basis of genetics .
For our purposes , the following features are important .
A DNA molecule is made of two intertwined , parallel strands ( the " double helix ' ' ) .
Each strand has the following structure : p p p p = phosphate .. \ / \ / \ / \ / ... s s s s s = sugar | | | | b b b b b = base where each b can be any one of four bases : = adenine , = thymine , = cytosine , = guanine .
where each can be any one of four bases : = adenine , = thymine , = cytosine , = guanine .
Two consecutive s-p bonds must occur at distinct places on the s molecule : one at the 3 ' ( " three - prime ' ' ) position and one at the 5 ' , so each strand has a 3 ' - end and a 5 ' - end , and so strands can be systematically oriented .
We will write , , , when the strand is being read from the 3 ' - end to the 5 ' - end , and , , , when the strand is being read the opposite way , that is , from the 5 ' - end to the 3 ' - end . *
bonds must occur at distinct places on the molecule : one at the ( " three - prime ' ' ) position and one at the , so each strand has a - end and a - end , and so strands can be systematically .
We will write , , , when the strand is being read from the - end to the - end , and , , , when the strand is being read the opposite way , that is , from the - end to the -end .
The two intertwined strands in a DNA molecule have opposite orientations , and complementary base sequences .
This means that opposite every on one strand is a on the other , and opposite every is an .
Likewise opposite every on one strand is a on the other , and opposite every is a .
A typical stretch of the DNA molecule looks like :
p p p p ... 3 '\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / 5 ' ... s s s s s | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | s s s s s ... 5 '/ \ / \ / \ / \ / \ 3 ' ... p p p p
In what follows , this schematic representation of a segment of a DNA molecule will be abbreviated to :
Complementarity , the fundamental key to DNA replication , is also the basic mathematical ingredient in DNA computing .

Introduction
This analysis is a summary of my attempt to understand two pictures , which implicitly pose two questions .
The first picture is this :
Visualization of oil saturation in Ghawar , with focus region on ' Ain Dar and Shedgum regions at northern end .
This is the " Linux Supercluster " picture ( finder 's credit Bob Shaw ) , showing a simulation visualization of the state of Ghawar at some year , probably but not certainly 2004 .
I have color reversed the original picture so that in this version , the red areas are interpreted to represent dry oil in the reservoir .
The dark blue areas are water below the oil .
The pale blue areas are interpreted to be swept , with most oil that can be removed already gone .

Here the question is : is this an accurate picture of the state of recent depletion of Ghawar ?
( Ghawar is the world 's largest oil field , and source of over half of the oil produced by Saudi Arabia ) .
And if so , then the second question arises : does that depletion have anything to do with this picture ?
In particular , Saudi oil production has been falling with increasing speeed since summer 2005 , and overall , since mid 2004 , about 2 million barrels of oil per day in production has gone missing ( about 1 mbpd in reduction in total production , and about another 1 mbpd in that two major new projects , Qatif and Haradh III , failed to increase overall production ) .
That 's 2.5 % of world production and , if that production had n't gone missing , gasoline in the US likely would still be somewhere in the vicinity of $ 2 / gallon instead of well over $ 3 .
I will analyze six or seven separate lines of technical evidence , and argue they all point to a consistent picture , which says that the answer to both questions is " Yes " .
Yes , the northern half of Ghawar is quite depleted .
And yes , this probably explains at least part of recent production declines .
Furthermore , it is likely that more declines in Saudi production are on the way .
The evidence in question comes from quantitative forensic correlation of hundreds of disparate pieces of data from dozens of technical papers about different aspects of Ghawar .
Thus this analysis is very long and detailed - my apologies to the reader .
It summarizes 300 + hours of work on my part , and probably similar amounts of work by several other members of the loose Oil Drum coalition investigating Ghawar and ( most particularly Euan Mearns , who has posted his own thoughts and Fractional_Flow ) .
It 's just a lot of material to document .
And in attempting to address both the detail needed by technical readers and the explanations needed by less - technical readers , the length has grown further .
Given the importance of the subject , in a choice between being thorough and being brief , it seemed better to be thorough .
I will at least do my best to be clear in my exposition .
The Linux Supercluster Picture
Schematic illustration of situation in an oil reservoir with oil below and gas cap above .
Picture courtesy Euan Mearns .
Let 's first go over a little background to make sure we understand what we are looking at .
We 'll start with this schematic of part of Ghawar ( courtesy of Euan Mearns ) :
An oilfield consists of some layers of rock , the reservoir , which contain pores , spaces between the rock grains , which contain some combination of oil , water , and natural gas .
Above the reservoir is a cap of some kind which will not allow the passage of fluid and which is shaped to trap the oil and gas from migrating upwards .
This they otherwise would do because they are lighter and more buoyant than the water that tends to fill rock pores underground .
Roughly speaking , the green volume in the picture above is the oil , and the dark blue volume is the water that was originally below it .
This is not quite true , as the oil region invariably has some droplets of water still trapped in the rock pores as well : this is the initial water which cannot move .
There may or may not be a cap of natural gas above the oil , depending on which part of the field we are in .
Oil in Ghawar is being produced by peripheral water injection .
In this case , in addition to the natural water below the oil , water is being pumped down special injector wells at the edge of , and thus below , the oil area .
The pressure of that water is slowly forcing the oil up the structure to wells at the top , from where it flows to treatment plants .
The pale blue area in Euan 's picture above is the swept area that used to be oil , but now is mostly water .
Unfortunately , it 's not all water .
Just as there was some water in the oil before we started , there will be some oil in the water when we are done .
This residual oil , which will not come out from any amount more flooding by water , consists of little droplets of oil beaded up and stuck in small pore channels in the rock .
So with that understanding , let 's look at the Linux supercluster picture again .
By default ( or if you click the " Region Labels On " button ) , we are looking at labels of the division of the field into major operating areas .
For readers new to the subject , it will be particularly useful to take a minute to become familiar with these .
' Ain Dar is the northwestern operating area , divided into two crest structures - underground hills in the reservoir shape - North and South ' Ain Dar .
This area is of very high quality reservoir rock ( holds lots of oil and lets it flow easily ) and was the first discovered and put on production back in 1951 .
The picture shows it quite depleted now .
Shedgum is in the North East , and is also of very high quality , and also shown quite depleted in the picture .
Uthmaniyah is in the center of the field .
Northern Uthmaniyah consists of a distinctive dual crest structure ( two north - south running ridges with a lower area between them .
Northern Uthmaniyah is also very productive , but southern Uthmaniyah much less so .
Hawiyah is the area below Uthmaniyah and is of much lower quality .
It was put on production in the 1970s , and is not very depleted in the picture .
Haradh is the southernmost region in the field .
It was developed in three phases beginning in 1996 , and concluding in 2006 with the bringing on stream of Haradh III ( the southernmost portion ) .
Haradh is the poorest quality part of the field and this will limit the rate of production .
The picture shows it only slightly depleted .

If you now click the " OWC Labels On " button , you will see labels that show , for the northern operating regions , where the contact between oil and water was before production started - the original oil water contact ( OOWC ) .
I 've also shown as " OWC2004 ? " the approximate level of the oil water contact ( OWC ) at the time the picture denotes ( perhaps 2004 ) , and , in yellow , the crest of each structure , which is where the water will reach to when all production by waterflood is over .
At that point , this picture would show those " hills " as all pale blue ( at least if all oil could successfully be produced ) .
As you can see , the picture shows quite a lot of the " hills " already being free of oil .
Although it 's hard to estimate precisely , I do n't think you could say that the average height of the top of the pale blue swept area has reached less than 55 % of the height of the structure .
Similarly , I think it 's definitely less than 75 % of the way up - overall it looks about 2/3 of the way up .
I encourage you to stare at the picture and make your own subjective estimate to see if you think my range is reasonable - I will be comparing this to other estimates later .
However , something that 's important to understand about this picture is that the vertical scale is very exaggerated to make the shape clearer .
Ghawar is really enormous and almost flat .
It 's about 175 miles from tip to toe ( ie 2 1/2 hours driving at freeway speeds ) .
And the structure slopes up to the center at only a few degrees .
The effect of that is to make it so that 2/3 of the way up the structure is a lot more than 2/3 of the oil gone .
This next picture shows a model estimate that I generated ( explained later ) of the effect of being two thirds of the way up in the ' Ain Dar and Shedgum regions .
On the left is how much oil was there to begin with ( darker red is more oil ) and on the right is how much would be left ( roughly ) if the OWC were 2/3 of the way up the structure like that .
Model of original distribution of oil reserves in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum ( left ) , and distribution after oil water contact is approximately 2/3 of the way up structure .
The model does n't quite distribute the oil the same as the Linux supercluster picture , but it's in the ballpark , and because it allows you to effectively look straight down , you can see how much oil has gone .
We will discuss exactly what this model is doing later .
For now I just want to illustrate that 2/3 of the way up the structure is a lot of oil gone .
However , after all this discussion of the Linux supercluster picture , you might be wondering whether there 's any reason to think it has any fidelity to the true state of affairs in Ghawar .
The paper from which the picture comes is a general survey for an industry magazine of the use of Linux superclusters for large scale computation tasks in the oil industry .
The authors discuss as one of their examples Saudi Aramco 's use of these types of massively parallel computing clusters to simulate oil and water flow in their reservoirs :
One approach is to not make the assumptions .
Instead , brute force can be used to run very large simulations where the best geological understanding is rendered in detail .
Already , models run at higher resolution than in the past .
In the case of managing the world 's largest asset , the Ghawar Oil Field , Saudi Aramco runs its POWERS simulator on a massively parallel HPC .
As of 2004 , this 128 - node Pentium IV ® - based machine had run full field simulations with between 10 million and 100 million cells and more than 4,000 wells , with larger runs pending .
These simulations are run with multicomponent hydrocarbon models , waterflooding with varying brine chemistries , and dual - perm response to match fracture - flow history .
Some runs include CO 2 floods .
This capability not only allows Saudi Aramco to run fairly large models with minimal or no scale up , but also to execute history matches extremely rapidly ( in some cases , in hours to days ) .
Saudi Aramco has used this capability for infill drilling , water cut management , breakthrough prediction and other basic reservoir engineering choices ( Figure 3 ) .
New data can then be incorporated into updated geological models that underpin the simulations .
And that 's all the text covering Figure 3 .
So , clearly the picture is not intended as a report on the status of Saudi fields .
Instead , it 's intended as an illustration of how cool their simulators are .
The question is , did Saudi Aramco a ) accidentally publish to the entire world , in an obscure publication , a state of the art simulation generated picture that revealed very clearly the status of their biggest oil field as of 2004 ( the year that the text references simulations as being done ) ?
Or b ) give away a simulation of some other year , maybe far in the future , or some hypothetical scenario that bears no relationship to current reality ?
Clearly , the question cannot be answered beyond reasonable doubt from the text above .
So now we will turn to other evidence .
First , however , we will have to gain a better understanding of the nature of the reservoir , so that we can better understand that evidence .
Before moving on , I want to briefly draw attention to the mention that some simulation runs " include CO 2 floods " .
This suggests planning for tertiary recovery approaches ( low production rate , expensive , final resort ways to get the last oil out of a field ) .
Geology and Reservoir Properties
The structure of Ghawar is a large anticline - the compressive forces of plate tectonics have caused the almost level strata of sediments to buckle up very slightly .
The reservoir rock , which is known as the Arab D layer , was laid down in a large shallow sea off the Arabian coast during Jurassic times .
It is essentially limestone formed of the remains of countless marine organisms that lived in that sea , died , and fell to the bottom .
In places where the sea was shallow , storms and currents stirred up the sediments and ensured that only larger grains could stay in place - these ultimately formed highly porous rock which could hold a lot of fluid ( high ) , and in many cases allow that fluid to flow freely amongst the pores ( high - related to porosity , but not the same thing as sometimes ample pores can be poorly connected to one another ) .
In other places , deeper waters allowed the deposition of very fine particles which formed lime mudstones with limited pore space and even poorer flow properties .
Overall , the sea rose at the beginning of the deposition of the Arab D reservoir , and so the rocks at the bottom are poorer in reservoir qualities throughout the field .
As the sea gradually filled up with sediments over the course of 2 - 3 million years , it got shallower and the rock formed grew more porous .
Thus the rocks at the top of the reservoir are generally better .
However , the southern end of the reservoir was generally deeper water than the northern end , and the rocks there were substantially poorer even in these later stages .
However , considerable briefer variations happened at one time and another and there is significant vertical and lateral heterogeneity in the rock .
We can summarize the situation though by saying that there is about 250 ' - 330 ' of total Arab D rock , with more at the northern end .
Of this , 140 ' - 200 ' were traditionally considered sufficiently permeable to allow oil production , and constituted the " net pay " .
The bulk of the net pay occurs in the upper half of the strata - generally known as Zone 2 - but the balance occurs in a number of thinner layers scattered through the lower zone 3 , and even into the rarely discussed zone 4 at the bottom .
Eventually , the deposits climbed high enough and the sea retreated enough that the top of Ghawar became a large salt flat , which eventually formed into a thick impermeable layer of anhydrite .
Thus later , when oil from slightly older deposits began to rise up through fractures in the rocks below the Arab D reservoir to replace some of the water there , it encountered the anhydrite layer and could go no further .
Zone 1 is a transitional zone between the high quality zone 2 layers of reservoir and the overlying cap which will not support fluid flow at all .
To get a clearer sense of the zones have a look at this next picture ( you might want to click on it to get a larger version in its own window ) .
This shows the porosity , permeability , and rock type as a function of depth in one well somewhere in the Uthmaniyah region of Ghawar ( the paper from which it comes does not give a more precise location ) .
Well log somewhere in Uthmaniyah studied in Saner S. , and Sahin A. , " Lithological and Zonal Porosity - Permeability Distributions in the Arab - D Reservoir , Uthmaniyah Field , Saudi Arabia , " Bulletin Of The American Association Of Petroleum Geologists , Vol. 83 , No. 2 ( February 1999 ) , pp. 230-243 .
As you can see , there is about 250 ' of total ( ie gross ) reservoir in this well , and you should be able to see the clearly higher porosity and permeability in zone 2 versus zone 3 , especially the upper part of zone 2 ( we will discuss porosity and permeability more quantitatively later , but it might be worth noticing now that the permeability is on a log scale ) .
For another perspective on the situation , take a look at this next figure which comes from a 1962 analysis by RW Powers of Ghawar rock ( with some reconstruction by me ) .
This is how the figures were originally created from samples taken every six inches from an oil well , and then mounted on 1200 microscope slides :
A standard Leitz mechanical stage was converted to a point - stage by addition of a spring clip to engage notches filed in one of the traversing wheels .
These notches were spaced to allow a linear slide motion of 0.8 mm between stops .
Distance between point count lines was controlled by the second traversing wheel .
Numerous experiments were tried to determine an ideal spacing between lines of points for obtaining acceptable results in a minimum of time .
Initially a pattern with points 0.8 mm and lines of points 1.0 mm apart was used ( about 600 points per slide ) .
Compared with line integration results from the same slides , this point density gave no difference for any one constituent greater than 2 per cent .
Using a 0.8 by 2.0 mm grid on slides with irregular particle shape and poor sorting , the maximum difference was 4 per cent .
The difference increased progressively as distance between traverses increased .
Most slides were finally counted on a pattern of 0.8 by 2.0 mm ( about 300 points ) ...
Figure 3 shows the data recorded for each slide .
To record this information , a battery of 24 individual hand counters was mounted in lines corresponding to size classes and types of components .
For each stop of the point - count stage , a counter appropriate to the component or port type appearing under the cross hairs was punched .
At the same time , the apparent long axis of each originally sedimented grain was measured with a micrometer ocular and the proper size grade recorded by counter .
1200 slides , 300 points each , bent over the microscope , click , measure , click , measure , click , measure , day after day , week after week , month after month .
Heroic science .
All I did was cut and paste his figures together and then measure various things in them .
This is a log from a well in Haradh ( the southernmost , poorest part of the field ) :
Reconstructed well log for Haradh from Figure 12 of Powers , R.W. , " Arabian Upper Jurassic Carbonate Reservoir Rocks , " Ph.D. Dissertation , 1962 , Yale University , also AAPG Memoir 1 , pp. 122-192 .
The rightmost data is permeability with pink colored boxes for net pay in Zone 2 , green colored boxes for net pay in Zone 3 .
Next to right is porosity , and the rest of the data indicate the various subcomponents of the carbonate rocks that make up the reservoir .
Other boxes are missing data .
Imputation of zone 2 and zone 3 to Powers logs based on author 's correlation to log data in Saner S. , and Sahin A. , " Lithological and Zonal Porosity - Permeability Distributions in the Arab - D Reservoir , Uthmaniyah Field , Saudi Arabia , " Bulletin Of The American Association Of Petroleum Geologists , Vol. 83 , No. 2 ( February 1999 ) , pp. 230-243 .
Here we have only about 205 ' of gross reservoir - significantly less than in Uthmaniyah .
The colored boxes represent an analysis to determine the amount of net pay ( defined here as rock of permeability 3 milliDarcies or better ( anonymous industry experts assessed the boundary between " net " and " non-net " as anywhere from 10 mD to 0.3 mD , and report that over time the trend has been to count worse rock as included in the reservoir , a point we will return to ) .
You can see that zone 2 has a lot more net pay ( the pink boxes ) than zone 3 ( the green boxes ) .
This well has an estimated 136 feet of net pay .
( The " estimation " comes into it because we have to correct for missing data ) .
Hopefully , the gradient from Uthmaniyah down to Haradh is clear .
Everything is somewhat worse - there is less zone 2 in total , less of both zone 2 and 3 are " net " , the net there has worse porosity and permeability .
Wells further north than Uthmaniyah are roughly of similar nature , but a bit better : they have more zone 2 , more net pay in both zones 2 and 3 , and the net pay is better ( more porous and more permeable ) .
It 's also worth noting the enormous variations in the permeability , which is shown on a log scale .
Rock of permeability 1000 mD will , at the same pressure difference , carry 1000 times more fluid flow than rock of permeability 1 mD , and both extremes are common in the Ghawar reservoir rocks - the reservoir is not homogeneous at all , even in a single well .
Porosity varies in the range 5 % to 30 % , though the upper end of that range is not attained in this Haradh well .
If you study this next picture , it shows a series of well summary pictures from Powers 1962 paper , with the Zone 2 and 3 net shown in overlaid colors ( I determined the correspondence between the modern zone 1 - 4 scheme and Powers upper / middle / lower scheme by detailed correlation of wells in Uthmaniyah - the bottom of his " Middle " cuts off about 10 ' above the bottom of zone 2 in Uthmaniyah ) .
I cut and pasted Powers pictures together into a north - south spectrum of just the wells he analyzes in Ghawar .
Click on the picture to get a bigger version in its own window :
Well summary figures from Powers , R.W. , " Arabian Upper Jurassic Carbonate Reservoir Rocks , " Ph.D. Dissertation , 1962 , Yale University , also AAPG Memoir 1 , pp. 122-192 .
I have rearranged them in a north - south sequence just for Ghawar , and shown them with a well log from Saner S. , and Sahin A. , " Lithological and Zonal Porosity - Permeability Distributions in the Arab - D Reservoir , Uthmaniyah Field , Saudi Arabia , " Bulletin Of The American Association Of Petroleum Geologists , Vol. 83 , No. 2 ( February 1999 ) , pp. 230-243 .
The colors indicate Power 's " Upper " and " Middle " Arab D ( pink ) and his " Lower " green .
The boundary between middle and lower appears to be roughly 10 feet above the modern Zone 2 / Zone 3 boundary ( based on other correlations not shown here ) .
In addition to the trend in the amount of zone 2 to zone 3 , you should also look at the " Calcarenitic and coarse carbonate clastic " component .
That 's the good stuff : big open grain structure that will let lots of fluid flow .
You will see that there is far more of this open grained rock in the north than the south .
There is also more in the upper part of the wells than in the lower .
Thus it is that the rock in the south is significantly poorer than the rock in the north , though this is a continuum , rather than a fundamentally different kind of rock .
The largest depth of gross reservoir in any of these wells is about 270 - 280 ' .
However , in the literature there is discussion of as much as 300 ' - 330 ' of reservoir when the very poor quality Zone 4 is included ( zone 4 is frequently not mentioned or studied , presumably because it makes a very limited contribution to production in most locations in Ghawar ) .
The approximate location of the wells in that last picture is as follows :
Approximate location of Ghawar wells studied in Powers , R.W. , " Arabian Upper Jurassic Carbonate Reservoir Rocks , " Ph.D. Dissertation , 1962 , Yale University , also AAPG Memoir 1 , pp. 122-192 .
As you can see , they form a reasonable sampling of the field , though not as good in the south as the north .
Development History of the Field
Logically enough , the development of the field began with the good parts in the north and has gradually proceeded south .
Ain Dar , Shedgum , and Uthmaniyah all began production in the 1950s , Hawiyah not until the 1970s , and although there was some limited development earlier , full injection supported production in Haradh has been bought on in three phases - Haradh I in 1996 , Haradh II in 2003 , and Haradh III ( the " toe " of the " boot " ) only in 2006 .
An anonymous correspondent recently gave me a hard copy of the 1979 staff report to the US Senate Subcommittee on International Economic Policy on " The Future of Saudi Arabian Oil Production " ( the report mentioned in Appendix C of Matt Simmons ' book " Twilight in the Desert " ) .
It has the first reliable figures for plateau production in all the operating areas that I have seen .
At that time , production was as follows ( either actual or planned ) :
Operating Area Production Ain Dar 1.0 mb/d Shedgum 1.25 mb/d North Uthmaniyah 1.9 mb/d South Uthmaniyah 0.4 mb/d Hawiyah / Haradh 1.3 mb/d ( est ) Total 5.85 mb/d ( est )
The figures for Hawiyah / Haradh were planning assumptions , not based on actual production .
We know from a recent paper that Haradh produces 300 kb / d from each of three operating areas , for a total of 0.9 mb / d. Production of 0.4mb/ d in Hawiyah would look about right as it has similar area to South Uthmaniyah , about half the area of Haradh , and quality intermediate between those two .
We will discuss more recent production history in a little while , but this gives a sense of the relative importance of different areas .
The important point is that the northern end of the field , from North Uthmaniyah up , has historically been far more productive , with over 2/3 of the productive capacity on these figures .
The combination of more rapid production and a much earlier start to production would certainly make it plausible that these areas of the field would become depleted first .
Evidence of Recent Flood Front Location in South ' Ain Dar
Now that we have a feel for what the reservoir rock layers are like , and the different operating areas of the field , we are in a better position to assess various other pieces of evidence for the position of the flood front in recent years .
The first piece of evidence comes from a paper by Hussain et al Optimizing Maximum - Reservoir - Contact wells : Application to Saudi Arabian Reservoirs presented to the 2005 International Petroleum Technology Conference ( IPTC 10395 ) .
The paper is a discussion of several well planning exercises in Ain Dar and Shedgum .
Individual simulations were performed to assess the likely lifetime performance of the wells .
However , our immediate interest is in a picture which shows the location of one of the planned wells :
Location of " ANDR - XYZ " well from Figure 11 of IPTC 10395 .
There is no key for this figure in the paper , and nor is the location shown in terms of the rest of the field .
Thus , the first time I looked at this it seemed completely mysterious .
However , after staring at it long enough , it turns out it can be decoded to determine quite precisely the state of the field in South ' Ain Dar and the saddle between South Ain Dar and Shedgum .
The key thing is to look at the contours .
I have labelled them more clearly , and shown the relationship to an overall map of ' Ain Dar / Shedgum , a key to the oil layer from Figure 8 of the same paper , and the relationship to the Linux Supercluster picture .
Location of " ANDR - XYZ " well from Figure 11 of IPTC 10395 , with added contour labels , oil layer key from similar Figure 8 of the same paper , and relationship to contour map and Linux supercluster paper .
Let me try to explain what you are looking at here .
Firstly , it 's critical to understand what the contours mean .
These are depths below sea level in both Figure 11 and the fragment of the map from Greg Croft 's page ( on which much more later ) .
The contour heights refer to the top of the Arab - D reservoir .
So when looking at a point on the 5800 contour , say , we are looking down on the top of a column of something like 275 ' ( give or take ) of reservoir rock .
Since the top of the reservoir at that point is at 5800 ' below sea level , the bottom of it would be at 6075 ' ( in round numbers ) .
Of that 275 ' of reservoir or so , about 200 ' or is actually good productive rock , while the rest is marginal enough that , at least in the past , it would not have been considered , but the 200 ' of good rock is scattered in layers amongst the total 275 ' of rock column .
Within the context of a small area like Figure 11 , the thickness of the reservoir probably does n't vary much .
In particular , any variations in structure thickness probably do n't have much to do with the variations in structure height , since the thickness is controlled by events when the rock was being laid down in the late Jurassic , while the height is controlled by tectonic distortion of the structure during the Cretaceous , 80 million years later .
Now , if you look at the location for Fig 11 ( 100 ' contour interval ) I have proposed in the overall ' Ain Dar / Shedgum picture ( 250 ' interval ) , hopefully it is clear that there is really no other candidate location that could work at all .
To get those contours to match , you have to be high up on the south side of a east - west saddle that tops out at a little below 6000 ' .
There 's only one place like that .
Once you 've got your mind around the contours , the next thing to look at is the colored regions , which almost certainly represent the thickness of the oil layer , with yellow representing something close to the original thickness of the layer , and the other colors representing less and less thickness of oil ( because water is intruding into that part of the oil layer as the water advances and the oil retreats up the structure to be produced out of wells up there ) .
A key from Figure 8 of the same paper , which shows a well location in Shedgum is included above , and this figure likely has a similar color scheme .
So , given that , it should be clear that the picture above is similar to the Linux Supercluster picture .
A relatively narrow ribbon of oil lies along the top of the south ' Ain Dar cap and goes across the saddle to Shedgum , while a much narrower ribbon goes up towards the North ' Ain Dar crest .
On the crest , there is no oil column below the 5900 ' contour , and we do n't have a full column below 5800 ' .
However , the oil across the saddle dips down , and we have a full column crossing the saddle down at some level between 6000 ' and 6100 ' below sea level .
Back before oil production began , oil in this area went down a little below 6500 ' , while the top of the South ' Ain Dar crest is a little shallower than 5600 feet .
So overall , we are about 2/3 of the way up the structure on the crest here , but have some extra oil in the saddle .
So this is very much consistent with the Linux Supercluster image being a 2004 image ( given this Figure 11 is from a 2005 paper ) .
A Word on Uncertainties
Before we go much further , I want to say a few words about errors and uncertainties .
One of the things I have attempted to do in this analysis is to make quantitative estimates of the uncertainty in all the important things I am analyzing , and you will be seeing more and more of this from here on out .
Some folks who saw early drafts of parts of this analysis experienced some confusion if they do n't think this way all the time , so let me stop here for a micro-lecture on that subject .
When I say , as I will shortly , that I believe the ultimate recovered reserves ( URR ) of oil from Ghawar via waterflood ( that is excluding tertiary recovery techniques ) will be 96 ± 8 billion barrels ( gb ) of oil , that could be translated informally as follows :
I do n't know exactly what the ultimate waterflood recovery will be , but more likely than not it will be in the range 88 - 104 gb ( this is known as the " one sigma " range ) .
It 's really quite unlikely that it would be outside the range 80 - 112gb , but it 's not inconceivable ( the " two sigma " range ) .
If my estimate is right , it is for practical purposes impossible for Ghawar ultimate waterflood recovery to lie outside the range 72 - 120gb ( the three sigma range ) .
If it did , my estimation or error analysis would almost certainly be mistaken .
In particular , if my estimation and error analysis are correct , then someone claiming that the Ghawar URR will be 130gb , as Saudi Aramco does , must be relying on something other than the waterflood for the last portion of the oil .
Otherwise , their view and mine would be statistically incompatible , and one of us would be in error in some fashion .
Let me take a moment to introduce a convention here .
Conscious of having both highly technical readers , and less technical readers , I am attempting to mark off sections of text that use a little more math or statistics in small print .
Less technical readers may free to skip these , while more technical readers can delve into them .
More formally , in a wide variety of practical situations , the results of a complex calculation that brings together many different unrelated uncertainties will be approximately " normally distributed " - having a special mathematical form originally due to the German mathematician Gauss .
If so , then we can say that the odds of the end result being no more than " one sigma away " from the estimate is 68 % .
The probability of being no more than two sigmas away is 95 % , and the probability of being no more than three sigmas away is 99.7 % - that is there is only 3 chances in a 1000 of being more than three sigmas from the estimate if that estimate and uncertainty were correct .
If the assumption of a normal distribution is in serious doubt ( which I do n't believe it is here ) , then a pretty much universally applicable theorem called Chebyshev 's inequality guarantees us that the worst case is that the two sigma range is at least 3 / 4 probable , and the three sigma range is at least 8/9 probable .
Where possible , I have estimated uncertainties in various quantities by using some type of sampling or statistical procedure .
In some cases , that is infeasible .
For example , we presently estimate the amount to oil in Uthmaniyah by combining three pictures visually .
This is necessarily a somewhat subjective procedure .
In those cases , I make three estimates : the value that seems to me most likely , the value that seems the least that could possibly be the case , and the value that seems the most that could possibly be the case .
I then take the average of those values as my estimate , treating the range from the smallest estimate to the largest estimate as the two sigma uncertainty range .
In practice , such estimates work well when combined with a number of other independent uncertainties .
There are well established mathematical rules for combining uncertainties , which I have employed .
For example , let 's look again at the picture above of South ' Ain Dar , and try to use the less formal procedure to estimate the average height of the oil water contact , and an uncertainty in the average .

My read on the picture is lowest conceivable : 6100 ' , highest conceivable : 5900 ' , likeliest , 6000 ' , so I would quote 6000 ± 50 ' .
Note the latter is intended as the one - sigma uncertainty in the average , not the range of variation which would clearly be greater .
To compare , I then took the first 20 in a list of randomly sampled locations in the picture , and , on the assumption that the color scale runs from zero to 275 ' ± 25 ' of gross oil layer above the water , I obtained an average and standard error of 6032 ' ± 38 ' .
So the two estimates agree within error bars , though the latter is likely a little better estimate .
Flood Height in North ' Ain Dar
Next , we turn to a more complex line of evidence that comes from the 2005 paper on water management in North Ain Dar ( SPE 93439 ) .
A number of figures in that paper provide data that we can interpret to constrain the position of the OWC in 2004 for comparison with what we have inferred so far .
The first is this picture :
Fig 5 of SPE 93439 .
They do n't spell out for us where this picture is , but the outline can be fitted nicely into better maps that have contours :
" Flood front advance in the most mature area of North ' Ain Dar " .
Fig 5 of SPE 93439 located on two other contour maps of North ' Ain Dar .
From this , I estimate the following heights for the OWC at different times :
1975 - 6550 ' ± 50 ' 1979 - 6475 ' ± 50 ' 1980 - 6450 ' ± 50 '
Next , there are several sources that , taken together , allow us to establish the rate that the OWC ( oil - water contact remember ) has climbed since .
For example , there are flowmeter profiles for three different wells in Figure 8 .
Each of these shows the cumulative percentage of fluid as a function of depth in the well , with green being oil , and blue being water .
As you can see , typically the water 's contribution is in the bottom of the well , and the oil in the top .
The dividing line is the oil water contact in that well , and it rises over time .
Flowmeter records for three wells in North ' Ain Dar ( click buttons to switch wells ) .
Position of flood front was estimated using grid and highest location in which water is emerging from well ( as indicated by a right edge to the blue region that was not vertical ) .
Source Figure 8 of SPE 93439
Now , we do n't know the exact depth of these wells ( no depth scale is provided ) , and we do n't have an a - priori reasons to suppose they are all the same depth , but the form of the profiles , with copious production from the upper half to two thirds and much smaller production in the lower one third to one half suggests that we have all of zone 2 and most or all of zone 3 .
It does n't appear we have zone 4 or the copious zone 2 production would make up less than half of the profile .
If we thus assume we have 250 ' of depth in all cases , and then plot the resulting depths versus time on a common graph , the overall agreement is quite striking :
Rate of vertical flood front progress inferred from Fig 8 and Fig 11 of SPE 93439
In addition to the three well curves ( with linear fits ) , I have added a blue line , which is in an arbitrary vertical position on the graph , but the slope of which is determined by translating the average 5.096 feet / day horizontal flood front velocity from this next graph in the same paper to a 0.0505 feet / day vertical velocity by assuming the original velocity was a southward velocity up the North ' Ain Dar ridge .
The agreement with the velocities determined from the well flowmeter profiles is excellent .
This is a striking illustration of the power of correlation to extract useful information from noisy uncertain data .
Horizontal flood front velocity in North ' Ain Dar from Figure 11 of SPE 93439 .
The combination of all this evidence gives an average vertical velocity of the flood front of 18.4 ± 0.7 feet / year over the period during which it was linear .
So we can start at the locations back in the late 70s from figure 5 , and extrapolate forward at this rate .
This next picture summarizes everything we know so far about the level of the oil water contact over time in North ' Ain Dar .
Summary so far of flood height estimates in North ' Ain Dar .
Starting at the left , we have , in turquoise , the SPE 93439 Fig 5 data for the far northern end of the northern ' Ain Dar ridge in the 1970s era .
Then we have the fairly constant 18.4 ' vertical feet / year march up the ridge from the Fig 11 flood front graph and the Fig 8 flowmeter profiles in the same paper .
Then , the pink point comes from translating the subjective visual estimates from the Linux Supercluster picture that I gave earlier .
Finally , we have the orange point being the South ' Ain Dar saddle estimate from sampling the IPTC 10395 Fig 11 .
Hopefully , you will agree that a pretty consistent picture is starting to emerge from this various evidence .
I have n't told you yet why I think the OOWC ( original oil water contact ) is where I show it , and you might also wonder why the OWC was still at the OOWC in 1976 , when production in this operating area began in 1951 .
Hold those questions for a couple of sections .
It 's time we started to talk about how to estimate how much oil is in these fields , and that will eventually clarify these points .
Framework for Understanding Volumetrics
So the procedure for estimating how much oil a given field might produce , or how much might be left at some point , is conceptually simple .
We need to know the volume of rock in the reservoir , what percentage of that rock is pore space ( the porosity ) , and what percentage of that pore space is occupied by oil , versus other fluids ( the ) .
Porosities of the Arab - D reservoir rock in Ghawar can range from a few percent up to as much as 30 % or so .
One other wrinkle is that the oil will shrink as it comes out of the ground ( due to natural gas coming out of solution in it ) , and we care about how much oil there isit has done this .
This shrinkage factor is known as the formation volume factor .
So if we multiply these four numbers together : rock volume , porosity , oil saturation , and the inverse of the formation volume factor , then we will know how much oil is in the ground at some given time , if it were brought to surface conditions .
Some more complications arise .
The simplest way to assess the volume of rock would be to measure the area on a map of the reservoir , and then multiply that area by the average thickness of the reservoir rock .
But to be more accurate , we will need to understand the shape of the reservoir in three dimensions .
Borrowing Euan 's nice picture again , we can illustrate the general idea in cross section :
Schematic illustration of situation in an oil reservoir with oil below and gas cap above .
Picture courtesy Euan Mearns .
In the case of Ghawar , the main complication arises from the triangular wedges where the oil runs into the water ( ie the oil water contact ) , which can be several miles wide .
When I said " roughly speaking " , one of the issues of interest is that not all the porosity in the green zone is full of oil that can come out .
Firstly , it is never the case that pores are 100 % filled with oil even in the reservoir at the outset .
There is invariably at least a little bit of water in there too , clinging as tiny droplets stuck inside little pore channels somewhere deep in the rock .
The fraction of such water is known as the initial water saturation .
Better , more open rock , will have lower initial water saturation , particularly if it is a long way above the oil water contact .
In that circumstance , the water saturation might start out as low as a few percent .
However , in very poor quality rock in the transition zone near the water , water saturation can start out as high as fifty percent even in an area that is nominally oil .
All cases in between occur .
Furthermore , after the flood front has passed by a given piece of rock , and water has been washing through it for a couple of decades , there will still be oil left in that piece of rock , again in the form of droplets trapped inside pores that cannot move .
This oil cannot be produced by waterflood alone - if it ever comes out it will be because of additional ( ie tertiary ) recovery techniques , should such prove economic .
The fraction of rock so occupied by oil at the end is known as the final oil saturation ( and the fraction occupied by water is the final water saturation ) .
Thus , in a given barrel of reservoir rock , the fraction of the barrel that will end up as oil on the surface is given by the porosity percentage ( how much pore space there is to hold fluid of any kind ) , multiplied by the difference between the initial and final oil saturations , divided by the formation volume factor that controls how much the oil will shrink by the time it gets to the tanker .
The remaining wrinkle is the net / gross distinction we briefly discussed earlier .
Fluid in the reservoir during production moves because of pressure gradients .
The injectors are increasing the pressure below the oil , and this is exerting force on the oil to move upwards and towards the producing wells .
However , the amount of movement that the oil makes in response to a given pressure difference depends on the permeability of the rock .
As we discussed earlier , this is related to the porosity , but not perfectly so .
In some rocks , the pores are poorly connected with one another , and it is hard to force fluid through them .
In others , the pores are well connected and fluid flows more freely .
Now , some rock has such poor permeability that , even though it contains some oil , that oil will not come out of it in any reasonable period of time .
Flow time is measured in centuries rather than the years - decades required to meaningfully contribute to the oil production .
Oil geologists and petroleum engineers distinguish net pay from gross reservoir .
The former excludes the not - sufficiently permeable rock , whereas the latter is everything .
Typically , there are layers of pay interspersed with non-pay , and this is very much the case in Ghawar , as we saw in the well logs earlier .
However , the distinction between pay and non-pay has been shifting over time .
The only data on this comes from Euan and I asking our networks of anonymous industry advisors .
We got answers ranging from 1 mD to 10 mD for the 1980 timeframe , but also a statement that at least one company ( that you 've heard of ) will sometimes now consider rock down to 0.3 mD as pay , given better technology to access such poor rock ( and , perhaps , lack of enough better reservoirs to drill into , meaning companies can't afford to be too picky ) .
The main technology enabler has been precise geo-steered horizontal wells , allowing wells to be drilled horizontally along the low - permeability layers , from whence the oil will slowly drip .
These variables tend to be loosely correlated .
Rock of higher porosity is more likely to be permeable , and more likely to have a low initial water saturation .
In short , it is " good " rock .
" Bad " rock has less pore space , poor flow properties even in the limited space there is , and high water content at the outset .
With that background , let 's now turn to the available map data , which is one critical component of the volumetric oil estimation we will do .
Maps and Map Corrections Unfortunately , the Saudi Oil Ministry neglects to publish complete and detailed maps of its oil fields .
In lieu of that , we have a mixture of old maps , and incomplete maps from technical papers .
The main thing we are looking for in a map is detailed and accurate contours of the top of the reservoir .
As you will see , Ghawar is about 5000 ' - 6500 ' below sea level .
Six maps are the main useful ones :
Some effort went into comparing these maps and deciding on the most reliable .
Obviously , errors in the area of the field will directly translate into errors in the amount of oil in it .
Euan reported the large industry report map to have a considerably longer Ghawar than the Croft map .
Careful measurements based on same contour analysis do not support this .
I find the distance from the bottom of the 6000 ' contour in Haradh to the 6400 ' line in North Ain Dar to be 143.7 miles in the Croft map , and 140.7 miles in the industry map , a variation of only 2 % .
My best reconciliation of the two maps , on identical scales , looks as follows :
Reconciliation of Greg Croft map with industry map .
This does not show an overall systematic scaling error between the two maps in my judgement , but many local variations in the exact structure ( note to others trying to work on this problem : it 's very important to compare contour - to - contour , not just look at the overall outline , since one map has contours going deeper than the other ) .
Clearly , at least one of these maps is somewhat imperfect .
An analysis of the more detailed map of ' Ain Dar turns up more serious problems however :
Reconciliation of Greg Croft map in ' Ain Dar with detailed map of that area .
Even on a equal - contour basis , the industry report map has significant areas above the oil water contact line that are not in the Croft map .
This is especially problematic in North ' Ain Dar , where I estimate the area difference to be about 50 % ( Euan suggested 25 % ) .
Euan 's reconciliation of the well location map with the Croft map suggests the same issues apply to Shedgum .
For this reason , I decided to use the asphaltene map for estimates in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum .
This map reconciles quite well with the industry report map :
Reconciliation of asphaltene map with industry report detailed map of that area .
Both appear to be more modern accurate maps .
The industry report map has a scale , and this was used to establish the scale for the asphaltene map , which is not provided with a scale in Saudi Aramco papers I have seen .
I did the reconciliation twice on different days and only came out 1 % different in the resulting scale , an error which is negligible compared to other uncertainties in the problem .
In the rest of the field , I used the Greg Croft map .
However , reconciliation of the Croft map with the asphaltene map suggests Croft is about 20 % too narrow in Uthmaniyah .
The approach I have taken to this overall problem is to correct reserve estimates for Uthmaniyah upwards by 20 % and to view all regions estimated with the Croft map as having a 20 % map uncertainty in their reserves .
No corrections were applied to Hawiyah which seems to be about the right size .
The special problems in Haradh are discussed later .
Reconciliation of asphaltene map with Croft map on same scale , illustrating narrowness of Uthmaniyah structure in Croft map , and general undersizing of north end of Ghawar in Croft map .
Modeling the Structure
As part of this analysis , I wrote a C program to parse an image of the map contours , and for each of the Croft map and the asphaltene map , used it to build a three dimensional model of the reservoir based on the map .
This formed the foundation of my estimates of oil reserves and depletion .
I linearly interpolated between contour lines , and where I had indications that the oil extended outside the structure in the map contours , I extrapolated from the last two contour lines on that edge of the structure .
I placed the top of each crest midway between the lowest contour that no map showed for that crest , and the highest contour that any map showed for it , and linearly interpolated up to that point ( ie my crests are conical in the last 75 - 125 ' ) .
While we will cover more aspects of this modeling as we go forward , this montage should give you some feeling for the kinds of things the code has to do , and hopefully provide visual evidence that it works correctly :
Four views of the Greg Croft map of Ghawar .
Left shows contours individually colored on a black background .
Second shows each contour step colored to illustrate structure height .
The third is the same as the second , but with each operational zone separately colored .
Rightmost version shows the density of original reserves according to an earlier version of the reserve model discussed in detail below ( for illustration only ) .
Since my code parses these maps and counts each pixel to estimate area , and since each pixel represents a small fraction of a mile , errors due to digitization of the map are negligible .
The way I do linear interpolation introduces a small amount of noise between contours that is different than the noise the real structure would have .
This is expected to be small compared to other errors ( it 's more a visual issue than anything ) .
Original Oil Water Contact
In order to estimate the volume of oil - bearing rock reliably , we do n't just need the map , we also need to know where the oil is , and where the water is .
That is , we need to estimate the position of the oil water contact , which forms a surface that intersects the base of the reservoir .
You might imagine that the oil water contact would form a level plane , but in fact it is tilted and somewhat uneven .
The main reason for this is that the water under the oil varies in its density because of large changes in salt content in different parts of the reservoir .
The approach I took to this issue was to fit a tilted plane to available data on the position of the oil water contact .
The regression ( model fit ) provided estimates of the uncertainty in original oil water contact ( OOWC ) position .
Let 's first take the case of the Croft map , which was used for estimates of original reserves in the south of the field .
Estimation of the position of the OOWC ( original oil water contact ) was carried out as follows for areas other than Haradh .
The map showing OOWC estimates in the 1959 Aramco AAPG paper was reconciled with the Croft map as follows :
Reconciliation of Greg Croft map with 1959 Aramco OOWC data .
The regression resulted in a plane that has the following characteristics :
It reaches the neck between ' Ain Dar and Fazran at 6560 feet depth ( 64.7 ' standard error in the height constant )
It rises by 2.45 feet / mile to the south ( 0.45 feet / mile standard error )
It dips by 8.9 feet / mile to the east ( 1.9 feet / mile standard error )
The model has an R2 of 83 % ( ie 83 % of the data variance is explained by the model ) , the model is significant with p=0.03 ( F - test ) , and the average deviation of data from model is 51.5 ' .
This OOWC was put into the overall original reserves analysis .
The relative error due to OOWC uncertainty was estimated by moving the plane height up and down by one standard error in the height constant .
That resulted in a relative error of 5 % in Hawiyah and Uthmaniyah .
Haradh is known to have its own local OOWC tilt dynamics that are more pronounced than the rest of the field , and furthermore , the 1959 OOWC measurements constrain the Haradh OOWC only very weakly .
The best available data come from SPE 71339 by Stenger et al and titled Assessing the Oil Water Contact in Haradh Arab D. The following is a reworking of their Figure 10 , with a reconcilliation of the Croft map , and annotations in blue of the absolute depths based on the text of SPE 71339 .
Estimation of the position of the OOWC ( original oil water contact ) was carried out as follows for areas other than Haradh .
The map showing OOWC estimates in the 1959 Aramco AAPG paper was reconciled with the Croft map as follows :
Reconciliation of Greg Croft map with SPE 71339 Figure 10 , with absolute depths annotated in blue .
Stenger proposes that the main explanation for the uneven oil column is the presence of very saline water under the oil in the east , and a localized source of much fresher water in the west , close to the point of highest oil contact .
It did not seem practical to base an interpolation model for the depth on these data - clearly any linear model will fail badly , but the data are inadequate to suggest what kind of non-linear model would be suited .
It appears that the main effect of the OOWC is to add to the oil filled area to the east of the Croft map .
Accordingly , we treated this issue by adding a 20 % upwards correction to the Haradh original reserve estimates , with ten percentage points of uncertainty .
Turning now to the northern areas of the field , we use the ashphaltene map shown to the right .
Splines were fitted to the contours , and these splines were parsed to generate a three dimensional model .
The map shows the oil water contact as the blue line around the edge of the map , or in places , in the interior of the structure .
The regression fitted to depths inferred from this blue line , has the slope of 2.5 feet downward for every mile to the north and 6.6 feet downward for every mile to the East .
The r2 of the model was 48 % , and the uncertainty in the vertical height was 23 feet ( in other words , compared to the whole field , the regression in just the northern fields finds less systematic height variation , less uncertainty in the height of the contact , and so a larger fraction of the variation is noise , rather than systematic trend .
This map is believed to be quite accurate , but it did prove necessary to make some modest corrections to the model based on it , in a manner I document after I have gotten a little further in my development .
Gas Caps
North and South ' Ain Dar both have gas caps which are mentioned in two papers that we have studied ( SPE 81567 and SPE 81425 ) .
The first of these papers ( from 2003 ) explains the situation :
The Arab - D reservoir of Ghawar Field contains an undersaturated light oil .
The bubble point pressure is ~ 1900 psi at the reservoir temperature of 215oF and the average gas oil ratio is ~ 570 scf / stb .
The reservoir pressure at present is over 3000 psi .
In the 1960s and 1970s the associated gases from part of the field were injected back into the reservoir at two locations due to unavailability of gas processing facilities and to avoid excessive flaring .
The injected gases have formed two separate gas caps in the field ( north and south gas - caps , Figure 1 ) .
In recent years oil production has started from these gas - cap regions .
The two papers show these images of the gas caps :
The left image appears to be more schematic , whereas the right image , although hand drawn , appears to attempt show the actual shape and to be based on wells that have gas production .
Both images show the gas caps as similar size , though the left image is about 20 % larger in area .
We would strongly expect that gas in the very high quality upper regions of the reservoir in Ain Dar would be able to reach gravitational equilibrium quickly in a static environment .
So the fact that the base of the gas is not level in the right hand image is in need of explanation .
Fractional_Flow and I developed the following explanation : asymmetries in the amount of oil production in the fields are pulling the gas caps down out of equilibrium .
In North ' Ain Dar , the north east flank is the largest and shallowest part of the structure , and production in this area has likely pulled the gas cap down towards it .
In the case of south Ain Dar , the south west is larger and less steep that other sides ( except for the saddle , which we know has n't been produced as heavily as some other places since it still was shown as having a full oil layer in a 2005 paper ) , so that the southern gas cap has been pulled to the southwest , though not by nearly as much as the northern gas cap , the structural asymmetries being less .
The approach taken to estimating the size of the gas cap in this analysis was to create a spline copy of the gas cap outline from the right picture , and then move it to the top of the structure , as though it was in gravitational equilibrium , and then , using my 3D model of the field , find the amount of vertical offset in OWC required to create an oil distribution that just matched the gas cap .
The lower boundary of this oil was then treated as missing due to the gas cap in further analysis .
This picture illustrates the process :
Gas caps from SPE 81567 moved back into gravitational equilibrium , and shown on model with OWC moved up to believed offset of gas cap ( shown with pale blue labels ) .
The error in the size of the gas cap was estimated roughly from the 20 % difference in size between the two images of the gas caps that we have .
Note , there is some not -quantifiable possibility that this approach to gas cap estimation is systematically wrong if the gas is smeared out in a much thinner layer than gravitational equilibrium at the top of the structure would suggest .
With the map modeled , the oil water contact modeled , and the gas caps estimated , we now know the large - scale geometry of the reservoir .
We turn to the quantitative parameters for the reservoir rock .
Data for Reserve Estimation
Hopefully you have some qualitative feeling for the types of variations in Ghawar Arab - D properties from the earlier discussion , and so let us now turn to the summary data recorded by Greg Croft , but which come from Saudi Aramco , which is the most obvious public basis for estimating how much oil would be under any given square mile of our maps .
This data essentially comes from back when Aramco was operated by a consortium of American oil companies , and thus likely represents a best circa 1980 understanding of the field parameters , which would have been based on extensive operating experience and well logs from around the field done by professionals from major international oil companies .
In short , this data is not to be taken lightly ( as has been repeatedly emphasized to me by anonymous industry advisers ) .
The data we need for this analysis can be summarized thus :
Haradh Hawiyah Uthmaniyah Shedgum Ain Dar Porosity 14 % 17 % 18 % 19 % 19 % Net Pay 140 ' 180 ' 180 ' 194 ' 204 ' Formation Volume Factor 1.27 1.3 1.31 1.35 1.34 Initial Water Saturation 11 % 11 % 11 % 11 % 11 %
As you can see , we have almost everything we need now to estimate the amount of oil originally in Ghawar , given a 3D model of the field .
But not quite .
Specifically , this does not tell us how much oil is left behind after the flood ( we need the final oil saturation , or equivalently , the final water saturation - the two together have to add to 100 % in this system so if you know one , you know the other ( with the exception of the ' Ain Dar gas caps ) ) .
And that , alas , will take us on a long digression .
But just before we go , notice also that the 11 % initial water saturation is a little odd in that it does n't vary with operating area .
We might have expected that number to get worse ( ie higher ) as we went south into poorer rocks that would trap more little water droplets that oil could n't displace .
So there is some suggestion that perhaps that 11 % might be a whole field average , rather than measured in each subfield .
I amassed two general types of evidence that bear on the initial and final water saturations , and I shall give one example of each type .
The first type of evidence comess from looking at simulation cross sections .
For example , here is a blown - up portion of a picture of a reservoir simulation cross section in simulated year 2004 in North Ain Dar from Fig 9a of SPE 93439 .
Numbering of layers in ' Ain Dar simulation of year 2004 from Fig 9a of SPE 93439 ) .
I have numberered the 13 layers that the simulation divides the rock into , and the lateral grid cell index can also be counted off ( rather more easily ) .
Once numbered , it is possible to generate a random sample of grid cell addresses , and , using the color scale , measure the saturation in each one .
We avoid cells very close to the original oil water contact , and we also avoid cells which have not had the same color for at least a decade ( ie where the simulated saturation might still be changing noticeably ) .
In particular , we do n't count unswept areas in the final saturation - if any areas are finally unswept we will take account of that in a separate sweep efficiency parameter .
This allows us to form a random sample of what the simulator considers the population of block final saturations is , at least for this particular location in the field .
Since Saudi Aramco uses state of the art simulation methodologies , has extensive well log data and production history to match to , and since a central point of the simulations is to estimate and maximize ultimate recovery we have reason to think that the simulation 's final saturations will have some fidelity to the true situation in the reservoir .
The other type of evidence comes from studies of flushing particular samples of rock either in the lab or rock taken from the reservoir after flooding .
For example , this next figure shows relative permeability curves for composite samples of rock from three operating areas :
Relative permeability curves for three curves from rock samples in different operating areas .
Figure 10 of SPE 105114 ) .
The relative permeability of oil ( Kro ) represents the ability of that oil to flow as a function of water saturation .
When the relative permeability to oil goes to zero ( where the oil curves hit the x-axis ) then no further oil can flow and the rest will be left behind by the waterflood .
As you can see , these particular rock samples had a final water saturation of about 66 % in Uthmaniyah , 68 % in Hawiyah , and 76 % in Haradh .
That is to say , that at the end of waterflooding these particular samples , 34 % , 32 % , and 24 % respectively of the pore volume was left with oil that would not come out .
Similarly , the initial water saturation represents the point below which water will not flow ( ie Krw=0 ) .
It is not clear how typical these particular sample are of the areas in question however - there is no reason to expect rock in Hawiyah to be worse on average than rock in Haradh , and we know that in all areas the rock is very diverse and it would be possible to find both good rocks ( with a large oil window between the initial and final saturations ) , and poor rocks with a very small window ( such as the Hawiyah sample in the graph above ) .
Hopefully these samples will illustrate the kind of evidence available on saturations ; there is too much data to show all of it , but this next figure summarizes the evidence I was able to gather from Saudi Aramco technical papers .
Summary of evidence on initial and final water saturations taken from SPE 93439 , SPE 98847 , SPE 105114 , and SPE 105259 .
Circles are rock - flush based evidence , squares are simulation cross section evidence , and triangle is Croft quoted number for initial saturation .
Boxes with centerlines illustrate averages and uncertainties as described in the text .
Note that the error bars shown are not the standard error in the mean of each population , but rather the standard deviation of that particular population ( whether it be a sample of grid cells in a simulation visualization , or a family of experiments ) to better illustrate the variability at a given location , as well as the variability between locations ) .
As to the final saturations ( turquoise data ) , although there is significant variation from one place to another , there is no obvious trend in the data .
Thus , the approach I took was to treat the points on this graph as equally weighted individual observations around the field average for the final saturation .
The spread in these observations allows me to constrain an uncertainty for that average .
That gives a final water saturation of 65.1 % ± 2.4 % ( percentage point error , not relative error ) .
This is shown as the pale blue box around the 65 % point .
The only potential problems with this are if either the Saudi Aramco simulations and experiments lack fidelity , or if this sample of observations is somehow too biassed .
Overall , there is quite a lot of geographical spread in the field , but it is somewhat weighted towards north Ghawar .
So it may not extend quite as well to the south .
However , the data points that we do have for the south do not appear at all anomalous relative to the northern observations .
The initial saturation data ( red ) is more interesting and gave rise to an extended debate between Euan and I which ended up delaying this post a week .
The first thing to note is that the data appear quite bi-modal .
There are a number of observations which cluster around the Croft value of 11 % ( in fact they average 10.9 % with a standard error in that average of only 1.0 % ( percentage points ) .
There are also a number of much larger values that are closer to 40 % ( mean of 38.6 % ± 2.0 % ) .
There are no observations in between .
In analyzing the initial saturations in cross sections of simulations I divided the cells into separate observations on zone 2 and zone three , since it was obvious the two were very different .
The division between zone 2 and zone 3 is based on layer counting and the following scheme from SPE 84371 ( A Scalable Massively Parallel Dual - Porosity Dual - Permeability Simulator for Fractured Reservoirs with Super - K Permeability ) :
The reservoir model is characterized into four zones .
Zone 1 is in layer 1 , zone 2 is in layers 2 to 10 , zones 3 is in layers 11 to 13 , and zones 4 is in layers 14 to 17 .
If the ' Ain Dar simulation pictures came from a simulation with the same layering scheme , then it suggests that , as there are only 13 layers , zone 4 is not important to production in this area ( in general , it is rarely mentioned in the literature ) .
It further suggests the interpretation that the bottom three layers are zone 3 .
If we now look at an example from 1940 , i.e. before production , then we can clearly see the difference in the initial saturation in these layers .

As you can see , the lowest three layers are yellow ( 40 % water ) or almost so .
The picture in Uthmaniyah is similar .
It is plausible that water saturations in the poorer rock of zone three would be higher than in the zone 2 rocks above .
However , Euan felt strongly , based on his experience , that 40 % water saturation was unrealistic in net rock .
He argued that those layers must include rock that would not have been considered net in the Croft numbers , i.e. rock of single milliDarcy permeability or sub milliDarcy permeability .
He and I explored data from carbonates in other fields were indeed he would be correct , but did n't find dispositive proof that net pay in Arab - D could n't have initial saturations that high .
Hold that potential issue in the back of your mind for a moment .
We have a lot of data on saturations , but we might not know quite how much of the oil they are being applied to .
If we average the zone two and zone three values for initial saturation and compute a combined average ( using a ratio for net pay based on analysis of the well logs from Powers 1962 paper and simulation cross sections ) we get an initial saturation of 16.9 % ± 1.2 % ( percentage points ) .
This gives a saturation change of 48.2 % ± 2.6 % ( percentage points ) , and a recovery rate of 58 % ± 3.2 % ( before applying any correction for sweep efficiency - blocks that end up unswept ) .
Remember that recovery rate .
And remember it just comes from averaging together simulation cross sections and experimental observations that Saudi Aramco has published .
Unfortunately , little public data is available to support estimates of sweep efficiency ( how much oil that in theory might have been producible but is left behind because the waterflood moves unevenly and leaves some areas unswept ) .
Based on advice from our various pseudonymous and anonymous industry advisers , I adopted an outer range of reasonableness for this well managed waterflood in north Ghawar of 80 % to 100 % .
Thus my central value is 90 % , and I take 5 % ( percentage points ) as the 1 - sigma error bar .
In the south , with poorer rock and heavy fracturing , I used 80 % ± 10 % .
Next , an exercise to validate the original reserve model with the asphaltene map was undertaken .
This identified one major area where the linear OOWC model and the broad contour interval combine to miss a low - lying area that is above the oil water contact , and which has a modest number of producing wells in the Voelker well distribution , and industry report maps .
Based on estimation of this volume , a 5.5 % upward correction was applied to North ' Ain Dar , and 4.5 % to Shedgum .
No issues were identified in South ' Ain Dar .
I compared these estimates with this figure from a 2004 presentation by Baqi and Saleri of Saudi Aramco , endeavoring to refute the concerns of Matt Simmons :
Summary of Ain Dar / Shedgum status from 2004 Baqi / Saleri presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
There are a number of very interesting numbers in this graphic .
But let 's first talk about the recovery rate data .
On the one hand for proven reserves we see a claimed recovery rate of 60 % , compared to the 58 ± 3.2 % we observe by averaging various individual observations in Saudi technical papers .
So these numbers are potentially in good agreement ( within one sigma ) with the exception that proved reserves would be assuming 100 % sweep efficiency - a fairly aggressive assumption .
More troubling is the estimated ultimate recovery of 75 percent of original oil in place .
It does not appear that this ultimate recovery could come from the present peripheral water flood alone .
All simulation cross sections in Ain Dar and Shedgum end up at about 65 % water saturation - ie 35 % of the pore volume is left as oil following the water flood , even in areas that were first swept decades ago .
Given that not all the pores began as oil , recovery rates from the flood must be somewhat below 65 % under any reasonable assumption .
( It 's very hard to see how the simulations could be badly wrong on this point , since they would show far more historical production than the actual wells if they were so wrong , making them useless to their owners ) .
If indeed ultimate recovey ends up as high as 75 % , it would appear to have to be as a result of extended recovery techniques of some kind , which would of course produce oil at much lower rates .
Now let 's take our initial and final saturations , together with Croft porosities and pay heights ( which recall are circa 1980 Aramco average estimates ) .
I applied those assumptions to the map based model discussed earlier .
Doing so resulted in estimates of original reserves for Ain Dar and Shedgum of 28.3 ± 2.1gb , with an estimate for original oil in place of 54 ± 4gb .
( The estimate of original reserves for the whole of Ghawar would have been 83 ± 9gb ) .
So there are two discrepancies between the numbers I just mentioned and the Baqi / Saleri slide above .
Firstly , they reported cumulative production for this area in 2004 of 26.9gb .
If the original producible oil was only 28.3 gb , then we'd be left with only a couple of billion barrels by 2004 , which would imply the field would have had to be already declining , inconsistent with other data showing it on plateau then .
Furthermore , they are reporting far more OOIP - 68.1 gb , versus 54 ± 4gb .
That 's a discrepancy over the central value of more than three standard errors - a pretty material discrepancy .
Their value is 25 % ± 9 % higher .
Now , we also have the following graph from the 2004 Aramco presentation concerning the growth of OOIP in the country as a whole :
Growth in OOIP for Saudi Arabia as a whole from 2004 Baqi / Saleri presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .
Careful measurement of the first ( 588.5 gb ) and last ( 700 gb ) data points gives us a whole - country OOIP growth of 19 % .
So , it would appear the growth in ' Ain Dar at 25 % ± 9 % is consistent with the whole country OOIP growth .
This raises the question of were this extra oil could be ?
Ain Dar and Shedgum had been in production for three decades by 1980 .
There would be no potential for growth in the known oil at the edges of the field because the edges of the field had been drowned long ago .
In principle , there could have been discovery of additional reservoirs , but this is n't very likely in such an extensively produced and characterized field , and nor is there any discussion in the literature of new reservoirs in Ghawar being studied ( though there is ample discussion of deeper Khuff gas reservoirs ) .
This leaves only one real possibility which is that the growth in OOIP is coming from rock that was not previously considered net pay , that is , rock of very low permeability in which oil flows very poorly .
Let me at this point remind you of Euan 's concern that in the simulation cross sections , the zone three saturations were too high to be net rock .
Could there be enough oil in the poor , formerly non-net , rock to account for this OOIP growth ?
Well , take a look at this next figure :
Permeability ( log scale ) versus porosity in 428 uniformly spaced samples from a well core at an unknown location in Uthmaniyah .
Source : Figure 7A of Saner S. , and Sahin A. , " Lithological and Zonal Porosity - Permeability Distributions in the Arab - D Reservoir , Uthmaniyah Field , Saudi Arabia , " Bulletin Of The American Association Of Petroleum Geologists , Vol. 83 , No. 2 ( February 1999 ) , pp. 230-243 .
I have added the blue line as a visual fit to the trend of the data .
Our industry advisers , asked about the likely permeability cutoff for net rock suggested values from one milliDarcy to 10 milliDarcy circa 1980 .
In my log analysis I used three milliDarcies .
As you can see , in the plot above , these cutoffs would leave rock with a significant amount of pore space and a sizable fraction of the rock would be below these cutoffs .
for example , the 3 milliDarcy line hits the trend at 14 percent porosity .
Overall , this suggests that including all of gross rock in OOIP could lead to about the right amount of growth , though it 's hard to be certain based on one well .
At any rate , the stance taken here is that we should give Saudi Aramco the benefit of the doubt wherever there is any , and see if we have established a problem notwithstanding that .
Thus , I assume that the saturation figures derived above ( from Saudi Aramco simulations and experiments ) should be applied to the " grown " OOIP that they say they use , and I use the 700/588.5 change as a basis to estimate that growth factor .
As we will see in the sequel , once this is done then all evidence forms a consistent picture of the state of the field .
To begin with , we can examine the implications of the 26.9 gigabarrels of cumulative production to date .
Because my model allows me to estimate the volume of rock in the field I can infer how high up the structure the oil water contact must have risen in order to produce 26.9 gigabarrels of oil .
It turns out a 511 foot rise is the number required , which can be the basis for comparison with other estimates of the OWC height .
Let us take one more step before we do that .
We know the production history in North Ain Dar through 2004 from Figure 1 of SPE 93439 ( the North ' Ain Dar water management paper ) :
North Ain Dar production history from Figure 1 of SPE 93439 .
With my 3D model and the above assumptions about saturations , etc , I can figure out how much change in the average OWC in North Ain Dar is required for each unit of production .
So I can take the 511 ' offset in OWC inferred from the entire Ain Dar / Shedgum cumulative production by 2004 , and then back it down the North Ain Dar structure to give the right production history for that subregion .
If I then plot that with all the other data we have on OWCs in this region , it looks like this :
Summary of all flood height analysis in North ' Ain Dar .
In addition to the data described earlier , I have added the gas cap base ( treated as though it was at the top of the structure , which it is n't actually ) , and the OWC curve inferred from reversing production as just described .
The level of agreement on the state of the field circa 2004 , and over the last 15 years or so , strikes me as extraordinary .
Given the diversity of approaches summarized in this graph , it seems very unlikely that the conclusions about current OWC could be badly wrong .
Unless the gas cap model is systematically wrong , it 's hard to see how production in North ' Ain Dar could not be affected by now .
The production based OWC estimate was divergent from the linear 18.4 foot / year vertical rise line prior to the late 1980s , and follows a more physically realistic track for average OWC .
My interpretation of what happened is that during the 1960s and 1970s , under heavy production , water crossing the broad very shallowly angled plateau northeast of the north ' Ain Dar crest was in poorer gravitational compliance , with oil piled up before the advancing water , and water not penetrating the less permeable lower strata of the reservoir as fast as static gravitational equilibrium would have dictated .
Thus the ridge areas studied in SPE 93439 did not get water until a relatively late date in the second half of the 1970s .
However , in the 1980s , as the OWC got into areas where the structure is steeper , and as production was sharply reduced due to the demand destruction following the 1979 - 1980 oil shocks , gravitational compliance improved and the OWC in the north ridge area began to track the average OWC based on production quite well .
From the 511 ' offset , I can plot what the distribution of remaining oil would look like .
( Note that this is just moving the original OWC plane up 511 ' without changing its tilt in any way - this is not likely exactly what happened , but is as good an assumption as any , and the Linux supercluster picture suggests it is not very wrong )
Here is a comparison of the original and remaining reserve distribution under that assumption :
Modeled distribution of original reserves ( left ) , offset by 511 ' vertically upward ( center ) and the same with the effect of gas caps ( right ) .
For comparison , here is the Linux supercluster picture again .
Clearly , the Linux picture is either not simulating the gas caps , or is actually plotting " hydrocarbon saturation "
Visualization of oil saturation in Ghawar , with focus region on ' Ain Dar and Shedgum .
To my eye , this picture is generally compatible in showing oil mainly up in the crests , roughly in compliance with gravity , though with some deviations where the supercluster picture has more oil in the saddles between the crests , while my model has a little more on the crests .
However , it is hard to make a more precise comparison than given above , given the different view angle and the small scale of the Linux picture .
This concludes the detailed analysis of the ' Ain Dar / Shedgum regions .
I now turn to the simpler treatments I used in the other regions .
Uthmaniyah
Original reserve analysis in Uthmaniyah is based on the Croft map and the global OOWC plane for the whole field , Croft table parameters , the same saturation end points and OOIP growth as in ' Ain Dar / Shedgum , and a 20 % map correction as discussed above .
2004 reserve analysis in Uthmaniyah is based on visual estimation of the full - oil - layer equivalent area implied by three sources : the Linux supercluster visual , 2004 simulation cross sections from SPE 98847 ( the water management in Uthmaniyah paper ) , and a partial map of the thickness of the oil layer from here .
Summary of area estimation analysis in Uthmaniyah .
Based on visual examination of the cross sections , it seems clear that with the dual crest structure in Uthmaniyah almost all the remaining oil is in the saddle between the two crests , and the approach based on gravitational compliance , which worked so well in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum , would fail here .
Thus 2004 reserve estimates in Uthmaniyah were based on the area analysis above , Croft table parameters , the same saturation end points and OOIP growth as in ' Ain Dar / Shedgum , and a 20 % map correction as discussed above .
Southern Ghawar
Less effort was made to characterize Southern Ghawar as precisely as the north .
In general , it is clear that the southern regions will be on plateau for decades at current production rates , and are unlikely to be an important factor in recent Saudi production declines .
Original reserves were based on Croft map parameters , the global OOWC map ( with correction for tilt in Haradh as discussed above ) , and a slightly lower 80 % sweep efficiency .
2004 reserves were based on the above , plus visual estimation from the Linux supercluster map that oil was 1/8 of the way up the structure in Haradh , and 4/15 of the way up in Hawiyah .
Summary of Uncertainty Analysis
In this section , I summarize all the various strands of uncertainty reasoning discussed above , and combine them into my current quoted error bars .
The overall reserve estimates are of the form of a product of six factors :
An area
The average remaining net pay height in that area
The average porosity of the remaining net - pay
The change in oil saturation from the unswept to the swept condition
The sweep efficiency
The inverse of the formation volume factor
Uncertainties in Original Reserves
North Ain Dar South Ain Dar Shedgum Uthmaniyah Hawiyah Haradh Map 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Sweep eff. 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 6.7 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Sat. change 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.4 % 5.4 % OOWC 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 5.0 % 4.9 % 10.0 % OOIP Growth 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Combined Uncertainty 14.3 % 14.3 % 14.3 % 17.3 % 18.8 % 20.7 %
Uncertainties in Current Reserves
North Ain Dar South Ain Dar Shedgum Uthmaniyah Hawiyah Haradh Map 15.0 % 15.0 % 15.0 % 15.0 % 15.0 % 15.0 % Sweep eff. 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 6.7 % 10.0 % 10.0 % Sat. change 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % 4.5 % OWC 52.1 % 26.4 % 17.4 % 25.0 % 25.0 % 25.0 % OOIP growth 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % Combined Uncertainty 55.6 % 31.2 % 24.1 % 30.2 % 31.1 % 31.1 %
Thus it is natural to work with the relative ( percentage ) errors in each of these factors , since , using standard rules of error propagation , the overall relative uncertainty will be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual relative errors ( given that we have no reason to suppose correlation between the various uncertainties , it seems reasonable to treat them as independent ) .
The following tables summarize the current uncertainty analysis .
The relative uncertainties are largest in ' Ain Dar / Shedgum in 2004 , especially North ' Ain Dar .
The reason for this is that there is not much oil left there , so small changes in the position of the OWC make large proportional differences in the estimated reserve remaining .
Comparison with Euan Mearns
Euan estimated the area based on the boundaries of the Croft structure map .
I explicitly modeled the oil - water contact in three - dimensions and used that to bound the area where oil was to be found ( this tends to reduce my estimates since the Croft map has contours that are substantially below the OWC in places ) .
Euan took the Croft map scale at face values .
I , finding the Croft map rather inaccurate , used the asphaltene map in the north , and applied correction factors based on discrepancies in the scaling of the Croft map where I did use it ( this tended to increase my estimates ) .
Euan used a significantly larger saturation change than my estimates , based on picking the best cells in simulation cross-sections , rather than averaging the cross-sections and other estimates ( this tends to reduce my estimates relative to his ) .
Euan treated " wedge " effects were the oil reservoir meets the water via corrections .
I explicitly model wedge effects ( the overall effect of this is unclear ) .
Euan relied on visual estimates from the Linux supercluster visualization to establish the 2004 oil - water contact .
I relied on data from the SPE papers , gravitational equilibrium , as well as the supercluster visualization .
These procedures probably produce roughly comparable estimates - a central result of my work is that the Linux supercluster picture appears to be quite reliable .
Euan unilaterally moved some of Uthmaniyah into Hawiyah .
This does n't change the whole field estimates , but does move oil from the one region to the other .
( Note in Euan 's tables I believe he had Haradh and Hawiyah switched accidentally - I have reversed that in what follows ) .
The other week , Euan Mearns presented his latest thoughts on the status of Ghawar , and its production prognosis .
In this section , I compare my subfield estimates to Euan's .
Note that Euan 's estimates were revised based in part on seeing some of the reasoning behind this post ( particularly the ' Ain Dar saddle decode ) .
The largest remaining points of difference in how I estimated original and remaining reserves versus Euan are :
This first graph shows the comparison between Euan and my estimates of the original and 2004 reserves in each of the operationing regions ( I have corrected his estimate to 2004 by averaging his 2002 and 2006 tables ) .
Note that in this diagram , and throughout this post , " reserves " means essentially " proved plus probable reserves " - and specifically is my best available central estimate of how much more oil is likely to be ultimately produced .
Also , my estimates , like Euan's , are just for production via the peripheral water flood .
Production via tertiary recovery techniques is not considered here .
Left : Euan 's estimates of the original reserves and 2004 reserves in each region , ex tertiary .
Right : my estimates of the same quantities .
Note that region definitions are not identical .
Overall , you can see that our estimates are in fairly good agreement .
One of the wonderful properties of independent errors is that they tend to cancel to a significant degree , and here we see the varying effects of our different procedures mostly canceling .
Here is a more direct comparison of our estimated ultimate recovery estimates :
Euan and my estimates of ultimate non-tertiary recovery .
Whole Field Comparisons
Both Euan 's and my estimates can be compared to that of others on a whole - Ghawar basis .
For comparisons of Ghawar as a whole , the following figure gives estimates by a variety of organizations of original reserves and remaining reserves .
Where necessary , I have adjusted from the estimate date to a common 2004 date by adding or subtracting production in intervening years .
Ghawar original and remaining reserves according to various authors .
The Jaffe / Elass / Saleri column is an estimate of the Saudi Aramco official position .
It is based on combining the 70gb of remaining reserves from the Jaffe / Elass paper with the 48 % depletion number from the 2004 Baqi / Saleri presentation 50 Year Crude Oil Supply Scenarios : Saudi Aramco 's Perspective .
It is unknown how much of these reserve estimates might be attributed to tertiary recovery .
The " 79 Senate 2P " estimate comes from assuming that the " 37 % of reserves " attributed to Ghawar can be applied to the 177.6gb of remaining probable reserves at the time , and adding an estimate of cumulative production to then .
These numbers are all based on Aramco estimates during the period when it was run by American companies and disclosed details to the US government .
The " 79 Senate 3P " estimate comes from adding an explicitly mentioned 17gb of additional possible reserves to the 2P estimate .
The " Croft " estimate is for cumulative production ( quoted on his web page as 51gb at year end 2000 , and corrected for 5 mbpd production to year end 2004 ) .
Euan 's estimates are his base and high case corrected to 2004 .
These exclude tertiary recovery .
The " Staniford " column is the " charitable " method in which we apply average initial and final saturations from various Saudi Aramco publications to OOIP increased as much they say it has increased .
Notwithstanding , this is for waterflood recovery only .
Note also that the " produced " column here is estimated from " Original minus Remaining " and thus has the combined error bar of both .
The " W/ O extra OOIP " column does n't grow OOIP at all , but uses the same saturation estimates .
This procedure fails to find enough oil in ' Ain Dar / Shedgum to cover cumulative production through 2004 , so is unlikely to be correct .
I do not include it as an estimate I believe valid , but rather for comparison as it appears to match the " 79 Senate 2P " estimate quite well .
Implications for Production
In my view , the best way to assess the implications of the depletion status of north Ghawar as shown in this analysis is to look at the reserve / production ratio .
If we assume that declines are uniform after a field goes off plateau , then there is a mathematical relationship between the final R/P at the end of plateau and the decline rate .
In essence , the closer to empty an operator can keep the field on plateau , the worse the decline will be when it comes :
Relationship between reserves / production at end of plateau to following uniform decline rate .
Click to enlarge .
In the 1979 Senate report , it was anticipated that Ghawar declines would begin between 1993 and 1995 , based on being unable to maintain plateau once R/P was less than 15 or 20 ( corresponding to a post - plateau decline rate of 5 % - 6 % ) .
This was based on all vertical wells .
Modern technology has allowed maintenance of plateau to R / Ps below 10 , and perhaps even below 5 in some cases .
This gives rise to very aggressive declines of 10 % or 15 % or so respectively once plateau is lost .
This next graph gives my estimates of R/P for the Ghawar operating areas .
The assumptions made here are that the split between South ' Ain Dar and Shedgum of the 1.5 mbpd they are known to share on plateau is 0.5 mbd to South ' Ain Dar , and 1mbd to Shedgum .
Also , North Uthmaniyah 's plateau is assumed to still be the 1.9 mbpd documented in the 1979 Senate report .
Either or both of these assumptions could be slightly off .
Estimated remaining 2P reserves / production for Ghawar operating areas , under the assumption that production is still on plateau .
Reserves are ex-tertiary recovery .
As you can see , the whole of North Ghawar is either off plateau already , or getting close .
That is something like 3.9 mbpd of production based on last known figures .
Whatever of this decline has not already occurred will mostly occur during the next decade .
Southern Ghawar , by contrast , can maintain plateau for decades to come , but there is only 1.7 mbpd of production there on last known figures .
While we cannot attribute an exact fraction at this time , it seems likely that not - altogether successful attempts to maintain the north Ghawar plateau to the bitter end explain a significant fraction of the sharp increase in oil rigs that began in 2004 , as well as the production declines since that timeframe :

Report : Less than .01 % of DHS cases related to terrorism
Nick Juliano
Published : Monday May 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
When he announced the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security in 2002 , President Bush invoked the fight against " terror " or " terrorists " 19 times in a single speech .
That 's more mentions than there have been terrorism charges brought by the department in the last three years , according to an independent analysis of DHS records .
The department brought terrorism claims against only 12 of 814,073 individuals charged in immigration courts , according to the study from the Transactional Records Clearinghouse at Syracuse University .
Those 12 cases represent 0.0015 percent of the department 's caseload , according to the first - of - its - kind study .
" The DHS claims it is focused on terrorism .
Well that 's just not true , " TRAC spokesman David Burnham told CNN .
" Either there 's no terrorism , or they 're terrible at catching them .
Either way it 's bad for all of us . "
The report found " national security " charges also made up a miniscule number of those brought by DHS .
Only 114 -- or 0.014 percent -- of charges carried that designation .
More than 85 percent of the charges brought by the department created in the wake of 9/11 to protect the country from terrorists involved common immigration violations such as overstaying a student visa or entering the United States without inspection .
TRAC notes the " apparent gap between DHS rhetoric about its role in fighting terrorism and what it actually has been doing . "
A DHS spokesman dismissed the findings , telling CNN the report was " ill - conceived " and that TRAC " lacked a grasp of the DHS mission . "
Renal tubule blocked by crystals .
Two months into the pet food recall , scientists were n’t sure why melamine and cyanuric acid , which are not thought to be very toxic , were killing pets .
Now scientists at the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada , may have found the answer as to how the contaminants in the tainted pet foods cause renal failure .
Perry Martos mixed melamine and cyanuric acid together and it almost immediately formed crystals like those found in the kidneys of animals that died .
Unfortunately , these crystals appear to be very insoluble .
On April 20th , I wrote that researchers have identified three melamine by - products in the tissue and urine of affected animals . ( article via PetConnection ) Scientists at the University of Guelph , Ontario , Cornell ’s College of Veterinary Medicine , and Michigan State University ’s Diagnostic Center for Population & Animal Health have found cyanuric acid ( used as a stabilizer for pool chlorine ) , amilorine , and amiloride .
Michigan State University ’s Diagnostic Center for Population & Animal Health has photographs of these crystals in the kidney of an affected dog and micrographs of these crystals clogging the renal tubules of the kidney .
It makes it easier to understand what these crystals did when you see these images .
( Note :
At the time these pathology slides were prepared , it was still thought that aminopterin was the contaminant . )

A Post By : Darren Rowse
Yesterday I wrote about how taking lots of shots can be one way to increase your chances of getting good results from your digital photography .
However you do n’t want to just end up with multiple shots of the same thing so here ’s 10 techniques for adding diversity to your digital photography :
1 . Shoot your subject at different focal lengths – using the zoom on your photos will not only change how close your subject appears but it will also change the depth of field ( ie the blurring of the background ) .
It also allows you to shoot from different distances which can really impact how relaxed your subject is ( there ’s nothing better than a photographer in your face to make you tense up ! )
2 . Shoot your subject from different angles – it ’s amazing how much you can change a shot by getting on your knees or taking a few steps to the side !
( more on this here )
3 . Shoot using different formats – there are different ways to grip a digital camera .
The two main ones are horizontally or vertically but you can also get into all kinds of diagonal ways to do it .
Mix it up .
4. Avoid the Group Shot Blink –
When photographing people try to take multiple shots , especially group photos when someone is always bound to be blinking
5 . Use continuous exposure modes – most digital cameras these days will have a mode that allows you to shoot multiple frames quickly .
So instead of taking one shot at a time you can take multiple ones by simply holding the shutter longer .
This can be very effective at capturing people in that second after they post ( quite often when they are looking a little more themselves ) .
6 . Move your Subject around – If it ’s appropriate move your subject around .
The pictures at the top of this post are from a session of photo I took of my brother .
I love the series because it puts him in a variety of poses in quick succession ( we shot 50 or so shots all in 10 minutes ) .
They make a great series .
7 . Try Exposure Bracketing – this is a technique that Pro photographers use to make sure they get the perfect exposure .
Some cameras have a built in bracketing function but with others you ’ll need to do it manually .
The basic principle of it is to take numerous shots in a row and purposely shooting them at a variety of exposures .
Start with under exposing them and gradually dial up your exposure levels until your last shot is over exposed .
I ’ll write a tutorial on this at some point in the future but in the mean time hit your digital camera ’s instruction book to see if they have a way to do it automatically .
8. Experiment with different ‘ modes ’ – even the most basic point and shoot cameras have different ‘ shooting modes ’ .
These are usually things like ‘ portrait ’ , ‘ landscape ’ , ‘ sports ’ , ‘ night ’ etc .
Sometimes it ’s worth flicking through these to take shots at different settings .
What these modes do is simply change the basic settings ( like aperture , shutter speed , ISO ) – all things that can change the look and feel of your shot considerably
9 . Play with your Flash – try turning your flash off or forcing it to fire in shots .
Sometimes adding flash to a scene where there ’s lots of light behind your subject is essential ( even though your camera might not think it needs it ) .
This stops those silhouette shots where it looks like you ’re trying to hide the identity oyour subject .

Tell a story – rather than trying to sum up a whole occasion in one shot think of the shots you take as an opportunity to tell a story .
I sometimes have the sequence of shots in mind as I ’m doing a shoot – look for a beginning shot , a middle shot and an end one .
It ’s almost like a movie but with still shots .
One last tip : when it comes to shooting lots of images – take note of what you ’re doing .
One of the problems with shooting lots of shots at different exposures and in different modes and settings is that you get home to your computer and find a brilliant shot but ca n’t remember how you did it .
Many cameras will store your settings in the images for you to look at later but I find it is sometimes helpful to even jot down what I do as I take images or at least to make a special mental note of what I ’m doing as I go so that I can reproduce the types of shots in future .

I am having trouble tracing this map all the way to its source , but I thought it was cool enough to show here ( via TJIC and Carls Blog ) .
The map renames each state with a country that has approximately the same GDP as that state .
Check out Russia / New Jersey .
And is it really saying New Zealand and the District of Columbia have the same GDP ?
Update :
If you enjoyed this post , check out our ( free ) comprehensive
guide to the skeptics arguments concerning man-made global warming .
It 's the number one religion ( by proportion of adherents ) in the states of Washington and Idaho ; it 's the number two religion in California , Utah , Massachusetts and Arkansas .
In most states , in fact , it ranks as the # 2 or # 3 belief , and in only a few is it # 4 or # 5 .
Nationwide , it ranks # 3 overall , just behind Baptist ( # 2 ) and Catholic ( # 1 ) .
Yet very few elected officials profess this faith , and a significant plurality of US voters say that they 'd never vote for someone who believes this .
What is this religion ?
It 's no religion at all .
Much to the surprise of both the very religious and the entirely irreligious , non-theism consistently shows up as the second or third most popular belief across most states .
According to the American Religious Identification Survey ( PDF ) , assembled by the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 2001 , over 14 % of US citizens profess themselves to be atheist , agnostic , humanist or secular ; this compares to 16 % Baptist , and 24.5 % Catholic .
This map from USA Today shows the breakdown by state ( Flash required ) .
It 's worth remembering this in light of recent statements by Sen. Barack Obama about the importance of religion to the Democratic party .
Non-believers are n't just a tiny fringe element in American society , and they are n't just found in coastal " blue states . "
Non-religious people make up a higher percentage of the populations of Idaho , Montana , and Nevada than they do of those of California , Massachusetts or New York .
This is n't the narrative we 're given by popular culture or media , but it 's reality .
I find this useful info for those of us thinking about the future for this reason : the stories we 're told about how a society works may not match the reality , and we should n't build our models and scenarios based on what we assume to be true .
How to Beat Speeding Tickets Before and After You Get One - What the Courts Do n't Want You to Know
Wednesday , Nov 23 , 2016 by Brian Laviage
Tips From Your Local Texas Traffic Ticket Attorney
NEVER :
Act like you know the law better than the officer does .
Law Enforcement Officers , especially Traffic Enforcement Officers hate drivers that quote the law to them .
I have had many a client who have ended up in the back of a patrol car following a heated debate on the law with a Traffic Cop .
More often than not , the Officer finds more reasons to hand out citations .

Admit any guilt .
Do n’t say you are sorry , or that you were unaware what you were doing was in violation of any law .
I advise all of my clients to say nothing .
Always remember anything you say is considered an admission and most certainly will be used against you in court .
My advice : Play dumb and take your ticket .
ALWAYS :
Be Mr. or Mrs. Submissive .
“ Brown nose ” behavior should n’t only be kept in the workplace .
Do n’t be afraid to reply “ yes Officer , no Officer ” to the questions you are asked .
Moreover , these replies should expedite your stay on the side of the road .

Play your ignorance card .
Most people , including traffic cops , are less obliged to inflict pain on a poor dumb animal .

Be afraid , be very afraid .
Show the officer that handing you a ticket is the equivalent of handing you a death sentence .
Remember policeman are people too , they put their pants on one leg at a time .
If you look like a shivering chihuahua , they may hesitate in writing you that ticket if they feel sorry for you .

Be a good actor .
If you truly feel like you were not doing what the officer accused you of doing , act like you had no idea why he pulled you over , like they got the wrong car ; take this theme all the way to the end zone .
At the end of the day using this strategy might end you up with a ticket anyway , but at least you have the argument that you did not do it once you are facing a judge .
Great !
Your advice did n’t help ,
It looks like I am getting the Ticket , what do I do now ?
Remember :
The side of a road is not your courtroom .
Pleading your case to the Traffic Officer is about as productive as arguing with the pavement .
Trust me …you wo n’t win .
This type of behavior has gotten my clients more citations or a night in the slammer and besides the immediate consequences , this behavior makes you stick out like a sore thumb in the mind of the cop .
As a result he will remember you when it comes time for him to testify .
Remain inconspicuous .
My advice : Accept your ticket , say nothing and casually drive away .

Develop a photographic memory .
Take a mental image of your surroundings and conditions .
Ask yourself what are the traffic conditions , what is the weather like , what lane you were in ?
This gives you some ammunition to fight whatever the officer writes on the ticket as the present conditions .
OK , what do I do at the pre-trial and while I am waiting for the trial ?
Always :
Plead “ not guilty . ”
Depending on where you are this is likely , an appearance in court or an opportunity to appear at a window in the courthouse prior to the date of appearance to give your plea .
Depending on where you are this is likely , an appearance in court or an opportunity to appear at a window in the courthouse prior to the date of appearance to give your plea .
Delay .
Do n’t work around the court ’s schedule , have the courts work around you .
Keep putting off that court date until it is convenient for you to show .
This is more likely to work if you are self employed or you are an independent contractor .
If you are employed by a company , make sure that the court does not interfere with your work , including business trips .
More often than not , by the time you appear , the officer will have forgotten all about the traffic stop and the court will have to dismiss your case A short side story : A very good client of mine got caught going 120 mph on the Sam Houston Parkway in Harris County Texas ( speed limit was 65 mph ) from a Texas State Trooper .
Being an avid business traveler , he was able to delay his court date for nearly 2 years .
When he finally ended up into court , he found that the Trooper had been transferred to the Dallas / Ft . Worth area .
His case was ultimately dismissed .

Sometimes :
Request information about the equipment used to catch you speeding .
Warning : this strategy can really put the prosecutor in a bad mood and persuade him or her to really go after you .
When laws allow , you can request : Copies of manufacturers names , including makes , models and serial numbers of all speed measuring devices in use by the Police Department .
Information regarding manufacturers recommended maintenance on all of the above mentioned devices .
Information pertaining to manufacturer literature regarding correct use , including specifications on mounting and aiming for all speed measuring devices used by that particular law enforcement agency .
Maintenance Records for the past six months ’ for all speed measuring devices used by the department .
Records speaking to the Training administered to the Officer who cited you , in the proper use of all speed measuring devices used by the department .
.
Warning : this strategy can really put the prosecutor in a bad mood and persuade him or her to really go after you .
Alright , so now I am finally at the courthouse for the trial setting , what do I do ?
10 Easy Steps :
Check in with the clerk .
Check the officer sign in sheet to see if the officer has arrived , if he does n’t show , a dismissal will almost always be granted .
If the officer does show , you will have an opportunity to speak with the prosecutor and determine whether the officer is ready to proceed ( if he remembers you and the case ) .
If the officer does not remember the episode , your case will be dismissed .
The judge will call you up to begin the trial .
More often than not , the officer will testify first .
You then question the officer to see if he truly remembers you and your vehicle .
Try to see if he can corroborate his information about the conditions of the day .
You then call any witnesses you have to refute the officers story and bolster your story that the officer cannot adequately remember the circumstances surrounding your alleged violation .
The officer is then allowed to make a closing statement
You should then make a closing statement focused on the inability of the officer to remember the incident ; this is the way you can beat him , credibility .
The judge will then take several moments to decide .
What to wear and how to act :
Wear a suit , or at least a tie .
If you look like a deadbeat scum bag bum , you will be treated as such .
.
If you look like a deadbeat scum bag bum , you will be treated as such .
Be polite and respond to courtesy .
Act like a jerk and you will be disposed of quickly and not to your favor .
Remember , you are innocent until proven guilty , that is the officer is the one who must prove your guilt , so :
Get confident , stupid .
You ca n’t win if you are a nervous wreck .

If the cop is unable to prove even the slightest , tiny , or insignificant element of the indictment , the court must dismiss you case .

Object to an officer bringing in evidence about speed measuring devices .
Claim the evidence is inadmissible .
In order to use this type of evidence the officer must establish Jurisdiction Certification , up to date , accurate , traffic and engineering survey , that the speed measuring device was properly calibrated , and that he maintains an up to date FCC license .

Do you Know the Sports Love Navtej Kohli
A couple of days ago , an American friend of mine expressed the opinion to me that cricket was a rather silly sport .
She did not understand how the sport had become so popular in former British Empire nations such as Australia , India and South Africa .
She said that , to her , cricket appeared to involve a group of guys standing around on a big round field , rocking back and forward on the soles of their feet all day long .
Ricky Ponting , a famous Australian cricket player
At first , I was a bit offended .
Cricket is n’t stupid !
I played cricket for my school and it ’s a highly technical , skillful game that requires high
levels of physical fitness and endurance .
The name “ Navtej Kohli ” has appeared in several record books for the sport and I ’m defensive about it !
But I digress …
It ’s not like this is the first time I ’ve heard people talk about how they do not like or understand cricket , but this instance made me think
about the sentiment more than I do usually .
In thinking about it , I have come to the conclusion that , rather than just cricket , all sports are inherently stupid .
This is not to say that I do n’t like sport .
Far from it .
I love sport .
When I visit Digg , I usually digg nothing but sports stories .
I love NFL , NBA and Major League Baseball .
I ’ll try and watch as much
of the summer and winter Olympics as possible .
But yes , friends ; sports are silly .
Let me elaborate …
Cricket
Cricket is enthralling .
As I mentioned in my introduction , it ’s involves physical fitness , mental endurance , natural talent and practiced skill .
But despite my love of cricket , I can see why it is indeed silly .
Firstly , let ’s look at the names given to the positions in cricket .
There are about 92471 positions that players can take on the field ( okay , more
like fifty ) , but some of them have names that make even true cricket ans crack a grin .
Here are some of the best :
• Silly mid-off
• Silly mid-on
• Fly slip
• Short fine leg
• Straight fine leg
• Wide long on
• Fine leg
• Short third man
• Square leg
• Fine leg
• Short leg
• Straight long off
Try explaining that to an American who ’s used to hearing “ center field ” and “ pitcher . ”
Even the position that baseball would name “ catcher ” is
called a “ wicket keeper ” , which means very little if you do n’t know what a wicket is .
What ’s a wicket ?
Three sticks , stuck into the ground with two little sticks on top of them .
If the ball hits the sticks , the batter is out .
If the batter does n’t manage to hit the ball and the batter ’s leg is in front of the sticks , the umpire ( referee ) can decide that the ball would have hit the sticks had the leg not been there , and the batter will be out .
You look up “ subjective ” in the dictionary and there ’s a picture of this offense ,
known as “ leg - before - wicket ” or LBW .
Cricket is best served in one - day format , which means that the match only takes one day to complete .
Old - fashioned cricket matches take three to five days and often end in a draw .
The draw , however , does not involve both teams arriving at the exact same score , but rather indicates that neither
team can win due to the time constraints of the game .
That is , the game would have to take even longer in order to determine a winner .
This is always very frustrating if your team is the one that ’s been doing the best and , given a chance to finish , your team would undoubtedly win .
One - day cricket was invented to negate the traditional lengthy matches .
This form of the game involves both teams being bowled to ( or pitched at , in baseball lingo ) fifty times .
The only instance in which a team would not face all fifty balls is if their players were all out before fifty
balls had been bowled .
So , I can see why many people think cricket is silly .
It goes on too long , its names are very traditional British labeling masterpieces ( i.e. silly ) and many cricket outfits look like preppy boys ’ schools ’ uniforms .
However , I still love the game and would love to have my American friends sit down and watch a closely - contested international one - day game with me .
Once you ’re hooked , cricket ’s silliness does n’t matter anymore .
Check out some of the questions I ’ve answered about cricket at here – Navtej Kohli – Answers Profile
Swimming
Swimming is the most passive aggressive of all sports .
Every competitor is isolated in their own lane , unable to tamper with competitors ’ races .
This immediately makes swimming less interesting than sports like running , where shoving your competition off the track and attempting to cut the backs of their legs with the spikes on the soles of your shoes is a well - loved pastime .
For a sport that involves racing ( as opposed to accumulating points ) , it seems very odd to have people sprint up and down a body of water in
order to get back to the place where they started .
Running is often guilty of this , too .
Some events , such as the very short sprints , make more sense , as the swimmers ’ goal is to get from one end of the pool to the other as quickly as possible .
It would make even more sense if there were treasures , money or tasty snacks at the other end .
However , there usually are n’t .
The dumbest thing about swimming is the four different styles in which a swimmer can compete .
“ Freestyle ” ( more accurately called crawl stroke or over - arm ) is the fastest style , but someone invented three others , including backstroke , butterfly and breaststroke .
Why would you invent slower ways of getting back to where you started from ?
Including a style ( butterfly ) that no one apart from national - level swimmers can do properly ?
And why invent breaststroke – the least hydrodynamic way of traveling through the water known to man ?
Netball
Netball is , like cricket , a sport that is primarily played by former British colonies .
It ’s especially popular in England , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and the West Indies .
Its defining characteristic , however , is that is almost always played by women and not by men .
The reason for this is ambiguous ; I ’ve heard a couple of stories about boys not being allowed to participate in netball in various schools in which the game is popular .
While this does n’t seem fair , one has to ask , “ why would they want to play in the first place ? ”
Netball is a dumbed down , rule - intensive , whistle - blowing version of basketball .
Some examples of netball ’s ridiculous rules include that
which prohibits players from running with the ball .
You may say , “ So what ?
You ca n’t run with the ball in basketball , either ! ”
You would be correct ; however , one can dribble the ball when playing basketball .
So long as the ball is bouncing up and down in between your hand and the ground , you can take it wherever you so choose .
But not in netball .
The furthest a player can move when in possession of a netball - ball is three steps .
That is , if a player catches the ball mid-air , they can
land , put the other foot on the ground , and then step with the foot on which they landed .
After that , they have to either bounce or throw the ball to another player , otherwise they are sited for “ stepping . ”
Needless to say , this makes for a game that resembles a badly composed , staccato - laden piece of music .
Another very annoying thing about
netball is the rule that prohibits obstructing another player .
I never understood this .
Seeing as the point of the game is to stop the other team from scoring goals , it confused the heck out of me why it was wrong to jump up and down in front of someone who was trying to throw the ball into the net .
All of that dancing and waving that you see in basketball is not allowed in netball .
The most the defense can do is stand there and hold up a passive arm in front of the opposing player .
Combine that with the constant whistle - blowing from the referees and the fact that spectators are also primarily girls ( and girls scream ) and you
have the makings of a thoroughly annoying game .
Soccer ( Football )
The game of soccer , which many countries refer to as “ football ” , is best known for its brawls .
English fans , in particular , are infamous for fighting each other and for picking fights with foreign nationals when they travel across the Channel to Europe .
osting the football World Cup is an honor ; however countries ’ police forces must shudder upon hearing the happy news that their nation is the next to host the competition .
There are three things that are ridiculous about soccer .
First is the fact that players can’t touch the ball with their hands .
The goalkeeper can ,
but no one else is allowed to lay a hand on the ball unless they ’re chucking it into the field of play from the sidelines .
This makes soccer the Irish Jig of sports .
I ’d love to see a soccer game played where the players ’ arms must be stock - still at their sides .
That would be fun to watch .
The second silly thing about soccer is the Hollywood aspect .
Upon falling over , many players love to grasp their ankles , knees or various other delicate body - parts and pretend that a ) a player on the other team is responsible for their fall , and b ) that they are inconsolably injured .
Other portspeople have been known to engage in similar tactics , but soccer players are the prime offenders when it comes to Hollywoods .
The third thing that makes soccer silly is actually one of the things that people like about it the most .
No one ever scores .
When someone does score , it ’s like the second coming of Christ .
Many games , especially ones involving top - level teams , end in scores like 0 - 1 , 1 - 2 or , one a big day , 3 - 2 .
Thus , fans spend ninety minutes watching an average of three goals take place .
It ’s not wonder they go nuts when someone managed to kick the ball into
the net .

The Manchester Union - Leader has an article today about Ron Paul ’s visit to the home of the nation ’s first primary :
Paul – who had been in New Hampshire since Thursday – found himself treated like a rock star at yesterday ’s event , and a couple of hundred people were on hand to hear him speak at the Free State Project ’s New Hampshire Liberty Forum .
About half the 350 people who attended the days - long conference , at the Holiday Inn on North Main Street , were from New Hampshire , organizers said .
Paul , who received a standing ovation before and after his remarks , touched on many points during his address .
For instance , he noted his long - standing opposition to the war in Iraq , which he said stemmed from his belief there was no security threat to America and the vote authorizing the war represented an illegal transfer of power to the president .
He also called for the United States to withdraw from Iraq .
“ The worst thing that could happen to al - Qaeda is for that war to end , ” Paul said .
Among other issues , Paul also voiced support for abandoning the war on drugs , allowing gold and silver to serve as legal tender , repealing the Seventeenth AmendmentÂ ” which lets voters directly elect U.S. Senators ” and ending the practice of withholding taxes from one ’s pay .
Instead , taxpayers would have to actually write checks to pay their taxes , a move Paul figured would soon end what he called the present tax - and - spend philosophy of government .
Filtering out the bad guys
Two months ago , we published Everything you need to know about IPv6 , telling you the following about firewalling IPv6 in relationship to the Network Address Translation that is common in today 's IP v4 home routers :
If you have a router or home gateway that supports IP v6 , make sure that it , too , filters IPv6 .
A stateful filter that allows outgoing connections and return traffic , but not incoming connections is closest to the IPv4 NAT filtering functionality .
This is in line with the recommendations in a document that the Internet Engineering Task Force 's IPv6 Operations ( v6ops ) working group is developing :
To implement simple security for IPv6 in , for example , a DSL - or Cable Modem - connected home network , the broadband gateway / router should be equipped with stateful firewall capabilities .
These should provide a default configuration where incoming traffic is limited to return traffic resulting from outgoing packets ( sometimes known as reflective session state ) .
There should also be an easy interface which allows users to create inbound ' pinholes ' for specific purposes such as online - gaming .
Sound advice , right ?
Maybe .
About firewalls
First , let 's review the purpose of firewalls .
Although anyone who uses a computer in this day and age has some concept of what a firewall is , there are usually a lot of assumptions involved .
That 's a good thing , because if we were all talking about the same thing , we 'd miss out on all those entertaining " which OS is more secure " discussions in the OpenForum .
The simplest form of a firewall is a packet filter .
A packet filter looks at packets coming by and allows them through or not based on the content of fields in the packet headers , most notably the " protocol " field , which can be TCP , UDP , ICMP , or a lesser - known protocol .
TCP and UDP each have a source and a destination port number , and ICMP has a type and a code , allowing for finer - grained filtering .
TCP also has a number of status bits that make it easy to allow only TCP sessions that are set up from the inside to the outside and not the other way around .
Packet filters are useful if you know exactly what you want to let through .
For instance , if you run a big DNS server , you can filter out everything except DNS - related packets .
Both routers and general purpose operating systems have implemented packet filters for some time .
To accomplish more advanced filtering , routers and special - purpose firewall devices gained the capability to keep track of communication sessions started from the inside so they could allow the associated return packets through but reject everything else .
These types of filters or firewalls are called stateful .
Stateful filtering works much better than simply rejecting TCP packets that try to create new sessions .
On computers themselves , firewalls also became stateful , and PC - based firewalls take that notion a step further : they gained the ability to keep track of which application is trying to do what exactly over the network .
Products like ZoneAlarm or Little Snitch are often called personal firewalls , and they protect as much against malicious programs on the inside that are trying to phone home as against evil packets coming in from the outside .
However , the kind of " firewall " present in most home routers does n't fall into any of those categories .
Since ISPs almost always only give their customers a single IP address , and home routers allow connecting multiple computers to the Internet , those home routers share the IP address that they obtain from the ISP with the computers on the local network using NAT .
For example , the router gets address 82.192.90.30 and a computer on the local network has 10.0.0.2 .
When the computer requests a web page from a server , the packets will have source address 10.0.0.2 , but the router translates this into 82.192.90.30 .
The return packets from the server go to the 82 address , but the router again translates the addresses so the packets end up at the computer holding address 10.0.0.2 .
But if a packet comes in addressed to the 82 address without an earlier outgoing packet , the home router does n't know which of the internal computers should receive the packet , so none of them get it .
This means that the functionality similar to a stateful firewall is a side effect of NAT .
With IP v6 , things change ...
If a “ Snakes on a Plane ” sequel is ever filmed at John Wayne Airport , actor Samuel L. Jackson had better watch his tongue -- unless a potty - mouthed dance student wins a free - speech lawsuit filed against Orange County this month .
Last summer , Elizabeth Venable of Riverside was cited for disorderly conduct after she allegedly yelled numerous obscenities to a friend while exiting the airport ’s baggage claim area .
An Orange County sheriff ’s deputy , noticing several families with small children nearby , had asked Venable to “ please watch her language while at the airport , ” according to court documents .
Venable allegedly responded with an expletive - filled question about whether it was illegal to use expletives .
Advertisement
Yes , it is , the deputy advised .
Venable , who is studying for a PhD in dance history and theory at UC Riverside , was charged with violating an Orange County law that bans “ disorderly , obnoxious [ or ] indecent ” behavior at the airport , a misdemeanor .
Prosecutors later added a disturbing - the - peace charge based on her allegedly “ loud and unreasonable ” noise .
Venable , 26 , is fighting back on two fronts : a 1st Amendment lawsuit in federal court and a criminal defense in Orange County Superior Court .
Advertisement
The federal suit , filed against Orange County , Sheriff Michael S. Carona and two deputies , seeks an injunction against enforcement of the county law .
It contends that the law governing conduct at airports is unconstitutionally vague and improperly squelches free speech .
A motion filed by Venable ’s attorneys in Superior Court echoes the federal lawsuit in more detail .
In particular , it outlines a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning a “ disturbing the peace ” charge against a man who wore a jacket that said , " [ Expletive ] the draft , ” inside a Los Angeles County courthouse where women and children were present .
Legal experts offered mixed opinions on Venable ’s chances for victory .
Advertisement
David B. Cruz , a USC law professor specializing in 1st Amendment issues , said the draft protest case is n’t comparable because it involved political speech , which has more protections .
Venable is on stronger ground arguing that the airport conduct code is too vague and does n’t adequately define “ obnoxious or indecent ” behavior , he said .
Cruz predicted that the federal lawsuit would be rejected under the “ abstention doctrine , ” which allows federal courts to refuse a case if there ’s a pending criminal hearing on the matter .
That means Venable would have to make her constitutional arguments in Superior Court and , if necessary , state appellate courts , he said .
However , Michael H. Shapiro , another USC constitutional law expert , said a guilty verdict for Venable seemed unlikely .
If the incident had occurred in an airport ticket line or at the gate , prosecutors might have a stronger case , he said , but “ I do n’t see how they can validly prosecute her ” for swearing outside the baggage area .

A Superior Court judge recently threw out the disturbing - the - peace allegation against Venable but ordered her to be arraigned in March on the disorderly conduct charge .
Venable did n’t comment , nor did a spokesman for the Orange County district attorney ’s office .

May 5 , 2007  -- A California man may pay with prison time for a public display of affection on a plane .
Carl Persing was convicted Thursday of interfering with flight attendants and crew members after he and his girlfriend , Dawn Sewell , were seen " embracing , kissing and acting in a manner that made other passengers uncomfortable , " according to a criminal complaint .
According to assistant U.S. Attorney John Bowler , Persing will likely serve jail time for the federal felony conviction , the Associated Press reports .
He was convicted after a three - day trial in U.S. District Court in Wilmington , Va .
According to an FBI indictment , Persing 's face was pressed to Sewell 's vaginal area during the September Southwest Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Raleigh , N.C .
When a flight attendant gave them a second warning , Persing reacted angrily and the couple , both in their early 40s , were arrested when the plane reached its destination .
At the time , the couple 's lawyer claimed that Persing had his head in Sewell 's lap because he was n't feeling well and that the flight attendant had humiliated and harassed them .
Persing 's conviction is the latest example of how in the wake of 9/11 and new security regulations , many airlines have become increasingly vigilant -- perhaps even uptight -- about minor infractions .
And many passengers realize they need to be on their best behavior when they take a flight .
" As a potential act of terrorism , it 's being a little oversensitive , " Charles Slepian , an aviation security expert at the Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center , said about Persing 's case .
" After all , the mile - high club has been around for at least 50 years .
But flight crews are sensitive that some passengers get upset when others get cozy , and that could erupt into an altercation . "
Although it usually covers serious criminal activity , the Patriot Act can apply to minor infractions on flights .
" You can't make any threatening gesture to an attendant because it does violate the Patriot Act , " explained Slepian .
" They do n't want you getting out of your seat except to go the lavatory .
The whole idea is to keep control .
If you react to the attendant , you 're going to get locked up . "
Flight attendants , with their increased power , definitely seem to be getting more sensitive to all types of behavior .
Emily Gillette claims that she was kicked off a plane last month for nursing her baby on a flight between Burlington , Vt. , and New York City .
A spokesman for Freedom Airlines , which was operating the Delta commuter flight , says that Gillette was ejected because she declined an attendant 's offer of a blanket .
One passenger on a Delta flight from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City was arrested for leaving his seat to go to the lavatory less than 30 minutes before landing ( due to the incident , air marshals ordered all passengers to put their hands on their heads for the rest of the flight ) .
And an Orthodox Jewish man was kicked off an Air Canada flight for praying , which attendants claim was making other passengers nervous .
Other passengers have been taken off flights for making jokes , such as asking attendants if they had " checked the crew for sobriety " and " where do you keep the bomb ? "
Some have been booted for taking onboard hand cream , matches and bottles of water , and for sniffing something in a bag .
And there does n't seem to be an age limit for the violators .
In 2005 , a United Airlines flight out of Chicago was delayed because a small boy said something inappropriate .
" It seems like there 's a real increase in these types of incidents .
They 're more sensitive to minor infractions , " said Anne Banas , the executive editor of SmarterTravel.com .
" There 's a no-tolerance policy .
It really seems like you have to be on your best behavior on the plane . "
So , what else constitutes bad behavior ?
According to Banas , try to avoid the following when flying : making jokes about blowing up planes ; getting drunk ; bumping other passengers with big bags ; taking up all the space in the overhead compartments .
Banas advised that you should show respect other passengers by not cursing and shouting .
The irony is that many travelers are already following those rules .
While flight crews may seem less tolerant of questionable behavior , passengers are actually getting nicer to the attendants , by at least one important measure .
The number of unruly passengers who have been penalized by the Federal Aviation Administration for trying to " assault , threaten , intimidate or interfere with a crewmember " has dropped dramatically in the last two years and is on track to hit a record low .
In 2004 , the FAA recorded 304 enforcement actions .
Through September of 2006 , there were only 79 such actions .
Of course , in these very sensitive times , almost everyone who flies experiences some tension , and sometimes it does boil over .
In September , Seth Stein , a London interior designer returning from his vacation in Turks and Caicos , was put in a chokehold and physically pinned to his seat by another passenger on an American Airlines flight .
Stein 's crime :
He used an iPod , went to the lavatory and his tan made him appear " Arab . "

From last weekend 's The New York Times Magazine comes Michael Pollan 's latest article about The Age of Nutritionism .
I would 've written about it sooner but it took me until last night to finish reading it .
It 's 12 pages long .
While the entire thing is absolutely worth reading , he ends with a " few ( flagrantly unscientific ) rules of thumb collected in the course of [ his ] nutritional odyssey " that bear repeating here , with my notes :
1. Eat food .
Do n't eat anything your great - great - grandmother would n't recognize as food .
Non-dairy creamer ?
You 're out .
You too , breakfast - cereal bars .
2. Avoid even those food products that come bearing health claims .
Science keeps changing , so trying to follow fads wo n't guarantee health .
You have a better chance at health by just eating a well - balanced diet .
3 . Especially avoid food products containing ingredients that are a ) unfamiliar , b ) unpronounceable c ) more than five in number — or that contain high - fructose corn syrup .
All those signs point to food that 's been processed .
More process = less nutrients and vitamins , never mind the environmental costs of producing the food .
4 . Get out of the supermarket whenever possible .
Buy food at farmer 's markets and you can avoid the foods listed in # 3 very easily .
5 . Pay more , eat less .
Pay for that grass - fed beef , but reduce your over - all beef consumption and it's not an exorbitant expense .
Interesting figure from the article : " Americans spend , on average , less than 10 percent of their income on food , down from 24 percent in 1947 , and less than the citizens of any other nation . "
6 . Eat mostly plants , especially leaves .
You do n't have to turn into a bunny , but make sure you 're getting greens .
They pack a nutritional wallop , but science still can't tell you exactly what inside is so good .
7 . Eat more like the French .
Or the Japanese .
Or the Italians .
Or the Greeks .
Confounding factors aside , people who eat according to the rules of a traditional food culture are generally healthier than we are .
You know , that whole Mediterranean diet , " French Women Don't Get Fat " thing .
8. Cook .
And if you can , plant a garden .
Duh .
If you cook from scratch , it 's unlikely you 'll add ferrous sulfate or sodium tripoly - phosphate to your dinner .
See # 3 above .
9 . Eat like an omnivore .
Variety is important , and we 've been reducing the diversity in our diets over the years .
Plus " biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields . "
Those tips should be given to every single citizen of the United States , as far as I 'm concerned .
It 's hard to believe we 've gotten to the point that we do n't know how to eat anymore .

The Kitchen has a summary of the article as well , highlighting some other facets of Pollan 's argument .

There ’s a place in the world where children can swim among polar bears .
Since July 2004 , in the little town of Cochrane , northern Ontario ( Canada ) , you can visit the Polar Bear Habitat , a kind of local zoo where people can live the once - in - a - lifetime experience of an outdoor swim with polar bears .
Of course , the humans are in a different pool , separated from the bears habitat by just a layer of glass .
Can you see the water drops now ?
There 's a bulletproof , shatterproof glass that 's almost 9 centimetres thick , because although they 're cute , polar bears are among the world 's most ferocious carnivores .
It took 20 years for the Polar Bear Conservation and Education Habitat and Heritage Village to get off the ground .
When it opened in it attracted some 11,000 visitors in the first six months .
And now you ’re invited to go and swim with all those bears if you dare .
I do n’t .

The Infinite Teen Slang Dictionary
There are a near - infinite number of slang words which are still only in hypothetical usage among the youth of today and tomorrow - this service attempts to pre-emptively catalogue them , for the benefit of baby namers , dot - com registrars and other dangerously bored people .
Enter a name or word or phrase , to see what it might ( but does n't ) mean .
Update
That did n't take long .
After less than a day of deliberations , a federal jury found Vonage guilty of infringing on three of seven VoIP - related patents held by Verizon .
The jury hearing the case awarded Verizon $ 58 million in damages and said that the VoIP provider must pay royalties of 5.5 percent to Verizon if it wishes to continue using Verizon 's IP .
In a statement , Vonage noticed that the jury only found that it had infringed on three of the seven patents in question , with two of them related to billing .
The jury also ruled that Vonage did not willfully infringe Verizon 's patents , which likely reduced the damages award from the $ 197 million figure Verizon was seeking .
Vonage plans to appeal the verdict and is attempting to reassure customers that there will be no interruption in services , saying that should Verizon 's request for an injunction against Vonage be granted , it will be immediately appealed .
A hearing on Verizon 's request for an injunction will take place on March 23 .
In a statement , Verizon said that " We are proud of our inventors and pleased the jury stood up for the legal protections they deserve . "
The verdict will send jolts through the VoIP industry , and other VoIP providers may now be feeling nervous at the prospect that they , too , will be targeted by Verizon .
With over 2.2 million subscribers , Vonage is currently the largest VoIP provider in the US .
Original story
During closing arguments in its patent infringement case against Vonage , Verizon attorneys asked the jury to award the telecom $ 197 million in damages along with royalties of $ 4.93 per customer , per month .
Accusing the United States ' largest VoIP provider of building its business on Verizon 's patent portfolio , Verizon lawyer Dan Webb told the jury that " This company has done very well with our patents and our technology for a number of years , " according to Reuters .
Verizon 's case hinges on seven patents awarded some time ago , covering voice mail , call forwarding , and WiFi calls .
The seven patents turned into 48 patent infringement claims — all of which Verizon was allowed to raise during the trial .
In its defense , Vonage raised questions about the validity of Verizon 's patents and argued that the VoIP provider did not infringe at all .
During his closing arguments , Vonage lawyer Roger Warin said that the technologies covered in Verizon 's patents were actually the invention of another VoIP provider , Net2Phone , and predated Verizon 's patent applications .
Warin also accused Verizon of using the lawsuit to kill off a major competitor in an area where the telecom is losing customers .
Verizon has seen its landline customer base shrinking as consumers drop landlines in favor of cellular and VoIP .
The telecom offers its own VoIP service , but it is not as well - known as Vonage and is significantly more expensive .
Vonage got a head start in the VoIP game and the infringement case represents an attack by a larger latecomer to the market wielding a hefty patent portfolio .
Should the case end in a victory for Verizon , Vonage could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and royalties .
It could also result in an injunction against Vonage using the patents , which could have serious implications for its VoIP services and customers .
A Verizon victory would also spell trouble for other players in the VoIP industry .
Vonage has said that its operations would be unaffected by a Verizon triumph , but given the company 's history of hemorrhaging money , absorbing a sizable judgment and paying royalties of almost $ 5 per customer , per month may prove very difficult .

Posted by Greg Robbins , Software EngineerWhen you trust your personal data to Google , it 's still your data .
You 're free to edit it , to share it with others , or to download it and take it somewhere else entirely .
The principle is simple : we wo n't lock you away from your data .
In practice , we work hard to be sure that you and the software you use have the access that makes the principle really meaningful .
Last year , Google introduced Google data APIs , based on the Atom Publishing Protocol .
Google data APIs are just a standard way to allow programs to get at your data on our servers .
They already work with Google Calendar , Google Base , Blogger , and many other services .
Google provides libraries to make it easy for programmers working in Java , C# , and Javascript to use the APIs .
The native language for Mac OS X applications is Objective - C , and it's our preferred language for Mac application development .
To make it simpler for us to write Mac software that interacts with Google services , I created a framework to use Google data APIs directly in Objective - C programs .
We are using the framework for our application development , and today we are making the framework available to all developers .
The Google Data APIs Objective - C Library joins MacFUSE and Breakpad as open - source development efforts of Google 's Mac software team , hosted at code.google.com .
A few small examples will give programmers an idea of how natural it is to use the framework to interact with Google services .
Say an online roleplaying game wants to add a reminder to your Google Calendar that you need to be ready to join your guild in battle tonight between 10 and 11 pm .
Adding the appointment to your calendar takes a few lines like this :
Or , if a screensaver wants to get the items you 've advertised for sale on Google Base and animate them in a groovy fashion , this is how it would retrieve your stuff :
The framework calls back into the screensaver with the list ( called a ) of Google Base items :
The framework also supports key - value coding , so it 's quick and easy for Mac code chefs to use Cocoa bindings to whip up user interface displays of your information .
Several sample Cocoa applications are available at code.google.com to show how to use more features of the Google data APIs .
Google Calendar , Google Base , Google Spreadsheets , and generic Atom feeds like Blogger are supported now in the framework , with access to more services already in development .
If you are a Mac developer , I hope you 'll join the open - source project and help us make even more Mac applications Google - savvy .

of the House and Senate continues to escalate .
" You ca n't say I want to win the war but not be willing to fight the war , " Karl Rove told the Washington Post Sunday .
But that 's only half the story .
A 2002 overhaul of campaign law shifted ad - financing contributions to independent groups — and these groups are more likely to air negative campaign ads .
In this new landscape , nearly $ 60 million has been spent on a massive stockpile of television artillery .
The pageant of grotesqueries is entertaining eyeballs all over the InterTubes , as with the ones in this round - up of nasty Senate ads .
Below are four even - nastier ads for tight House races — plus an update on the nastiest Senate race of all .
A silhouette of a stripper appears next to footage of a smirking district attorney — Michael Arcuri , the Democratic House candidate for New York 's 24th Congressional district .
"
The phone number to an adult fantasy hotline appeared on Michael Arcuri's New York City hotel room bill , " the announcer warns , " while he was there on official business ...
Who calls a fantasy hotline and then bills taxpayers ? " " Bad call ! " the stripper moans .
What the ad does n't say is the call lasted less than a minute , and was apparently a wrong number .
While attending a 2004 conference for district attorneys , the director of New York 's Prosecutor Training Institute had used Acuri 's phone to dial the state 's Department of Criminal Justice Services , which coincidentally had the same number , but with a 1 - 800 area code .
Immediately realizing his mistake , he 'd dialed the correct number , Arcuri told the— producing phone records to back up his claim .
The cost of the mis-dialed phone call ?
$ 1.25 .
The ad cites as its source conservative web site HumanEvents.com , though the story was published the same day the National Republican Campaign Committee distributed the information .
( Ironically , the story 's 26 - year - old author , Robert B Bluey , is analumnus of Cybercast News Service , which also employed suspected male prostitute Jeff Gannon . )
Because of the ad's misleading nature , New York television stations are refusing to broadcast it , and in the Times ' article even Arcuri's Republican opponent Ray Meier characterized the attack as " way over the line . "
In fact , both men told the Associated Press they were friends , and regretted the nasty tone of ads funded by their parties ' national committees .
But the National Republican Congressional Committeeinsisted the ad's claim that the call appeared on a taxpayer - funded phone bill is " totally true , and we stand by it .
" In another NRCC ad , their announcer tells voters that " A man charged with raping a 13 - year - old girl was let out of jail after Michael Arcuri 's office did n't indict him in time .
" For the other side of Capitol Hill , the National Republican Senate Committee has created a sexy ad of their own .
It 's a montage of bizarro - world voters , each giving a ridiculously unappealing reason for supporting Tennessee Senate candidate Harold Ford .
" Terrorists need their privacy . " " When I die , Harold Ford will let me pay taxes again ! " " Ford 's right .
I do have too many guns !
"
" So he took money from porn movie producers .
Who has n't ?
" The format gives the ad's producers an opportunity to include a woman wearing nothing but a necklace , squeaking in a bimbo voice that she met Harold at the Playboy party .
It 's an allusion to a 2005 Super Bowl party Ford attended , which the Republicans have been using since last March , to attack Ford 's appeal to values voters .
( " What kind of man parties with Playboy playmates in lingerie , and then films political ads from a church pew ? " )
But even Ford 's opponent , Republican Bob Corker , thinks the national committee 's latest ad " has no place in this , or any other campaign , " according to his campaign manager .
( Who added that the ad was " tacky , over the top and ... not reflective of the kind of campaign we are running . " )
The ad closes with the warning that the candidate is " just not right " - followed by one last shot of the mock Playboy bunny , whispering into the camera .
" Harold ?
Call me !
" Idaho Republican Bill Sali finds himself in a surprisingly competive race for a district which encompasses half the state .
Now he 's facing TV attacks with a barrage of damning quotes about his candidacy — from Republicans .
" He was incompetent in the legislature , " goes the quote attributed to State Senator Sheila Sorensen .
" In the campaign he proved himself dishonest and deceitful and he'd be an embarrassment to Idaho . " " He's an obstinate opportunist , " according to Representative Dolores Crow .
" An absolute idiot , " says another quote from Speaker Bruce Newcomb .
" He does n't have one ounce of empathy in his whole fricking body , and you can put that in the paper .
" Sali is a far - right conservative who squeaked onto the ballot after winning 18,965 votes in a six - way primary .
A social and fiscal conservative , Sali entered the race with a $ 400,000 war - chest , prompting Idaho 's largest newspaper to dub him " a wholly - owned subsidiary of a big out - of - state benefactor , the anti-tax Club for Growth . "
His confrontational 16 - year career in the state legislature has apparently created lingering bad feelings among other Republicans .
( When Dick Cheney came to Idaho to campaign for Sali , all of Idaho 's Republican congressmen reportedly skipped the event . )
This created an opening for Idaho Democrat Larry Grant .
The announcer in his ad does n't identify his party affiliation .
It just reminds voters that " If you 're a Republican or independent and you want to vote for Larry Grant — you 're in good company .
" Majority Action is a 527 group which includes seven former members of Congress and the national field director for Al Gore 's 2000 campaign .
They 've assembled a series of hard - hitting ads about stem cell research , an issue some believe could become a liberal wedge issue splitting voters off from traditionally Republican blocs .
Missouri Senate candidate Claire McCaskill has already tapped the issue for her tight race against Republican Jim Talent .
( Michael J.
Fox reminds viewers he cares deeply about stem cell research , and tells Missouri voters the election 's results matter to millions of Americans — " Americans like me . " )
But a new ad by Majority Action tries to personalize the stakes even more .
" This ad , in very powerful terms , lays out what is at stake in the stem cell debate , " says the group 's Executive Director .
One shows three people matter - of - factly describing the medical problems waiting in their future .
A boy says he 'll be paralyzed for the rest of his life ; a woman saying she 'll have Alzheimer 's disease ; a little girl says she 'll be diagnosed with diabetes .
Staring at the camera , they indict the Congressmen who voted against federal funding for stem cell research , saying it could save their lives , and maybe the lives of the viewer 's family .
" Help me ! " the boy says .
" Help me ! " the little girl says ... Majority Action is running the same ad against four Republican House candidates — Don Sherwood , Jim Walsh , Chris Chocola , and Thelma Drake .
Thelma
Drake gets a second dose of negativity from Majority Action in another ad saying she " wo n't stand up to the Bush / Cheney White House .
"
The ad is a straightforward attempt to link the Virginia Congresswoman to the failures of the Bush administration .
An image of George Bush , doubling into two , and then four images , repeats " We must stay the course .
We must stay the course .
We must stay the course ... " " It was the right thing to do , " Dick Cheney says nonchalantly about the war in Iraq , " and if we had it to do over again , we 'd do exactly the same thing .
A closeup then appears of George Washington 's sad eye on the dollar bill , next to the words " Exactly the same ?
Cost : Over $ 300 billion .
Billions missing and insider deals .... " " It was the right thing to do , " Dick Cheney says again , " and if we had it to do over again we'd do exactly the same thing . " " Insufficient forces .
No weapons of mass destruction .
Dubai ports sales scandal .
Our ports and borders : unsecured .
" The ad's stark take is matched by its striking melodramatic music - a disembodied chorus rising over discordant violins which would be more at home on the soundtrack of a scary movie .
" U.S. Intelligence Report : Iraq war breeding more terrorists .
Five ' F's ' from 9/11 Commission .
bin Laden still at large .
Exactly the same ?
" The same ad is also being run agaisnt House candidates Dave Reichert , Deborha Pryce , and Jim Walsh .
To condemn each of these lawmaker 's support of President Bush , the ads close by ( badly ) inserting Dick Cheney 's lips into pictures of the candidates , so it looks like they 're speaking Cheney 's words .
The ad - makers are hoping to swing the election towards the Democrats , and they 're staking it on the idea that voters will find something unforgiveable in the Vice President 's staunch refusal to concede mistakes .
" It was the right thing to do , " they lip sync , " and if we had it to do over again we'd do exactly the same thing . "
Shortly after the woman 's injury , Dr. Bernard Devauchelle , head of face and jaw surgery at Amiens University Hospital , decided that the woman was a candidate for a partial face transplant and sent an urgent request for help in locating a donor to the French Biomedicine Agency , which oversees the allocation of organs for transplant in France .
The window for a successful transplant was narrow , the doctors said , because the wound was developing scar tissue .
Dr. Benoît Lengelé , a Belgian surgeon who assisted in the transplant , said the woman would have required at least three or four traditional plastic surgery operations to rebuild her face with skin flaps from other parts of her body , but the results would never have been aesthetically or functionally satisfactory .
Meanwhile , the woman 's injury had made it difficult for her to talk or even drink and eat , because food and liquid spilled easily from her mouth .
The doctors said her ability to open her jaw was also progressively diminishing as her wounded tissue stiffened .
In July , Dr. Devauchelle consulted with Dr. Dubernard , who visited the woman in early August .
" The moment she removed her mask , which she always wore , I had no more hesitation , " Dr. Dubernard said Friday .
No information was given about the donor , a brain - dead woman whose anonymity is protected by law .
She was located on Saturday at a hospital in the northern city of Lille , 85 miles from Amiens .
Brain - dead patients in France are presumed to be organ donors unless they have made explicit provisions to the contrary , and approval by next of kin is not normally required .
But given the delicacy of the case , the donor 's family was consulted about the possible harvesting of part of the donor 's face during the initial interviews that are undertaken to ensure that the deceased had not given instructions preventing organ donations .
A special team of psychologists worked with the family on Saturday afternoon as the doctors involved were notified that a potential donor had been found .
By midnight Saturday , Dr. Devauchelle , who led the surgical team , was in Lille to begin harvesting the face while another team of surgeons in snowy Amiens began removing scar tissue from the patient in preparation for the transplant .
However , one thing is critical to keep in mind .
If you are going to use the model for forecasting , the model must be tested .
Testing the model is called “ validation ” , or sometimes “ back - casting . ”
This involves feeding the model real data , and observing how well the predictions match up with the observations .
If the predictions match up on a consistent basis , and any large variations are explainable , you have the makings of a predictive model .
If you have not validated your model , or if you have attempted to validate it and found that the predictions were inconsistent , the model should be used with caution ( if at all ) .
In this essay I have done some back - casts on the Hubbert Linearization ( HL ) model and attempted to use it to make predictions using historical data .
Like Cindy Crawford , I have done quite a bit of modeling in my career .
However , mine has been in front of a computer .
There are various types of models .
They can be empirical , such that you curve fit data without having a clear explanation of the underlying mechanisms .
Or they can be theoretical , in which the system is modeled according to the governing scientific principles and mathematical equations .
The background of the technique is outside the scope of this essay , but Stuart Staniford has provided details here .
The HL model is a hybrid model with empirical parts and theoretical parts .
Jumping past the differential equations involved , a basic explanation of the modeling technique is as follows :
If one plots the cumulative oil production of a region ( Q ) , versus the yearly production ( P ) divided by the cumulative production ( P/Q ) , a plot can be made to extrapolate and find the ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) for the region ( Qt ) .
You can see a number of HL examples in Stuart ’s essays When Does Hubbert Linearization Work ? and Extrapolating World Production
Qt and Peak Production
I am unaware of a case in which a country has completely run out of recoverable oil and had Qt verified by the HL method .
However , there are plenty of examples in which a region ’s production profile follows the expected path determined by the HL .
There are also many examples showing that a region ’s production peaked at very close to 50 % of Qt. Quoting from an article by Jeffrey Brown and Khebab :
With time , a HL data set starts to show a linear progression , and one can extrapolate the data down to where P is effectively zero , which gives one Qt , or ultimate recoverable reserves for the region .
Based on the assumption that production tends to peak at about 50 % of Qt , one can generate a predicted production profile for the region .
The Lower 48 peaked at 48.5 % of Qt .
Some areas have tended to peak at a higher % Qt than others .
It is commonly claimed that Texas production , for example , peaked in 1972 at 57 % of Qt ( the reason for the qualifier will become apparent later in the essay ) .
The fact that Texas peaked later than most regions is sometimes explained by the fact that prior to 1972 Texas was the swing producer , and production was regulated .
This situation is similar to that of Saudi Arabia , so Texas is often used as an analog for predicting Saudi Arabia ’s peak .
So far , so good .
But the astute reader may wonder “ Can the value of Qt change significantly over time ? ”
If the answer is “ yes ” , then the inevitable follow - up is “ Then how can I be confident in using the HL to predict a peak ? ”
I will attempt to answer these key questions by looking at the evolution of the HL for Texas over time .
Evolution of the Texas HL
I have retrieved historical Texas oil production records and modeled a series of HLs at various time periods .
According to a 1956 Hubbert paper , ( 1 ) Texas had extracted approximately 4 billion barrels of oil prior to 1935 .
Beginning in 1935 , we have annual production statistics that take us through the end of 2006 .
( 2 ) Therefore , we can construct a series of HL curves .
To avoid any bias on my part , I had Excel extrapolate the line and make the forecast once there was a relatively smooth trend .
Let ’s take a snapshot from 1960 :
Figure 1 . Hubbert Linearization of Texas Oil Production Using Data Available in 1960 .
As you can see , we have a nice trend .
In fact , the latest 10 points are reminiscent of today ’s HL of Saudi Arabia .
The points have settled down and are staying pretty close to the line .
So , what could we say in 1960 ?
Qt as determined in 1960 from the intercept above is 42.5 billion barrels ( Gbl ) .
Texas crossed 50 % of Qt in 1957 , and by 1960 was at 56 % of Qt – almost the same value as today .
Surely peak was imminent .
In fact , if you look at the data , Texas clearly peaked in 1956 at 1.079 MM bbl / day .
By 1960 , Texas was down to 892,000 bbl / day .
It had undergone an annual decline of 5.5 % for 4 years , and was well past 50 % of Qt .
In 1960 , we could have said “ Texas oil production peaked in 1956 , as predicted by the HL method . ”
But as we know , that ’s not at all what happened .
That would have been forecasting the peak 16 years too early .
So let ’s fast - forward to 1970 :
Figure 2 . Hubbert Linearization of Texas Oil Production Using Data Available in 1970 .
Well , that ’s not very helpful .
Our Texas HL in 1970 is much more muddled than in 1960 .
The 1956 record was broken in 1968 – twelve years after the 1960 analysis indicated a peak .
We are starting to see some points rise above the line and extend Qt out further than was implied in 1960 .
The trend line that Excel drew is now forecasting 46.25 Gbl as our URR .
That puts production in 1970 at 73 % of Qt .
The last 14 years had been spent well above 50 % of Qt. But , the last 4 points – starting in 1967 – seem to indicate that Qt may end up being even further out than we thought .
Now remember , it ’s 1970 .
What exactly about this curve would indicate that we are 2 years from peaking ?
Let ’s jump forward now to 1980 :
Figure 3 . Hubbert Linearization of Texas Oil Production Using Data Available in 1980 .
Qt continues to grow .
Excel is now forecasting Qt at 55.5 Gbl .
The trend toward a higher URR is evident .
The last few points imply that the forecast will grow to 57 Gbl .
If so , our 1980 HL would put Texas ’ 1972 peak at 63 % of Qt . So , not only do we see Qt growing with time , we see that the % of Qt when the 1972 peak occurred is getting smaller .
So , can we forecast the 1972 peak by 1980 ?
No .
We have already seen a case where the 1956 production record was n’t broken for 12 years .
The %
Qt during that time was well over 50 % .
The % Qt in 1970 had climbed to 73 % .
Yet that still did n’t enable us to call peak .
On what basis could we have done so in 1980 ?
We have now gone through 24 years in which we could say “ peak might be here . ”
To suggest that we could have made any other forecast at that time is wishful thinking .
So let ’s skip to present day – end of 2006 :
Figure 4 . Hubbert Linearization of Texas Oil Production Using Data Available in 2006 .
Qt is now at 62 Gbl , but look at those last few points .
They are once again pointing to a higher Qt. Some time in the 1980’s , as production continued to fall , we could have finally said “ 1972 was the peak . ”
But the % of Qt for the 1972 peak is still a moving target .
Today , the 1972 peak clocks in at 58.3 % of Qt – not far from the value in 1960 .
In 1980 it was 63 % of Qt , and in 1970 it was 73 % of Qt . Therefore , the claim of “ no examples of large producing regions showing sustained , steady increases in production past the 60 % of Qt mark ” is clearly wrong .
Texas showed steady production increases past the 60 % mark of Qt , because it reached that level in the early 1960’s .
Texas even showed production increases past 70 % Qt , as it reached 73 % two years prior to the production peak .
Implications for Saudi
So , is Saudi like Texas in 1956 , or is Saudi like Texas in 1972 ?
Or is it like neither ?
The HL ca n’t tell us that .
This essay should make clear that confidently predicting a Saudi peak on the basis of the Texas HL is nothing more than an exercise in faith - based forecasting .
The only reason that the Texas HL looks as it does is because we have decades of data points following the Texas peak .
But what is missed is that the HL has changed greatly from the time Texas actually peaked .
So the Texas HL at its peak looked nothing like the Saudi HL of today .
It is invalid to use three decades of hindsight for refining the Texas forecast , because we clearly do n't have the same option with Saudi Arabia .
Yet some argue that the Saudi peak can be forecast with confidence using the knowledge obtained from the case of Texas – a region in which the uncertainty of the method spanned almost 3 decades .
So , the HL has shown that it is good at forecasting the past , but can be very unreliable for predicting the future .
In Part II , we will examine the evolution of the Saudi HL over time .
Note
For those who may be unfamiliar with my position , this argument in no way diminishes my belief that we need to take action right now concerning oil depletion .
I am merely evaluating one of the tools that is used to forecast peak , and trying to determine whether that tool can give us any precision on forecasting a peak in Saudi Arabia .
My conclusion is that it can’t , but we will look at the specific case of Saudi Arabia in Part II .

Tim O’Reilly issued a Draft Blogger ’s Code of Conduct yesterday , in response to the blogging ethics questions raised by death threats and other nastiness in comments at Kathy Sierra ’s blog .
Excerpts :
We take responsibility for our own words and for the comments we allow on our blog .
We wo n’t say anything online that we would n’t say in person .
We connect privately before we respond publicly .
When we believe someone is unfairly attacking another , we take action .
We do not allow anonymous comments .
We ignore the trolls .
Tim even crafted a badge for your blog .
And another one if your motto is “ anything goes ” .
Naturally , the blogosphere erupted .
Bloggers like being told how to run their blogs almost as much as they enjoy DMCA take - down notices .
Andy Beal points out flaws in most of the above commandments , especially the parts where the blogger must assume responsibility for content posted by others .
Shelley makes a good point about the subterranean communication channels proposed in # 3 , “ If what I write offends , the person offended can tell me so to my face ” ( i.e. out on the open blog ) .
Seth asks , “ who enforces it ? ” And Valleywagquips :
While we ’re at it , how about an ombudsman , required ethics courses at J - school , and regulation by the FCC ?
Because that ’s worked so well for America ’s breathtakingly turgid daily newspapers , and bland network news .
To try to craft any code of conduct that applies to all bloggers completely misses one of the most important characteristics of blogging : freedom of individual expression and diversity .
So rules of conduct must be left to the individual — but how do we deal with unacceptable content ?
Kent Newsome ’s idea might be a good place to start .
What rules do you impose on yourself and your readers when you blog ?
Is it “ anything goes ” , or “ play nicely with others ” ?
Why would the framers , whose political genius has not been exceeded , have countenanced such an unfair exception ?
Jefferson objected that ideas are , “ like fire , expansible over all space , without lessening their density at any point , and , like the air in which we breathe , move and have our physical being , incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation . ”
But ideas are immaterial to the question of copyright .
Mozart and Neil Diamond may have begun with the same idea , but that a work of art is more than an idea is confirmed by the difference between the “ Soave sia il vento ” and “ Kentucky Woman . ”
We have different words for art and idea because they are two different things .
The flow and proportion of the elements of a work of art , its subtle engineering , even its surface glosses , combine substance and style indistinguishably in a creation for which the right of property is natural and becoming .
And in Jefferson ’s era 95 percent of the population drew its living from the land .
Writers and inventors were largely those who obtained their sustenance from their patrimony or their mills ; their writings or improvements to craft were secondary .
No one except perhaps Hamilton or Franklin might have imagined that services and intellectual property would become primary fields of endeavor and the chief engines of the economy .
Now they are , and it is no more rational to deny them equal status than it would have been to confiscate farms , ropewalks and other forms of property in the 18th century .
Still , it is the express order of the Constitution , long imprinted without catastrophe upon the fabric of our history .
But given the grace of the Constitution it is not surprising to find the remedy within it , in the very words that prohibit the holding of patents or copyrights in perpetuity : “ for limited Times . ”
The genius of the framers in making this provision is that it allows for infinite adjustment .
Congress is free to extend at will the term of copyright .
It last did so in 1998 , and should do so again , as far as it can throw .
Would it not be just and fair for those who try to extract a living from the uncertain arts of writing and composing to be freed from a form of confiscation not visited upon anyone else ?
The answer is obvious , and transcends even justice .
No good case exists for the inequality of real and intellectual property , because no good case can exist for treating with special disfavor the work of the spirit and the mind .
The top Republican on the House 's main investigative committee , Rep. Thomas Davis of Virginia , is charging the Justice Department with stonewalling his inquiries about the FBI 's assertion that it closed several leak investigations because of a lack of cooperation on the part of other government officials .
In January , Mr. Davis asked the Justice Department about a report in The New York Sun that at least three leak inquiries were shut down after officials at the " victim agency " ignored phone calls and canceled meetings with FBI agents assigned to the probes .
The agents said some requests for information were rebuffed for more than a year .
On Friday , the lawmaker , the ranking Republican member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , sent a sharply worded letter to Attorney General Gonzales , expressing " aggravation " at the Justice Department 's handling of questions about the aborted investigations .
" General Gonzales , it would be an understatement to say I am frustrated and disappointed by your department 's response , " Mr. Davis wrote .
Mr. Davis said he would agree to procedures for a classified briefing , but that the Justice Department replied that " the concern is not classification . "
Mr. Davis 's letter also disclosed that the director of the FBI , Robert Mueller , is conducting an internal review of the bureau 's handling of leak cases .
The Republican congressman 's complaints about Justice Department intransigence come as the attorney general faces mounting criticism .
Yesterday , Senator Schumer urged Mr. Gonzales to resign .
" Attorney General Gonzales is a nice man , but he either does n't accept or does n't understand that he is no longer just the president 's lawyer , but has a higher obligation to the rule of law and the Constitution , even when the president should not want it to be so , " Mr. Schumer said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
" This department has been so political that I think , for the sake of the nation , Attorney General Gonzales should step down , " said Mr. Schumer , a Democrat of New York who sits on the Judiciary Committee .
In recent days , Mr. Gonzales has faced sustained bipartisan criticism over the administration 's dismissal of at least eight U.S. attorneys .
The Justice Department claimed that all but one of the departures were sought for performance reasons , but others have seen political overtones to the ousters .
McClatchy Newspapers reported Saturday that the chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico , Allen Weh , said he complained to the White House twice about the chief federal prosecutor in that state , David Iglesias .
Some Republicans were upset that Mr. Iglesias was moving too slowly on a corruption investigation of local Democrats .
Mr. Weh said his first complaint , in 2005 , was to an aide to President Bush 's top political adviser , Karl Rove .
The second conversation was directly with Mr. Rove at a White House event in 2006 , the state party official said .
" It was n't that Iglesias was n't looking out for Republicans .
He just was n't doing his job , period , " Mr. Weh told the newspaper chain .
Mr. Iglesias has defended his record and said he resisted political pressure to indict Democrats before the 2006 election .
In an op - ed piece last week , Mr. Gonzales downplayed the flap over the prosecutors as an " overblown personnel matter , " though he now seems more contrite about the department 's actions .
On Friday , Mr. Gonzales came under fire on a second front , regarding alleged misuse of administrative subpoenas which do not require judicial approval and are known as national security letters .
A report by the Justice Department 's inspector general found that the FBI sometimes issued the letters without proper authority , obtained data beyond what the law permits , and failed to include more than 8,000 of the information demands in statistics provided to Congress .
Senator Specter of Pennsylvania , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , had raised the possibility that Mr. Gonzales might depart his post soon , but appearing on CBS yesterday , Mr. Specter stopped short of calling for the former White House counsel 's firing .
" I think that 's a question for the president and the attorney general , but I do think there have been lots of problems , " Mr. Specter said .
" Before we come to conclusions we need to know more facts . "
However , Mr. Specter said Congress was likely to rein in the FBI 's subpoena power .
" It has been very badly abused , " he said .
Senator Biden , a Democrat of Delaware , said yesterday that America would be " better off " if the attorney general quit .
" Gonzales has lost the confidence of the vast majority of Americans , " Mr. Biden told CNN 's " Late Edition . "
A White House spokesman said yesterday that President Bush dismissed the call for Mr. Gonzales 's resignation .
" The president has confidence in the attorney general , " the spokesman , R. Alexander Conant , said .
" The attorney general has shown leadership by demanding a new and higher level of accountability of the FBI 's use of national security letters in terrorism investigations . "
Mr. Conant referred questions about Mr. Rove 's alleged involvement in the dismissals of the New Mexico prosecutor to the Justice Department .
In a statement , a spokesman there , Brian Roehrkasse , did not address that issue or comment directly on Mr. Schumer 's suggestion that Mr. Gonzales resign .
" The attorney general demonstrated decisive leadership by demanding a new level of accountability to address systematic problems in oversight over some of the FBI 's national security tools , " Mr. Roehrkasse said , according to the Associated Press .
Another spokesman for the department , Dean Boyd , said Mr. Davis 's letter about the leak probes was under review .
" As a general matter , we receive outstanding cooperation from victim agencies , including intelligence agencies , during investigations into leaks of classified information , " the spokesman said .
The FBI had no immediate response yesterday to a request for comment about the scope of Mr. Mueller 's review of leak cases .
The Sun 's report that the FBI cited a lack of cooperation when closing investigations into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information was based on records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by this reporter .
In a court filing in December , the FBI said 22 investigative files pertaining to leak probes were " missing " with no indication of who had removed them .
Late last month , the FBI told the court that 19 of the files have been physically located and that the bureau can account for the three others .
10 . Pulp Fiction
What everyone thinks the message is : Tarantino values extreme violence and immoral , criminal characters
What it actually is : A selfish , violent life is one not worth living , and redemption is possible for anyone who wants it badly enough .
Most people who truly appreciate Pulp Fiction easily understand its message , but most of the twitchy , conservative , older generation who decried its violence and profanity completely missed the point .
It ’s easy to look at Pulp Fiction ’s best scenes of violence and assume that Tarantino is glorifying the gangster lifestyle , until you consider that the only characters who end up living are the ones who ( in some way or another ) renounce their selfish ways and redeem themselves .
Plus , how can anyone watch Marcellus Wallace get anally raped and think that it glorifies the life of a criminal ?
9. Jarhead
What everyone thinks the message is :
War is really good !
OR : War is really bad !
What it actually is : Respect your Marines .
Jarhead is a movie where you more or less get from it what you bring to it .
If you are vehemently pro or anti-war , Jarhead will do nothing to change your mind in that respect .
While the trailer made it seem like a modern Apocalypse Now – the gas mask football sequence seems a lot cooler when taken out of context – Jarhead strives only to tell the true story of what it it ’s like to be a Marine .
In this case , it involved a lot of waiting , masturbating , and getting cheated on by your girlfriend .
Kind of like high school .
8. Little Miss Sunshine
What everyone thinks the message is : Life sucks ass !
What it actually is : Life rules !
I did n’t say you had to agree with the true moral of every movie , especially considering how sappy and mainstream the otherwise - adequate Little Miss Sunshine is , but them ’s the breaks .
Despite cramming as much forced familial dysfunction and philosophical cynicism as humanly possible into the first 90 % of the movie , the writers make a complete 180 at the film ’s climax and decide that , despite the fact that one of the characters is dead and the rest have had their lives ruined in literally every way conceivable , that life is actually pretty neat !
Even if your gay lover left you for someone who now has your job , and even if you ca n’t realize your dream of becoming a jet pilot due to biological defects beyond your control , and even if your self - help program did n’t sell ( thus leaving you nearly bankrupt with two kids to support ) , everything can be okay if you dance !
If the movie had gone on for another week , most of the main characters would have committed suicide out of depression .
7. Raging Bull
What everyone thinks the message is : Determination and unwillingness to compromise can lead you to the top .
What it actually is :
Do n’t be an asshole .
In talking about Raging Bull , Scorsese frequently mentions La Strada , an old film of director Frederico Fellini .
In it , an asshole strongman befriends a kind young girl , and then abandons her on the road where she later dies .
Too late , the strongman realizes he ’s made a horrendous mistake .
THAT , in essence , is what Raging Bull is about .
If you have a friend who claims to be knowledgeable about movies , ask him what Raging Bull is about .
If he says “ it ’s about the rise and fall of a boxer , ” or if he talks about how the best part of the movie is the well - choreographed boxing scenes , then he ’s an idiot and you should kick him in the penis .
If he says “ it ’s about a violent boxer whose intensity in the ring propels him to stardom , but whose same intensity in his private life drives away everyone he loves , ” then you ’re probably talking to me .
In which case , you should probably give me money for my time .
6. Donnie Darko
What everyone thinks the message is : Donnie goes back in time and intentionally kills himself at the end , thus preventing all of the problems he causes later in life .
What it actually is : Donnie rips the engine off his mother ’s plane and throws it through the time vortex making his death not an intentional desire to prevent his existence but rather a necessity in order for him to be sent to heaven and what the goddamn shit am I talking about ?
Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding about Donnie Darko ’s theme is the assumption that there is any theme at all .
While emos have clutched onto this movie like their own cinematic Bible , and while it is an entertaining flick in its own right , a hard truth must be faced : if you watch the movie , and just the movie , and you think you ’ve understood the plot , you are wrong .
Very large , very important information pertaining to the movie is , for some reason , only available on the Donnie Darko website ( which is structured more like an interactive game than a movie webpage ) .
Now , does that make the flick any less entertaining or weird or fun ?
No .
But it does make whatever standalone message you thought you gleaned from the flick completely null and void .
5 . The Searchers
What everyone thinks the message is :
Nothing can break the bond between family , or the determination of one man ’s love for his niece .
What it actually is : John Wayne hates himself some Injuns .
If you have n’t seen The Searchers in a really long time , you ’ll probably remember it as a really great adventure story about some evil Indians and a heroic ex-soldier .
And while it is a great adventure story , and a good movie in its own right , that ’s not really what it ’s about .
John Wayne , a racist ex-Confederate soldier , tracks down his kidnapped niece more out of hatred for Injuns than love for the girl .
After finding out that she has become assimilated into their culture , Wayne seriously considers murdering her ( against the wishes of his part - Indian nephew , who he pretty much treats like shit for the entire movie ) .
You may also remember a great tracking shot of Wayne riding through an Indian camp , pistols blazing in both hands .
You may not remember the part right afterward where he grabs the incapacitated Indian Chief and then scalps him for his own enjoyment .
4. Casablanca
What everyone thinks the message is :
Love conquers all , and saves the good guys from the harshness of war .
What it actually is : Love is a waste of time .
Join the peace corps .
Rick makes Ilsa leave with Laszlo at the end of the movie .
Period .
Everybody quotes the “ you ’ll regret it , maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life ” speech as if it was the most romantic thing in the world , but Bogie ’s essentially telling Ingrid Bergman to get the fuck out while she still can .
He figured she ’d be better off as a freedom fighter in France than Humphrey ’s bitch in Casablanca .
And yeah , his desire for her to have a better life is kinda sweet , but it ’s hardly romantic .
Romance would have been if he ’d boarded the plane with her , instead of staying behind with the gay French cop and the dead German .
3 . The Godfather
What everyone thinks the message is : The Mob values family above all else .
What it actually is : Violence is a vicious , inescapable cycle .
Hey , society , I ’ve got an idea .
Let ’s ignore all the actual events of the Godfather and only quote certain things out of context !
Like when Brando says that “ A man who does n’t spend time with his family can never be a real man ” !
Ignoring , of course , the fact that Michael Corleone – who is initially the most levelheaded of the Corleone children – has no qualms whatsoever about killing his repentant brother - in - law Carlo or his misunderstanding , borderline - retarded brother Fredo .
The whole point of all of the flashbacks in The Godfather Part II was to show that violence begets more violence : a crime lord kills Vito ’s family , Vito joins the mob so he can go back and kill the crime lord , and his children have to inherit his legacy of violence ( which is why Michael starts out as an upstanding marine and ends up claiming to renounce Satan at his nephew ’s baptism while simultaneously killing the fuck out of the heads of the four other families ) .
Although , he DOES , technically , “ spend time ” with his family members .
Right before he , you know .
Kills them .
2. Gone With The Wind
What everyone thinks the message is : Nothing can stop love , or the will to survive .
What it actually is : Black people is dumb .
The South shall rise again !
People heralded Hattie McDaniel ’s Best Supporting Oscar win as a watershed moment in motion picture history : a moment that marked a more intelligent , more progressive Hollywood .
Too bad they gave her the award for playing a stupid , unrealistically kind slave woman .
Most of the troubles that Scarlett O’Hara faces in Gone With The Wind come from one of three sources : ( 1 ) The Civil War , ( 2 ) Postwar Carpetbaggers / Greedy Union Soldiers , and ( 3 ) Clark Gable ’s dick .
Two of these three problems go more or less unrecognized and unremembered in modern society .
While the film is pretty damn good , and does a fantastic job of developing the two leads ( over the course of the movie , Scarlett goes from “ prissy Southern bitch ” to “ prissy Southern bitch who does n’t take shit from anyone ” ) , nobody seems to remember the scene in which the Evil Union Soldier tries to rape Scarlett , forcing her to shoot him in self - defense .
Or how grateful Mammy is to have such a kind , caring massuh in Miss Scawlett .
Appreciate the on - again - off - again - on - again relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara all you like , just do n’t forget that biggest problems these sympathetic , well - drawn characters have to deal with all come from evil men in blue uniforms who believed blacks should be free .
1. Scarface
What everyone thinks the message is : Tony Montana is awesome !
What it actually is :
No , he is n’t !
If there is any cultural phenomenon more widespread or more infuriating than the wholesale misunderstanding of Scarface by the gangster rap community , I do n’t know what it is .
Either every copy of Scarface in the ghetto has the last half of the movie edited out , or America is dumber than anyone could have ever truly considered .
Wannabe gangstas (z ) look at Tony Montana ’s rise , and they think , “ That ’s me .
He ’s uncompromising , he ’s ambitious , he ’s intelligent , and he ’s got morals .
He is a product of his environment , but he ’s made the most out of it and is a relative hero amongst villains . ”
Then they look at Tony Montana ’s fall , where he abandons his mother , loses Michelle Pfieffer , fucking murders his best friend , involuntarily gets his sister shot , and then gets blown in half by a shotgun , they think , “ Let ’s watch the first half again . ”
Honestly , how ridiculous a world do we live in where an entire generational subgroup admires the aesthetics of a drug - fueled gangster flick , but not its overall message ?
Not to mention , this general attitude led to the creation of the alternate - reality Scarface video game , where Tony survives the shootout .
But let ’s not think about that right now .
In what must be taken as the biggest implicit blow Microsoft ’s Vista has taken , it seems customers are requesting to have XP instead of Vista .
Customer demand is so great for XP over Vista that Dell changed its policy midstream and today announced that is once again offering consumers the chance to take XP instead of Vista .
Dell and Microsoft play it down as an innocuous move , but take note that this was totally consumer driven .
It was n’t just a handful of tech geeks ( they would have gone for Ubuntu anyway ) .
It ’s not often that a massive company like Dell does an about - face on product offerings .
The only explanation for the move to re-issue systems with XP is that there ’s a substantial cultural undercurrent that is not happy with Windows Vista .
To be honest , I ca n’t say that I ’m one of them .
I use Vista and actually like it .
Would n’t go back to XP .
But , I ’ve gotta call things as I see them , and the way I see things right now is that Microsoft has a major problem with public perception of Vista ( probably not helped by the Mac vs PC commercials ! )

Reuters has withdrawn a second photograph and admitted that the image was doctored , following the emergence of new suspicions against images provided by the news organization .
On Sunday , Reuters admitted that one of its photographers , Adnan Hajj , used software to distort an image of smoke billowing from buildings in Beirut in order to create the effect of more smoke and damage .
The latest image to face doubts is a photograph of an Israeli F - 16 fighter jet over the skies of Lebanon , seen in the image firing off " missiles during an air strike on Nabatiyeh , " according to the image 's accompanying text provided by Reuters .
Reuters has recalled all photos by Adnan Hajj
The owner of the My Pet Jawa web log noted that the warplane in the picture is actually firing defensive flares aimed at dealing with anti-aircraft missiles .
Caught Red Handed Reuters admits altering Beirut photo Yaakov Lappin Reuters withdraws photograph of Beirut after Air Force attack after US blogs , photographers point out ' blatant evidence of manipulation . '
Reuters admits altering Beirut photo
In addition , the Jawa blog says the flares have been replicated by Reuters , giving the impression that the jet was firing many " missiles , " thereby distortion the image .
" The F - 16 in the photo is not firing missiles , but is rather dropping chaffe or flares designed to be a decoy for surface to air missiles .
However , a close up ( of ) what Hajj calls " missiles " reveals that only one flare has been dropped .
The other two " flares " are simply copies of the original , " Shackleford wrote .
" But what about the ' bombs ' in the photo ?
Here is a close up of them .
Notice anything ?
That 's right .
The top and bottom " bomb " are the same . "
Another manipulated Reuters image
Following the accusations , Reuters conceded that a second image it provided had been manipulated , and released a statement saying it had recalled all photos by Hajj .
" Reuters has withdrawn from its database all photographs taken by Beirut - based freelance Adnan Hajj after establishing that he had altered two images since the start of the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hizbullah group , " the statement said .
The news outlet said that it discovered " in the last 24 hours that he ( Hajj ) altered two photographs since the beginning of the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese group Hizbullah , " Reuters added .
“ There is no graver breach of Reuters standards for our photographers than the deliberate manipulation of an image " , Reuters ' statement quoted Tom Szlukovenyi , Reuters Global Picture Editor , as saying .
' Tighter editing needed '
Reuters also said it would apply " tighter editing procedure for images of the Middle East conflict to ensure that no photograph from the region would be transmitted to subscribers without review by the most senior editor on the Reuters Global Pictures Desk . "
" Reuters terminated its relationship with Hajj on Sunday ...
An immediate enquiry began into Hajj ’s other work , " the statement said .
Hajj had provided Reuters with several images from the Lebanese village of Qana , many of which have also been suspected of being staged .
Other Reuters images have been called into question by blogs in the United States .
A reader of the Power Line blog , Robert Opalecky , wrote : " I do n't know if this has been brought to anyone 's attention yet , but in a quick search of the authenticated Reuters photographs attributed to Adnan Hajj , I found the following two . "
T he first Reuters image of July 24
" One is from July 24 of a bombed out area in Beirut , with a clearly identifiable building in a prominent part of the shot .
The second is of the exact same area , same buildings , same condition , with a woman walking past " a building flattened during an overnight Israeli air raid on Beirut 's suburbs August 5 , 2006 , " he wrote .
Reuters ' second ' Beirut attack ' photo , dated August 5
A film released on the YouTube video sharing website compares the two images , and appears to show striking similarities between the photograph used by Reuters on both July 24 and August 5 .
We know smoking tobacco is not good for kids , but a lot of other things are n’t good .
Drinking ’s not good .
Some would say milk ’s not good .
Bob Dole
Loren Cordain ’s latest newsletter ( PDF ) is up , and it ’s going to make a lot of people unhappy .
Why ?
Because Dr. Cordain is one of those people Bob Dole was talking about who say that milk is n’t good .
The one sentence summation of the newsletter is that betacellulin , a heat - stable hormone found in large concentrations in cow ’s milk , attaches to and stimulates the intestinal EGF receptor , possible causing an increase in the incidence of cancer formation and accelerated growth .
Money quote from the newsletter :
So what –what if a little betacellulin from cow ’s milk gets into your bloodstream–does it matter ?
You bet it matters .
A liter of whole milk ( 633 kcal ) contains 1,930 nano - grams of betacellulin whereas the amount of EGF that your salivary glands secrete is only 35.3 ng per day .
The binding affinity of betacellulin to the EGF receptor is greater than that for EGF ; consequently betacellulin can displace EGF from the EGF receptor .
The amount of betacellulin that you get from drinking even a single cup of milk ( 457 nanograms ) has the capacity to stimulate the EGF receptor 10 times more than what normally would occur during a 24 hour period from EGF in saliva .
Over the past couple of days I ’ve received a dozen or so emails and comments asking what I thought about this newsletter .
My reaction to it is colored a little by the fact that I do n’t drink much milk .
Unlike my bride , I do n’t drink cream in my coffee , and I do n’t eat a whole lot of cheese .
So , if I found out that milk was a dangerous food , it would n’t change my life much to avoid it entirely .
Others may not have the same perspective .
Over the course of the last year or so that Dr. Cordain has been working on this , he and I have corresponded frequently , and he has sent me a slew of papers on betacellulin , EGF , and the EGF receptor –the data is consistent with the information in his newsletter .
This idea is n’t published by others ; it ’s his theory based on his considerable research on the material .
And Dr. Cordain , his views on saturated fat notwithstanding , is a very smart guy , so it probably would n’t pay totally disregard him .
The idea that milk might not be an ideal has been around for a while .
Anthropologist Marvin Harris wrote a number of years back that
This discovery was made fairly recently ; it was only in the 1950s that it began to dawn on people that milk was not good for everybody .
However , the normal situation was originally regarded as the abnormal one .
The idea also fits with the evolutionary template .
In Paleolithic times and before man did n’t drink milk beyond infancy .
In fact , after infancy humans developed lactose intolerance , the inability to break down milk sugar .
As a consequence , drinking milk would cause GI problems due to this lack of ability to break down and absorb lactose .
Since this lactose intolerance is a fairly common finding among adults the world over ( there are some societies who have through mutation inactivated the genes responsible for lactose intolerance ) , it probably served some useful purpose in terms of our survival .
Since the EGF receptor , which is normally activated by EGF from saliva , promotes gut healing and maintenance , maybe nature did n’t want its effects interfered with after childhood and used the development of lactose intolerance to achieve its ends .
A reader sent me an article from several years ago from the Townsend Letter on the failure of a couple of pharmaceutical companies to get approval to market their EGF receptor - blocking drugs , the most famous of which was ImClone , the maker of the drug Erbitux .
If you recall , ImClone is the company headed by Sam Wachsal , who , when he got advance notice of the FDA denial , sold his stock before the word got out and the price cratered and advised friends , one of whom was Martha Stewart , to do the same .
Dr. Wachsal is now doing time –Martha , as everyone knows , has already done hers .
This article makes the EGF receptor blocking drugs appear not particularly effective , but since that time , the FDA has approved more trials .
As I wrote earlier , I ’m not a milk drinker or a cheese eater , so I do n’t really have a dog in this fight .
I ’ve got enough stuff to work on that really does interest me that I do n’t want to spend more time than I already have tracking all this down .
If someone else wants to do it , send me whatever you dig up , and I ’ll be happy to post it .

How To Play Rummy Online
The objective of Rummy games is to be the first to get rid of all the cards in your hand .
You do this by picking up and discarding cards and forming the cards in your hand into melds .
A Meld just means a set of cards of the same value or a group of consecutive cards with the same suit .
There are two types of melds :
A set consists of 3 or more cards of the same rank
A run consists of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit
A Rummy game is typically played by 2 - 4 players .
Each player is dealt a set number of cards .
The remaining cards are placed face down on the table to become the stock .
The dealer turns over the top card and places it face up on the table to the right of the stock to start the discard pile .
A turn begins by drawing a card from either the stock or discards pile and must end by discarding a card onto the discard pile .
When you have formed a meld you place it down on the table .
When a player gets rid of all of their cards the Rummy game is over .
Each of the Rummy games has their own specific scoring charts .
The winner of a single ring game is the first player to dispose of all his cards .
The winner of a tournament is the first player to accumulate the highest amount of points or the last player to stay in the game without being eliminated by exceeding the elimination target score .
In the last couple of years , Rummy has become very popular online .
Playing Rummy online gives you the chance to play against players from all over the world .

RummyRoyal is also offering FreeRoll Tournaments to both real and fun game players .
Rummy Rules
Traditional Rummy is similar to all of the different variations of Rummy .
The winner is the first player to dispose of all the cards in his hand at once – this move is called Going Rummy .
Another way to win the game is to be the first player to dispose of all the cards in his hand gradually – this is called Going Out .
In this variation of Rummy there are no restrictions regarding when you are allowed to lay down melds or add matching cards to existing melds .
In other words , you can lay down melds or add matching cards to existing ones at any time .
Same rules applies also to Rummy games that can be found at best UK casino sites .
Dealing with online players is even more exciting than playing with friends , as you will not know their best moves .
The objective of Rummy is to get rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents do by arranging as many as possible of the cards in your hand into sets or runs of cards :
Classic Rummy Rules
Each player at the table is dealt 10 cards .
The remaining cards are placed face down on the table , forming the stock and one card is placed face up next to the stock to form the discard pile .
A player must draw a card either from the stock pile or from the discard pile and add it to his hand .
In case a player has formed any melds , he may also lay them down on the table face up .
If the player does not wish to lay down a meld , he discards one card , face up , onto the discard pile .
If the stock runs out , the discard pile is shuffled and placed face down to form a new stock .
The card discarded by the player who drew the last card of the old stock is placed face up beside the new stock to start the new discard pile .
During his turn , a player may add one or more cards from his hand to any meld that is already on the table .
For example , if there are three fives on the table you can add the fourth one .
If there was an eight of hearts , nine of hearts and ten of hearts on the table you can add a Jack of hearts , Jack and Queen of hearts , Seven of hearts or a Six of hearts and Seven of hearts .
There are two ways that you can win in Rummy .
That is by Going Out or by Going Rummy .
Going
Out – the first player to discard his last card wins .
Going Rummy – A player goes “ Rummy ” when he gets rid of all the cards in his hand at once , without previously having put down or laid off any melds or cards .
Point Scoring
If the game ended with the winner going out the sum of all cards remaining in the hands of other players is added to the cumulative score of the winning player .
If the game ended with the winner going rummy the sum of all cards remaining in the hands of other players is added to the cumulative score of the winning player + 25 points .
The game continues with further hands until a previously agreed upon target score is reached .
The winner is the player with the highest score ( or the first to reach the target score ) .
Scientists in the United States are testing a robot which has been designed to carry out remote surgery in space .
Benjamin Bierce interviewed one of the accused , Specialist James Barker who made a written statement in which he recorded graphic and brutal sexual details of the alleged assault on March 12 .
Mr Bierce was testifying on the second day of the hearing to determine whether five soldiers must stand trial for the rape and killing of Abeer Qassim al - Janabi , her parents and five - year - old sister in the town of Mahmudiya .
It is among the worst in a series of cases of alleged misconduct .
Specialist Barker 's signed statement was submitted in evidence .
He is accused , along with Sergeant Paul Cortez , Private Jesse Spielman and Private Bryan Howard of rape and murder .
Another soldier , Sergeant Anthony Yribe , is accused of failing to report the attack but is not alleged to have participated .
Former private , Steven Green , was discharged from the army for a " personality disorder " after the incident and was arrested in North Carolina in June on rape and murder charges .
He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail .
Yesterday , Private Justin Watt testified that Private Howard told him , before the incident , that Private Green , Sergeant Cortez and Specialist Barker had planned to rape a girl , and Private Howard was to be the lookout .
Another investigator , Michael Hood , told the hearing that he interviewed Private Spielman , who denied shooting or having sex with anyone .
He was given a lie - detector test and passed .
According to Specialist Barker 's statement , Private Green not only raped the girl but also shot her and her family after telling his comrades repeatedly he wanted to kill some Iraqis .
Mr Bierce said that on the day of the attack , Specialist Barker , Sergeant Cortez , Private Spielman and Private Green had been playing cards and drinking Iraqi whisky mixed with an energy drink .
They practised hitting golf balls , Specialist Barker 's statement said .
Specialist Barker made it clear Private Green was very persistent about killing some Iraqis .
At some point they decided to go to the house of the girl they had seen passing by their checkpoint .
Specialist Barker also said that when they arrived at the house , the father and the girl were outside .
Private Spielman grabbed the girl while Private Green seized her father and took them into the house .
Private Green took the father , mother and the younger sister into the bedroom , while the girl remained in the living room .
Specialist Barker wrote that Sergeant Cortez pushed the girl to the floor , and tore off her underwear .
Sergeant Cortez appeared to rape her , according to the statement .
Specialist Barker then tried to rape the girl , Mr Bierce said .
Suddenly , the group heard gunshots .
Private Green came out of the bedroom holding an AK - 47 rifle and declared : " They 're all dead .
I just killed them , " the statement said .
Private Green put the gun down , then raped the girl while Sergeant Cortez held her down .
Specialist Barker claims Private Green picked up the AK - 47 and shot the girl once , paused , then shot her several more times .
Specialist Barker said he got a lamp and poured kerosene on the girl .
She was set on fire , but he does not say who did it .
He does not say if Private Howard or Private Spielman took part in the rape .
The statement says he grilled chicken wings back at their checkpoint .
The case has increased demands for changes to an agreement that exempts US soldiers from prosecution in Iraqi courts .
Prime minister Nuri al - Maliki has demanded an independent investigation .

Wrist - Watch Radio – 1947
First introduced in 1947 , this wrist - watch radio used a “ new miniature radio transceiver being developed by the U. S. Bureau of Standards ” , capable of receiving / transmitting short waves while also picking up standard radio broadcasts .
This world ’s smallest microtube was made possible by the elimination of bulky wires , which have been replaced by a silver chloride circuit stenciled on a slice of plastic or ceramic material .
Developed as a result of co-operative research with industry , the miniature tube has various military applications aside from its use in the wrist - watch radio

Instant Camera – 1947
Edwin H. Land , former president of the Polaroid Corporation ( 1947 ) , invented the world ’s first instant camera .
Here ’s how it works :
With his camera , you snap the shutter and turn a knob ; 60 seconds later you have a finished , dry print .
The Land camera takes its pictures in the conventional way , but inside it , in addition to the film roll , there is a roll of positive paper with a pod of developing chemicals at the top of each frame .
Turning the knob forces the exposed negative and the paper together through rollers , breaking the pod and spreading the reagents evenly between the two layers as they emerge from the rear of the camera .
Clipped off , they can be peeled apart a minute later

Washington -- Henry Waxman 's critics say he is a " Bush - bashing " attack dog obsessed with a partisan vendetta .
His admirers say he is a dogged investigator making up for years of neglect during the six years a Republican - controlled Congress exercised little oversight of a Republican - controlled executive branch .
Whatever his motivations , the 17 - term Democratic congressman from Los Angeles has been making life distinctly uncomfortable for the Bush White House .
Since he became chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in January , Waxman , 67 , has been probing some of the more contentious issues surrounding the administration , including prewar intelligence on Iraq , corruption in postwar reconstruction , White House contacts with convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff , allegations that administration officials used political party e-mail accounts to conduct government business , and the misinformation surrounding the friendly fire death in Afghanistan of former NFL star Pat Tillman .
Last week , Waxman chaired a hearing into the government 's often - criticized response to the mental health problems of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan , which he called " an enormous public health threat . "
To Rep. Patrick McHenry , a North Carolina Republican on the committee , Waxman 's " investigative direction and agenda are simply objectionable . "
" Oversight committee hearings are reduced to Bush - bashing press conferences , " McHenry said through a spokesman .
Ask Waxman about his agenda , and the bald , 5 - foot - 5 Democrat , who has represented the affluent west side of Los Angeles for 32 years , offers a nonpartisan explanation .
" I believe in government , and I want the government to be effective .
I want us to look and make sure that government agencies are doing a good job for the American people , " he said in an interview .
Longtime friends and associates , in his hometown and on Capitol Hill , say policy drives Waxman more than politics .
" He 's much more focused on substance and performance than he is on politics per se , " said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md .
Lining the walls of Waxman 's office on Capitol Hill are the trophies of what he considers his most important achievements : framed facsimiles of milestone bills he has authored that he says have made the United States safer and healthier .
There is a copy of the Clean Air Act of 1990 , which helped combat smog , acid rain , toxic air emissions and ozone depletions ; and of the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act , which regulates pesticides in food .
There is a photograph of Waxman smiling after a 1994 public hearing in which the nation 's cigarette executives swore under oath that they did not believe smoking was addictive .
The hearing created momentum for nationwide litigation against the tobacco industry .
" The thing that brings me the most satisfaction is to pass legislation that I know is going to make an important difference in people 's lives , " Waxman said .
Waxman , who was born in Los Angeles and grew up in an apartment above a Watts grocery run by his father , a Jewish immigrant from Russia , got his bachelor 's and law degrees at UCLA .
After serving in the California Assembly for five years , Waxman won his seat in Congress in 1974 and has held it ever since , usually winning with more than 60 percent of the vote .
For 16 years , when the Democrats controlled Congress , Waxman chaired the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's subcommittee on health and environment , pushing through groundbreaking legislation on Medicaid and Medicare coverage , AIDS , and availability of prescription drugs .
As the ranking minority member on the Government Reform Committee from 1997 until last year , Waxman continued to press on health - related issues , notably including the use of steroids in sports .
But he also broadened his interests , starting investigations into waste , fraud and abuse in government contracting -- a prelude , his staffers say , to his current probes .
" Abuse of funding in Iraq reconstruction , tampering with science and the issue of climate change , the tragedy of Pat Tillman 's family -- these are ... major insults to the public trust he is investigating , " said East Bay Rep.
George Miller , D - Martinez , whose Capitol Hill office is next door to Waxman's .
Waxman 's opponents see it differently .
" The administration , for a variety of reasons , is wounded , and Chairman Waxman is going in for the kill , " David Marin , Republican staff director for the Oversight Committee , wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle .
FrontPage Magazine , an online conservative political magazine , recently described Waxman as " spewing out subpoenas all over the place in what is the beginning of an obvious drive toward impeaching the president . "
Waxman countered that when Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va. , was chairman , he had the word " Oversight " removed from the committee 's title altogether .
One of Waxman 's first actions as the new chairman was to restore it .
As for his alleged abuse of subpoena power , Waxman said he has issued only three subpoenas , reluctantly -- one of which is to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , on the administration 's prewar claims that Iraq was building nuclear weapons .
He pointed to Rep. Dan Burton , R - Ill. , chairman of the committee under President Bill Clinton .
" He issued 1,052 subpoenas ! " Waxman said with an incredulous chuckle .
" And then , when the Republicans came to power , there was n't a scandal too big for them to ignore .
...
That was inappropriate and partisan oversight . "
Burton 's office did not respond to requests for an interview .
For all the limelight of his investigations , Waxman is not a Capitol Hill celebrity , nor does he appear to seek to be one -- even as he represents one of the most glamorous , celebrity - driven districts in the country , which includes Beverly Hills and Bel - Air .
Derek Shearer , a foreign policy adviser to President Clinton and now a professor at Occidental College , said the last time he ran into Waxman , the congressman was walking hand in hand with his wife , Janet , into a Los Angeles Starbucks .
" He 's probably the least self - promoting member of Congress , " Shearer said .
Waxman , a grandfather of four and an observant Jew , is " plenty tough " on the job , but " personally , he is almost a puppy dog , a great guy with great family life , very nice kids , very religious , " said Norman Ornstein , an expert on government and Congress at the conservative - leaning American Enterprise Institute and a friend of Waxman's .
Which is not to say that Waxman is entirely modest .
Along with copies of laws he had authored , his office is decorated with numerous pictures of him shaking hands with Presidents Clinton and Reagan , and with the late Pope John Paul II .
" He does n't insert himself onto the front pages of the local papers , but when he needs to use his influence he does , " said Jack Weiss , Waxman 's friend and a member of the Los Angeles City Council whose district lies within Waxman 's territory .
For instance , Waxman recently helped kill the plan by the FBI to build a new headquarters for its local office on the west side of Los Angeles -- a project that , many feared , would snarl the already terrible traffic in the area , Weiss said .
Waxman has never run for another office , and his decadeslong career in the House has allowed him to pursue issues he cares about .
" He spent 10 years fighting to get the Clean Air Act passed , " said Phil Schiliro , who has worked as Waxman 's chief of staff for 25 years .
" That 's difficult for a lot of people in politics because they are inevitably running for another office .
He does n't want that . "
What does he want ?
What , ultimately , drives him ?
In his characteristically dispassionate , low - key manner , Waxman answers :
" I just want to make sure that the government 's working . "

Issues on Waxman 's docket
IRAQ
INTELLIGENCE --
Waxman 's committee is seeking information on prewar intelligence used to justify the war in Iraq , including the Bush administration 's claim that Iraq was attempting to purchase uranium from Niger to be used in nuclear weapons .
Waxman has issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the matter .
Waxman : " It was important to me because it was for that reason that I voted for the authorization for President Bush to go to war if necessary , if the U.N. process did n't allow the disarming of Saddam Hussein .
So I think it 's important to get this information and to have people held accountable . "
WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL --
The committee is investigating whether White House officials used the Republican National Committee e-mail accounts to conduct government business .
Waxman has subpoenaed RNC documents and its chairman , Robert Duncan , to be questioned about whether the party 's e-mail system was used by Bush officials to conceal some of their government actions .
Waxman :
" The law in this country tries to protect civil servants from having their bosses call them in and talk to them about doing something in campaigns where they really are not in a position to say ' no ' for fear that they might not be treated as well at work .
And so this is not supposed to be permitted in government facilities . "
IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION --
The committee is seeking information on alleged corruption and waste involved in government contracts for reconstruction and development work in Iraq .
Waxman : " The first and most important one is that our committee ... should be the watchdog for the taxpayers ' dollars .
We want to make sure that taxpayers ' dollars are not involved in waste , fraud or abuse .
...
In Iraq reconstruction contracts ... there 've been billions still unaccounted for . "
DEATH OF PAT TILLMAN -- Last month , Waxman 's committee held hearings seeking to find out " why the Tillman family and the American public were misled about the cause of death of Army Cpl. Patrick Tillman . "
Waxman : " We owe a lot to our servicemen and women .
...
But one thing we owe them more than anything else is the truth , and I 'm determined that we uphold that standard . "
JACK ABRAMOFF SCANDAL --
The investigation into the relationship between the convicted lobbyist and the White House began in 2006 , after Abramoff pleaded guilty to mail fraud , tax evasion and four counts of conspiracy .
It was launched by then - committee Chairman Tom Davis , R - Va. , and then - ranking member Waxman .
On Tuesday , Waxman disclosed that Susan Ralston , a former top aide to Karl Rove , was refusing to testify on the matter unless granted immunity .
Waxman : " We still do n't know the full story on the Abramoff scandal .
We know it threatened the integrity of government decisions but it is still not clear how far the corruption extended .
That is why we are continuing our investigation . "

Groups believe impeachment is ' more on the table than people think ' Miriam Raftery
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has famously stated that impeachment proceedings against President Bush or Vice President Cheney are " off the table , " many activists feel that the tide is beginning to turn .
For a previous report on this past weekend 's California Democratic Convention in San Diego , RAW STORY obtained responses about impeachment directly from Senator Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) and 2008 candidates New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and former Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel .
A blogger present at the convention also helped pose the question to Senators Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and former North Carolina Senator John Edwards ( full article at this link ) .
While Gravel indicated that impeachment " will come , in due course , " Dodd told RAW STORY that having " been down that road " before with former President Clinton , he believes that " [ i] t sucks all of the oxygen out of the air . 
However , on Sunday , April 29 , California delegates and state party members sent a powerful message to Pelosi and Congressional Democrats .
 In a resolution affirmed by the full state party convention Sunday , the Democrats called on the U.S. Congress to use its subpoena power to investigate misdeeds of President Bush and Vice President Cheney  and to hold the Administration accountable ' with appropriate remedies and punishment , including impeachment , ' " a letter to Progressive Democrats of America ( PDA ) members obtained by RAW STORY states .
The letter continues , " The delegate insurgency was coordinated by Progressive Democrats of America and its allies .
While Speaker Pelosi had declared impeachment ' off the table , ' the Democratic Party rank - and - file has demonstrated its commitment to putting the issue ' on ' the table .
And it 's no longer just the rank - and - file : Even among the members of the convention 's Resolutions Committee ( appointed by the California Party chair ) , the impeachment resolution was the top vote - getter ( tied with one other resolution ) . 
( Read the full resolution text here ) Protesters inside and outside the convention also sent a message to Presidential aspirants and Speaker Pelosi .
An estimated 200 impeachment supporters lined both sides of the street outside the convention center on Saturday in anticipation of Pelosis arrival .
Demonstrators were barred from entering the building , but PDA members inside posted prominent impeachment banners and wore bright orange shirts urging impeachment .
Protesters also staged an  Impeach on the Beach activity at nearby Torrey Pines , but cloud cover prevented an airplane from flying over to photograph the message spelled out with 250 human bodies .
 One third of those were Move On members ,  said Will McRae , MoveOn coordinator for San Diego County .
 For MoveOn to pretend impeachment isnt on the table is the same as Pelosi .
They need to put it on their website [ for a vote ] .
We owe it to our members .
DFA head : " More on the table than people think " Jim Dean , head of Democracy for America and brother of Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean , said he understands the reluctance of Pelosi to lead Congress into impeachment proceedings during her first 100 days in office .
 We took control of Congress because people are fed up and want us to get things done ,  he observed , adding that impeachment proceedings would bog down Congress .
But he noted ,  Just letting these guys off is setting a bad precedent . 
Asked about the prospect of impeachment , he observed ,  I think its more on the table than people think . 
PDA president Tim Carpenter called passage of the impeachment resolution by California delegates  the culmination of one month of effort by PDA to put the issue of investigating , accountability and impeachment on the table .
 Im a California native and an elected central committee member ,  added Carpenter , who made a lot of cell phone calls to win support for the measure .
On Saturday , Carpenter revealed , he met with Pelosi .
 I think the fact that she met with us shows she is a listener ,  he said , but he added ,  We agreed to disagree . 
Impeachment is a constitutional imperative , he believes .
 If we dont begin to talk about impeachment , the next president will be allowed to torture , do wiretapping , lying , and engage in manipulation of everything in signing statements ,  the PDA leader predicted .
At a dinner honoring Pelosi Saturday evening , pro-impeachment activists slipped elegant placecards onto each place at the table .
The cards read : Remember , Were the Deciders .
Impeachment is on the table .
Investigate and Impeach Cheney and Bush !
Secret Service agents blocked Jeeni Criscenzo , the endorsed Democratic Congressional candidate who ran against Darrell Issa , from unfurling a banner at the dinner which read : Impeach Bush - Cheney Now No Attack on Iran !
 Where is our freedom ?  asked Criscenzo .
 Thousands of people have signed this banner and they wont let us present it to the Speaker quietly and respectfully . 
Criscenzo added that she might just go to Washington for Mothers Day to try and present the banner to Pelosi .

WASHINGTON -- Two of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , hijackers had a support network in the United States that included agents of the Saudi government , and the Bush administration and FBI blocked a congressional investigation into that relationship , Senator Bob Graham wrote in a book to be released Tuesday .
The discovery of the financial backing of the two hijackers " would draw a direct line between the terrorists and the government of Saudi Arabia , and trigger an attempted coverup by the Bush administration , " the Florida Democrat wrote .
And in Graham 's book , " Intelligence Matters , " obtained by The Miami Herald yesterday , he makes clear that some details of that financial support from Saudi Arabia were in the 27 pages of the congressional inquiry 's final report that were blocked from release by the administration , despite the pleas of leaders of both parties on the House and Senate intelligence committees .
Graham also disclosed that General Tommy Franks told him on Feb. 19 , 2002 , four months after the invasion of Afghanistan , that many important resources -- including the Predator drone aircraft crucial to the search for Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda leaders -- were being shifted to prepare for a war against Iraq .
Graham , who was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from June 2001 through the buildup to the Iraq war , voted against the war resolution in October 2002 because he saw Iraq as a diversion that would hinder the fight against Al Qaeda terrorism .
He oversaw the Sept. 11 investigation on Capitol Hill with Representative Porter Goss .
According to Graham , the FBI and the White House blocked efforts to investigate the extent of official Saudi connections to two hijackers .
Graham wrote that the staff of the congressional inquiry concluded that two Saudis in the San Diego area , Omar al - Bayoumi and Osama Bassan , who gave significant financial support to two hijackers , were working for the Saudi government .
Bayoumi received a monthly allowance from a contractor for Saudi Civil Aviation that jumped from $ 465 to $ 3,700 in March 2000 , after he helped Nawaf al - Hazmi and Khalid al - Mihdhdar -- two of the Sept. 11 hijackers -- find apartments and make contacts in San Diego , before they began pilot training .
Saudi officials have denied ties to the hijackers or Al Qaeda plots to attack the United States .

It ’s supermodels against the actress !
Schiffer stepped out in her Chanel minidress in London in February , while Lohan ruled the red carpet in her chain - laden dress in L.A. this week .
But Christensen debuted it first – at a charity event in Ireland in January .
… ask Harper et al. in their study of the effects of calorie restriction ( CR ) on mice caught in the field ( as opposed to standard strains commonly used in laboratory research ) .
The study ( from the lab of veteran mouse wrangler Steven Austad ) comes to a startling ( and , to CR aficionados and practitioners , disturbing ) conclusion : No .
To investigate whether mice genetically unaltered by many generations of laboratory selection exhibit similar hormonal and demographic responses to caloric restriction ( CR ) as laboratory rodents , we performed CR on cohorts of genetically heterogeneous male mice which were grandoffspring of wild - caught ancestors .
Although hormonal changes , specifically an increase in corticosterone and decrease in testosterone , mimicked those seen in laboratory - adapted rodents , we found no difference in mean longevity between ad libitum ( AL ) and CR dietary groups , although a maximum likelihood fitted Gompertz mortality model indicated a significantly shallower slope and higher intercept for the CR group .
This result was due to higher mortality in CR animals early in life , but lower mortality late in life .
A subset of animals may have exhibited the standard demographic response to CR in that the longest - lived 8.1 % of our animals were all from the CR group .
Despite the lack of a robust mean longevity difference between groups , we did note a strong anticancer effect of CR as seen in laboratory rodents .
Three plausible interpretations of our results are the following : ( 1 ) animals not selected under laboratory conditions do not show the typical CR effect ; ( 2 ) because wild - derived animals eat less when fed AL , our restriction regime was too severe to see the CR effect ; or ( 3 ) there is genetic variation for the CR effect in wild populations ; variants that respond to CR with extended life are inadvertently selected for under conditions of laboratory domestication .
Why might laboratory selection select for animals that show a CR effect ?
First of all :
The best lab mouse is a fertile and fecund mouse , one that reproduces early and often .
These animals might have an ad libitum ( AL ) intake far in excess of their wild cousins , consistent with the observation that lab mice eat more than wild ones when confronted with an all - you - can - eat kibble buffet .
The beneficial effects of CR are generally a biphasic function of total caloric intake : there ’s a sweet spot of maximum benefit at , say , 60 % AL , but below that the mice are generally less healthy than the AL cohort , because they ’re frankly starving .
One upshot of the selection of lab mice for efficient conversion of kibble into more mice ( and their concomitant bigger appetites ) is that wild mice on AL diets might be closer to the CR “ peak ” than lab mice — so that reducing their intake to 60 % actually puts them below the peak , into the starvation part of the dose - response curve .
If this is the case , then wild mice might well benefit from CR , just at a higher percentage of AL calories .
But it might also be , as the authors point out , that lab mice have been inadvertently selected for some trait that enhances the benefits of CR .
Wild populations may be a mix of some mice that benefit from CR and some that do n’t ( e.g. , the early - mortality subjects in this study ) .
This is the possibility that ’s of particular concern for humans .
Via the emerging field of pharmacogenomics , we ’re becoming increasingly aware of the impact that genetic variation can play on the efficacy of therapeutics :
Sometimes a drug will benefit only 20 % of the trial population , but it later turns out that 100 % of those 20 % had the same haplotype at a particular locus , making the drug great for them and lousy for everyone else .
This phenomenon is n’t limited to drugs ; it extends ( e.g. ) to the benefits people reap from exercise and the risk of getting cancer after a lifetime of smoking .
What if calorie restriction is the same ?
I would argue that we ’re more like wild mice than lab mice , and that there are going to be existing variants in the human population that benefit differently from CR ( just like any other course of treatment ) .
What do we do if it turns out that CR confers both early mortality ( on one subset of the population ) and delayed aging ( in another , or in everyone who survives the increased early - mortality risk ) ?
We ’ve based a lot of our optimism about CR in humans on data from rodents , and while the human and primate data is promising so far , it ’s also limited in statistical power and temporal depth .
Simple intellectual honesty mandates that these results give us pause , and encourage rational reflection about all the possibilities that might result from being our own guinea pigs .
If there 's one thing even cave - dwelling , 15 - year - fixed - rate - paying troglodytes must acknowledge , it's that the the national crisis in sub - prime lending has doomed the real estate market , perhaps the entire American economy .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd ( D - CT ) is already calling for a multi-billion - dollar bailout .
Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has diagnosed a financial pandemic that can only be reversed by giving the erstwhile head of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform all the powers of the White House .
Strangely though , this horrific news has somehow escaped the notice of homebuyers here at the epicenter of the sub - prime slaughter of innocents , where actual closing prices continue to climb .
What explains this disconnect ?
The sub - prime meltdown takes place in a context of debt panic — specifically , a context of other - people 's - debt panic .
The economic left , values conservatives and bien pensant moderates are in full agreement on this one :
Poor people 's access to debt is driving them to fiscal ruination or worse .
The new documentary Maxed
Out makes the case for massive increases in federal oversight that will prevent suicidal college students from getting credit cards .
Generation Debt glamourpuss Anya Kamenetz , whose hard - luck bio includes the Dickensian detail that she " graduated from Yale seven months after the 9/11 attacks , " has built a stellar career on the premise that having to pay your student loans is no different than serfdom .
Ambitious politicians and math - unencumbered reporters are in hot pursuit of the culprits : predatory lenders , indifferent regulators , Madison Avenue captains of consciousness — everybody except people who borrow large sums of money with no intention of paying it back .
It 's interesting that the conventional wisdom once said the precise opposite — that the deserving poor did n't have enough access to debt .
As an audio - visual aid , you can do no better than the great " collateral " speech from The Best Years of Our Lives , viewable in three parts in Quicktime here , here , and here .
Fredric March , playing a rising bank middle manager who has just returned to his job after serving as an Army NCO in the Pacific , reads a rambling riot act to a banquet of porcine small - town bankers who have criticized him for providing loans to bad - credit - risk veterans .
He argues through parable :
If we'd fought like bankers , seeking collateral for every risk and a guarantee on every expenditure , we'd have lost the war .
In this context , it 's a straightforward redistribution - of - wealth argument , in which the prerogatives of the common good are asserted in the baldest terms :
If the state can claim its citizens ' lives ( or in the case of the film 's disabled co-star Harold Russell , their hands ) , who are you to try and hang onto your property ?
The joke of history is that all that easy money March was calling for created one of the greatest booms in the country 's history — the suburbanization of America , which is now derided by the bien pensant classes who claim there 's too much ready credit out there .
The difference now is that it 's coming from the free market rather than a package of government guarantees , from an industry that expanded to fill a demand and is now contracting as the demand has been filled .
In a sane world , we 'd say this is a free market behaving as it should , and marvel at an economy where so many people who were once locked into the renters market have gotten a chance at homeownership .
Some of them have blown their chance — by exhibiting the same kind of behavior that made them bad credit risks in the first place .
But most have not .
In fact nine out of every ten Americans carrying sub - prime loans are still making their payments .
So our grandparents solved the not - enough - credit crisis , and Clinton and Dodd are well on the way to solving the too - much - credit crisis .
What will they think of next ?
Will it be a " savings crisis " like the one that supposedly haunts the Japanese economy ?
Only one thing is certain :
Whenever the next big one comes , there will be plenty of deadbeats , politicians , and people who can't do math around to cry that the sky is falling , even if home prices are not .

I was able to find video of a young Iranian girl being arrested by the Islamic Republic 's police .
In the shocking and sad video , you 'll hear the screams of the young girl , whose only " fault " was not covering herself like the black cows .

Here 's a translation of what the girl shouts and what the police say to her :
Girl ( screaming ) : I am not coming .
Let me go .
You man !
Dont touch me !
Let me go !
I dont want to go !
I dont want to go !
Police ( to people ) : Do not gather !
Go !
Where are the Western feminists who always complain against alleged ' discrimination ' in the very same societies that grant them full rights ?
Where are they when you need them ?
Ms. Nancy Pelosi , anything to say ?
Are you still planning to go shake hands with the Mullahs ' while women are being humiliated ?
Why dont the Western women take action to help their sisters in Iran ?
But it 's not only the women who are being arrested , fined and " rebuked " , though they are the main victims .
It 's the guys , too .
Why ?
Because they dare to defy the regime by dressing like their Western counterparts , with long hair and fashion hair style , other than listening to music or wearing shorts .
Microsoft and Brussels are locked in a war of words
Brussels criticised the software giant for not changing its behaviour since it was fined 497 m euros ( £ 331 m ) in 2004 .
In an escalation of its long - running battle with the US firm , Brussels said Microsoft had been seeking unreasonable prices from competitors for key data .
In response , Microsoft said the threat of further fines was unreasonable .
Attitude
" In the 50 years of European antitrust policy , it 's the first time we 've been confronted with a company that has failed to comply with an antitrust decision , " a Commission spokesman said .
Microsoft is a company not used to losing
Neelie Kroes , EU Competition Commissioner
The EU has sought to force Microsoft to disclose information that will allow other companies to make sure their software works properly with Microsoft 's operating systems .
The latest move comes after the Commission not only fined the firm , but also ordered it to make a version of Windows available without Media Player software .
After its latest rebuke , Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said she was " not used to dealing with companies who drag their feet as Microsoft is doing " .
" Microsoft is a company not used to losing . "
But the firm said : " It is hard to see how the Commission can argue that even patented innovation must be made available for free . "
Last year , Microsoft was told to pay daily fines adding up to 280.5 million euros over a six - month period , after it failed to adhere to the 2004 ruling .
Stephen Harper has promised to lower taxes
Mr Harper 's Conservatives won Canada 's general election , but will have to seek allies in parliament after failing to win an overall majority .
Mr Harper aims to cut taxes , tackle corruption and clamp down on crime .
But correspondents say the failure to score a major victory may temper the authority of Mr Harper 's government .
Outgoing prime minister and Liberal party leader Paul Martin announced his decision to step down as party leader after conceding the election to Mr Harper in a late - night phone call .
On the campaign trail Mr Harper repeatedly attacked the Liberals over a string of corruption scandals .
The election was called following revelations that Liberal politicians in Quebec had taken kickbacks in return for awarding government contracts .
Wide ambition
At a victory rally in his western heartland of Calgary , Mr Harper again stressed his hope for a sea change in national politics .
He pledged an immediate 1 % cut in national sales tax , a new vigour in fighting crime and gang violence , and a re-evaluation of relations with Washington , which have become strained in recent years .
Extra funds would be released for child care and into the healthcare system , Mr Harper said .
There would also be a renewed drive for federalism for Francophone Quebec .
" We will do this because shuffling the deck in Ottawa is not good enough , " Mr Harper said .
Political balance
Overall the Conservatives won 124 seats , the Liberals 103 , the Bloc Quebecois 51 and the New Democratic Party 29 , official results showed after counts at Canada 's 66,000 polling stations .
CONSERVATIVE PLEDGES
Cut in national sales tax Reform of justice system New accountability rules to root out corruption New funds for childcare and healthcare " New voice " for Quebec federalism Closer ties with Washington
Send us your comments
The Conservatives made significant gains in Ontario , Canada 's most populous province , and in Quebec .
Mr Harper 's party had 36 % of the vote and the Liberals 30 % .
Despite enjoying a comfortable lead in opinion polls throughout the campaign , the party fell well short of the 155 seats needed for an outright majority in the 308 - seat parliament .
However , history suggests that minority governments in Canada struggle to push legislation through parliament , with few minority administrations lasting longer than 18 months .
There was lukewarm support for the Conservatives from the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , which won 29 crucial seats in parliament , a gain of 11 from the previous election in 2004 .
NDP leader Jack Layton said his party would act to " balance " Mr Harper 's party .
Paul Martin lost a confidence vote late last year
" We differ on many things , but we all share the belief of the potential and the promise of Canada and the desire of our country to succeed , " he said .
Among the incoming MPs was Harvard professor and author Michael Ignatieff , who has been tipped as a possible future Liberal leader .
He won his seat in a Toronto suburb .
Astronomers released this beautiful photograph of the grand spiral design galaxy , M81 , captured by the Hubble Space Telescope .
Although it looks like a single image , it was actually constructed by stitching together many images on computer , using three different wavelengths of light .
M81 is located about 11.6 million light - years in the constellation of Ursa Major .
We ’re fortunate that it ’s turned at an oblique angle towards the Earth , so we can see a full view of the spiral structure .
Hubble ’s view of M81 is so crisp and clear that individual stars can be resolved , as well as open clusters and globular star clusters .
The older , redder stars are contained around the galaxy ’s central bulge , and it has regions of star formation along its spiral arms .
Astronomers suspect that its recent nearby encounter with another galaxy ( M82 ) unleashed the period of star formation about 300 million years ago .
The image was released as part of the Americal Astronomical Society Meeting in Honolulu , which is currently going on in Hawaii .

NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) �
For the first time , compensation for private college presidents has broken through the million - dollar barrier .
In 2004 , five presidents earned more than $ 1 million .
And in all , 50 earned over $ 500,000 .
That 's just one of the findings from a special report on college and university presidents ' compensation published Monday in The Chronicle of Higher Education .
The highest paid private college president is Donald E. Ross of Lynn University , a small liberal arts school in Boca Raton , Fla .
His compensation package topped $ 5 million last year , the bulk of it because he was awarded $ 4.5 million in deferred compensation to be paid out after he retires in June 2006 .
Christine Lynn , chair of the University 's board , told the Chronicle that the sizeable pay package was because Ross , who has been with the school for 34 years and at one point pulled it out of bankruptcy , had n't taken a salary in his early years during which time the school also did n't have money to put toward his retirement .
Other million - dollar pay packages went to Audrey K. Doberstein of Wilmington College ( $ 1.37 million ) ; E. Gordon Gee of Vanderbilt University ( $ 1.33 million ) ; John R. Silber of Boston University ( $ 1.25 million ) ; and John M. McCardell Jr. of Middlebury College ( $ 1.21 million ) .
The Chronicle also looked at the pay packages this year of the 139 public university presidents .
It found : � 23 will have total compensation packages topping $ 500,000 this year , up 35 percent from a year ago .
�
Another 30 will get between $ 400,000 and $ 499,999 in compensation . �
And the median compensation for the post is $ 360,000 .
The best compensated public university leaders are : Mary Sue Coleman of the University of Michigan system ( $ 724,604 ) ; David P. Roselle of the University of Delaware ( $ 720,522 ) ; Mark G. Yudof of the University of Texas system ( $ 693,677 ) , Carl V. Patton of the Georgia State University ( $ 688,406 ) ; and John T. Casteen III of the University of Virginia ( $ 659,670 ) .
The compensation for public university presidents does n't necessarily all come from state coffers ( i.e. , taxpayer dollars ) .
Part of it , including benefits , bonuses and perquisites , may come from private foundations .
The Chronicle found that 43 percent of public college and university presidents will receive part of the compensation from a private entity .
The list of top - earning presidents at public universities also can be somewhat volatile .
" The compensation packages of some presidents are subject to periodic spikes because of the different ways of paying performance and retention bonuses and deferred compensation , including retirement plans that vest only after certain requirements are fulfilled , " writes Chronicle reporter Paul Fain in one article .
One example , Fain notes , is the compensation package of Georgia State University president Carl V. Patton , who ranks No. 4 on the list .
The reason his compensation is so high this year is that he will receive part of his $ 900,000 in deferred comp for serving 12 years in his post .
Why is the pay so high ?
There are those who argue , much as they do in the corporate world , that the compensation for college and university leaders needs to attract highly qualified candidates and needs to reflect the increasing demands of the job .
Indeed , some say , running a school these days is very much like running a for - profit company .
The University of Michigan system run by Coleman , for instance , has a $ 4.6 billion budget , 39,000 students on its main campus and 450,000 living alumni , according to the Chronicle .
Others reject the corporate - world analogy , preferring a political one instead , Fain writes , noting that some question whether college leaders should be paid more than the president of the United States .
President Bush is paid $ 400,000 .
Chronicle reporter Audrey Williams
June notes that the entry of college presidents into the million - dollar club is bound to garner a lot of attention " as the federal government starts seeking the logic behind high pay for leaders of nonprofit organizations , faculty members call for salary caps and board members move to defend the amount they pay college executives .
