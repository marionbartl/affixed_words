That ’s right , this is the post I ’ve been waiting to write since before I started FiscalGeek .
We just sent off our final payoff to Wachovia Dealer Services on our VW Sportwagen .
In just over 11 months we have managed to pay off $ 63,535.65 of credit cards , credit lines and two vehicle loans .
Yes we still owe on the house but do n’t rain on my parade .
Since this is such a special day I ’ve asked FiscalWife to help document our story sharing her insights on our journey to financial freedom because I certainly could n’t be writing this post without her incredible help and support through this process .
What Made you Decide to Get Debt Free ?
Paul : Honestly this was all Angela ( FiscalWife ) to start .
We were sitting in church and they were doing ads for Dave Ramsey ’s Financial Peace University .
Later that day she mentioned that we should go because she was concerned about our finances .
I halfheartedly agreed and we signed up .
Up until this point in our marriage our finances were a relatively taboo subject .
We just kind of avoided the issue because we felt relatively helpless and directionless .
Plus I bought a lot of stuff but that ’s neither here nor there .
After that first session I was beyond gung ho .
As my wife would tell you , when I ’m focused on something my vision narrows and I throw myself at it with full force .
Ang : I had been concerned with the state of our finances for a couple of years before we started on the plan .
I knew we were making way too much money to be going in and out of debt .
Also , Paul and I had very different spending habits – he loves cars , gadgets , outdoor equipment and other toys .
I enjoy outdoor equipment too , but I ’m not much of a spender and agonize over purchases .
Paul would literally come home with spreadsheets to show me why we “ needed ” this motorcycle or that recreational item …
I was no match for him .
If it was something I thought would be fun , I ’d give in quickly .
If it was something I was n’t sure about … it was only a matter of time .
My problem was that I was disorganized and over - committed with my time .
We were spending a ton of money on eating out because I hated planning our meals .
Basically , I knew that we were being wasteful of the money that God had so graciously providing for us through Paul ’s employment .
We were spending too much on things we did n’t need .
I have had the wonderful opportunity to give some of my time to short - term , over - seas missions .
I want to continue to serve over seas as God calls me .
I also want to be able to give substantially to different ministries all around the world .
I knew we were n’t going to be able to do that well if we continued to go into debt .
How Did We Get Started ?
Ang : I had voiced my concerns a couple of times , but we did n’t really make any changes .
We would just wait to pay off our debt when we would get a bonus .
That would relieve my concerns a little , but then I would be frustrated again , because if we had stayed out of debt we could have had a nice little savings account .
I did n’t really know how to bring this up in a way that did n’t make me come off as the nagging and disapproving wife , so I began to pray for Paul and myself .
I prayed that God would help us to get our acts together and that if possible , He would send a mentor along for us .
Especially for Paul , I really wanted to find someone whose opinions Paul could respect .
Well , when we started Financial Peace University last January , I had nooo idea the impact Dave Ramsey would have on our family .
Paul immediately read the materials and it ’s like a switch was flipped in his heart .
I ’m sure Paul will tell you more , but from my perspective , I saw Paul mature in his role as a husband , father and provider .
He has always been such a faithful , devoted and generous guy – but it ’s like the “ baby steps ” were the just the right amount of tinder to set his passion aflame !
Paul :
We started by raising a baby emergency fund of $ 1000 .
Some may argue that you want a larger cushion for emergencies but this is what Dave Ramsey recommends and I have to admit I ’m a rule follower .
What I would do though is once we got a budget going I ’d save our large debt payment until the end of the month so we ’d have our $ 1000 plus our debt payment as an extra buffer in case anything came up .
Fortunately we did n’t have any super huge hangups other than my brakes in the truck .
We used the debt snowball method to order our debts from smallest to largest but with one modification .
I had a much hated Citibank credit card that was in the middle of the snowball but since we had a tax return coming knocked that out first .
That really kicked things off ( that one had adjusted to a 29 % APR that they offered to reduce once I paid it off , classy ) .
We then just systematically moved through our debts from smallest to largest rolling our big old snowball .
Every time we paid off a debt we were able to throw those payments on to the next one .
It really does work , there is a great satisfaction in tackling one after the other .
Be sure to take the small wins and celebrate on your way out .
The Breakdown of our Debt
1st Credit Union Visa : $ 992.04
Wells Fargo Overdraft Credit Line : $ 1234.48
Citibank Mastercard : $ 6693.58
Credit Union Truck Loan : $ 10,139.17
2nd Credit Union Visa : $ 11,505.17
Wachovia Car Loan : $ 32,971.21
Where Did You Get $ 63,000 in 11 Months ?
Paul : Short answer all over the place .
I have to admit I make a good wage at my day job .
I ’ve been in the tech industry going on 15 years as a network engineer .
So we have a relatively large shovel with which to dig ourselves out .
Although all of these payments and a large mortgage do n’t help much .
We worked really hard to get a good zero based budget going which was the very key for our success in my opinion .
Angela worked a part time job which all went towards debt .
I sold pretty much everything that we had laying around either on eBay or Craigslist .
Most of it was my stuff .
I admit it , I like to buy things especially gadgets .
Fortunately newer gadgets have a decent resale value .
My employer offers stock awards based on yearly performance so I was able to take the stock that vested and throw it at our snowball .
I also received a yearly review bonus that also helped .
This blog actually helped a bit , as the months have gone on I ’ve been getting more and more traffic and revenue from the ads on this site ( I hope you do n’t find them too intrusive ) .
Finally just this week I sold my motorcycle which is allowing us to hit our goal .
Ang : From my perspective , the best explanation is that we really did “ give every dollar a name ” !
I actually love our monthly budget meetings .
I knew that it was a time where I could lay out our needs ( for my domain – house , kids , pets , etc. ) and that we would work it out .
We also talked about the fact that if we are n’t going to be eating out as often , I needed to know that I had Paul ’s support to make meal planning a priority .
No complaining about having to eat leftovers or “ cheap ” food .
Most months we budgeted enough money for a dinner out every two weeks .
There was also an “ entertainment ” budget for a date night or movie with the kids a couple of times a month .
We were n’t stuck languishing at home every weekend !
We also allocated money for things like gifts , hair care , school supplies , pet care and gas .
Once we figured out our averages in these categories , we just stuck with them .
We are very fortunate that we can live comfortably on about half of our income .
I think the biggest source of non-conventional income for our debt pay - off is learning contentment .
I do n’t feel the need to have a super nice , well decorated house and designer clothes .
Our kids do n’t participate in every sport or activity offered .
We try to choose to do the things we love at affordable prices .
We ski , but we do n’t go on ski vacations .
We pack a lunch , packets of hot cocoa and instant coffee .
I actually had an argument with the lady at our local “ ski resort ” because she was going to try to charge me a dollar for a paper cup .
We will continue to live like this as far as I ’m concerned .
If we are going to go to the beach , you better bet we ’ll be packing along our tent and cooler .
Living on less than you make , requires a little creativity .
In the book of Philippians , the apostle Paul writes : “ I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances .
I know what it is to be in need , and I know what it is to have plenty .
I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation , whether well fed or hungry , whether living in plenty or in want .
I can do everything through him who gives me strength … ” .
I try to tell our boys that we are fortunate , we have everything we need and most of the things we want .
I am thankful , like the apostle Paul , for the perspective that comes from experiencing both ends of the spectrum .
God is faithful and longs to walk closely with us no matter what our financial situation .
What Was the Most Crucial Thing You Learned Through This Process ?
Paul :
For me it was how to build and use a budget .
Over the last year we ’ve got a good and workable fiscal plan in place and we ’re able to account for things that happen like car repair .
Also this year we were able to pay cash for our entire Christmas for the first time ever .
Along with that we have adopted cash envelope budgeting which makes it really easy to keep track of your spending .
If there ’s no cash , you do n’t buy anything .
Ang :
The most crucial thing for me was to learn how to communicate with Paul about our finances .
Early in our marriage , I did the finances .
But then I had two little guys to take care of and we were moving to a new area .
I was overwhelmed and handed them back to Paul .
I knew things were n’t going well , but I did n’t want to just take them back , like a mother scolding a child .
I wanted to work through them with Paul – with him taking the initiative .
I wanted him to lead our family into this area of growth .
Taking the Financial Peace University class gave us tools we needed to start the conversation .
Dave Ramsey ’s perspective gave us insight into how men and women look at money and broke down some of the communication barriers .
Now we just keep the lines open .
What Was the Hardest Thing About Paying Off This Debt ?
Ang :
The hardest part for me was keeping my time organized so that I could properly plan our household needs .
I needed to carve out time to have food in the house and make dinner , so we were n’t tempted to eat out .
I also needed to be organized so that I could accurately predict our needs at budget meetings .
It ’s hard to remember things like school pictures and teachers ’ gifts without taking some time to think the month over .
Paul :
This would be the budget .
I ’ll tell you the first 2 - 3 months was rough trying to get a workable budget going .
If you have n’t been operating on one it takes awhile to figure out how much you really can live on in your various categories .
It also takes some negotiation as to what stays and what goes .
I got pretty frustrated early on being the geek and wanting to account for every penny .
This is where the envelope budgeting was so helpful because Angela could manage her stuff without feeling like I was watching her every move .
There needs to be some give and take if you are going through this with a significant other .
Like weight loss or working out you need to stick with it and get through the first month or two of difficulties .
It will really pay off in the end .
What Did you Find Surprisingly Easy About Paying Off Your Debt ?
Paul : conspicuous consumption .
I like stuff .
I love gadgets , tools , cars , motorcycles .
Over the years I ’ve acquired a lot of stuff , most of it on credit .
So I was incredibly surprised to find out that I really did n’t need that stuff .
Along this process I found something I never knew I was looking for : contentment .
I am very blessed and this process helped me to realize that fact .
I got rid of many things I did n’t really need and feel much better about it .
I promise I have sworn off new cars entirely .
Truthfully I feel like the scales are lifted from my eyes and I look forward to the future where we can invest and give freely without the burdens of debt around our necks .
Ang : Sticking to the budget once we agreed to it .
I felt we did a pretty job of talking things through .
I loved hearing Paul tell me that he had sent another big chunk of money off to some credit card at the end of the month .
He would send me spreadsheets ( you think I ’m kidding , but no ) of our debt pay - off progress .
I loved seeing more and more zeros at the bottom of our different loan balances .
Now What ?
Ang :
Well , I ’m thrilled to think that we will have our emergency savings fully funded by the end of summer .
Then we are thinking of taking a trip to see our friends in Australia .
Then , I suppose we move on to paying off the house and getting the boys all set up for college ( at least for tuition , books and housing – I ’m thinking they should have a part - time job to support some of their expenses ) .
I get excited thinking that if we maintain our current lifestyle , we can really begin to “ give like no one else ” .
I want us to be set up for a good retirement , of course , but I really want to know that we are being good stewards of God ’s provision in our life .
Paul : stay the course .
We ’ve got our budget in place , that will remain relatively the same and those payments that would have gone to our debt are going to fund a large emergency fund based on six months of expenses .
Once that is complete we ’re kicking off our 401k retirement investing as well as funding a Coverdell ESA for our two boys college .
We will then cap that off with a trip to Australia and finally to paying off the house .
That ’s our plan and I ’ll keep you posted as we go right here on FiscalGeek .
Thanks for reading , this indeed is a happy day in the FiscalGeek household and it ’s great fun to share it with you .
I ’ve talked a bit about manufacturing on this blog , mostly from my personal experiences working for chumby building the eponymous devices .
I was browsing around on the internet and came across another world of manufacturing that I do n’t get to see — the world of highly automated manufacturing .
Seems like the big fish in the pond there is FANUC , a Japanese company that spun out from Fujitsu ( the acronym stands for Fuji Automatic Numerical Control ) .
Their Japanese corporate site is a bit dry , so for people wanting something more digestible , check out their US subsidiary home page .
Also , their corporate profile flyer is a bit amusing … it reads a bit like a backgrounder for some anime , complete with photos of fantasy art scenes and tea gardens cheek to jowl with big yellow robots .
FANUC may have the biggest robot sex operation in the world .
Get your geek - voyeurism on and watch unabashed robot - on - robot - making - other - robot action in the video below .
And below is a bit longer , but still interesting video that goes through more of FANUC ’s offerings ( you will want to skip 3:00 , where the narrator proclaims , “ Now let ’s look at the FANUC robots ! ” ) :
There ’s a ton of YouTube videos for FANUC .
Now this feels like we ’re in 2010 !
A new study from two academics at BYU tracking the sales of printed books following free ebook releases found that generally , a free ebook release is correlated with increased sales .
Interestingly , the exception is for a group of ebooks that were released for a week and then withdrawn — part of Tor.com 's launch strategy , and a success in getting large number of people signed up to the site .
Very nice to see some crunchy data in the mix .
Those who have advocated the release of free ebooks to boost print sales of book titles have been perennially dogged by arguments that they rely too heavily on the anecdote .
That is , they tend to hype singular cases of success — the wayward example of a book 's sales rocketing after the viral spread of its ebook counterpart online .
However John Hilton III and David Wiley have recently examined sales for 41 print titles before and after they were released online for free .
This study was just published in The Journal of Electronic Publishing and is titled ' The Short - Term Influence of Free Digital Versions of Books on Print Sales ' .
They organized the books they studied into four groups ; three of the four groups saw increased sales after the books had been made available for free .
The Cassini spacecraft captured this Pac - Man - shaped heat map of Saturn 's moon Mimas during a flyby on Februrary 13 .
Besides the nostalgia value , the map presents some odd questions .
Scientists were expecting gradual heat variations on Mimas — where " hot " means " moderately less ungodly frigid " , think - 294 compared to - 320 — but these abrupt cut offs are thoroughly curiosity inducing .
This is , by the way , not the first time Mimas has intersected with Earthling geek culture .
Previously , it was best known for sporting a giant , centered crater on one side , earning comparisons to the Death Star .
Insert your own " that 's no moon " joke here .
Boulder Daily Camera : Pac- Man Shaped Hot Spot Graces Saturn's Moon
Key senators are weighing a request from Big Oil to levy a carbon fee on the industry rather than wrap it into a sweeping cap - and - trade system that covers most of the U.S. economy .
If accepted , the approach -- supported by ConocoPhillips , BP America and Exxon Mobil Corp. -- could rearrange the politics of the Senate climate debate and potentially open up votes that may not be there otherwise .
" It gets you a solution to the carbon problem that does n't destroy that part of the economy , " Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , a lead co-author of the Senate legislation , said yesterday .
" Once you have oil people saying , ' We can live with this , this was our idea , ' then hopefully everybody else begins to look at this thing anew .
That 's the hope . "
Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) said yesterday she has been in talks for several months with Graham and Sens.
John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) on a proposal that sets up a " linked - carbon fee " on transportation fuels , with revenues raised going back to consumers to help them deal with higher gas prices .
The idea , Landrieu said , comes in response to refiners ' complaints that the House - passed climate bill short - changed the industry of the emissions allowances they would need in deference to other , better - connected industries like coal and manufacturing .
Graham found fault in the House bill too , which forced the industry into an upstream cap - and - trade system covering both the emissions from the refining process itself and the emissions from the products it sold .
" It really increases gas prices dramatically more than consumers can bear , " Graham said .
" The goal is to price carbon on the transportation side in a way that 'd allow alternative vehicles to become more attractive to the consumer , and to manufacturers . "
Senate aides say Kerry , Graham and Lieberman have taken Big Oil 's ideas and run with them .
No decisions have been made , but they are considering separating the industry from a cap - and - trade plan that covers electric utilities and manufacturers .
Instead , transportation fuels would face a carbon fee , with the price linked to the compliance requirements for other industries .
New revenue would be geared toward transportation projects , reducing fuel consumption and lowering domestic reliance on foreign oil .
The Highway Trust Fund is also a potential recipient of the carbon tax revenue .
" The whole concept is transportation money goes back into transportation projects , " said a Senate aide close to the process .
Kerry said he plans to release details in the coming days to senators and interest groups on the overall energy and climate plan -- an approach that appears to have some early support from oil - state Democrats and the party 's leadership .
" The issue about equalizing the costs of people who put emissions in the air is what the game plan should be , " said Sen. Mark Begich ( D - Alaska ) .
" Maybe the sector approach is the right start , " said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) .
" I 'm open to anything that moves us toward pricing carbon and reducing greenhouse gas emissions . "
Industry officials said they too welcome the discussions of a carbon fee as part of the Kerry - Graham - Lieberman effort .
" Clearly it softens the reaction and increases the likelihood that a number of people who 've been forced to push back will be much more cooperative in the dialogue , " said Jack Gerard , president of the American Petroleum Institute .
Gerard said that the carbon fee approach would yield net environmental benefits , while giving consumers the most transparent signal they can get about what the costs are from the program .
Unlike the House bill 's cap - and - trade system , oil companies would pass through the costs with signs at the gas pump letting people know they 're paying more because of U.S. efforts to deal with climate change .
" The effect is you alter consumer behavior , " Gerard said .
" If consumers know they have choices between buying a more efficient car , riding a bike or buying an SUV , now they 're making an informed choice . "
Red Cavaney , senior vice president for government affairs at ConocoPhillips , said his company joined with BP in floating a carbon fee for the oil industry during negotiations last year with the U.S. Climate Action Partnership coalition .
Their approach also would send the bulk of the revenue back to consumers , but he said opening up the bill means other pricing ideas may take hold .
" The more you get into this , the more you find out there are a lot of variations on it , " Cavaney said .
" Having some soak time , some education time , will probably develop some better proposals as more people look at this . "
ExxonMobil also has weighed in on the carbon fee .
The company proposed ( pdf ) it in 2008 to Western governors as they worked on a regional climate program , with the fee linked periodically to the average allowance price in the cap - and - trade system .
ExxonMobil CEO
Rex Tillerson has said a carbon tax has more political backing than many analysts are willing to give it .
" They say a carbon tax is too politically sensitive and that it is easier and more expedient to support a cap - and - trade approach because the public will never figure out where it's hitting them , " Tillerson told the Economic Club of Washington last October .
" They 'll just know they hurt somewhere in their pocketbook .
I disagree with this assessment .
I believe the American people want climate policy to be transparent , honest and effective . "
Denny Ellerman , a retired energy economist who worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said the oil industry 's general interest in the carbon fee stems in large part from their distaste with buying and selling emission allocations .
" Just make it a tax , and we 'll pay the tax , " Ellerman said .
" They know it gets passed on .
They know demand is inelastic .
They just do n't like the sound of having the allowances . "
Environmental groups say they want to ensure any legislation actually leads to reductions in greenhouse gases from an industrial sector that contributes to about a third of the annual U.S. emission total .
" I think it 's an interesting idea , " said Dan Weiss , a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress .
" In general , it 's a good concept .
If they can get emission reductions from it , great . "
" The key environmental concern is that transportation fuels need to be covered by the program and within the cap , " said Daniel Lashof , deputy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council 's climate center .
" It does n't mean it has to be the same [ as other industries ] .
You can certainly tailor the approach from one sector to another .
But it does need to be part of the overall program . "
To maintain environmental integrity , Lashof suggested the government would purchase and then retire allowances that represent the transportation sector 's emissions .
" Every sector has to have a responsibility , " he added .
Pitfalls
The move toward a carbon fee on transportation comes with risks .
Kerry , Graham and Lieberman are already struggling to sell their approach and avoid use of the term " cap and trade , " which opponents quickly dubbed " cap and tax " during the House debate .
By opting for a carbon fee , sponsors will be directly exposing senators to the argument that Congress is raising taxes .
" Clearly , there 's political risk for a strategy that goes to a fee approach , " said Tim Profeta , head of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University .
" The key is whether this brings any new members to the table and on board .
If it does n't , it does n't seem to have much political benefit . "
Majority Whip Durbin acknowledged the political dilemma .
" This is not an easy issue , " he said .
" It 's controversial .
There 's even a dispute in the Senate as to whether there 's such a thing as global warming . "
But Durbin said climate bill proponents can make their case to the public by talking up the measure 's importance to U.S. competitiveness .
" I just got back from Africa , " he said .
" China is all over Africa .
Opening up companies that are focusing on energy .
And we 're standing on the sidelines here locked in debate , and we 've got to get beyond that or we 're going to surrender opportunities for job creation . "
Politics are not the only sticking point .
Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) said he doubts whether there is unanimity among the refining industry on the need for a carbon fee , specifically citing concerns from smaller producers .
" Some of those larger companies have thrown up the white flag in this debate a long time ago , " he said .
" So this is sort of a continuation of that . "
A key negotiator in the House - passed climate bill also took issue with the push for a carbon fee .
Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - Va. ) said authors of the House bill opted not to give free allocations to petroleum refiners because they would have made windfall profits by passing off the permits ' costs to consumers -- unlike the electric utilities that must work through local distribution companies .
" There 's no regulator in the chamber to stop that from happening , and so rather than them get a windfall profit out of the value of the allowances , we decided to let them go buy them , " Boucher said .
" They 're going to pass through the costs one way or another .
We might as well have the money flow to people , rather than see them get it . "
If the Senate adopts a carbon fee for transportation fuels , Boucher predicted the industry would face essentially the same outcome as lawmakers wrestle over where to disburse the revenue .
" A tax would direct the money to the government and then the government in theory could give it out to these deserving entities , " he said .
" You wind up with the same result as you get with our bill . "
The refining industry also has other demands .
Carbon tax or not , Charles Drevna , president of the National Petrochemical & Refining Association , said he is concerned the climate bill will still drive up costs on domestic industries without the promise of internationally consistent regulations for competitors in India , China and South America .
Drevna also said he doubted the revenue raised by a carbon tax would get back to consumers given the other parochial interests that often creep into the legislative process .
" It goes back to the ways of creating winners and losers , " he said .
" Until such a proposal is rock - solid against that , we 're very cautious about getting too excited . "
Refiners also do not want to face any regulatory overlap , and they are calling on the Senate to drop any plans for a renewable fuels standard .
They also want credit when it comes to the emission reduction benefits that will come with new fuel economy standards that are supposed to level off the growth in U.S. motor vehicle emissions over the next 25 years , as well as the renewable fuels mandate that significantly increases ethanol use in the country .
" In fairness , that should be part of the equation , " Gerard said .
Here , refiners can expect pushback from environmentalists .
Lashof said an emission performance standard for transportation fuels is " an appropriate complementary policy to including transportation sector emissions under an overall cap . "
NRDC , he added , would oppose any attempt to restrict existing EPA or state authority to set up such a standard .
Senators also will need to sort through competing interests as they decide what to do with the revenue .
But Ellerman said this is not a bad thing .
" I 'm actually rather encouraged Congress is confronting this in an open debate , " he said .
" Do you reduce taxes ?
Get efficiency gains ?
Or earmarks toward uses that are under funded ?
Or for useful social purposes , like Social Security , or to repair bridges and highways .
" You name it , there are lots of public needs , " Ellerman said .

WHEN I started making bread back in the 1970s , whether an establishment loaf from James Beard ’s “ Beard on Bread ” or a countercultural one from “ The Tassajara Bread Book , ” it was a hands - on workout , kneading a stiff , elastic dough for what felt like a very long 10 to 15 minutes .
In the 1990s , I kneaded many hours away getting the hang of the tangy , crusty breads from the Acme Bread Company in the Bay Area , starting with the recipe that Steve Sullivan , Acme ’s founder , had supplied for “ Chez Panisse Cooking . ”
Today I wonder what else I might have done with all those hours .
Labor - saving bread books are nothing new , but the current crop includes several by respected professional bakers , and a consensus that kneading just is n’t necessary for good homemade bread .
Most proclaim the virtues of doughs that are too wet and sticky to knead , nothing like the resilient doughs of the past .
What happened to the idea that prolonged kneading works a dough ’s gluten proteins into alignment , making it more elastic and capable of rising higher into a lighter loaf ?
Is it really true that less work can make better bread ?
To find out , I baked variations on the same loaves daily for a few weeks  firm and wet , kneaded and not .
Then I got a professional ’s perspective from Michel Suas , founder of the San Francisco Baking Institute , a school nearby .
Bullying is common in classrooms around the world : About 15 percent of children are victimized , leading to depression , anxiety , loneliness , and other negative outcomes .
What 's driving bullies to behave the way they do ?
According to a new large - scale Dutch study , most bullies are motivated by the pursuit of status and affection .
The longitudinal study was conducted by researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands .
It appears in the March / April 2010 issue of the journal Child Development .
In their work , the researchers questioned almost 500 elementary - school children ages 9 to 12 .
Based on their findings , they conclude that bullies generally choose to gain status by dominating their victims .
But at the same time , they try to reduce the chances that they 'll end up on the outs with other classmates by choosing as victims children who are weak and not well - liked by others .
In short , even bullies care a lot about others ' affection and do n't want to lose it .
Gender also plays a role .
For example , the study finds that at this age , bullies only care about not losing affection from classmates of their own gender .
So when boys bully boys , it does n't matter whether girls approve or disapprove .
The same holds for girls .
Moreover , boys will bully only those girls that are n't well liked by other boys , regardless of what girls think about it , and girls will do the same in their bullying of boys .
" To understand the complex nature of acceptance and rejection , it 's necessary to distinguish the gender of the bully , the gender of the target , and the gender of the classmates who accept and reject bullies and victims , " according to René Veenstra , professor of sociology at the University of Groningen , who led the study .
Not only is the man captured reaching off screen for the new pair ( 0.51 ) , his assistant also fumbles the trick by placing the sharpened pair on the table some distance from its replacement ( 0.59 ) .
A crime suspect who invokes his “ right to remain silent ” under the famous Miranda decision can be questioned again after 14 days , the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday .
And if he freely agrees to talk then , his incriminatory statements can be used against him .
In a 9 - 0 decision in a Maryland child - abuse case , the high court overturned a rule set in 1981 that barred the police from questioning a suspect once he had asked to remain silent and to speak with a lawyer .
Known as the “ Edwards rule , ” it was intended to prevent investigators from “ badgering ” a suspect who was held in jail after he had invoked his Miranda rights .
In some cases , police had awakened a suspect in the middle of the night and asked him again to waive his rights and to admit to a crime .
In recent years , the rule has been understood to prevent police from ever requestioning a freed suspect , even for other crimes in other places .
The justices said Wednesday that although the rule made sense for suspects who were held in jail , it did not make sense for suspects who had gone free .

“ In a country that harbors a large number of repeat offenders , the consequence [ of this no- further - questioning rule ] is disastrous , ” Justice Antonin Scalia said .
If there has been a “ break in custody ” and the suspect has gone free , Scalia said , the police should be allowed to speak with him after some period of time .
“ It seems to us that period is 14 days , ” he said .
“ That provides plenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his normal life [ and ] to consult with friends and counsel . ”
Then , if the suspect waives his rights and agrees to talk , any statement he makes can be used against him , the court said .

The ruling in Maryland vs. Shatzer reinstates a child - abuse conviction against a Maryland man who made incriminatory statements to a state investigator 2 1 / 2 years after he had first been questioned by police .
At the time of the initial questioning , Michael Shatzer refused to talk without first consulting a lawyer .
He was later sent to state prison on an unrelated child - abuse charge .
When a new investigator asked him about the original allegation , he agreed to speak and admitted to abusing his son .
However , he won a ruling from the Maryland courts that said his statements could not be used against him because he had been questioned without his lawyer .
The high court overturned the lower court decision and ruled that Shatzer ’s incriminatory statements could be used to convict him .

As Washington plays politics as usual instead of fixing our broken system , people are dying .
Americans simply cannot wait for comprehensive health care reform - it 's time for Democrats to stand up to Big Insurance and their conservative allies , and get reform done right .
During the Virtual March for Real Health Care Reform , we 'll send a million messages to Congress to make sure they know that voters want them to get to work and get health care done .
Passing comprehensive healthcare reform is both good politics and good policy .
Polling of the people who voted for Obama in 2008 and for Republican Scott Brown in 2010 shows that 82 % of them support a public option : they believe the failure in DC is that Democrats are not aggressive enough in fighting for them .
Our nation ’s health care crisis is not an incremental problem and cannot be fixed with incremental solutions .
We cannot ban denials for pre-existing conditions without mandates ; we cannot institute mandates without providing subsidies ; and we cannot provide subsidies without raising revenue .
All the most popular elements of true meaningful reform are intertwined .
Public option is gaining momentum .
Support in the Senate for using reconciliation to pass a public option is growing by the day .
Currently 18 Senators have signed a letter in support of using reconciliation to pass a public option .
In addition , whip counts show that there are the votes needed to pass a public option .
In the House , more than 118 members have signed a similar letter .
On the day of the bipartisan summit , we all know Republicans still have no good ideas for health care reform , and that they will continue to be the party of " No , We Can't ! " while we 'll continue to be the party of " Yes , We Can ! "
Krugman 's right in his editorial today when he writes this :
So California ’s woes show that conservative prescriptions for health reform just wo n’t work .
What would work ?
By all means , let ’s ban discrimination on the basis of medical history — but we also have to keep healthy people in the risk pool , which means requiring that people purchase insurance .
This , in turn , requires substantial aid to lower - income Americans so that they can afford coverage .
And if you put all of that together , you end up with something very much like the health reform bills that have already passed both the House and the Senate .
What about claims that these bills would force Americans into the clutches of greedy insurance companies ?
Well , the main answer is stronger regulation ; but it would also be a very good idea , politically as well as substantively , for the Senate to use reconciliation to put the public option back into its bill .
It 's time for Washington to stop stalling --- tell them to finish their job on the 24th !
Here 's how it 's going to work here as laid out by nyceve :
The 1,000,000 Voices campaign will be rolled out to the media starting on Monday .
We 'll keep you advised of all developments as they happen .
On the morning of Wednesday , February 24th , either slinkerwink or I will post a diary , which we will ask you to please keep alive and on the rec list all day and into the evening .
We 'll ask you to sign in on Daily Kos , once you do that , you 'll be seamlessly directed to MoveOn .
On the MoveOn 1,000,000 Voices Virtual March on Washington web site , which will go live early in the morning of February 24th , you 'll be able to use their incredible tools to contact Congress and the Senate and to take the action of your choice -- call , email , fax or write .
We ask you to sign in on Daily Kos so that we 'll know and give you frequent tallies throughout the day and night of the number of Kossacks who are participating in the Virtual March .
And here 's how we 'll get this job done on February 24th , the day President Obama holds his bipartisan summit !
Each organization will ask its members to call , email , fax , or write a letter .
If you decide to call , you 'll be offered talking points .
You 're free to use them or not , whatever moves you .
Just take an action -- call , email , fax , letter - - it 's all about 1,000,000 contacts on February 24th .
These are the talking points which resonate with us .
You 're free to use them or not , it 's your choice .
The call - in effort will be to ask for these items below in the reconciliation fix , and directing these calls at the House and the Senate .
* Inclusion of the public option
* The Medicare buy - in
* Fixing the excise tax
* Getting rid of the Nebraska Cornhusker Kickback deal
* National exchange
* Drug re-importation
* Drug price negotiation in Medicare Part D
* Increasing subsidies .
Why are we aiming high ?
Because we need to do our best , and always fight to the end in making this Senate bill better .
On the other hand , if you believe the best route to getting a bill passed is for the House to simply vote to pass the Senate Bill , you are free to make that your " ask " .
And we thank you too , for participating .
All we ask , is that you take an action .
Thank you for joining the 1,000,000 Voices Virtual March on Washington campaign , and tell your friends to join as well !
Lucky to be alive :
The bunny torched in his hutch by drunk woman during family argument
Cowering in fear , his fur scorched , this is a traumatised rabbit just minutes after a heartless yob set him alight .
He was left badly burned and blistered when Katey Barber torched his hutch after drinking seven cans of lager .
The 22 - year - old had been burning clothes belonging to her mother 's partner in the garden before turning her attention to the rabbit .
Bunny the rabbit is a sorry sight after his owner 's sister set light to his hutch during a family row
The charred hutch shows the extent to which the fire took hold after a burning piece of paper was thrown in
Katey Barber set fire to her sister 's rabbit hutch , leaving poor Bunny charred and blistered
She prodded the terrified animal with a stick before throwing a burning piece of paper into its hutch and shutting the door .
When friends and family tried to intervene Barber swore at them and locked them inside the house .
Barber was then seen laughing and said : ' Look , the rabbit 's running around on fire , ' before eventually pouring water on the animal to put out the flames .
Vets who examined the rabbit , named Bunny , said he could be permanently scarred by the attack , which happened last September .
He may need to have part of one ear amputated and has been left terrified of any human contact .
Stockport magistrates heard the attack happened while Barber was staying at her mother 's home in Cheadle Heath , Stockport .
Her mother and her boyfriend were away on holiday with Barber 's sister , Rachel , the rabbit 's owner .
Dominic Geelan , prosecuting , said two children were asleep upstairs when the attack began .
After burning her mother 's partner 's clothes ' in a round drum , pouring turps on them and setting them alight ' , Barber set the hutch on fire , Mr Geelan said .
When others tried to stop her they were ' met with expletives ' , he added .
Barber , of Wythenshawe , Greater Manchester , admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal when she appeared in court last Friday .
news Here Is A Video of A Pigeon Riding the Subway
Pigeons : they ’re just like us !
The video above — turn the volume up so you can hear all the ambient noise — was shot by Elaine Georgolios earlier this month on a TTC train arriving at Runnymede Station .
We wo n’t spoil the ending other than to say that it is one of the most suspenseful , and then triumphant , testimonies to the human pigeon spirit ever captured on a cellphone camera .
Basically , it ’s The Shawshank Redemption , starring this pigeon .
Georgolios originally uploaded the video to her Facebook profile , but we ’ve been sent links to it so many times that we decided to convince her to add it to YouTube so that we could share it with the world .
Because the world must see this .
Ok , Be Afraid if Someone 's Got a Voltmeter Hooked to Your CPU
Boy , do I hate it when a FLOSS project is given a hard time unfairly .
I was this morning greeted with news from many places that OpenSSL , one of the most common FLOSS software libraries used for cryptography , was somehow severely vulnerable .
I had a hunch what was going on .
I quickly downloaded a copy of the academic paper that was cited as the sole source for the story and read it .
As I feared , OpenSSL was getting some bad press unfairly .
One must really read this academic computer science article in the context it was written ; most commenting about this paper probably did not .
First of all , I do n't claim to be an expert on cryptography , and I think my knowledge level to opine on this subject remains limited to a little blog post like this and nothing more .
Between college and graduate school , I worked as a system administrator focusing on network security .
While a computer science graduate student , I did take two cryptography courses , two theory of computation courses , and one class on complexity theory .
So , when compared to the general population I probably am an expert , but compared to people who actually work in cryptography regularly , I 'm clearly a novice .
However , I suspect many who have hitherto opined about this academic article to declare this severe vulnerability have even less knowledge than I do on the subject .
This article , of course , was n't written for novices like me , and certainly not for the general public nor the technology press .
It was written by and for professional researchers who spend much time each week reading dozens of these academic papers , a task I have n't done since graduate school .
Indeed , the paper is written in a style I know well ; my “ welcome to CS graduate school ” seminar in 1997 covered the format well .
The first thing you have to note about such papers is that informed readers generally ignore the parts that a newbie is most likely focus on : the Abstract , Introduction and Conclusion sections .
These sections are promotional materials ; they are equivalent to a sales brochure selling you on how important and groundbreaking the research is .
Some research is groundbreaking , of course , but most is an incremental step forward toward understanding some theoretical concept , or some report about an isolated but interesting experimental finding .
Unfortunately , these promotional parts of the paper are the sections that focus on the negative implications for OpenSSL .
In the rest of the paper , OpenSSL is merely the software component of the experiment equipment .
They likely could have used GNU TLS or any other implementation of RSA taken from a book on cryptography .
But this fact is not even the primary reason that this article is n't really that big of a deal for daily use of cryptography .
The experiment described in the paper is very difficult to reproduce .
You have to cause very subtle faults in computation at specific times .
As I understand it , they had to assemble a specialized hardware copy of a SPARC - based GNU / Linux environment to accomplish the experiment .
Next , the data generated during the run of the software on the specially - constructed faulty hardware must be collected and operated upon by a parallel processing computing environment over the course of many hours .
If it turns out all the needed data was gathered , the output of this whole process is the private RSA key .
The details of the fault generation process deserve special mention .
Very specific faults have to occur , and they can't occur such that any other parts of the computation ( such as , say , the normal running of the operating system ) are interrupted or corrupted .
This is somewhat straightforward to get done in a lab environment , but accomplishing it in a production situation would be impractical and improbable .
It would also usually require physical access to the hardware holding the private key .
Such physical access would , of course , probably give you the private key anyway by simply copying it off the hard drive or out of RAM !
This is interesting research , and it does suggest some changes that might be useful .
For example , if it does n't slow a system down too much , the integrity of RSA signatures should be verified , on a closely controlled proxy unit with a separate CPU , before sending out to a wider audience .
But even that would be a process only for the most paranoid .
If faults are occurring on production hardware enough to generate the bad computations this cracking process relies on , likely something else will go wrong on the hardware too and it will be declared generally unusable for production before an interloper could gather enough data to crack the key .
Thus , another useful change to make based on this finding is to disable and discard RSA keys that were in use on production hardware that went faulty .
Finally , I think this article does completely convince me that I would never want to run any RSA computations on a system where the CPU was emulated .
Causing faults in an emulated CPU would only require changes to the emulation software , and could be done with careful precision to detect when an RSA - related computation was happening , and only give the faulty result on those occasions .
I 've never heard of anyone running production cryptography on an emulated CPU , since it would be too slow , and virtualization technologies like Xen , KVM , and QEMU all pass - through CPU instructions directly to hardware ( for speed reasons ) when the virtualized guest matches the hardware architecture of the host .
The point , however , is that proper description of the dangers of a “ security vulnerability ” requires more than a single bit field .
Some security vulnerabilities are much worse than others .
This one is substantially closer to the “ oh , that 's cute ” end of the spectrum , not the “ ZOMG , everyone 's going to experience identity theft tomorrow ” side .
Many casual users do n't realize that cryptography — the stuff that secures your networked data from unwanted viewers — is n't about math problems that are unsolvable .
In fact , it 's often based on math problems that are trivially solvable , but take a very long time to solve .
This is why algorithmic complexity questions are central to the question of cryptographic security .
I 'm oversimplifying a bit here .
A key factor in the paper appears to be the linear time algorithm used to compute cryptographic digital signatures , and the fact that the signatures are n't verified for integrity before being deployed .
I suspect , though , that just about any RSA system is going to do this .
( Although I do usually test the integrity of my GnuPG signatures before sending them out , I do this as a user by hand ) .
The following is an excerpt from Frank Schaeffer ’s Patience With God : Faith for People Who Do n’t Like Religion ( or Atheism )
( Da Capo , 2009 ) .
Ask yourself :
What will happen to Rick Warren ’s church when Warren dies , leaves , or is thrown out ?
Will it remain as successful ?
Are people there for each other and their community ?
Are they there for Jesus ?
Or are they there for Rick Warren ?
Warren ’s message turns out to be less about God than it is about trying to convince his readers to become American - style evangelicals .
In other words , to find purpose they have to join the North American individualistic cult of one - stop born - again “ salvation ” to which Warren belongs .
Warren ’s Christianity ( the leftover residue of the simplistic frontier Protestantism we call “ evangelicalism ” that broke most connections theological , aesthetic , and liturgical to the historic Christian churches of both the East and West ) is not to be confused with what Christians through most of the 2,000 - year history of their religion would have recognized as even remotely familiar .
According to traditional Christianity , a person was not “ saved ” or “ lost ” in a one - stop magical affirmation of “ correct ” doctrine , but , rather , the process of salvation was lived out in a community .
Salvation was a path toward God , not a you ’re - in - or - out event , as in “ At two thirty last Wednesday I accepted Jesus . ”
Just as Hillary Clinton said about child rearing , the process of redemption took a village .
Pastors were part of that “ village ” tradition and were inducted into existing communities of faith .
They were not self - made and reinventing the faith according to whim .
The heart of worship was sacramental continuity and an unbroken connection to generations that came before .
Bishops and priests came and went , but the Church remained .
What the Church provided was a set of tools — liturgical sacramental exercises , things to do to train one to receive God ’s love by learning to love others as oneself .
Some members of the Church — East and West — did some very , very nasty things .
They oppressed women , killed heretics , started wars , buggered choir boys , persecuted Jews , molested pilgrims , and aided and abetted the institution of slavery .
But they usually did get one thing right : Spirituality was n’t a matter of celebrity leaders who sprang up then faded away .
Some terrible celebrity Christian leaders existed , such as the fifteenth century ’s nasty , odd , and painting - burning Savonarola of Florence .
But celebrities were the exception to an otherwise virtually anonymous pastorate .
Communities built cathedrals over generations .
Usually , no one who worked on laying the building ’s foundation was around when it was completed .
The name of the cathedral was that of the town where it stood ( for instance , Chartres Cathedral ) or that of a biblical figure ( Notre Dame for instance ) .
A few egomaniacal popes ( or bishops ) aside , churches were not about their leaders but about the people who worshipped in them .
There were religious orders in the Roman Catholic Church that bore the names of their founders , such as the Franciscans , but when those orders survived their founders , it was because they were folded into a hierarchical orderly structure .
There were egomaniacal “ saints ” who drew attention to their “ holiness ” by public displays of self - mortification ( the so - called Stylites , or “ Pillar - Saints , ” ascetics in the Byzantine Empire who stood on pillars preaching , exposed to the elements , while followers gathered around ) , but they performed their antics outside of churches .
Such individualistic displays did n’t penetrate the liturgical practices led by largely anonymous priests .
The North American evangelical / fundamentalist brand of Christianity is the religious version of the American civil religion : consumerist individualism .
Today ’s “ Stylites ” are more often found in private jets , but they still have followers who conflate holiness with success American style — in other words , as measured by money , possessions , numbers , and ( above all ) celebrity status .
The consumer picks a pastor based on where the action seems to be : “ Wow , you ought to hear our pastor ! ” Such “ churches ” are often founded by a man or woman who started them the way other men and women start a restaurant or a movie company .
In Warren ’s case , he is pastor of a church called Saddleback , but it ’s more properly known as “ Rick Warren ’s church , ” just as the Crystal Cathedral came to be known as “ Robert Schuller ’s church , ” and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has its founder ’s name in the same way as the Ford Motor Company bears the name of its founder .
Atheist or Liar
Media mogul Rupert Murdoch now owns the largest “ Christian ” publishing company , having bought it out and then folded it into his stable of publishing giants , one of which publishes — that ’s right —
Rick Warren .
One ca n’t picture any scenario in which Warren would be thrown off the evangelical / fundamentalist team , other than if he started to officiate at gay weddings .
He answers to no one , let alone to a tradition of liturgical practice , or , God forbid , a bishop , that might diminish the go - it - alone individualism ( otherwise known as “ God ’s leading ” ) of market capitalism with a Jesus twist that works so well for him .
Warren makes past evangelical / fundamentalist superstars such as Lewis , Falwell , Schuller , or my dad [ Francis Schaeffer ] seem insignificant .
Warren ’s is star power on an Oprah level .
Warren gave the invocation at a president ’s inauguration .
Warren ’s church is huge .
He ’s the author of the all - time bestselling book ever published in the history of American publishing .
God is blessing !
Right ?
Maybe not .
A Rick Warren , a C. S. Lewis , and a Francis Schaeffer are the essence of evangelical / fundamentalist success , but they also represent the Achilles heel of American evangelicalism .
Personality cults with no accountability and no tradition and no structure to fall back on when the “ Dear Leader ” dies , or is found to have “ fallen , ” whatever , are no better than the men and women they ’re built on .
The “ something bigger ” you thought you joined just turns out to just be some smooth - talking guy named Rick .
The evangelical / fundamentalist religion is no different in its core “ values ” from the celebrity - worshiping , entertainment - oriented society it claims to be a prophetic witness to .
In this vein it ’s no coincidence that Billy Graham ’s alma mater , the aforementioned Wheaton College , also has a “ museum ” attached to its campus in which Disneyland - like experiences are offered .
This attraction is described on the school ’s website as a “ journey through the Museum [ that ] takes you on a Walk Through The Gospel , with a stirring three - dimensional presentation of the Christian message . ”
But that is only after you have experienced an “ encounter [ with ] one of the loveliest and most fascinating presentations of the basic Christian message in The Cross of The Millennium .
From here , you ’ll enter a major section of the Museum which highlights the Life and Ministry of Billy Graham . ”
If the United States Marine Corps caved to the consumer culture the way the evangelicals have , each drill instructor would be individually picked by each recruit , some choosing DIs based on looks , others on charm , yet others because this or that DI wore a cool uniform or was “ nicer than those other guys . ”
The process might be fun , but the idea that the Marines are identifiable because each Marine knows that all other Marines share the same experience of boot camp , values , and discipline would be lost .
The word Marine would lose its meaning if all recruits went to boot camps that suited them personally .
The Marine Corps would become just another part of the entertainment industry / consumer culture , which is exactly what the evangelical / fundamentalist churches are today , with a therapeutic twist that adds feeling good to the product list .
If I have heard this once , I have heard it ( or rather read it in emails ) literally hundreds of times .
“ I ca n’t say this in public , but … ” has been the start of so many emails from many evangelical and Roman Catholic and ( to be truthful ) several Orthodox leaders too , as well as ordinary folks living what amount to intellectual / spiritual double lives .
Perhaps it ’s because they are being presented with bad alternatives that they believe they must choose between :
Frank ,
After leaving the strait jacket of evangelicalism , I can breathe … I was out of step as an evangelical pastor [ with ] my quotes of Bob Dylan , celebration of sexuality when the [ biblical ] passage called for it and a demand for truth though it was only when I was out from the oppression of the movement that I realized how much compromise had been interwoven into my life as pastor and leader .
Cordially , D .
I can’t prove this , but I think that any person who remains a “ professional Christian ” in the evangelical / fundamentalist world for a lifetime , especially any pastor , risks becoming an atheist and / or a liar .
Such individuals put on an act of certainty .
Sooner or later they become flakes faking it , or quit .
Worse yet , some just stop asking questions .
The very fact that a preacher can fool others when he or she has so many doubts makes the self - appointed mediator of faith the deepest cynic of all if , that is , he or she does n’t embrace paradox .
Warren can’t do more than act the part of Rick Warren being Rick Warren .
He also has to be “ into ” whatever the Church Ladies are into at the moment .
And woe betide Warren if he expresses any truths about his doubts and failings or , worse yet , casually mentions that he ’d rather be , say , a secular Jew free to do or say what he wants without a gaggle of low - IQ evangelicals parsing his every move .
Warren knows that he must park his conscience at the door of his golden cage , or his empire will melt away under the intolerable weight of the gossip of the Church Ladies .
Warren got a whiff of this when he was foolish enough to go on Larry King Live in the spring of 2009 , and mention that maybe he was n’t as firmly against gay marriage as he was said to have been in the wake of the battle over gay marriage in California last year .
As the Washington Times reported on April 11 , 2009 , “ I was extremely troubled , ” said Al Mohler , president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville , Kentucky .
“ Absolutely baffling , ” huffed Wendy Wright , president of the far - right Concerned Women of America organization .
Warren learned , if he did n’t already know , that the only thing evangelicals will never forgive is any letting up on hating the “ other . ”
That ’s what my friend Richard Cizik , former vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals , learned .
He was being interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air in 2009 and mentioned that maybe he was n’t against gay civil unions .
He did n’t even mention gay marriage .
He was fired within days .
Rich told me that he was never even asked by the board what he ’d meant by his remarks and was never given a chance to respond .
Cizik had almost been forced out several years before when James Dobson , of Focus on the Family fame , wrote to the NAE board demanding Cizik ’s dismissal for saying that he thought global warming was real .
Cizik got away with that apostasy against the Republican Party , which had long since come to be a stand - in for the “ true church ” for power - hungry evangelical / fundamentalist leaders such as Dobson .
But when Cizik did n’t hate gays enough , game over !

Gordon Brown has told the Iraq inquiry the war had been " right " - and troops had all the equipment they needed .
The PM also insisted he had not been kept in the dark by Tony Blair despite not being aware of some developments .
His own intelligence briefings had convinced him that Iraq was a threat that " had to be dealt with " , he said .
But the main issue for him was that Iraq was in breach of UN resolutions - and that " rogue states " could not be allowed to flout international law .
If the international community could not act together over Iraq , Mr Brown said , he feared the " new world order we were trying to create would be put at risk " .
Assessing the prime minister 's four hour appearance before the committee , BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said : " Gordon Brown 's aim today appears to be to look and sound different from Tony Blair whilst simultaneously opening up no gap of substance with him and the decisions he took . "
' Diplomatic route '
Mr Brown , who was chancellor at the time of the war , was giving evidence weeks ahead of the UK general election , which is expected to be held in early May .
THE STORY SO FAR
He may have been writing the cheques as chancellor , but Gordon Brown remained largely silent in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war He was thought by some to be sceptical about it .
Others thought he was hedging his bets ahead of a leadership bid After becoming PM , he set up the Iraq inquiry to " learn lessons " from the war , although he originally wanted it held in secret and the timing ensured it would not report until after the election Ex-military leaders have given evidence at the inquiry suggesting Mr Brown kept defence spending tight during his 10 years at the Treasury with some suggesting this had a knock - on effect on forces ' kit Mr Brown has denied this and will want to counter any impression , as put by David Cameron , that he did not see the military as a priority until he was PM and it became politically convenient
LIVE : Video and text commentary Q&A : Iraq war inquiry Iraq inquiry : Day - by - day timeline Read Nick 's thoughts in full Brown : the unasked questions
He began the session by paying tribute to the " sacrifice " made by British servicemen and women , but he added : " I think it was the right decision and made for the right reasons . "
Mr Brown acknowledged that there were " important lessons " to be learned from the way Iraq descended into chaos following the invasion .
" It was one of my regrets that I was n't able to be more successful in pushing the Americans on this issue - that the planning for reconstruction was essential , just the same as planning for the war , " he said .
And he added : " There will be other states , rogue states , that need to change and we need to ensure civilian support as well as military support to do what 's necessary when a broken state has to be rebuilt . "
He also stressed that he had always believed in an international effort to rebuild Iraq and create a " just peace " for its citizens , adding , in an apparent swipe at members of George Bush 's US administration : " I never subscribed to what you might call the neo-Conservative position that somehow , at the barrel of a gun , overnight , liberty and democracy could be conjured up . "
Setting out his thinking on the rationale for war for the first time in public , Mr Brown said terrorists and " rogue states " were the " two risks to the post - Cold War world " and had to be tackled .
He said he had met the intelligence service five times during 2002 and early 2003 and was given information " which led me to believe that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with by the actions of the international community . "
But he added : " Right up to the last minute , right up to the last weekend , I think many of us were hopeful that the diplomatic route would succeed . "
Equipment Mr Brown said he had largely restricted his involvement in the run up to war to financial matters , and he had assured Tony Blair at an early stage that he would not try to block military options " on the grounds of cost " .
And he insisted UK forces had been given all the equipment they had asked for - in response to earlier evidence from ex-military leaders who told the inquiry spending had been squeezed .

More from BBC Radio 5 live " At any point , commanders were able to ask for equipment that they needed and I know of no occasion when they were turned down , " he told the panel .
He said the total cost to the UK of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had been £ 18bn , in addition to a " rising " defence budget , which he admitted was a " sizeable sum of money " which had " made my life more difficult " as chancellor .
But he said the government had been able to meet the costs from reserves without making cuts elsewhere and it had ultimately been " manageable " .
EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT Georgina Pattinson , Assistant Editor BBC Democracy Live , at the Iraq inquiry
There was barely a sound in the inquiry room , particularly at moments when Mr Brown replied to key questions .
At the mention of those who lost their lives in the Iraq conflict , or on questions concerning the equipment given to the military , you could have heard a pin drop .
There was a real feeling of tension , as those listening appeared to hold their breath .
But there were moments of lethargy among the audience too .
When the prime minister began to answer questions with a long list of figures , there were some eyelids closing and heads nodding .
" Pretty stage - managed , " said one member of the audience in the lift , leaving at the end of the two hour session .
" Not as stage - managed as Tony Blair , " said another .
" That was pure theatre . "
Panel member Lawrence Freedman challenged Mr Brown over funding for armed forces equipment - particularly Snatch Land Rovers , an issue he said had been raised by the families of soldiers killed in Iraq .
Mr Brown said Bulldog and Mastiff vehicles had been supplied to troops at a cost of £ 90 m as soon as their commanders on the ground had asked for them , with the first of them arriving in Iraq " within six months " .
Mr Brown praised Tony Blair 's handling of the diplomatic negotiations : " Everything Mr Blair did , he did properly and I was kept fully informed about the information that I needed to make my decisions . "
But he said he had largely restricted his involvement to financial matters , telling the inquiry : " My role in this was not to interfere in what were very important diplomatic negotiations . "
He said he had not seen letters sent by Tony Blair to US President George W Bush - and had not been aware that Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had changed his opinion on the legality of the war .
Asked whether he knew what Mr Blair had said to Mr Bush at a private meeting at the US president 's Texas ranch in 2002 , at which some inquiry witnesses have suggested Mr Blair committed Britain to war , he said : " I did n't know the exact conversation and you would n't expect me to . "
But he said the " decision making structures " at the top of the British government in the run up to war had been too informal and both he and Tony Blair had since taken steps to rectify this .

About 2 hours ago Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said it was clear from Mr Brown 's evidence that he had had been kept in the dark by Mr Blair about key aspects of the build up to war .
He told the BBC News channel that as " the most senior member of the cabinet " after Mr Blair , Mr Brown should have asked more questions about the wider political implications of the conflict .
Unlike Tony Blair when he appeared in January , Mr Brown entered the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre , where the inquiry is being held , by the front entrance .
Only a small knot of protesters had gathered to mark his arrival .
Mr Brown is expected to have a private meeting with family members of some of those killed in the conflict at some point during the day .
Only one family who lost a relative in Iraq has applied for seats at Mr Brown 's hearing - 40 seats were reserved for families over the course of Mr Blair 's day - long session .
Mr Blair gave evidence to the inquiry in January .
He said he had " no regrets " about removing Saddam Hussein from power and insisted the Iraq war had made the world a safer place .

Christmas Bomber : Where Airport Security Worked
With all the talk about the failure of airport security to detect the PETN that the Christmas bomber sewed into his underwear — and to think I ’ve been using the phrase “ underwear bomber ” as a joke all these years — people forget that airport security played an important role in foiling the plot .
In order to get through airport security , Abdulmutallab — or , more precisely , whoever built the bomb — had to construct a far less reliable bomb than he would have otherwise ; he had to resort to a much more ineffective detonation mechanism .
And , as we ’ve learned , detonating PETN is actually very hard .
Additionally , I do n’t think it ’s fair to criticize airport security for not catching the PETN .
The security systems at airports are n’t designed to catch someone strapping a plastic explosive to his body .
Even more strongly : no security system , at any airport , in any country on the planet , is designed to catch someone doing this .
This is n’t a surprise .
It is n’t even a new idea .
It was n’t even a new idea when I said this to then TSA head Kip Hawley in 2007 : “ I do n’t want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers . ”
You can try to argue that the TSA , and other airport security organizations around the world , should have been redesigned years ago to catch this , but anyone who is surprised by this attack simply has n’t been paying attention .
EDITED TO ADD ( 1/4 ) : I do n’t know what to make of this :
Ben Wallace , who used to work at defence firm QinetiQ , one of the companies making the technology , warned it was not a “ big silver bullet ” . [… ]
Mr Wallace said the scanners would probably not have detected the failed Detroit plane plot of Christmas Day .
He said the same of the 2006 airliner liquid bomb plot and of explosives used in the 2005 bombings of three Tube trains and a bus in London . [… ]
He said the “ passive millimetre wave scanners ” – which QinetiQ helped develop – probably would not have detected key plots affecting passengers in the UK in recent years . [ … ]
Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4 ’s Today programme : “ The advantage of the millimetre waves are that they can be used at longer range , they can be quicker and they are harmless to travellers .
“ But there is a big but , and the but was in all the testing that we undertook , it was unlikely that it would have picked up the current explosive devices being used by al - Qaeda . ”
He added : “ It probably would n’t have picked up the very large plot with the liquids in 2006 at Heathrow or indeed the… bombs that were used on the Tube because it was n’t very good and it was n’t that easy to detect liquids and plastics unless they were very solid plastics .
“ This is not necessarily the big silver bullet that is somehow being portrayed by Downing Street . ”
A spokeswoman for QinetiQ said “ no single technology can address every eventuality or security risk ” .
“ QinetiQ ’s passive millimetre wave system , SPO , is a… people - screening system which can identify potential security threats concealed on the human body .
It is not a checkpoint security system .
“ SPO can effectively shortlist people who may need further investigation , either via other technology such as x-rays , or human intervention such as a pat - down search . ”

I was talking to a son of a friend of mine over the weekend .
Mark ( not his real name ) is 18 and has been finding his energy and motivation can flag at times .
Some of the time he can be energised and motivated .
Other times he feels lethargic and “ ca n’t be bothered with life ” .
Naturally , the focus on this issue has been on his life circumstances , but I was also interested to explore if physiological or biochemical factors may be playing some part in his symptoms .
I asked Mark if his symptoms appeared to have any relationship to food .
He said others had noticed that his mood improves , at least momentarily on eating .
There are many reasons why someone may feel cheerier for eating including , of course , the deriving of pleasure from food .
One other important reason individuals may feel better for eating is that they have come into that meal with low levels of blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) .
Because the brain generally uses a lot of sugar , under - fuelling of the brain through hypoglycaemia can cause it to malfunction .
Low mental energy and low mood are potential symptoms of hypoglycaemia .
When blood sugar levels are improved by eating , it can lead to an improvement in energy and outlook too .
I have found over the years that blood sugar instability is a major cause of fluctuation in mood and energy .
This has not just been my professional experience , but my personal experience too .
Many years ago ( when my diet was much richer in carbohydrate ) I was quite prone to what I take to be spells of hypoglycaemia myself .
While I talking to Mark I remembered how I would sit as medical student in teaching hospital clinics or lectures in the afternoon ( a danger time for hypoglycaemia ) feeling tired , unable to concentrate and often utterly demotivated .
Later on I began to realise that at least a large part of these issues were down to my awry blood sugar control .
This was picked up on by others too .
For example , if I was grumpy those who knew me well ( a girlfriend , say ) would urge me to ‘ eat something ’ .
One of my friends , a doctor , suggested that I was Snow White ’s eighth dwarf – going under the name of ‘ hypo ’ .
I have learned , likes many others , that getting the diet right is key to stabilising blood sugar levels .
There are two fundamental here : eating foods that release sugar relatively slowly into the bloodstream , and eating those foods regularly enough .
I asked Mark about his diet .
A lot of his diet turned out to be generally disruptive for blood sugar ( Subway sandwiches , burgers and fries , mounds of pasta ) .
His eating was also quite irregular .
I asked about breakfast .
His reply was “ I do n’t see the point of breakfast ” .
I asked him what he meant by this and he replied “ When I eat breakfast I ’m starving an hour later . ”
When I asked him what he might have for breakfast it turned out to be cereal .
His experience here is relatively common .
I quite often hear individuals tell me they are hungrier in the morning after the eat breakfast than if they do n’t .
This , I think , is another symptom of impaired blood sugar regulation .
Typical breakfast fare such as toast and cereal tend to induce surges of blood sugar which , in turn , can cause large quantities of insulin to be secreted by the pancreas .
One of the chief functions of insulin is to reduce blood sugar levels , but a glut of insulin can cause hypoglycaemia , which can cause individuals to be hungry ( typically for carbohydrate - rich foods ) .
My advice was to scale back the carbs a bit , up the protein , and to eat more regularly ( including healthy snacks if he gets peckish between meals ) .
Cutting back on carbs and eating more regularly should help to ensure a steadier supply of fuel into the brain .
More protein should help here too .
But another trick that protein has up its sleeve is the fact that it is made of amino acids , and these supply the building blocks of brain chemicals ( neurotransmitters ) that can have a profound effect on mood and brain energy ( including dopamine , noradrenaline and serotonin ) .
Giving advice is no guarantee that someone will act on it .
However , my experience tells me that if Mark adjusts his diet in the way I outline here he will see quite immediate benefit in terms of his energy and mood .
I know it did with me , and I ’ve seen it work for countless others too .
A number of studies over the past two decades have shown that religious people tend to be healthier .
But a new study suggests that when it comes to heart disease and clogged arteries , attending religious services or having spiritual experiences may not protect against heart attacks and strokes .
This study suggests “ there ’s not a lot of extra burden or extra protection afforded by this particular aspect of people ’s lives , ” said Dr. Donald Lloyd - Jones , of the Feinberg School of Medicine , Northwestern University , Chicago , who led the study , published in the journal Circulation .
In their review of data from nearly 5,500 people who were part of another study , Lloyd - Jones and his colleagues -- one of whom , Matthew Feinstein , is a Northwestern medical student who suggested the research -- expected to see less risk for heart disease among those with more “ religiosity . ”
The authors defined religiosity as participation in religious activities , prayer or meditation , and spirituality , regardless of denomination .
They did not report the religious faiths of study participants .
Over the course of 4 years , those in the study had 152 events related to heart disease or clogged arteries , including 9 deaths , 42 heart attacks , and 24 strokes .
That rate of such events -- less than one percent per year -- was lower than in the general population , which the team expected because they excluded people who were already diagnosed with heart disease and related conditions .
However , neither the rate of heart disease events , nor the number of certain risk factors -- such as high cholesterol , diabetes , and high blood pressure -- differed among those who were more or less religious or spiritual .
The only exceptions :
Those who went to religious services , otherwise prayed or meditated , or were highly spiritual were more likely to be obese , and less likely to smoke .
Given that many religions discourage smoking tobacco , the smoking finding was not difficult to explain , Lloyd - Jones said , and is consistent with earlier studies .
The reasons for the obesity finding , which is similar to some previous studies but the opposite of others , are less clear .
“ We ’re not sure whether it is that religious people are more likely to gain weight through activities they pursue , or maybe heavier people seek out religion as a result of stigmatization , ” Lloyd - Jones said .
Dr. Harold G. Koenig , a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University , Durham , North Carolina , said the obesity finding was not surprising , given that congregations and families often “ fellowship ” over meals .
Koenig , who has studied the potential connection between health and religion , was not involved in Lloyd - Jones ’ work .
He said the research is well - done , but it has a lot of limitations that make the meaning of the results unclear .
For example , he said the low rate of heart attacks and other events could be a weakness of the study , because at small numbers , the likelihood of an effect is more difficult to tease out .
Koenig also noted that half of the people studied were either African American or Hispanic -- groups that , on average , have poorer access to health care than do whites and Asian Americans , who made up the rest of the study sample .
African Americans , on average , are also some of the most religious people in the world , Koenig said .
“ When you ’ve got a population with this big a difference , struggling , and under stress , religion would have to overcome an enormous number of risk factors to have a significant effect . ”
Lloyd - Jones agreed that the study is “ not the final word .
But it ’s very interesting . ”
Heart disease “ is very complex , ” Lloyd - Jones said .
“ It does not arise from a single source .
Each of us brings our own mix of genes and environment . ”

Final space shuttle booster test - firing ready to light
BY JUSTIN RAY
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 24 , 2010
BRIGHAM CITY , Utah --
A space shuttle solid rocket booster , anchored horizontally in the high desert of northern Utah , will be ignited for a two - minute firing Thursday that caps a test program dating back to 1977 .
Booster maker Alliant Techsystems will conduct the test just before 12 noon Mountain Time ( 2 p.m. EST ; 1900 GMT ) at its facilities in Promontory .
Engineers have 43 design objectives for the full - scale shuttle rocket , which is instrumented with 258 channels of data .
It will be 52nd such test performed for NASA 's space shuttle program .
The first test was conducted on July 18 , 1977 , during the shuttle 's early development .
With the shuttle program now winding down and only four missions left to launch into space this year , officials say Thursday 's test will ensure those upcoming boosters fly safely .
The twin solid - fuel rockets provide 80 percent of the thrust needed to propel the space shuttle off the ground .
A single shuttle solid rocket booster generates up to 3.3 million pounds of thrust during ascent , equivalent to 22 million horsepower .
Each motor is packed with 1.1 million pounds of propellant and burn about five tons of fuel per second .
The rubber - like fuel resembling a pencil eraser is a blend of aluminum powder , ammonium perchlorate , HB polymer , iron oxide and an epoxy curing .
The pure white boosters are 149 feet long and 12 feet in diameter .
They are comprised of 11 steel sections that are stacked together .
Known for their reusability , the motors parachute into the Atlantic Ocean during launch for retrieval and refurbishment .
The booster being used in Thursday 's test has casings flown previously on 38 shuttle missions .
Spaceflight Now will be covering Thursday 's test live from the ATK test site .

Recently by Peter Schiff : Paul Krugman Versus Reality
The latest housing initiative announced today by the Obama Administration draws the U.S. government and , by proxy , all taxpaying Americans , further into the inescapable quagmire of a devastated real estate market .
By transferring more underwater mortgage balances onto the public books , the plan puts taxpayers on the hook for further losses if housing prices continue to fall .
Given the massive support for real estate already afforded by record - low interest rates and massive federal tax and policy incentives , there are very good reasons to believe that home prices will indeed collapse when these crutches are removed .
Recent spikes in long - term interest rates warn of this prospect .
Crash Proof 2.0 : How t... Peter D. Schiff Best Price : $ 1.50 Buy New $ 3.97 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
If the Administration had allowed losses to fall where they rightfully belong , namely on those who foolishly loaded up on toxic mortgage bonds , then the housing market would have already found its true clearing level .
Instead , every measure is working to prolong and delay the ultimate reckoning , while setting up taxpayers as the patsy .
Given the horrendous government deficit projections for the next several years , any losses incurred by the government mortgage portfolio may add a critical stress on America ’s fiscal viability .
In addition , the moves add even more incentives detrimental to economic growth .
By targeting benefits toward unemployed homeowners , or those who are delinquent in mortgage payments , the program will encourage some mortgage holders to defer job - hunting and miss payments .
Also , in offering loan - balance reductions , the program makes no distinction between homeowners who navely overpaid during the speculative peak and those who willfully put themselves underwater by taking advantage of home equity loans on existing mortgages .
In short , these policies reward profligacy and penalize prudence .
The longer the government continues to distort the underlying economics of the real estate market , the longer it will take for the sector to heal itself — and the longer the sickness will infect the broader economy .

Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has forbidden the practice until now , these sources said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
The Israeli statements were confirmed by more than a half dozen U.S. foreign policy and intelligence officials in interviews with UPI .
With the appointment of Meir Dagan , the new director Israel 's Mossad secret intelligence service , Sharon is also preparing " a huge budget " increase for the spy agency as part of " a tougher stance in fighting global jihad ( or holy war ) , " one Israeli official said .
Since Sharon became Israeli prime minister , Israel has mainly limited its practice of targeted killings to the West Bank and Gaza because " no one wanted such operations on their territory , " a former Israeli intelligence official said .
Another former Israeli government official said that under Sharon , " diplomatic constraints have prevented the Mossad from carrying out ' preventive operations ' ( targeted killings ) on the soil of friendly countries until now . "
He said Sharon is " reversing that policy , even if it risks complications to Israel 's bilateral relations . "
A former Israeli military intelligence source agreed : " What Sharon wants is a much more extensive and tough approach to global terrorism , and this includes greater operational maneuverability . "
Does this mean assassinations on the soil of allies ?
" It does , " he said .
" Mossad is definitely being beefed up , " a U.S. government official said of the Israeli agency 's budget increase .
He declined to comment on Israel 's geographic expansion of targeted killings .
An FBI spokesman also declined to comment , saying : " This is a policy matter .
We only enforce federal laws . "
A congressional staff member with deep knowledge of intelligence matters said , " I do n't know on what basis we would be able to protest Israel 's actions . "
He referred to the recent killing of Qaed Salim Sinan al Harethi , a top al Qaida leader , in Yemen by a remotely controlled CIA drone .
" That was done on the soil of a friendly ally , " the staffer said .
Gerald Bull , an Ontario - born U.S. citizen and designer of the Iraqi supergun -- a massive artillery system capable of launching satellites into orbit , and of delivering nuclear chemical or biological payloads from Baghdad to Israel -- was killed in Belgium in March 1990 .
The killing is still unsolved , but former CIA officials said a Mossad hit team is the most likely suspect .
Bull worked on the supergun design -- codenamed Project Babylon -- for 10 years , and helped the Iraqis develop many smaller artillery systems .
He was found with five bullets in his head outside his Brussels apartment .
Israeli hit teams , which consist of units or squadrons of the Kidon , a sub-unit for Mossad 's highly secret Metsada department , would stage the operations , former Israeli intelligence sources said .
Kidon is a Hebrew word meaning " bayonet , " one former Israeli intelligence source said .
This Israeli government source explained that in the past Israel has not staged targeted killings in friendly countries because " no one wanted such operations on their territory . "
This has become irrelevant , he said .
Dagan , the new hard - driving director of Mossad , will implement the new changes , former Israeli government officials said .
Dagan , nicknamed " the gun , " was Sharon 's adviser on counter - terrorism during the government of Netanyahu in 1996 , former Israeli government officials say .
A former military man , Dagan has also undertaken extremely sensitive diplomatic missions for several of Israel 's prime ministers , former Israeli government sources said .
Former Israel Defense Forces Lt. Col. Gal Luft , who served under Dagan , described him as an " extremely creative individual -- creative to the point of recklessness . "
A former CIA official who knows Dagan said the new Mossad director knows " his foreign affairs inside and out , " and has a " real killer instinct . "
Dagan is also " an intelligence natural " who has " a superb analyst not afraid to act on gut instinct , " the former CIA official said .
Dagan has already removed Mossad officials whom he regards as " being too conservative or too cautious " and is building up " a constituency of senior people of the same mentality , " one former long - time Israeli operative said .
Dagan is also urging that Mossad operatives rely less on secret sources and rely more on open information that is so plentifully provided on the Internet and newspapers .
" It 's a cultural thing , " one former Israeli intelligence operative explained .
" Mossad in the past has put its emphasis on Humint ( human intelligence ) and secret operations and has neglected the whole field of open media , which has become extremely important . "
Regarding Mossad 's new policy and budget increase , Kim Farber an Israeli Embassy official said , " There is so little information available on this , there is nothing I can add . "

How is China getting 17 nations on board with such an ambitious -- and expensive -- project ?
For starters , they 're offering to pick up the tab .
China will build the infrastructure in exchange for rights to natural resources in the nations that benefit from the high - speed links .
So China gets timber , minerals , oil , gas , etc. as well as a fast , efficient means to pipe them to cities within its borders , and smaller , sometimes isolated nations ( here 's looking at you , Burma ) get a high tech , high speed connection to the greater global economy .
Identity
Theft is increasingly becoming a common crime because of unassuming people who take little care of their personal information .
It is easier for Identity thieves to assume one ’s life , especially now with all the new technologies readily available to them to commit the crime .
Once an ID thief possesses your personal and financial information , even from a simple source like a bill or a driver ’s license , your identity can successfully be stolen .
For people victimized by the crime , it will be extremely difficult to recover because of the repercussions that it causes to other aspects of their lives .
Stolen money can be earned back in time .
Reputation is harder to restore .
The ID thief can commit other criminal acts while pretending to be you ; it can cause problems with your personal relationships , financial institutions , or worse , the government .
Online Identity Theft
Identity theft has been occurring long before the advent of cyberspace .
The online version of this crime is quite similar to the offline version , but always more convenient and a great deal faster .
When before , a thief can only focus on one victim at a time ; today , a single click of the mouse can affect millions of lives .
The phishing scheme , for example , requires an ID thief to pose as a representative of a trusted company or organization already affiliated with the victim .
The victim usually receives an email , which deceivingly looks similar to the real thing , and will ask for highly sensitive information about an account with them , such as passwords and account numbers , for a supposed verification process .
If the victim makes the fatal mistake of divulging the information , the thief can begin to wreck havoc by accessing those accounts and even open new ones under the victim ’s name for whatever purpose they desire .
While the authorities are already aggressive with cracking down the crime violators for persecution , especially with Internet fraud , it is still up to the public to protect themselves first and foremost .
Taking extra precautions and advancing your knowledge about Identity
Theft is still your best bet in preventing potentially damaging loss .
Below are some great tips to protect yourself from identity theft and being scammed :
Identity Theft Prevention Tips
Keep a hard copy of all important personal information in a secure location .
It can help you track or cancel your accounts should your documents get lost or stolen .
Never let your credit card out of your sight or leave your personal documents in accessible places .
Be wary of people who have access to your personal information , even in retail shops and restaurants .
If you need to leave documents inside your car , it should be kept in a lockable glove compartment or in the trunk .
Do not store personal information on notebooks , laptops , mobile phone or other gadgets that can be used by somebody else , easily misplaced , lost or stolen .
If you cannot avoid it , secure all your personal information with a password .
Never disclose your credit card PIN to anyone .
Choose PIN numbers difficult to guess - those that do n’t include birth dates , maiden names , pet ’s name , usual number combinations , and so on .
When entering your PIN at ATMs and in stores , cover with your hand and be observant of your surroundings .
Make sure that there is surveillance around and that nobody is watching you do your transactions on the ATM .
Make sure that there are no unusual devices , such as a card skimmer , illegally attached to the ATM .
Always sign the back of your new credit card as soon you receive .
This will make it difficult for an ID thief to impersonate you in an immediate verification of any transactions .
Reduce the number of credit cards you have been issued and only carry those that you intend to use .
Shred the credit cards you do n’t need after you call customer service to cancel them .
Check bills every month and make sure that all the charges are legitimate .
Immediately report any unauthorized transactions to your bank or credit card company and ask for an investigation .
Destroy any old and expired credit cards .
Shred or incinerate everything that bears your personal information before disposal ; these include bills , statement letters , and even receipts .
This would prevent thieves from knowing your habits , you normal whereabouts at a specific time , or other information , which can help them steal your identity .
Immediately report credit cards that are missing .
If you have applied for a credit card that did not arrive on time , contact your credit card company and relay the problem as soon as possible .
The reason for this is ID thieves can intercept them ; the sooner you act , the lesser your risk .
Never respond through postal mail or over the phone when dealing with sensitive information .
Scammers will do anything they can to get something from you even if it means eavesdropping on all your phone conversations or transactions .
Your credit card company will never call you and ask you to verify your information .
If you receive a call from the credit card company , hang up and call the number on the back of the card so you know you ’re talking to the company and not a scammer .
Do not submit personal details over the internet , like your date of birth , home or mailing address and phone numbers , especially in social networking sites .
Do not give your private details to anyone who sends you an email or links to unsecured websites .
Do not click on photos , videos or advertisements on unknown websites or social networking sites .
Ensure that you have a software protection against antivirus and antimalware installed on your computer devices and that it is kept up to date .
Be careful with public WiFi hotspots like at a coffee shop .
WiFi hotspots wo n’t have secure internet and inputting your personal information when connected can put your information at risk of being snooped by someone at the coffee shop .
Avoid Common Identity Theft Scams
The FBI has a great website dedicated to common fraud schemes .
Make sure you do n’t fall for them .
Always take any email or phone call you get with a grain of salt .
If someone asks you to deposit a check and then Western Union the money to somewhere in Africa , do n’t do it .
( Yes , people fall for this . )
If you receive a call from one of your financial institutions be sure to get off the phone quickly without giving away any identifying information , then look up the correct phone number online ( or on the back of your card ) and call back directly .
What To Do If You Think Your Identity Has Been Stolen
Think your identity has been stolen ?
Here are 3 steps to take :
Check Your Credit Report
If you fear your identity has been stolen — maybe you got a call from your credit card company about a bunch of fraudulent charges they caught — the first thing you need to do is to check your credit report .
There are many services that can help you keep tabs on your credit report :
AnnualCreditReport.com is a free website that the government required the credit bureaus to set up .
You are allowed one free credit report every 365 from each of the 3 credit bureaus .
The bureaus share information so there is usually no need to check all three reports at the same time .
If you spread out your free reports to once every four months , you ’ll be able to monitor your credit much more closely .
Identity Force – is an identity theft protection service .
They monitor all three of your credit reports , your credit score , and even the black market for personal information to make sure your identity is n’t compromised .

They monitor all three of your credit reports , your credit score , and even the black market for personal information to make sure your identity is n’t compromised .
Credit Karma is a free service that gives you not only a free credit report , but also a free credit score .
You ’ll be able to see if any accounts have been opened in your name and if any fraudulent accounts have late or missed payments which would bring down your credit score .

You ’ll be able to see if any accounts have been opened in your name and if any fraudulent accounts have late or missed payments which would bring down your credit score .
Credit Sesame is a service that lets you access a free credit report each month .
Plus , they help you find ways to save money on the loans you have and increase your credit score over time .
Once you have your report you need to review it to make sure that all of the accounts that are open on your report are actual accounts you opened .
If not , your identity has most likely been stolen and you ’ll need to take further steps .
Alert Your Financial Institutions
If you suspect your identity has been stolen you need to contact all of your financial institutions to let them know to put a fraud alert on your account .
That means you have to call every bank , credit union , and credit card company that you have accounts with .
You will also have to call the institutions where unauthorized accounts have been opened in your name and get them to close them .
Often they will require you to have a police report to be able do this .
Freeze Your Credit
Lastly , you can freeze your credit with each of the credit bureaus .
Experian has a good explanation of how to freeze your credit .
You normally have to pay a nominal fee to each credit bureau to lock down your credit report .
However , doing this will make it impossible for anyone — including you — to open new lines of credit in your name .
To get a new line of credit in the future you will have to pay another nominal fee to unlock your credit report .
This is a great way to keep your financial history safe .
It ca n’t prevent your personal information ( like social security number ) from being stolen , but it can make having that information useless because the identity thief can’t open up accounts in your name .

When can I stop taking parental IT calls ?
Having generously donated half your DNA , your pops is certainly entitled to some hand - holding as he navigates the frightening realms of Windows Vista and Facebook status updates .
But if you 're on the verge of jamming pencils into your frontal lobes , it 's time to cut the cable .
That does n't mean you need to go all unhelpful - IT - department on him ( " Sorry , that is not supported " ) .
Instead , says Laura Funk , a fellow at the University of Victoria 's Center on Aging , " gently suggest that your father take some basic computer workshops .
You could even offer to pay for them as a holiday present . "
Alternatively , on your next visit , walk dear old Dad through the basics of troubleshooting .
And bring along one of those " For Dummies " books .
Then drop the hammer :
If his hard drive starts screeching and smoking , sure , he can call .

We 'd definitely stay up extra late to watch that flick , but if that 's the kind of scenario you 're worried about , the news is bad : Federal law compels implant manufacturers to keep tabs on their wares , and doctors are forbidden from interfering with that requirement .
You may not buy the Man 's explanation , but this is ostensibly for your own safety ; if a batch of implants were found to be defective , would n't you want to know whether your melons were lemons ?
If you prefer to play things close to the chest , though , you need n't overshare with the manufacturer .
According to a spokesperson for implant maker Mentor , " A patient can always refuse to release her name , Social Security number , or other identifying information " ; the only things the company will know then are where and when you got the surgery .
And keep in mind , it 's not like those things are carrying RFID chips .
Sure , you could probably go overseas and find a shady surgeon willing to stuff your chest with bootleg implants .
( Rumor is that anything goes in Bangkok . )

What 's the rule of thumb on expired medicines ?
I just popped a past - its - prime Tylenol , and it seemed to work fine .
Are those expiration dates just a corporate racket ?
Drug companies do , indeed , tend to err on the side of caution — and they 're not exactly averse to selling you a new bottle of pills before your old one is empty .
A few years back , the FDA evaluated a US military stockpile of aging drugs and found that 90 percent were perfectly safe and effective past their expiration dates .
One of those medications , a remedy for nerve gas poisoning , still worked after sitting on a shelf for 15 years longer than recommended .
So yeah , that date on the bottle is certainly a conservative estimate and may even be a bit random .
But that does n't mean you should start popping pills from the Clinton era .
For starters , much depends on how they 've been stored — you 'll want to toss any that have been exposed to extreme temperatures and are crumbling into chalk .
More important , it 's best to confine your pharmaceutical gambles to situations in which there is n't a huge potential downside if the drug is n't effective .
If you take an old Tylenol and it does n't work , no worries — just buy a new pack .
But if you 're bound for the Amazon Basin , a fresh bottle of antimalarials is mandatory .
You can decide for yourself where Viagra falls on this spectrum .

Having been invited to lunch with Bernie Ecclestone on Tuesday , Pitpass business editor Chris Sylt asked editor ( in chief ? ? ? )
Chris Balfe if he had any questions for the F1 supremo .
In no time at all , Balfe had produced several hundred questions , among them the following : F1 cannot garner the passion and interest of football .
Why is this and might there be a time when F1 could incite such passion ?
On Wednesday night , Liverpool were beaten in an FA Cup replay by Reading just days after the mighty Manchester United were dumped by League One team Leeds United .
Indeed , that very night QPR - owned by Ecclestone and good mate Flavio Briatore - went out of the FA Cup to Sheffield United .
In the case of Liverpool and Manchester United , big teams were eliminated from a prestigious tournament by relative minnows , and it is these acts giant killing that not only makes the FA Cup what it is , but what football is all about .
It is the fact that one can never really predict what is going to happen in a match for the destiny rests with its participants , the players and , to a lesser extent the referee plus a little bit of magic from Lady Luck .
For the most part , the rules of football are straightforward and , like many other sports , have remained relatively untouched for as long as anyone can remember .
For some reason however , those that run Formula One - a sport which according to Sylt 's Formula Money has seen six car manufacturers invest £ 3.9bn in the last five years alone - continually tinker with the rules , an endless programme aimed , so they tell us , at improving the show .
Football does n't require a Goal Scoring Group , a board of ' experts ' whose job it is to find a way for more goals to be scored , yet F1 has an Overtaking Working Group the aim of which is to increase the amount of overtaking .
At the same time , Ecclestone comes up with ever sillier ideas to make F1 better be it changes to the points system , a medals based championship or even reversed grids .
However , his latest brainwave is perhaps the silliest of the lot .
The F1 supremo , in his desperation to see more overtaking is suggesting that tracks should feature shortcuts which would allow drivers to overtake their rivals .
" I 've tried to push the teams with a number of proposals , " he told reporters during a surprise visit to Ferrari 's media get together in the Dolomites yesterday .
“ It would be very easy for us , on each circuit , to have an area where you could gain a lot of time , so you could overtake .
A shortcut if you like , which a driver can use five times during a race , so it will stop people getting stuck behind somebody .
" It would be great for TV and good for commentators , who would talk about one driver with three short cuts left and another with two , " he added . ”
Ignoring the fact that most commentators find it hard enough to keep track as it is - no pun intended - one has to ask what the casual fan or newcomer might think of such an idea .
It was n't that long ago that Ecclestone and Mosley were telling us that in reality there had n't really been that much overtaking in the past , indeed , the former FIA president told us that pit stop strategy was the thing that really got fans excited .
The fact is that we do tend to remember those iconic overtaking manoeuvres , forgetting the many races - even during the golden era - that were essentially cars going round and round and round .
However , the fact remains that it is the modern aerodynamic regulations that prevent drivers overtaking these days , not to mention a points system - again introduced to manipulate the championship - that encourages drivers to hold station rather than going for it and Mickey Mouse tracks more about status , glitz and glamour than racing .
If at half - time during a QPR game , over a Bovril and warm pie , Ecclestone was to tell a group of QPR fans his ideas for spicing up football we have no doubt that they would soon tell him where to stick his little gimmick .
F1 fans , the teams and drivers should do likewise .
The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's :
SAN FRANCISCO ( Standard & Poor's ) Jan. 13 , 2010 -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services lowered to ' A - ' from ' A ' its ratings and underlying ratings ( SPURs ) on California 's $ 63.9 billion of general obligation ( GO ) debt , and to ' BBB + ' from ' A - ' its ratings and SPURs on the state 's $ 9.4 billion of
appropriation - backed lease revenue bonds .
We also lowered to ' A - ' from ' A ' our rating on the state 's $ 1.9 billion proposition 1A receivables program bonds , and to ' A - 2 ' from ' A - 1 ' our rating on the state 's $ 2 billion commercial paper ( CP ) program .
At the same time , we affirmed our ' SP - 1 ' short - term rating on the state 's $ 8.8 billion in revenue anticipation notes ( RANs ) .
The outlook is
negative .
Our ' A + ' ratings and SPURs on the state 's roughly $ 8.06 billion of sales tax - supported GO economic recovery bonds are not affected .
These ratings have a stable outlook .
The rating actions reflect our view of the state 's credit quality in light of its severe fiscal imbalance and the impending recurrence of a cash deficiency if the state 's revenue and spending trajectories continue .
With the recent release of his fiscal 2010 - 2011 budget proposal , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal emergency .
We understand that the governor seeks swift
adoption of $ 8.9 billion of the $ 19.9 billion of budget solutions in his proposal because if the legislature does not approve them by March 1 , the full amount of estimated savings may not be attainable .
The fiscal emergency declaration also reflects that forecasts of cash flows indicate the general fund will experience insufficient cash positions in March and July .
According to the Department of Finance ( DOF ) , adoption of the governor 's proposal , including a plan to supplement financial liquidity with an external borrowing , should improve the state 's cash position in July , although the DOF still expects a dearth of cash in March .
To cover the low cash period in March , the governor 's budget includes $ 1 billion in as - yet - undetermined cash solutions .
However , the projected cash position improves toward the end of fiscal 2010 even without approval of a budget revision , providing 3.2 x coverage of the $ 2.83 billion in RANs that mature in May and 2.02 x the $ 5.98 billion of RANs maturing in June .
We believe that , relative to the past fiscal year , uncertain assumptions for major portions of the budget balancing proposal make the state 's credit more susceptible to adverse economic or other developments .
Although the governor 's budget proposal seeks structural improvement to the state 's projected fiscal imbalance , it does so by assuming what we consider to be significant increases in federal reimbursements and funding ( $ 6.9 billion ) and reduced federal spending mandates -- provisions over which the state lacks singular or direct authority .
It also requires voter approval of two ballot
measures to allow the redirection of $ 1 billion in funds presently earmarked pursuant to two prior election results .
The budget proposal concurrently depends on a supermajority of state legislators agreeing to make vast cuts totaling $ 8.5 billion across a wide range of programs and agencies in addition to significant alternative funding ( $ 3.9 billion ) .
A trigger for even deeper cuts , including the outright elimination of CalWorks ( the state 's version of the federal temporary aid for needy families program ) and numerous other social service programs , is in the budget proposal in case the new federal funding is not forthcoming before July 15 , 2010 .
The trigger proposal also extends several previously adopted temporary tax increases that will phase out under existing law .
We believe these assumptions and the scope of the proposed solutions increase the state 's credit risk , particularly as it confronts redressing -- at least somewhat -- the existing budget for fiscal 2010 , which is significantly out of balance in our view .
From the middle of fiscal 2009 and into early fiscal 2010 , lawmakers addressed a cumulative budget gap of over $ 60 billion spanning the 18 months through June 2010 , relying extensively on nonrecurring solutions .
At its adoption , the amended fiscal 2010 budget assumed a balanced position for the year and , incorporating the expiration of the nonrecurring measures , projected a $ 7.4 billion shortfall in fiscal 2011 .
A number of the budget measures are not functioning as planned , contributing to a shortfall of $ 6.6 billion for the remainder of fiscal 2010 and building to a $ 12.3 billion projected deficit for fiscal 2011 .
These deficits represent 7.6 % and 12 % of total estimated budget expenses for fiscals 2010 and 2011 , respectively ( when measured as a portion
of the baseline workload budgets for each year as of July 2009 , when the fiscal 2010 budget amendment was adopted ) .
We believe the state 's options have narrowed considerably as the one - time measures and funding have lapsed .
In our view , the combination of fewer unconventional nonrecurring potential budget solutions , reliance on what we consider to be extraordinary federal cooperation , voter approval , and difficulty in achieving the legislative agreement to make deep cuts as proposed could impede meaningful and timely progress on a budget agreement .
The speed at which a budget stalemate among lawmakers could translate to a cash crisis depends to a large extent on the state 's economic and revenue performance , adding urgency to the state 's overall financial situation .
In our view , the following factors constrain the state 's credit quality , including :
-- Constitutional requirements for a two - thirds majority vote of the legislature for both budget approval and to increase taxes , which we believe complicates the former and effectively precludes the latter , given the legislature 's political composition ;
-- General fund revenue composition , which in our view is highly sensitive to economic and equity market performance ;
-- Existing and proposed constitutional amendments that limit discretion over major portions of general fund spending , especially when combined with federal maintenance of effort requirements ; and
-- Our Financial Management Assessment ( FMA ) , which at " standard " is the lowest of our state FMA scores .
We also believe the following factors underpin the current budget deficit while contributing to the difficulty of restoring balance in fiscal 2011 :
-- A reliance in the Amended 2009 Budget Act ( for fiscal 2010 ) on approximately $ 20 billion ( according to the state Legislative Analyst 's Office ) in nonrecurring or expiring budget solutions that are not available for the remainder of fiscal 2010 or 2011 ;
-- Numerous fiscal 2010 budget solutions representing $ 7.2 billion of revenue or savings that either failed to materialize , eroded , or succumbed to legal challenges ( many of which remain ongoing ) ; and
-- Upward pressure on spending due to current and projected population and caseload growth combined with a lowered revenue forecast , adding $ 4.8 billion to the projected deficit .
Despite its problematic areas , we believe the state 's budget and finances benefit from a number of attributes , including :
-- Indications of economic stabilization and revenue performance that have held up reasonably well compared with the state 's budget assumptions , with general fund cash collections just 0.9 % below budget assumptions for the fiscal year as of December 2009 , according to the state controller ;
--
The state controller 's demonstrated willingness and authority to exercise what we consider to be extraordinary cash management maneuvers that protect the state 's priority payments , including those for debt service ;
-- Modest structural reform adopted in the Amended 2009 Budget Act ( for fiscal 2010 ) that eliminated statutes providing for automatic inflationary cost - of - living adjustments in the annual budget process for some social services and state employee salaries ( with an estimated value of $ 590 million in fiscal 2011 ) ; and
-- A budget structure that assumes that the less - certain revenues and budget savings will occur late in fiscal 2010 , coinciding with the stronger phase of the state 's annual cash flow cycle , thereby mitigating and delaying the impact of their not materializing .
Longer - term credit attributes of the state include our view of :
--
The magnitude and diversity of its economy , which accounts for nearly 13 % of U.S. GDP and covers a broad array of industries ;
--
An educated workforce that , if sustained , can attract firms in progressive sectors and make California a leading venture capital recipient state ; and
-- A conservatively structured , albeit growing , debt burden .
Serving as the source of repayment for all of the GO bonds and CP is the state 's general fund , which the state has pledged under its full faith and credit .
The public school system and public institutions of higher education are the state 's only obligations that have a higher priority than debt service payments .
The state 's lease and appropriation - backed debt are among its other
priority payments that fall behind payments for education and GO bonds .
As noted , the CP is a general obligation of the state 's credit and the state is authorized to issue CP notes on an interim basis in lieu of approved but unissued GO bonds .
The CP also has security from a letter of credit ( LOC ) agreement , which includes provisions limiting the state to $ 2 billion in notes outstanding at any given time , provided severally from a consortium of banks .
However , because the lowest - rated bank is Bayerische Landesbank ( NR ) , Standard & Poor 's does not incorporate the LOC into the rating at this time .
The CP rating ( A - 2 ) is therefore based solely on the higher - rated support , that of the State of California ( A - / Negative ) .
Debt service on the proposition 1A bonds takes priority over other obligations of the state , subject only to prior and constitutionally required payments for
S&P Lowers Various California
Debt schools and debt service on the state 's GO bonds .
Authorization of legislation for the bonds also provides for a continuing resolution so that late budget adoption by the state will not impair semiannual interest payments , which are due on June 15 and Dec. 15 each year , or the principal payment , due on June 15 , 2013 .
The state 's RANs are unsecured obligations of the general fund , subject to prior claims for schools , GO debt service , repayment of internal loans , wages and benefits payments , and lease payments supporting the state 's lease revenue bonds .
Although the proposed state budget projects , assuming its adoption , that revenue in fiscals 2010 and 2011 will exceed expenses , the state 's finances must also absorb the prior - year deficit of almost $ 6 billion carried into fiscal 2010 .
Prior - and current - year deficits , according to existing budget law , underlie the general fund 's cumulative cash deficit , which is currently $ 24.8 billion , according to the state controller .
A combination of internal ( $ 16 billion ) and external ( $ 8.8 billion ) borrowing provide interim financial liquidity to the state 's general fund , according to the controller .
As during the prior fiscal year , we believe the state 's constitutionally based and ,
relative to most other states , high requisite consensus among lawmakers to adopt a budget could put the state on course for another budget negotiation stalemate .
Until legislators and the governor reach agreement on a budget revision , cash outflow will continue in accordance with existing law , unless the controller utilizes his extraordinary discretion to adjust the timing of the cash disbursements .
Absent a change to the current budget , we expect that disbursements relative to cash receipts would very nearly deplete the state 's general fund and borrowable cash resources in March , with the potential for an even weaker cash position in July .
We believe that these challenges , when combined with a reliance on federal funding and consent for relief from certain spending requirements , separate California 's credit quality today from that of the prior fiscal year and of other states , all of which have higher GO or issuer credit ratings as a result .
We nonetheless believe the state controller 's demonstrated capacity ( in fiscals 2009 and 2010 ) to exert control over the timing of certain cash outflows helps protect the state 's ability to meet its priority obligations , including its debt service .
This quality of the state as a sovereign entity partially underscores our view of the state 's fundamental credit quality , which we generally view as strong even if strained .
At its core , and absent the infusion of new federal funding sought by the state , adopting a balanced budget as mandated by the state constitution requires that lawmakers consider a mix of spending cuts or revenue increases .
In our view , either cutting spending or increasing taxes could potentially subdue the incipient economic recovery underway in the state .
We recognize that portions of recent budget solutions for fiscal 2010 included deferrals , furloughs , and revenue shifting from local governments .
However , these often have a similar economic effect as outright spending reductions .
Providing some offset to this are the governor 's proposals for $ 700 million of job training funding and first - time homebuyer tax credits .
If the $ 500 million job training program works as envisioned by the DOF , it will increase employment , particularly among those unemployed for nine months or more , by 100,000 throughout the state , which has lost approximately 1 million jobs since the recession began .
According to the state 's Employment Development Department , the unemployment rate was 12.3 % as of December 2009 , well above the national rate of 10 % as of January 2010 .
Two constitutional provisions outline California 's ability to service its debt from a budget and cash flow perspective .
Proposition 98 , passed by voters in 1988 , establishes the required minimum funding level for K - 14 institutions ( kindergarten through community college ) , with an estimated cost to the general fund of $ 36.09 billion in fiscal 2011 .
Meeting this requirement would leave $ 49.2 billion to fund an estimated $ 6.15 billion in GO and appropriation - backed debt service .
Debt service represents what we consider a low 7.4 % of total budgeted expenses but a more moderate 13 % after adjusting for the proposition 98 funding requirement .
The constitution separately establishes the state 's required priority payments for education , which includes public higher education institutions ( the California State University and University of California systems ) as well as K - 14 education .
For 2011 , the required education payments that enjoy a priority status , according to the proposed budget , total approximately $ 40.5 billion , and debt service therefore
represents 14.5 % of the remaining $ 45 billion budget .
OUTLOOK
The negative outlook reflects our concerns about the large structural projected budget deficits facing the state and their implications for the state 's cash position .
Following a year in which the state grappled with a more than $ 60 billion deficit , we think the current deficit of approximately $ 19 billion could be more difficult to resolve given the state 's extensive reliance on nonrecurring measures in the prior budget cycle .
We believe indications of economic stabilization suggest that a recovery , if underway , remains precarious .
Furthermore , if economic or revenue trends substantially falter , we could lower the state rating during the next six to 12 months .
In this environment , the state 's ability and willingness to raise revenues or reduce expenditures through tax increases or program reductions could become integral to maintaining credit quality because a significant delay could result in another episode of cash deficiency for the general fund .
We remain concerned that the political process could impede timely solutions .
The absence of timely action could result in our lowering the GO rating .
On the other hand , if revenue performance is in our view adequate relative to budget assumptions and if lawmakers reach agreement on a reliable set of solutions in a timely manner , we could revise the outlook to stable .
GOVERNMENT REFORM AND VOTER INITIATIVES
We recognize that numerous government and budget reform initiatives are underway and in the public discourse .
Although we incorporate the implications of each when assessing whether they have a material impact on credit , we observe that their cumulative effect has complicated and reduced discretion over the state 's fiscal management .
We estimate that because of a combination of constitutional amendments , provisions , or federal maintenance of effort
requirements , there is limited discretion for approximately 65 % of general fund expenditures , absent what we consider to be extraordinary action in the course of budget adoption .

There has been an ongoing “ re-evaluation ” of Green Party policy around scientific evidence recently .
This came about mainly due to a few journalists helpfully letting us know that there was some deeply dodgy stuff in policy .
It certainly came as a shock to many of us who had not thoroughly read our voluminous policy documents .
This conference saw the first swath of re-orientating our policy on a more science friendly footing .
We passed the motion on abolition of the science pledge – a policy so offensive to scientists and ‘ technologists ’ that it makes me wince just to think of it .
Anyway , it ’s gone .
Hurray .
This was quickly followed by the passing of the science chapter enabling motion which means that the party has officially endorsed a review and rewrite of our entire science and technology section of the PSS , our core policy document .
That ’s going to take some hard work and we ’ll be looking for people both inside and outside of the party to help us with that process .
Health
The headlines in this are that we state that we “ will not make judgements on individual treatments or medicines ” as that is the job of regulators and scientists which replaced a very specific and somewhat rigid list of treatments we , apparently , like in favour of others .
We have removed the idea that health research will have a “ particular emphasis ” on “ holistic treatments ” and “ complementary therapies ” .
We removed the statement that “ vivisection is of questionable value and incompatible with ecological philosophy ” replacing it with a section calling for “ a thorough evaluation of animal tests ” which seems difficult to disagree with as it happens already .
We previously had the difficult situation where we appeared to state that alternative therapies did not require the same kind of regulation as more conventional medicines .
Conference amended this to ensure that all medicines are properly regulated and subjected to the same controls “ based on the best clinical evidence available ” .
We also deleted a long section on “ natural medicines ” , whatever they might be .
Bizarrely , we did have a policy that opposed some stem cell research ( but not using adult stem cells ) and appeared to be , and maybe even was , the sort of thing George W. might have approved of .
This was also problematic because it clashed with our 100 % pro-choice agenda on abortion .
Now the policy reads that we look to the “ benefits to humans and other animals from stem cell technologies , using both adult and embryonic cellular material .
These benefits include direct medical advances , improved non-animal testing methods for new medical treatments , and the advancement of knowledge . ”
Animals
As a last part of this process this conference we also took a look at the animal rights section and although the motion , C9 , that I proposed was not passed the animal experimentation policy has been improved by removing direct reference to “ scientific ” grounds for opposing animal experimentation and the rather blanket reference to “ superior non-animal technologies ” which implied all animal tests had an already existing superior alternative that did not involve harm to animals .
However , my ambition to strip out all reference to scientific grounds for opposition to animal testing was not approved by conference .
I had hoped to stick to the ethics of animal rights within this section and leave the policy on the utility of animal testing to the health section , which seemed more appropriate , but I think members thought this was a step too far and they wanted policy to reassure them they were objectively right on a moral stance .
I ’m determined to see the positives of this but secretly I ’m gutted at this ( single ) conference defeat .
When push comes to shove the Green Party has made great strides forwards at this conference and the focus is now to pull apart the science policy and make sure it ’s strong , evidence based and relevant to a campaigning political party that wants to see progressive change .
All help much appreciated .
j Query 1.4 was recently released .
This was n't simply a maintenance release as some had speculated ; there are many new features , enhancements and performance improvements included in 1.4 !
This post covers the new features and enhancements that you may find beneficial .
You can download jQuery 1.4 right now , here : http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.js
1. Passing Attributes to jQuery ( … )
Pre 1.4 , jQuery supported adding attributes to an element collection via the useful " attr " method , which can be passed both an attribute name and value , or an object specifying several attributes .
j Query 1.4 adds support for passing an attributes object as the second argument to the jQuery function itself , upon element creation .
Let 's say you need to create an anchor element with several attributes .
With 1.4 it's as simple as :
You may have noticed the " text " attribute — you 'll probably be wondering what that 's doing there , after all there 's no " text " attribute for anchors !
Well , jQuery 1.4 utilises its very own methods when you pass certain attributes .
So the " text " attribute specified above would cause jQuery to call the " .text ( ) " method , passing " Go to Google ! " as its only argument .
A better example of this in action :
The " id " is added as a regular attribute , but the " css " and " click " properties trigger calling of each respective method .
The above code , before the 1.4 release , would have been written like this :
Read more about jQuery ( … )
2. Everything " until " !
Three new methods have been added to the DOM traversal arsenal in 1.4 , " nextUntil " , " prevUntil " and " parentsUntil " .
Each of these methods will traverse the DOM in a certain direction until the passed selector is satisfied .
So , let 's say you have a list of fruit :
You want to select all of items after " Apple " , but you want to stop once you reach " Strawberry " .
It could n't be simpler :
Read more about : prevUntil , nextUntil , parentsUntil
3. Binding Multiple Event Handlers
Instead of chaining a bunch of event binding methods together , you can lump them all into the same call , like so :
This also works with " .one ( ) " .

4. Per -Property Easing
Instead of just defining one easing function for a single animation , you can now define a different easing function for each property that you 're animating .
jQuery includes two easing functions , swing ( the default ) and linear .
For other ones you 'll need to download them separately !
To specify an easing function for each property simply define the property as an array , with the first value being what you want to animate that property to , and the second being the easing function to use :
See this code in action !
You can also define per-property easing functions in the optional options object as property name - value pairs in the " specialEasing " object :
Editor 's Note -
The author of this article , James Padolsey , is being modest .
This new feature was his idea !

5. New Live Events !
j Query 1.4 adds support for delegating the " submit " , " change " , " focus " and " blur " events .
In jQuery , we use the " .live ( ) " method to delegate events .
This is useful when you have to register event handlers on many elements , and when new elements may be added over time ( using " .live ( ) " is less - costly than re-binding continually ) .
But , be careful !
You must use the event names , " focusin " and " focusout " if you want to delegate the " focus " and " blur " events !
6. Controlling a Function 's Context
j Query 1.4 provides a new " proxy " function under the jQuery namespace .
This function takes two arguments , either a " scope " and a method name , or a function and the intended scope .
JavaScript's " this " keyword can be quite tricky to keep a hold of .
Sometimes you wo n't want it to be an element , but instead an object that you 've previously created .
For example , here we 've got an " app " object which has two properties , a " clickHandler " method and a config object :
The " clickHandler " method , when called like " app.clickHandler ( ) " will have " app " as its context , meaning that the " this " keyword will allow it access to " app " .
This works quite well if we simply call :
Let 's try binding it as an event handler :
When we click an anchor it does n't appear to work ( nothing is alerted ) .
That 's because jQuery ( and most sane event models ) will , by default , set the context of the handler as the target element , - that is , the element that 's just been clicked will be accessible via " this " .
But we do n't want that , we want " this " to be set to " app " .
Achieving this in jQuery 1.4 could n't be simpler :
Now whenever an anchor is clicked , " Hi ! " will be alerted !
The proxy function returns a " wrapped " version of your function , with " this " set to whatever you specify .
It 's useful in other contexts too , such as passing callbacks to other jQuery methods , or to plugins .

7. Delay an Animation Queue
You can now add a delay to your animation queues .
In fact , this works on any queue , but its most common use case will probably be with the " fx " queue .
This allows you to pause between animations without having to mess with callbacks and calls to " setTimeout " .
The first argument to " .delay ( ) " is the amount of milliseconds you want to delay for .
If you want to delay a queue other than the default " fx " queue , then you 'll need to pass the queue name as the second argument to " .delay ( ) " .
Read more about .delay ( … )
8. Check if an Element Has Something
j Query 1.4 makes it easy to check if an element ( or collection ) " .has ( ) " something .
This is the programmatic equivalent to jQuery 's selector filter , " : has ( ) " .
This method will select all elements in the current collection that contain at least one element that complies with the passed selector .
That would select all DIV elements that contain UL elements .
In this situation you 'd probably just use the selector filter ( " : has ( ) " ) , but this method is still useful when you need to filter a collection programmatically .
j Query 1.4 also reveals the " contains " function under the jQuery namespace .
This is a low - level function that accepts two DOM nodes .
It 'll return a boolean indicating whether the second element is contained within the first element .
E.g .
Read more about : .has (… ) , jQuery.contains (… )
9. Unwrap Elements !
We 've had the " . wrap ( ) " method for a while now .
j Query 1.4 adds the " .unwrap ( ) " method which does the complete opposite .
If we assume the following DOM structure :
We can unwrap the paragraph element like so :
The resulting DOM structure would be :
Essentially , this method simply removes the parent of any element .
Read more about .unwrap (…)
10 . Remove Elements Without Deleting Data
The new " .detach ( ) " method allows you to remove elements from the DOM , much like the " .remove ( ) " method .
The key difference with this new method is that it does n't destroy the data held by jQuery on that element .
This includes data added via " .data ( ) " and any event handlers added via jQuery 's event system .
This can be useful when you need to remove an element from the DOM , but you know you 'll need to add it back at a later stage .
Its event handlers and any other data will persist .
Read more about . detach ( … )
11. index (…) Enhancements
j Query 1.4 gives you two new ways to use the " .index ( ) " method .
Previously , you could only pass an element as its argument and you 'd expect a number to be returned indicating the index of that element within the current collection .
Passing no arguments now returns the index of an element amongst its siblings .
So , assuming the following DOM structure :
When a list item is clicked you want to find out the index of the clicked element amongst all the other list items .
It 's as simple as :
j Query 1.4 also allows you to specify a selector as the first argument to " .index ( ) " , doing so will give you the index of the current element amongst the collection produced from that selector .
You should note that what 's returned from this method is an integer , and it will return - 1 if the selector / element passed cannot be found in the document .
Read more about .index ( … )
12 . DOM Manipulation Methods Accept Callbacks
Most of the DOM manipulation methods now support passing a function as the sole argument ( or second , in the case of " .css ( ) " & " .attr ( ) " ) .
This function will be run on every element in the collection to determine what should be used as the real value for that method .
The following methods have this capability :
Within the callback function , you 'll have access to the current element in the collection via " this " and its index via the first argument .
Also , with some of the above methods you 'll also get a second argument .
If you 're calling a setter method ( like " .html ( ) " or " .attr ( ' href ) " ) you 'll have access to the current value .
E.g .
As you can see , with the " .css ( ) " and " .attr ( ) " methods , you would pass the function as the second argument , since the first would be used to name the property you wish to change :
13 . Determine the Type of Object
j Query 1.4 adds two new helper functions ( stored directly under the jQuery namespace ) that help you determine what type of object you 're dealing with .
First , there 's " isEmptyObject " , this function returns a boolean indicating whether or not the the passed object is empty ( devoid of properties - direct and inherited ) .
Second , there 's " isPlainObject " , which will return a boolean indicating whether the passed object is a plain JavaScript object , that is , one created via " {} " or " new Object ( ) " .
Read more about : isPlainObject (… ) , isEmptyObject (…)
14 . Closest (…) Enhancements
jQuery's " .closest ( ) " method now accepts an array of selectors .
This is useful when you want to traverse the ancestors of an element , looking for ( more than one ) closest elements with certain characteristics .
In addition , it now accepts a context as the second argument , meaning that you can control just how far or how close you want the DOM traversed to .
Both of these enhancements accommodate rare use cases but they are used internally to great effect !
Read more about .closest (…)
15 . New Events !
focusIn and focusOut
As mentioned , to delegate the " focus " and " blur " events you must use these new events , called " focusin " and " focusout " .
These events allow you to take action when an element , or a descendant of an element , gains focus .
You should also note that both of these events do not propagate ( " bubble " ) ; they are captured .
This means that the outermost ( ancestor ) element will be triggered before the causal " target " element .
Read more about the focusIn and focusOut events .

Three churches were fire bombed in the Malaysian capital early Friday escalating religious tensions over the use of word “ Allah ” by non-Muslims , as government and opposition leaders joined to defuse the situation .
As the majority Muslims angered over the decision last week by the High Court to let Christians use the word “ Allah ” while referring to God were preparing to hold protest during Friday prayers , a church in the suburbs was fire bombed around midnight .
The entire ground floor office of the Metro Tabernacle Church in Desa Melawati was gutted .
Molotov cocktails were thrown into the compounds of two other churches , the Assumption Catholic Church and the Life Chapel Protestant Church in Petaling Jaya , causing damage to one of them .
Police said some motorcycle borne youths were seen throwing incendiary objects inside before fleeing .
Following the incidents , police beefed up security around all religious places as the Prime Minister Najib Razak condemned the attacks and directed the police to safeguard all religious places .
“ I condemn these attacks .
These incident destroy unity at a time when multi-religion is a way of life in our country .
We will do all we can to prevent this ” , Mr. Razak said .
Inspector General of Police Musa Hassan said he had received number of calls of church leaders saying they were being threatened . ”
I have asked police cars to patrol all areas near the churches ” .

Srinagar
A belief that Jesus survived the crucifixion and spent his remaining years in Kashmir has led to a run-down shrine in Srinagar making it firmly onto the must - visit - in India tourist trail .
Jesus is reputed to be buried in this run-down shrine in the Kashmir capital
In the backstreets of downtown Srinagar is an old building known as the Rozabal shrine .
It 's in a part of the city where the Indian security forces are on regular patrol , or peering out from behind check - posts made of sandbags .
There are still occasional clashes with militants or stone - throwing children , but the security situation has improved in recent times and the tourists are returning .
When I first searched for Rozabal two years ago , the taxi circled around a minor Muslim tomb in a city of many mosques and mausoleums , the driver asking directions several times before we found it .
The shrine , on a street corner , is a modest stone building with a traditional Kashmiri multi-tiered sloping roof .
A watchman led me in and encouraged me to inspect the smaller wooden chamber within , with its trellis - like , perforated screen .
Through the gaps I could see a gravestone covered with a green cloth .
When I returned to the shrine recently though , it was shut - its gate padlocked because it had attracted too many visitors .
The reason ?
Well , according to an eclectic combination of New Age Christians , unorthodox Muslims and fans of the Da Vinci Code , the grave contains the mortal remains of a candidate for the most important visitor of all time to India .
' Crazy professor '
Officially , the tomb is the burial site of Youza Asaph , a medieval Muslim preacher - but a growing number of people believe that it is in fact the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth .
They believe that Jesus survived the crucifixion almost 2,000 Easters ago , and went to live out his days in Kashmir .
" What else could they do ?
They had to close it , " Riaz told me .
His family home almost overlooks the shrine , and he is witheringly dismissive of the notion that Jesus was buried there .
" It 's a story spread by local shopkeepers , just because some crazy professor said it was Jesus 's tomb .
They thought it would be good for business .
Tourists would come , after all these years of violence .
" And then it got into the Lonely Planet , and too many people started coming .
" And one foreigner " he gave me an apologetic look , " broke off a bit from the tomb to take home with him .
So that 's why it 's closed now . "
On cue , a couple of unwashed and exhausted Australians appeared , carrying the latest edition of the Lonely Planet travel guide to India , which , sure enough , carried the tale of Jesus 's tomb , with some caveats about crackpots and blasphemy .
They asked me to take a photo of them outside the shrine - but were not desperately disappointed that it was closed .
The tomb of Jesus was just another place to tick off on their tourist - in - India must - visit list .
Famous meeting
The remains of a Buddhist monastery which some believe Jesus visited
The ruins of a Buddhist monastery in a spectacular location halfway up a mountainside north of Srinagar are not , yet , mentioned in the Lonely Planet .
It 's a spot that I had previously been unable to visit , because as a senior police officer told me , it was " infested with terrorists " .
But the watchman now seemed prepared for the arrival of mass tourism , with his 50 words of English , and his hidden stock of ancient terracotta tiles for sale .
He informed me that Jesus was among the religious leaders who attended a famous Buddhist meeting here in AD80 , and even pointed to the place where he sat .
The stories of Jesus in India are not just aimed at gullible tourists - they date back to the 19th Century .
They were part of attempts to explain the striking similarities between Christianity and Buddhism , a matter of great concern to 19th Century scholars - and also a desire among some Christians to root the story of Jesus in Indian soil .
Missing years
There is talk of the missing years of Jesus , unmentioned in the gospels , when he was between the ages of 12 and 30 .
Christians form a little more than 2 % of India 's population Some say he was in India , picking up Buddhist ideas .
These are n't notions that have entirely died out .
The US - based Christian sect , known as the Church Universal and Triumphant , is the best - known modern supporter of the belief that Jesus lived in Kashmir , though they do n't believe he died there .
And in Islam , in which Jesus is the penultimate prophet , there is also a minority tradition adopted by the controversial Ahmadiyya sect , that Rozabal does contain the grave of Jesus .
Professional historians tend to laugh out loud when you mention the notion that Jesus might have lived in Kashmir - but his tomb is now firmly on the tourist trail - and a growing number of credulous visitors believe that he was buried in the Rozabal shrine .
And for those who scoff , remember that others have argued , just as implausibly , that Jesus came to Britain .
A theory that was much in vogue when the poet William Blake famously asked : " And did those feet in ancient time , walk upon England 's mountains green ?
And was the holy Lamb of God on England 's pleasant pastures seen ? "

A military judge Friday rejected a defense request to throw out charges against the last Marine accused in the killing of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in 2005 .
The judge , Lt. Col.
David Jones , had ruled Tuesday it was possible that two generals who brought charges against Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich had been subject to what the military calls undue command influence .
But Friday , Jones ruled that he saw no indication of actual influence on Gen. James Mattis or retired Lt. Gen. Samuel Helland .
Both , he said , conducted an “ unbiased assessment ” of the case before sending charges .
Mattis sent charges to a preliminary hearing in December 2006 .
Helland sent the case to a court - martial a year later , after that hearing .

In making his Tuesday ruling , Jones said the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no undue influence existed .
In turning down the defense request Friday , the judge ruled that prosecutors had “ overwhelmingly ” met that burden .
Wuterich ’s court - martial is set for Sept. 13 on a variety of charges , including manslaughter , aggravated assault , dereliction of duty , reckless endangerment and obstruction of justice .
He remains on active duty .
The 30 - year - old from Connecticut is the only Marine still facing charges .
He showed no emotion after the ruling .
Wuterich told Jones that he preferred to have a jury composed of Marines ; by Marine law , the jury will have at least one - third enlisted personnel .
He could have opted to have a trial by a military judge .

“ I ’m actually happy to see there is a trial date and that this will be over soon , ” Wuterich told reporters . " . . .
It ’s been a tough five years , seeing everybody else exonerated . ”
Wuterich is attached to a battalion responsible for billeting , contracting and maintenance .
He served briefly as an instructor in Twentynine Palms , Calif. , for Marines bound for combat duty in Afghanistan .
He has asked to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan , but been rejected .
Charges have been dropped against six Marines ; one was acquitted .
The enlisted Marines were accused in the killings and the officers were charged with failing to launch a war crimes investigation .
Faced with similar issues of alleged undue influence , another judge ruled differently , leading to the dropping of dereliction - of - duty charges against Lt. Col.
Jeffrey Chessani , the battalion commander .

Wuterich was the squad leader on Nov. 19 , 2005 , when Marines killed five Iraqis in the street and 19 others in three homes while searching for insurgents who may have been involved in detonating a roadside bomb that killed one Marine and injured two others .
The accusations of undue command influence arose because a Marine lawyer who was part of an initial investigation into the killings later sat in on meetings in which the case was discussed .
But there was no evidence the lawyer who was at the meeting to discuss other legal cases ever discussed the Haditha case at such meetings , Jones ruled .
“ There was no chilling effect , ” Jones said .
“ The court must deal with facts , not conjecture . ”

Jones ruled that prosecutors did a better job in rebutting the undue influence charges in the Wuterich case than with Chessani .
Neal Puckett , one of Wuterich ’s lawyers , said he is confident that a jury composed of combat veterans will understand the pressures placed on young Marines .

This is n’t the first time the fashion house has featured homoerotic content in its advertising .
Dolce & Gabbana came under fire in 2006 for a Super Bowl ad featuring two men kissing .
When airing the ad was challenged , the Advertising Standards Authority declared , “ We did not consider that a kiss between two men automatically made an ad unacceptable for broadcast or that the kiss was in itself grounds for imposing a stricter timing restriction . ”
Super Bowl ad :
SACRAMENTO , Feb. 17 ( UPI ) --
A billboard near Sacramento promoting atheism was vandalized by someone depicting atheists as lost , one of the billboard 's sponsor said .
The billboard -- one of several posted in the Sacramento area -- originally read : " Are you good without God ? Millions are . "
Someone spray - painted the words " also lost ? " beneath " millions are , " CBS13 reported Tuesday .

Rachael Harrington of the Sacramento Area Coalition of Reason -- which paid to have the billboards put up -- said the ads are intended to let atheists and agnostics know they are not alone , the TV station said .
" This shows loud and clear just how necessary our message is , because prejudice against people who do n't believe in a god remains very real in America , " Harrington said .
The organization has asked Clear Channel , the company that owns the billboard , to file a police report .
The company offered to replace the sign free of charge , Harrington told the TV station .
A preschool student at a Catholic school in Boulder will not be allowed to return next school year because the student ’s parents are two women and the Denver Archdiocese says their homosexual relationship violates the school ’s beliefs and policy .
According to teachers at Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School , a meeting was held Tuesday to discuss the issue .
The staff was told a student would not be allowed to re-enroll because of his or her parents ’ sexual orientation .
The staff members were also told not to talk to the media .
In a statement sent to 9NEWS , the Archdiocese said , “ No person shall be admitted as a student in any Catholic school unless that person and his / her parent ( s ) subscribe to the school ’s philosophy and agree to abide by the educational policies and regulations of the school and Archdiocese , ” the statement said .
Because this student ’s parents are homosexual , the Archdiocese says they were in clear violation of the school ’s policy .
According to legal experts , it is legal for the Archdiocese to deny a student enrollment at the private school because of the school ’s policy .

Phase Change Material Could Cool Houses
MIT 's Technology Review reports on paraffin wax capsules could use the cold of evening to cool rooms in the day .
Building materials that absorb heat during the day and release it at night , eliminating the need for air - conditioning in some climates , will soon be on the market in the United States .
The North Carolina company National Gypsum is testing drywall sheets -- the plaster panels that make up the walls in most new buildings -- containing capsules that absorb heat to passively cool a building .
The capsules , made by chemical giant BASF , can be incorporated into a range of construction materials and are already found in some products in Europe .
This wo n't help much so much where the difference in day and night temperatures is small .
But desert areas get very cool at night .
So this approach would work well for these areas .
What I wonder :
Does the paraffin increase the flammability of the walls in a fire ?
One could also use a similar approach to make use of lower night rates for electricity .
Run an air conditioner or ground sink heat pump at night and use it to cool a compound from liquid to solid phase at night .
Then blow home air over the solid during the day to cool it .
Pricing of electricity by time of day and even by level of demand would provide more incentive to implement storage systems for heat and cool .
Changes in utility regulatory policies to change electricity pricing based on supply and demand would encourage greater use of materials for storing cool and heat .
Keepers brave cold to gather information to be used as part of worldwide conservation effort
Officials at London zoo today began the mandatory annual count of the zoo 's population today , with keepers braving the cold to tot up more than 750 different species .
" We need to know not just how many animals we 've got , but also who we 've got , " the zoological director , David Field , said .
Field said the information would be used as part of a worldwide conservation effort because some of the zoo 's animals are critically endangered species .
" Some of the animals are extinct in the wild , like our socorro doves , " he explained .
" The mountain chicken frogs are going extinct as we speak , and it 's so important that we know exactly how many we 've got , how many we 've bred and who has bred who . "
Officials expect the count to last a week , with the total population set to be marginally higher than the 14,567 recorded last year .
However , keepers in charge of the zoo 's invertebrate population – 7,510 , according to last year 's figures – get some respite by not always having to count individuals .
" What we do with ants and some of the invertebrates is that we count colonies , " Field said .
" Although we have a good estimate of how many are in the colony , there 's a little bit of cheating that goes on there . "
New exhibits mean some animals will be logged for the first time this week .
Recent additions to the zoo's population will be counted with varying degrees of difficulty and caution – newcomers include three Galapagos tortoises , two aardvarks , a pack of coatis and some porcupines .
Two lion cubs , the first born at the zoo in a decade , are among the most prized youngsters .
In a 32 - page filing with the FCC last week , AT&T asked that the requirement that it support a landline network be repealed .
It 's an aggressive bid to get rid of the cumbersome wall jack and move entirely to VoIP .

An all - IP phone network may be inevitable someday , but AT&T is clearly hoping for that day to be as soon as possible .
Landlines are less efficient and more expensive to maintain for the carrier , and do n't add much consumer benefit either .
Unfortunately , AT&T 's filing does n't account for the 20 % of Americans who currently use only landline connections , and there 's no way the FCC is going to leave one in five taxpayers twisting in the wind .
The migration seems to be happening naturally anyway : according to GigaOM , total interstate and intrastate switched access minutes have fallen 42 % from 2000 to 2008 .

The Viennese pride themselves on having turned back the Ottoman invasion of Europe at the city ’s gates after a famous 1529 siege .
But these days there ’s a new threat coming from the East : billions of dollars in potentially bad loans Austrian banks gave out to their former Communist neighbors .
Austrian banks have outstanding loans in Central and Eastern Europe totaling some € 200 billion Euros ( $ 273 billion ) , an amount equal to 70 percent of their country ’s gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
With the world financial crisis hitting that region particularly hard , there have been fears that a tidal wave of bad loans could overwhelm Austria ’s banks , possibly pulling the country itself into bankruptcy .
The government here has already spent € 100 billion ( $ 137 billion ) to shore up its banks , guaranteeing loans and refilling their depleted coffers .
In December , it nationalized Hypo Group Alpe Adria , a Klagenfurt - based regional bank overwhelmed by bad loans to clients in the Balkans , for fear a collapse would endanger the rest of the sector .
In the event of a regional meltdown , it is unclear if Austria has the resources to save its highly exposed banks .
“ We do n’t yet know exactly how the East European countries will overcome the crisis , because they got hit very strongly , ” says Franz Hahn , a financial macroeconomist at the Austrian Institute of Economic Research .
“ Everything is happening in the dark , so we can only hope that there is n’t a monster hiding there . ”
Through the 1980s , Austria ’s banks were sleepy places in a city on the periphery of European events .
But the collapse of the Soviet Empire changed all that , opening new opportunities in lands that were once part of Imperial Austria ’s empire .
Austria ’s banks moved in a big way , taking advantage of their cultural , historical , and geographic proximity to seize an outsized share of the banking opportunities in Hungary , Czechoslovakia , Poland , Slovenia , and other countries .
The bankers boldly invested in the region ’s many unmet needs , providing loans to manufacturers and real estate developers and buying up local banks , where they introduced East European customers to credit cards , mortgages , ATM cards , and small business loans .
But many of those investments became vulnerable when crisis swept the world financial system in the wake of the collapse of New York - based Lehman Brothers in September 2008 .
Hungary and Latvia had to be rescued from national bankruptcy by the International Monetary Fund , export orders plummeted , national currencies weakened against the Euro , and the newly jobless fell behind on their mortgage and credit card payments .
Austria ’s banks have been under close watch ever since , with some recalling that a similar chain of events brought down Vienna ’s Creditanstalt in 1931 , an event widely credited with sparking the Great Depression .
In the spring of last year , analysts were warning that Austria was itself at risk for national bankruptcy , including Nobel laureate Paul Krugman .
Last July , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that the financial system was still at risk from its exposure in Eastern Europe and that contingency plans “ should be kept at the ready to deal with any downside risks . ”
But even in the aftermath of the latest bank nationalization , some experts are now cautiously optimistic that the worst will not come to pass .
“ The fear was that this region would be like Asia in 1997 , a crisis that would bring everything down , ” says Krzysztof Rybinski of the Warsaw School of Economics .
“ Those fears have been completely overblown . ”
Indeed , Austria ’s banks say the situation has always been less dire than supposed .
The region , they point out , did not have a financial crisis of its own , but rather has been suffering from the economic downturn .
“ We do n’t have a problem with toxic assets , ” says Michael Mauritz , a spokesperson at Erste Bank Group , which controls subsidiary banks throughout the region .
“ The banks finance the real economy : real people and real companies that produced real goods .
There are no fancy products . ”
“ The problem we face now is that consumption and production are going down , ” Mauritz adds .
“ But dealing with a downturn in an economic cycle is what we are here to do . ”
“ The situation regarding the Austrian banks ’ exposure in Central and Eastern Europe was exaggerated , ” says Raiffeisen International spokesperson Michael Palzer .
“ We will be faced with still increasing numbers of non-performing loans , but we believe we will manage the situation and are on our way out of the woods . ”
But Mr. Hahn at the Austrian Institute for Economic Research is n’t as certain .
The worst affected countries have been shored up by emergency aid from the IMF and other international institutions , but it is unclear if they are really stabilized .
“ Our assessment is that the risks are still there , ” he says .
“ The Austrian banking sector may be a little over optimistic in this respect . ”

If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it .

What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly , and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of “ humility . ”
This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism .
– Albert Einstein
It seems to me that the idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I can not take seriously .
I also cannot imagine some will or goal outside the human sphere .
…
Science has been charged with undermining morality , but the charge is unjust .
A man ’s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death .
– Albert Einstein
If people are good only because they fear punishment , and hope for reward , then we are a sorry lot indeed .

The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction : jealous and proud of it ; a petty , unjust , unforgiving control - freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; a misogynistic , homophobic , racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal , sadomasochistic , capriciously malevolent bully .

We are afraid of the known and afraid of the unknown .
That is our daily life and in that there is no hope , and therefore every form of philosophy , every form of theological concept , is merely an escape from the actual reality of what is .

Atheism leaves a man to sense , to philosophy , to natural piety , to laws , to reputation ; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue , even if religion vanished ; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men .
– Francis Bacon A
God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd ; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant .
If God is seen as a self in a world of his own , an ego that relates to a thought , a cause separate from its effect .
he becomes a being , not Being itself .
An omnipotent , all - knowing tyrant is not so different from earthly dictators who make everything and everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled .
An atheism that rejects such a God is amply justified .

And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he does n’t want you to do .
And if you do any of these things , he will send you to a special place , of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever , and suffer , and burn , and scream , until the end of time .
But he loves you .

He loves you and he needs money .

Back to Atheism
PIMCO investment guru Mohammad El - Erian takes to Bloomberg to warn about what he sees as excessive optimism -- or at least complacency -- currently in financial markets .
Judging from market valuations , I sense quite a gap between consensus market expectations and key political and economic realities , especially in the U.S.
If the gap is n’t bridged by the validation of the more optimistic expectations , investors may well find that January ’s global equity sell - off was just a precursor to a disappointing year for several asset classes , including stocks .
He goes on to talk about a " tense " situation in Washington right now , and the potential for gridlock , causing an inability to tackle the genuinely difficult challenges of the moment .
I am particularly concerned about the surge in joblessness .
In the absence of bold structural measures , most of which face political headwinds , we are looking at a period of persistently high unemployment that will disproportionately affect the young .
We risk significant welfare losses and skill erosion , lower labor - market flexibility , and yet another burden on the country ’s stretched public finances .
These are consequential political and economic questions .
They speak to a more protracted post - crisis resetting of the U.S. economy -- what Pimco labeled last year as a bumpy multiyear journey to a new normal .
What comes after banking crises ?
Sovereign debt crises .
All this is consistent with the academic literature on post - crisis periods .
Such research reminds us of the extent to which massive disruptions -- such as the one experienced in 2007 - 09 -- expose structural cracks that , at best , can only be masked temporarily by a massive cyclical policy response .
Actually , credit to Morgan Stanley , who was ahead of the curve in predicting that this would be the story of 2010 .
They produced this chart last November :
Robert Jacobson , the developer behind the open source Java Model Railroad Interface ( JMRI ) project , finally prevailed in a long - running open source software license enforcement lawsuit against Matthew Katzer , the owner of a company that sells commercial model train software .
Katzer initially threatened Jacobson and JMRI with a patent infringement lawsuit in 2005 , and demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars in licensing fees .
Upon investigating Katzer 's claims , Jacobson was surprised to discover that Katzer had misappropriated significant amounts of JMRI code , using it without attribution in a commercial software package .
Jacobson retaliated against Katzer 's patent suit by filing a copyright infringement suit .
The case has attracted considerable attention within the open source software community because it has broad ramifications for open source license legality .
A federal appeals court that heard the case in 2008 ruled that violating the terms of an open source software license constitutes copyright infringement , not just breach of contract .
The distinction is important because the legal remedies for copyright infringement are generally stronger .
After the 2008 ruling , the case was passed back to the district court so that the appropriate remedy could be determined .
In a summary judgement issued in December , the district court ruled that Jacobson is entitled to collect monetary damages from Katzer .
The judgment also declared that Katzer 's removal of attribution and copyright information from the JMRI code constituted a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Although the ruling wo n't set a broad precedent due to the fact that it emerged from a district court , it 's still a significant victory for open source software licensing enforcement .
The threat of having to pay monetary damages will give software companies a big incentive to refrain from abusing or misappropriating open source software code .
In response to the ruling , Katzer finally agreed to settle with Jacobson last week .
The conflict , which originally started five years ago , has reached an end .
One might call it Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's own drug war hat - trick .
Today Mexican officials announced the capture of alleged Tijuana drug trafficker Teodoro “ El Teo ” Garcia Simental , believed to be behind a recent spate of gruesome violence in the troubled border town .
His arrest marks the third high - profile take - down of a Mexican drug trafficker in less than a month .
It 's a much - needed political victory for President Calderon , who , despite dispatching 45,000 troops across the country to stop organized crime , had not been able to boast of many high - profile arrests in his first three years in office .
And while some critics say it will make little difference in the nation - wide fight to clamp down on crime that has sullied Mexico ’s reputation worldwide , it definitely bodes well for the region .
“ This is a big deal for Baja California , and particularly for Tijuana , because of the very violent tendencies exhibited by ‘ El Teo ’ and his organization , ” says David Shirk , a Woodrow Wilson Center fellow and professor at the University of San Diego .
Law enforcement officials told the Associated Press said that Mr. Garcia Simental was arrested at 5 a.m. in La Paz , the capital of Baja California Sur .
While the influence of the major drug trafficking group in Tijuana has waned in recent years ( see briefing on Mexico 's drug cartels ) , Garcia Simental , who broke off from the dominant player , was considered among the most vicious traffickers in the country .
Listed as No. 24 on Mexico ’s list of most - wanted , law enforcement officials suspect he is behind numerous beheadings and the ordering of hundreds of bodies to be dissolved in caustic soda ; the government had offered $ 2.1 million for information leading to his arrest .
The arrest comes less than a month after Mexican authorities killed leader Arturo Beltran Leyva on Dec. 16 during a raid in Cuernavaca , south of Mexico City .
Just two weeks later officials arrested his brother Carlos Beltran Leyva .
But some critics say that as long as the Calderon administration shies away from seizing assets and addressing structural problems that lead Mexicans into drug trafficking gangs , such arrests will do little .
“ The ‘ capos ’ are very important in the structure of the gang .
But many people start to replace them , ” says Javier Oliva Posada , a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico .
“ It is only one person . ”
And Mr. Oliva Posada says that taking out the major players could ultimately lead to more violence .
Garcia Simental reportedly broke from the Arellano Felix gang after its leader was arrested – the kind of splinter violence that has typified Mexico since it began clamping down on kingpins , especially in the administration of President Vicente Fox , Calderon ’s predecessor .
Garcia Simental had reportedly formed his own gang and was believed to be allied with the powerful Sinaloa cartel , according to a 2009 Mexican Army document cited by the Associated Press .
“ There is no clear indication with whom ‘ El Teo ’ was working if anyone , ” say Mr. Shirk .
“ But whomever who he was with , ‘ El Teo ’ was a bad guy , ” part of a third - generation of drug trafficker , as Shirk puts it , who are less sophisticated and less predictable than their predecessors .
The first generation of Mexican traffickers inherited the cocaine routes from their Colombian counterparts , while many leading figures in the second generation , tied closely to the first , have been taken down by Mexican authorities .
That has led to a vacuum that has contributed to the ghoulish violence that marks Mexico today , say experts on the drug war .

The Great Weight Debate : Is It OK to Be Fat ?
Four fiery panelists debate whether you can be fat and healthy .
Feb. 23 , 2010  --
From plus - size to big boned , pleasantly plump to succulently shapely , and Rubenesque to curvy , no matter how you dress it up , for decades , the world " fat " has been associated with laziness , filth and inactivity .
It 's become a pop culture punch line .
Recent headlines show just how mainstream the issue of obesity has become .
Last week , film director Kevin Smith was ejected from a Southwest airlines flight after being deemed too large for his seat .
First lady Michelle Obama has recently launched a campaign to fight childhood obesity .
Even former president Bill Clinton links his continual heart problems to poor eating habits as a child .
CLICK HERE to watch the full fiery debate
The message in all of this is that fat is bad .
And with a $ 50 billion industry of weight loss drugs , bestselling books , and workout programs , there appears to be no end in sight .
But has it all gone too far ?
Linda Bacon , a professor of nutrition whose book , " Healthy at Every Size , " has become a kind of bible for the so - called fat acceptance movement , thinks it has .
" That 's an extraordinary amount of money that we are all putting out right now to support an industry that does n't have our best interests in mind , " Bacon said . " " I think that we 've reached the point where these ideas about weight are now so strongly part of our cultural landscape that we do n't even challenge them , we do n't even recognize that they are assumptions .
We just accept them . "
Bacon says her research shows that we should n't be focusing so much on fat .
" There are about 40 studies that have been conducted that have looked at longevity and weight , " she said , " and almost all of them are showing that people that are in the category that we call overweight are actually living longer lives than people that are in the category that we deem normal and advisable . "
On the other hand , the federal government says that two thirds of adults in America are overweight , 72 million are clinically obese .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 2008 , 9.1 percent of all health care spending in the U.S. -- $ 147 billion – was spent on obesity - related medical care , much of that paid for by taxpayers .
So who 's right ?
Has America become a dangerously supersized nation or is it all an unhealthy obsession with being thin ?
To help answer the question , " Nightline " brought together four outspoken people for a " Nightline Face - Off : Is It OK to Be Fat ? "
The debate is part of the " Face - Off " series , which has debated controversial issues including atheism , porn , Satan and adultery .

Fat Acceptance Movement ' Takes Us Backwards '
The debate took place at the Cooper Union 's historic Great Hall in downtown Manhattan .
On one side of the issue were Kim Bensen and MeMe Roth .
Benson , a former obese woman spent a lifetime yo - yo dieting , and finally dropped the weight after tipping the scales at 347 pounds .
" I lost over 200 pounds and have kept it off for over 7 years , " she said .
" I 'm really excited to be here today to talk about the topic . "
Bensen was partnered up with Meme Roth , one of the most outspoken members of the ant - obesity movement and the head of National Action Against Obesity ( NAAO ) .
Roth does not believe that a person can be fat and healthy .
She also believes that obesity bears a major financial burden to taxpayers .
" The big problem with this pro-fat acceptance movement is it takes us backwards , " said Roth , " and it makes us pretend like we 're debating whether obesity is bad , but obesity is bad . "
On the other side of the debate were Marianne Kirby and Crystal Renn .
Kirby , who proudly identifies herself as fat , is a leader of the Fat Acceptance Movement .
In her book , " Lessons from the Fat - o - Sphere , " she argues that fat can be beautiful and healthy .
Kirby believes that fat men and women should not be ashamed and should accept their bodies , no matter what they are , without judgment .
" [ MeMe ] says a lot of inflammatory things that I think are pretty damaging to people , " said Kirby prior to the debate , " but she 's not a monster , she 's not crazy .
She 's just a person .
I 'm not here to throw cupcakes at her . "
Panelist : ' I Could n't ' Breath '
When I Was Obese
Kirby was joined by Crystal Renn , the world 's highest - paid plus - size model , and author of " Hungry : A Young Model 's Story of Appetite , Ambition and the Ultimate Embrace of Curves . "
When she started modeling , she was a size zero , and she dieted her way to an eating disorder and a slew of health problems .
" I actually suffered from an eating disorder , anorexia , for three years , and it nearly took my life , " said Renn .
" And today , I can speak about health at any size because I really lived it through life experience . "
As the audience gathered inside the Great Hall , the panelists made last minute preparations and met each other for the first time .
After introductions , the panelists sat down and went through their opening arguments .
Kirby kicked off the debate .
In America , one in three people is obese , but she believes that the health risks associated with obesity are exaggerated and it is possible to be overweight and healthy .
" I think that we look at health from an incredibly narrow standpoint , " said Kirby .
" I think that if you are eating healthfully if you are taking care of your own personal health … if you are taking care of those things , that 's a completely divorced issue from weight . "
Bensen , who struggled with her weight for most of her life , strongly disagreed .
" I think it 's very scary to be saying that you do n't have health risks when you 're overweight .
I know from personal experience .
I could n't breathe when I slept at night . "
" That does not mean that my situation affects my health in X , Y , Z , " said Kirby .
" So the blanket statement that there are all of these nasty consequences for being fat is kind of naive thing for us as a s society to believe . "
Dieting Debate : ' I 'm This Size Because I Dieted '
Soon , the debate moved into mental health .
In America , about 10 million women and one million men suffer from eating disorders .
With issues like low self esteem on the table , the panelists were then asked if Americans , particularly children , where too fixated on the issue of size versus health .
" I think the most important thing that we can give to a child is a love for the body , " said Roth , " and having cake and ice cream at someone 's birthday party is n't why Americans [ are ] fat .
It 's acting like every day is somebody 's birthday party is why America is fat .
" Food is a pleasurable thing , " said Renn .
" It can be a pleasurable thing in moderation .
I absolutely believe there is nothing wrong with celebrating a birthday with something pleasurable such as food . "
But Roth was n't finished .
" We 've gotten ourselves to the point where we 're behaviorally and neurochemically dependent upon food , " she said .
" [ It 's ] fine to have birthday party food at a birthday party .
But we say , ' Oh , you had a good day , here 's cake , you had a bad here 's cake , you got a promotion , here 's cake . ' "
" But what about when you start to go the other way and you say , ' Oh my God , food let 's be scared now . '
That 's such a bad thing , " said Renn , " I think that 's also planting the anorexic seed possibly from the beginning in children 's minds . "
Kirby then opened up about her personal battle with dieting and her eventual acceptance of her weight .
" I mean I started out as a kind of chubby kid and increased through all of these behaviors ... I 'm this size because I dieted for 20 years .
And when you stop --"
" Well dieting does n't get you to that size , " said Benson .
" It does actually , " Kirby responded .
" So when you go through the cycle of weight gain and reloss and gain and loss and gain and loss , you wind up this size . "
" I know I did !
I was bigger than you .
A lot , " said Bensen , " But you 're not answering my question . "
" It 's not about giving up , " said Kirby .
" I gave up dieting because it was a loser game for me .
It made me fatter .
It made me incredibly unhealthy .
It made me full of self loathing ...
I have permanently screwed up my metabolism because I dieted from age 7 to the age of 27 ... When I stopped dieting my body settled , [ it ] stopped changing .
And my health improved . "
Some studies have shown that women who yo - yo diet may actually gain more weight over time than those who do n't .
Another study found that just 5 percent of dieters keep the weight off after five years .
Roth thinks that 's because people do n't really understand what it means to eat healthy .
" I can't eat more than 1,300 calories if I 'm not gonna exercise , " said Roth .
" That 's not a lot of food .
So I run for four miles a day and I 'm eating somewhere close to 1,800 calories a day . "
Renn Goes After MeMe's Personal Eating Habits
Renn seemed perplexed .
" Excuse me a second , " she said .
" Sorry , I just want to understand what you said .
You 're saying that you run four miles a day and eat only 1,800 calories ...
That 's really interesting and that 's just about 300 calories off where I was about four years ago when I was really sick and had hair falling out of my head . "
" You 're 5 foot 9 , " said Roth .
" You 're right .
I 'm not saying you have anorexia , " said Renn .
" I definitely believe there is something going on cause you 're quite passionate and I think a little fat phobic . "
" There 's a lot of studies looking at staying at a lower end of BMI [ body mass index ] perhaps giving us longevity and healthier longevity , " said Roth .
Renn then delved deeper into her own personal battle with anorexia .
" So when I was eating 1,000 calories a day and lost my menstrual cycle for three years and might not be able to have children that I think says something .
[ That 's ] way too little . "
The Economics of Obesity
The panelists also tackled the economics of obesity .
People say at what point does ones right to be fat impinge on someone 's airline seat , ambulance trip , or hospital bed ?
" If you require two of something you should pay for two of something , " said Roth .
" No one 's ever sold me a seat at a discounted rate because I do n't take up the entire seat .
I 'm not sure that I am buying into discrimination for obesity .
I 'm looking at the numbers and the discrimination may be on the few of us who are staying healthy , eating properly and subsidizing an obese culture . "
Kirby was incensed .
" No !
MeMe Roth just said that thin people are discriminated against , " she said .
" That 's amazing . "
" They certainly are , " Roth shot back .
As the debate came to an end , panelists lingered to answer audience questions , many of them aimed at MeMe Roth .
" It 's hard as hell , " she told one overweight audience member .
" It is so hard to make yourself exercise every day .
It is so hard to say no to the plethora of delectable things that you could eat at all times , but damn it people , it is wrong to be sick , it is wrong to make yourself sick , and it is wrong to make every other citizen of this country pay the price for it . "
Despite the wide range of arguments and viewpoints that emerged during the " Face - Off , " there were several points of agreement .
The panelists all agreed that quality foods , fruits and vegetables should be available for everyone .
They also agreed that no one should be stigmatized based on their size .
" The fact that people do n't do it is not the same as can't do it , " said Roth .
" She 's done it , " she said referring to Benson .
" There are many people who do it .
Now I am not saying it 's easy .
I 'm not saying that more than five percent do it .
But I 'm not saying that it 's impossible . "
" My body and my health do n't look like everybody else 's body and their health , " said Kirby .
" Everyone is an individual .
Everyone has ... their own challenges , when it comes to their health , however that 's defined .
And I think that it 's incredibly damaging to judge someone ... and their health levels , based solely on this one factor .
It 's ridiculous . "

Editorial .
Today we interrupt our regularly scheduled programming to bring you a guest post by Oleg Kiselyov , reinterpreting our previous post about nested loops and continuations with exceptions .
Hello !
I noticed your recent article about nested loops and continuations .
I should have commented on it using the provided form , but I was not sure how formatting would come out .
The comment includes a lot of code .
Please feel free to post the code in whole or in part , or do anything else with it .
The thesis of my comment is that callCC is not necessary for the implementation of break and continue in single and nested loops .
We observe that the continuations of each iteration and of the entire loop are invoked either 0 or 1 time ( but never more than once ) .
That is the pattern of exceptions .
So , the problem posed by your article can be solved with exceptions .
Here are several variations of the solution .
First , a few preliminaries : this message is the complete literate Haskell code .
> import Prelude hiding ( break , catch ) > import Control .
Monad > import Control .
Monad .
Trans
Alas , ErrorT in Control .
Monad .
Error has the stupid Error constraint .
So , we have to write our own Exception monad transformer .
The code below is standard .
> newtype ExT e m a = ExT{unExT :: m ( Either e a ) } > > instance Monad m =>
Monad ( ExT e m ) where > return = ExT . return .
Right > m >>= f = ExT $ unExT m >>= either ( return .
Left ) ( unExT . f ) > > instance MonadTrans ( ExT e ) where > lift m = ExT $ m >>= return .
Right > > instance MonadIO m => MonadIO ( ExT e m ) where > liftIO m = ExT $ liftIO m >>= return .
Right > > raise :: Monad m => e ->
ExT e m a > raise = ExT . return .
Left > > catch :: Monad m => ExT e m a -> ( e -> ExT e' m a ) ->
ExT e' m a > catch m h = ExT $ unExT m >>= either ( unExT . h ) ( return .
Right ) > > runExT :: Monad m => ExT e m a -> m a > runExT m = unExT m >>= either ( const $ fail " Unhandled exc " ) return
We are ready to code the first solution , for simple , non-nested loops .
The idea is to treat ' break ' and ' continue ' as exceptions .
After all , both control operators cause computations to be skipped — which is what exceptions do .
We define the datatype of our ' exceptions ' :
> data BC = Break | Cont > > break , continue :: Monad m =>
ExT BC m a > break = raise Break > continue = raise Cont
Here is the code for the loop : it catches exceptions at some points :
> for_in :: Monad m => [ a ] -> ( a -> ExT BC m ( ) ) -> m ( ) > for_in xs f = runExT $ mapM_ iter xs `catch` hbreak > where > iter x = catch ( f x ) hcont > hcont Cont = return ( ) -- handle Cont , re-raise Break > hcont e = raise e > hbreak Break = return ( ) > hbreak Cont = return ( ) --
Should n't happen actually
Here is your test :
> loopLookForIt1 :: IO ( ) > loopLookForIt1 = > for_in [ 0..100 ] $ \x -> do > when ( x `mod` 3 == 1 ) $ continue > when ( x `div` 17 == 2 ) $ break > lift $ print x
Running it :
> tf1 = loopLookForIt1 :: IO ()
prints 23 numbers starting with 0 , 2 , 3 and ending with 30 , 32 , 33 .
We have to generalize to nested loops .
Two solutions are apparent .
I would call the first one ' dynamic ' .
We index the exceptions by levels , which are natural numbers .
Level 0 pertains to the current loop , level 1 is for the parent loop , etc .
> data BCN = BCN BC Int --
Add the level of breaking
Operators break and continue now take the number : how many loop scopes to break .
I think Perl has a similar breaking - with - number operator .
> breakN = raise .
BCN Break > continueN = raise .
BCN Cont
The new iterator :
> for_inN :: Monad m => [ a ] -> ( a -> ExT BCN m ( ) ) -> ExT BCN m ( ) > for_inN xs f = mapM_ iter xs `catch` hbreak > where > iter x = catch ( f x ) hcont > hcont ( BCN Cont 0 ) = return ( ) -- handle Cont , re-raise Break > hcont e = raise e > --
If the exception is for a parent , re-raise it , decrementing its level > hbreak ( BCN Break 0 ) = return ( ) > hbreak ( BCN Cont 0 ) = return ( ) --
Should n't happen actually > hbreak ( BCN exc n ) = raise ( BCN exc ( n - 1 ) )
The single - loop test now looks as follows .
> loopLookForItN :: ExT BCN IO ( ) > loopLookForItN = > for_inN [ 0..100 ] $ \x -> do > when ( x `mod` 3 == 1 ) $ continueN 0 > when ( x `div` 17 == 2 ) $ breakN 0 > lift $ print x > > tfN = runExT loopLookForItN :: IO ()
We can now write the nested loop test .
I took a liberty to enhance the example in your article , so to exercises all cases :
> loopBreakOuter1 :: ExT BCN IO ( ) > loopBreakOuter1 = > for_inN [ 1,2,3 ] $ \x -> do > lift $ print x > for_inN [ 4,5,6 ] $ \y -> do > lift $ print y > when ( y == 4 ) $ continueN 0 > when ( x == 1 ) $ breakN 0 > when ( x == 3 ) $ breakN 1 > when ( y == 5 ) $ continueN 1 > breakN 1 > lift $ print x > > tbN1 = runExT loopBreakOuter1 :: IO ()
The result is the sequence of numbers : 1 4 5 1 2 4 5 3 4 5
There exists another solution for the nested - loop problem , which I call ' static ' .
What if we just iterate the single - loop solution ?
We can nest ExT BC monad transformers to any given depth .
To refer to particular layer in the transformer stack , we use lift .
We can use the for_in iterator and the operators break , continue defined earlier .
We write the nested test as follows :
> loopBreakOuterS1 :: IO ( ) > loopBreakOuterS1 = > for_in [ 1,2,3 ] $ \x -> do > liftIO $ print x > for_in [ 4,5,6 ] $ \y -> do > liftIO $ print y > when ( y == 4 ) $ continue > when ( x == 1 ) $ break > when ( x == 3 ) $ lift $ break > when ( y == 5 ) $ lift $ continue > lift $ break > liftIO $ print x > tbS1 = loopBreakOuterS1 :: IO ()
I guess the lesson here might be that callCC is often not needed ( I would argue that callCC is never needed , but that 's the argument for another time ) .
Here is another example of simple exceptions sufficing where call / cc was thought to be required :

Despite being at the bottom of the food chain , plants may be able to significantly alter the ecological patterns in their habitats .
Generally , ecosystems are studied from a " top - down " perspective : top predators limit the numbers of herbivores , which in turn allows plants to flourish .
In a paper published in Science last week , researchers showed that plants can also affect these patterns from the bottom up .
Milkweeds are a family of plants fed upon by a species of aphid , and these aphids serve as prey for a range of invertebrate predators .
By manipulating soil nutrient levels and predator access in 16 species of milkweeds , the researchers tried to determine whether milkweed success — here measured via plant biomass — was always determined top - down , by the influence of predators .
Results show that milkweeds face an evolutionary trade - off and can adopt one of two strategies : they can invest their energy in growing quickly and taking advantage of rich soil , or in developing resistance to the aphids .
Depending on which strategy was in operation , the milkweed species differed in how important top - down effects were ; plants that were most responsive to changes in soil fertility were also the species in which the presence of predators had the biggest positive effect on plant biomass .
In other words , the plants that sacrifice herbivore resistance for growth rely more heavily on predators for protection than plants with the alternative , aphid - resistant strategy do .
Apparently , less - resistant milkweed species still played an active role in the ecosystem , as they produce more volatile organic compounds called sesquiterpenes that can actually draw predators to the plants , providing some protection from the aphids .
This study suggests that , while top - down effects are important , bottom - up effects based on evolutionary trade - offs in plants may be an underestimated source of variation in ecological communities .

Despite James Cameron ’s “ Avatar ” now fighting for the top grossing film of all time slot , the game version of the hyper - fable failed Ubisoft ’s sales goals by a significant margin .
Coming out a full two weeks before the film has been the reason most have attributed to the failure , the top brass at the publisher have mentioned that releasing licensed media in December has always been a risky move .
Speaking shortly after the company slashed its guidance , CEO Yves Guillemot spoke on how the company has taken the hit .
“ We knew we were taking [ some risk ] .
The fact that the movie was coming in December was a potential problem , and it did result in a problem .
We thought the game would continue to sell after the new year .
It will be difficult in the future to buy rights to a movie that comes in December , because it ’s too risky , and it cannot [ capture ] Christmas season [ sales ] .
It does n’t work as well for a video game company . ”
Guillemot also took time to describe how the company will retract its usual amount of license acquiring in order to focus on its more original – and profitable – content .
“ The goal is to reduce the investment in licenses , and put more emphasis on making our brands bigger [ and appear ] more often , with very high quality , ” Guillemot explained .
“ It does n’t mean we will stop , but we are going to spend less on licenses in the future . ”
CFO Alain Martinez was sure to chime in and lessen doubts that the company did n’t lose much on Avatar : The Game , “ Avatar is not a loss - making project , ” he stated .
“ When we lose 1 million sales [ from our projections ] , that ’s about 30 million euros in sales and 65 or 70 percent of gross margin that has been lost . ”

FROM being a rounding error a decade ago , the financial clout of China now trails only that of America .
By market capitalisation , it has three of the four largest banks , the two largest insurance companies , the second - largest stockmarket and a lengthening list of investment funds .
Yet who makes the decisions in China is barely understood .
The government and the Communist Party are intimately entwined with the managers of China 's financial institutions .
Working out who is really in charge is almost impossible .
Even attempting to do so takes you into sensitive territory .
Disclosing information about how the Chinese government works risks violating nebulous secrecy laws or sacrificing business opportunities .
Many China - watchers will only speak face to face , concerned about using e-mails or phone calls to discuss what , in the West , would be standard chatter about the status of bankers and their supervisors .
Almost all of the credit for Chinese companies is raised through its commercial banks .
The country 's bank chiefs are powerful men whose careers have been meticulously managed .
But none has the freedom of their peers in the West , not even those managing state - infested firms like Citigroup and RBS .
Perhaps the only Western equivalents of a Chinese bank are the two American housing agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—vast institutions with political mandates to expand credit , and protection from the consequences of their role in fostering bad debt .
Big credit decisions in China are not advanced by any one bank , nor any one banker .
Credit is infused and withdrawn by central diktat .
That process has extraordinary appeal to state planners but is horribly inefficient for individual institutions .
In recent weeks , for example , as the screws on lending have tightened , favoured industrial companies have been getting urgent calls from their bankers demanding that they immediately scoop up their credit needs for months to come , or be subject to a freeze of uncertain duration .
Firms that manage to load up on credit still suffer because they bear interest costs long before the money is actually needed .
“ The Chinese banks are pure utilities , ” says one banker .
“ The State Council [ the government 's chief administrative arm ] tells them to lend , and they lend . ”
Overt controls increase in line with the amount of credit .
Loans above $ 500 m are said to be directly vetted by the State Council .
Something like four - fifths of the assets in the banking system are controlled by 17 institutions .
In many ways , China Development Bank is easiest for an outsider to understand .
It is vast , run by a powerful government official , Chen Yuan ( son of Chen Yun , one of the “ eight immortals ” who created modern China ) , and supports projects that the government favours .
Most of the other big banks are not explicitly run by the government , but regulators attend board meetings and senior management often includes a person with the title “ head of discipline ” , who represents the Communist Party .
Executives are rotated between institutions by government decree .
HSBC was stunned in 2006 when Zhang Jianguo , the president of Bank of Communications , in which it had taken a 20 % stake , turned up as president of a key competitor , China Construction Bank , the country 's second - largest financial institution .
There was no consultation , nor even notification of the move .
China Construction
Bank 's chairman , Guo Shuqing , is rumoured to be in the running for a top political position : the move could have been succession planning .
Shifts of this kind have gone into high gear since the start of the year .
Some China - watchers reckon that those bankers who stay in their posts have more chance of developing their institutions into world - class businesses .
This group includes Jiang Jianqing , chairman of ICBC , the world 's largest bank by assets and valuation , and possibly Ma Weihua , president of China Merchants Bank , often cited as the most dynamic of the mainland 's big financial institutions ( despite a ratings downgrade by Fitch this week ) .
Both institutions have been permitted to undertake non-mainland acquisitions .
The bidding process , however , remains tightly controlled .
ICBC abruptly dropped out of a competition with Merchants to buy Hong Kong 's Wing Lung Bank in 2008 .
The suspected reason ?
The government 's reluctance to bid , in effect , against itself .

Other parts of the financial system are no more transparent .
Take the China Investment Corporation ( CIC ) , China 's sovereign - wealth fund , which was founded in 2007 .
For fund managers and companies in search of money , CIC 's chief investment officer , Gao Xiqing , has become highly sought - after .
But just how much autonomy Mr Gao has is uncertain .
CIC 's chief executive , Lou Jiwei , told a conference in Hong Kong on January 20th that two things would improve his organisation : more freedom from foreign authorities to make investments , which would doubtless be fostered by his second wish , more freedom to manage itself .
For many firms , ties to government are considered their greatest asset .
The seed capital for China International Capital Corporation ( CICC ) , which dominates domestic underwriting activity , was provided by Morgan Stanley back in 1995 .
But Morgan has since been squeezed out of a hands - on role .
CICC is now run by Levin Zhu , son of Zhu Rongji , a former prime minister .
Two CICC alumni , Wu Shangzhi and Fang Fenglei , run what are described as the most important private - equity firms in China — CDH Investments and Hopu Investment Management , respectively .
In this kind of system , big decisions are funnelled upwards to a very small group of people .
Technically , the banks fall under the auspices of Liu Mingkang , chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission .
Interest - rate and exchange - rate decisions come under Zhou Xiaochuan , head of the People 's Bank of China , and a former director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange , now run by Yi Gang .
But their official titles both overrate and underrate their authority .
Mr Liu and Mr Zhou are likely to be involved in innumerable decisions that would be considered private matters outside China .
It is unlikely that lending rates or credit policies could be shifted without their input .
Both provide an intellectual foundation , through papers and speeches , for China 's actions .
Even so , in the shifting currents of power , many believe the critical hand is played by Wang Qishan , the vice - premier responsible for the financial sector , a former mayor of Beijing and former head of China Construction Bank .
Unlike Mr Zhou and Mr Liu , Mr Wang rarely comments publicly .
But he is a critical conduit for bankers inside and outside China , directly oversees the People 's Bank and is a member of the Politburo , the government 's chief political arm .
He also serves on three big regulatory commissions covering insurance , banking and securities .
When the government is pondering a new policy — expanding China 's financial ties to Africa , say , or the creation of a futures market —
Mr Wang is the one who calls in foreign bankers for consultations .
They do not say no .
During the depths of the financial crisis , when money was being sought for Morgan Stanley from CIC , Hank Paulson , then America 's treasury secretary , called Mr Wang for his blessing ( and got a lukewarm reception ) .
Technically , only Wen Jiabao , the prime minister , sits above Mr Wang in economic matters .
But when it comes to financial decisions that China perceives to be particularly sensitive , such as exchange - rate movements , stimulus spending or even large financial transactions , the standing committee of the Politburo — the nine most senior leaders of China , including President Hu Jintao — can take up the matter .
At some point the sheer complexity of China 's economy will preclude China 's top leaders from serving , in effect , as an elevated credit committee .
But that time has yet to come .
Kucinich jeers : Congress is ‘ complicit ’ in violating Americans ’ constitutional rights
In the wake of congressional Democrats ’ reauthorization and extension of the USA Patriot Act , few elected Democrats have been as vocal about the post - 9/11 security measures as they were during the Bush administration .
Leave it to stalwart House progressive Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) to raise a rallying cry against what he called America ’s love of its fears .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This legislation extends three problematic provisions of the PATRIOT Act and , at the same time , leaves some of the most egregious provisions in place , absent any meaningful reform and debate , ” he declared in a media advisory .
The specific provisions he cited are the Patriot Act ’s powers to conduct roving wiretaps , conduct surveillance of people not thought to have any association with terrorism and tap into your personal records , such as library accounts .
The extensions were approved by Congress and sent to President Obama on Thursday , several days before the Patriot Act ’s most nefarious portions were set to expire .
President Obama had yet to sign the bill at time of this writing .
The Associated Press called the votes a “ political victory for Republicans . ”
Some Senate Democrats did attempt to propose some modifications to the legislation that would have allowed for greater oversight , but they were ignored .
Democratic leadership bowed to the wishes of Republicans and conducted a voice vote on Wednesday , upon which the one - year extension was passed .
The House voted 315 - 97 in favor on Thursday .

“ Thrown away were restrictions and greater scrutiny on the government ’s authority to spy on Americans and seize their records , ” AP added .
“ While I strongly support using the most robust tools possible to go after terrorists , Congress must revise and narrow — not extend — Bush era policies , ” said Congresswoman Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , according to Reuters .
Kucinich ’s scorn for the legislation was even more pronounced .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Despite years of documentation evidencing abuse of these provisions during the Bush Administration , the Department of Justice has failed to hold Bush Administration officials accountable for illegal domestic spying by barring any lawsuits to be brought against those officials , ” he said .
“ Months into this Administration , The New York Times reported that the National Security Agency had ‘ intercepted private e-mail messages and phone calls of Americans in recent months on a scale that went beyond the broad legal limits , ’ and that the practice was ‘ significant and systematic . ’
Passage of this legislation today continues to make Congress complicit in these violations of our basic constitutional rights . ”
The title of his press release pleaded for congress to “ repeal ” the Patriot Act and “ restore Constitutional rights to Americans . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ As Members of Congress sworn to protect the rights and civil liberties afforded to us by the Constitution , we have a responsibility to exercise our oversight powers fully , and significantly reform the PATRIOT Act , ensuring that the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans are fully protected , ” he said .
“ More than eight years after the passage of the PATRIOT Act , we have failed to do so .
As National Journal correspondent Shane Harris recently put it , we have witnessed the rise of an ‘ American Surveillance State . ’
We have come to love our fears more than we love our freedoms . ”
The USA Patriot Act was passed by Congress in the weeks proceeding the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Many Democrats criticized its passage as too hasty , with some even claiming they did not have a chance to read the hefty legislation before the vote .
At the time , the Republican majority did not question it , falling in line to support the legislation seemingly regardless of what the Bush administration put in it .
“ This was not , in my view , the finest hour for the United States Senate , ” Senator Russel Feingold ( D - WI ) said , in an address given to Congress on Oct. 12 , 2001 .
“ The debate on a bill that may have the most far reaching consequences on the civil liberties of the American people in a generation was a non-debate .
The merits took a back seat to the deal . ”

In contrast , many of those same Republicans have criticized President Obama for attempting to pass his package of health care reforms too quickly , though none of them voiced that same concern about the USA Patriot Act .
President Obama is expected to sign the extension before Sunday .
Most pictures are worth 1,000 words .
Sarah Palin’s are worth $ 10,000 .
During an upcoming fundraising visit to Minnesota , fans are being asked to fork over a pretty penny to have a brief meeting with the ex-Alaska governor memorialized on film .
The April 7 visit includes an afternoon rally at the Minneapolis Convention Center and a $ 500 - a - plate dinner to help raise cash for Rep. Michele Bachmann ’s reelection campaign .
The evening ’s schedule includes a brief chance , for ten big ones , to have a picture taken with Palin , according to an RSVP for the event .
Bachmann has been leading a populist charge against federal health care reforms , appearing at a Washington , D.C. rally Tuesday with a bullhorn in hand .
She is scheduled to appear on Fox News Wednesday , but her campaign manager , Gina Countryman , defended the high - dollar donations .
“ Congresswoman Bachmann ’s record of fighting for Minnesotans stands for itself .
She is standing firmly against a massive government takeover of health care , for smaller , more sensible government , and works every day to ensure the voices of her constituents are heard in Washington , ” Countryman said .
But for at least one Democratic rival , Bachmann ’s fundraising was an opportunity to raise cash .
In a letter sent Tuesday , Tarryl Clark ’s campaign manager Zach Rodvold asked supporters for a $ 10 donation to counter the event .
“ The Bachmann campaign has n’t advertised these sky - high ticket prices yet , and it ’s not hard to tell why , ” Rodvold wrote .
“ Michele Bachmann does n’t want people to know that while families and small businesses are struggling in Minnesota , she ’s getting ten grand per snapshot with right wing celebrity Sarah Palin . ”
The highly anticipated visit is a joint fundraiser for Bachmann and the Republican Party of Minnesota .
It is Palin ’s second visit here since she was launched into the national consciousness from the stage of the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , where she was introduced as Sen.
John McCain ’s presidential running mate .
One of the favorite put - downs from people who think they have the moral high ground in the climate debate is to accuse skeptics with this phrase : “ You are nothing but a shill for Big Oil ”
Who amongst us has n’t seen variants of that pointed finger repeated thousands of times ?
The paradigm has shifted .
Now it appears CRU is the one looking for “ big oil ” money .

There ’s more .
But wait that ’s not all !
Further down in that email , look at who else they were looking to for money .
Oh , this is horrible , it just ca n’t be , they would n’t .
They were looking to not only BP but , but EXXON in its Esso incarnation :

Now who is the shill for Big Oil again ?
Next time somebody brings up that ridiculous argument about skeptics , show them this .

Affirmation of life is the spiritual act by which man ceases to live thoughtlessly and begins to devote himself to his life

Richard Holbrooke ’s comments on reconciliation with the Taliban in Afghanistan , made during the recent Munich Security Conference , echoed earlier remarks by U.N. officials and American military commanders in Kabul that suggest that diplomacy might be coming alive on the Afghan front .
This could be true despite , or in coordination with , a new NATO offensive in southern Afghanistan .
For it to succeed , however , it has three enormous obstacles to overcome .
The first is that neither the Pentagon nor the White House seems to have clearly identified what the United States wants in Afghanistan .
To capture the al - Qaida leadership ?
Or to defeat that Taliban and create a client government there ?
President Barack Obama is in Afghanistan because it is the “ right ” war to fight .
This is because it is where al - Qaida supposedly has its headquarters .
But the president seems also to have been convinced that his real objective should be to stabilize or secure Pakistan as well as Afghanistan because of the former ’s nuclear weapons .
This is entirely different .
The highly nationalistic Pakistan army is already hostile to the U.S .
One more military intervention for the U.S. ?
Washington already is deeply involved in Afghanistan .
Israel wants the U.S. to attack Iran .
Iraq could blow up this spring because of scheduled elections and attempts by Shiite government figures to disqualify Sunni candidates accused of Baath Party connections .
What is the rationale for an involvement in Pakistan , likely to involve India ?
A former colleague of mine in the world of strategic studies said in a recent letter that on a Washington visit he could find no one among his acquaintances at the National Security Council who could give him a coherent explanation of what the United States is actually doing in Afghanistan .
Obviously there is a plan on paper : defeat and neutralize al - Qaida .
But whatever al - Qaida consists of in Afghanistan today — leaders , a staff , arms , training areas for volunteers ? — can leave the country whenever it decides to do so .
The essential elements could probably depart with a few hours ’ notice , while the rest scatter .
But the U.S. is laboriously building up a multinational military operational force with attendant bases , infrastructure and ( highly vulnerable ) lines of supply in order to defeat the Taliban effort to take back control of Afghanistan .
The U.S. is doing this to defend the elected government in Kabul against its internal political and ethnic enemies .
Why ?
Ca n’t the present Afghan leadership defend itself ?
Or make its own deal with the Pashtun majority in the country , where the Taliban have found their support ?
U.S. military action to defeat the Taliban has not been a great success .
Nor does Afghanistan offer the terrain for the classic seize - and - hold strategy of orthodox armies confronted with guerrillas and terrorists .
The unorthodox weapon President Obama seems to like best , the unmanned drone bomber , by all accounts has the collateral effect of bitterly alienating the population whose support the U.S. seeks to win .
Richard Holbrooke said at the Berlin security meeting that he regretted that in the past year the reconciliation of the Taliban has been “ neglected . ”
He said that this year American generals hope to separate the Taliban from their existing relationship with the ordinary Pashtun people , among whom they live and find protection .
Holbrooke ’s policy of reconciliation sounds very much like the strategy Gen. David Petraeus applied in Iraq , where he dealt with the tribal leadership to foster the Sunni “ awakening ” movement , through which the U.S. paid the Sunni tribes to provide security in difficult areas .
Last week it was reported in Afghanistan that one of the largest tribal groups , the Shinwari , has apparently turned against the Taliban ( for reasons of its own ) .
A million dollars in development funds has now been promised by the U.S. in payment directly to the tribal leaders .
This is a fragile gain for the anti-Taliban cause but very much what Gen. Stanley McChrystal wants to see .
American officials are talking about greatly enlarged tribal subsidies to provide jobs and economic security .
The objection here is that this buys loyalty to the U.S Army or to NATO units but not to the central government in Kabul , which is dominated by ethnic rivals of the Pashtuns , and is allegedly corrupt .
Present policy is that defectors must swear allegiance to the government , which is often unacceptable .
Buying the tribes does n’t solve the problem of internal conflict in the country because the Americans inevitably will ( someday ) go home .
U.S. and U.N. officials have claimed that Taliban leaders met the top U.N. figure in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , although the story ( unsurprisingly ) has been denied .
The fate of al - Qaida aside , a negotiated settlement to the Afghanistan conflict is unlikely and maybe impossible without the involvement and support of neighboring countries , including — notably — Iran as well as Pakistan and India .
All would expect withdrawal of U.S. troops .
Is that acceptable to the United States ?
If not , why not ?
What permanent interest , requiring permanent U.S. bases , does the United States have in the countries of Central and Southern Asia ?
This is a key issue , and the public has a right to know .
The United States went into Afghanistan to find al - Qaida , not to rule Asia .

How to Budget and Track Spending in a Spreadsheet
A reader e-mailed me a while back asking for some clarification on my budgeting and monthly spending plan strategy .
Here ’s what they had to say :
I have recently rediscovered your blog .
It helped me get started Â on my way to living debt free ; I ’m almost there .
Â
But I am need toÂ revamp my budget as it is still very simple .
I love your “ envelope ” Â method of book keeping and would like to set up something similar .
Â
After studying your blog I understand how your system and spreadsheetÂ work ; however , I ca n’t envision how to set it up and keep track of itÂ electronically .
I have found some budget temples , but they are asÂ simple as mine .
Â I would Â greatly appreciate it if you Could give meÂ some advice on setting up my spreadsheet possibly a screen shot of howÂ you set up yours .
Thank you for all the wonderful ideas and information you haveÂ shared it has been and will continue to be great inspiration .
Thanks for the kind words , reader !
Just to make sure everyone is on the same page let me link to two separate posts .

Now that Apple has chosen the famously awkward name " iPad " for its tablet , the most obvious candidate " iTablet " is up for grabs .
Sure enough , a UK company is leaping at the opportunity .
X2 is happy to announce it 's " hot on the heels of Apple 's latest product launch " with the iTablet , which will run Windows 7 and Linux .
The iTablet will ship April in two screen sizes — 10.2 inches and 10.7 inches — with a 1,024 - by - 768 resolution TFT touchscreen ( multitouch optional ) .
Other specs sound like the guts of a netbook : a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor , up to 250GB hard drive capacity , built - in stereo speakers , three USB ports , Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , HDMI output , a 1.3 - megapixel webcam and 3G connectivity .
It 's good to see competition for the iPad ( I did , after all , predict 2010 would be the year of the tablet ) , but it 's hard to draw positive impressions from a company whose website is practically impossible to navigate .
No details on price have been announced .

Fanget verdens største breiflabb
( VG Nett ) - Vi tenkte at dette var mye veldig god mat , sier en av fiskerne som fanget verdens største breiflabb .

Det var tirsdag formiddag på Hjelmås i Hordaland at Kåre Haugland og John Arne Mostraum , begge to drevene hobbyfiskere på 54 år , fikk en kjempeoverraskelse da de skulle dra opp garnet .
Der lå det nemlig en breiflabb på nesten 100 kilo .
Den var det ikke enkelt å få om bord i båten .
- Begynte å revne
STOLT : John Arne Mostraum smiler stolt ved siden av kjempebreiflabben de fanget tirsdag formiddag .

- Garnet begynte å revne , så vi turte ikke å dra det opp .
Vi fikk festet et tau rundt halen på fisken , og ved hjelp av båtshaken , som vi stakk inn i kjeften på den så han bet til , fikk vi hodet over kanten , sier Mostraum til VG Nett om rekordfangsten .
Breiflabben ble så dratt bak i den 19 - fots store båten « Slabben » .
- Hvordan tar man livet av en sånn breiflabb ?
NYTER FANGSTEN : Kåre Haugland nyter fangsten etter at breiflabben på nesten 100 kilo er kommet i land .

- Vi måtte bare gi ham et par kakk , dra litt til med en svær planke , og så stikke en kniv i ham , sier Mostraum .
- Har fisk for en stund
Deretter ringte mennene til en kamerat med truck som kom for å hjelpe dem med å frakte fisken i land .
På kaien i Leknes fikk de ved hjelp av tauet i halen og trucken løftet opp breiflabben , og bilder ble tatt .
Folk som var på kaien , strømmet til for å se kjempen .
Deretter ble fisken filetert mens den hang fra kroken .
Mostraum tipper at man fikk en 20 til 25 kilo rent fiskekjøtt fra beistet som ble veid til 99,4 kilo .
- Vi eter mye fisk , men nå har vi jo for en stund .
Så vi får dele litt med slekt og venner , sier Mostraum .
- Var dere nervøse da dere så fisken i garnet ?
- Vi var redd for å miste den , ler han .
- Helt vanvittig
Havforskningsinstituttet var også på kaien for hente hodet til breiflabben .
De viste stor interesse .
- Dette er fiskestørrelser vi bare har hørt rykter om tidligere .
Den størrelsen er bare helt vanvittig , sier Otto Bjelland ved Havforskningsinstituttet til BA.no .
Breiflabben er den største som har vært dokumentert på verdensbasis .
Forrige rekord var på 79 kilo , og denne hadde 20 kilo rogn .
Tirsdagens fangst var helt uten .

Online support groups can be a great source of emotional support and valuable health information you wo n’t find on any website from the National Institute of Mental Health or others .
Some people are a little leery of joining an online support group , however .
Others do n’t quite understand what benefit they may gain from joining one .
Still others understand a support group ’s benefits , but feel like they still do n’t gain as much from joining one as they had hoped .
Your experience in an online support group will inevitably vary .
But these tips may help you get the most from your experience , and keep your expectations in check .
1 . Take what you need , leave the rest .
Many people come into an online support group with their story , asking a specific question about treatment or other people ’s experiences .
Some people may reply with experiences of their own , or advice about what the “ best ” treatment is for a given condition .
This is how online support groups work .
But some people may not agree with the advice given , and that ’s perfectly okay .
We ’re a diverse culture living in a diverse world and we will not always agree .
Some people spend a lot of time arguing about opinions or things that are secondary to why they joined the support group in the first place .
Take the advice that makes sense to you , and leave the rest alone .
2. Stay somewhat anonymous .
This may not seem like the most obvious advice — after all , self - help support groups have a large social component .
How are people supposed to get to know you if you remain anonymous , sharing little of your person life with others ?
Staying somewhat anonymous does n’t mean you do n’t share — but pick and choose which information you share .
Remember that potential future employers , insurance companies , etc. can easily tie online information you share in an online support group to your identity if you let them .
There are already documented cases of people being denied coverage for life insurance based upon what they share online , and people not getting a job for the same reason .
The key is to share the important stuff — your feelings , how doctors are treating you , what treatments are recommended , how your family is supporting you , etc. — and leave the unimportant stuff out ( like where , exactly , you live ; your exact age ; anything that would be readily personally identifying ) .
3 . Set your expectations .
An online support group is n’t going to magically cure your concern .
Nor will you find it full only of caring , supportive individuals .
Support groups mimic the diversity of the real world , meaning they will be full of people from all walks of life and often from very different backgrounds .
Do n’t assume that others experience things the same way you do — chances are they do n’t .
Online support groups are best used as adjunct to some other kind of treatment .
In mental health , that means that for most people , they should also be in psychotherapy or taking a psychiatric medication .
You can also use a support group to test the waters to see if treatment is needed in your case .
As an addition to other treatment , an online support group is best used primarily for social and emotional support , and for exchanging information about treatments .
People need such support when facing life - threatening health concerns or ongoing mental health concerns .
It helps an individual feel like they are not alone .
4 . Be respectful of other people .
This seems like a no - brainer , but I still see people snipe and be mean to one another in an online support group setting every day .
Do n’t put down or disparage other people ’s experiences , advice or opinions .
You can disagree with someone without making it personal .
You can disagree with someone respectfully , too .
It just sometimes takes us a moment to take a step back , catch our breath , and try and gain some perspective before responding .
For instance , it ’s okay to correct misinformation you come across it in a support group online .
But there ’s a big difference between , “ I ca n’t believe you posted that everyone who has had ECT has had zero side effects !
That ’s just a lie ” and “ From what I ’ve read about ECT treatments , it seems that most people experience some memory loss , but it varies from person to person . ”
5. Respond mindfully .
If people responded more mindfully in support groups online , I suspect people would generally get more out of them .
Being mindful simply means taking a moment to stop , think about exactly what it is you ’re feeling and thinking , acknowledge such feelings and thoughts , and then proceed with an appreciation for those thoughts and feelings .
It ’s a great way to stop anger in its tracks , and also a great way to focus on a person ’s emotional message , rather than the technical specifics of a particular support group posting .
I look at mindfulness as a way of appreciating both the forest and the trees .
6 . Do n’t believe everything you read .
Related to # 1 about taking what you need and leaving the rest , you should n’t believe everything you read in an online support group .
While it ’s been my experience that most people do n’t relay misinformation nearly as much as professionals fear , it still happens once in awhile .
When it does happen , it ’s usually corrected by another group member in the same conversation thread .
But sometimes the misinformation comes in the form of an opinion , and therefore there may not be as easily recognized or corrected .
When in doubt , check it out —
Google is always just a click away .
7. Support groups are n’t for everyone .
Some people will try all of these tips when joining a support group and still do n’t “ get it ” after giving it a try .
Do n’t be worried — support groups are n’t for everyone .
Some people just do n’t get much emotional support or feel “ supported ” in such groups .
Some people view it as just a place to complain and do n’t see how people are also trying to break out of old , unhealthy patterns .
They are n’t right for everyone .
Support groups work best when you come into one with an understanding that different people are there for different reasons .
Some will be more supportive than others , and that will come out in what they say or how they respond to you .
That ’s not a reflection on you , that ’s a reflection on the diversity of people and their differing needs .
Online support groups have helped millions of people online for the past two decades .
I hope these tips help you enjoy one today .

7 Tips for Making the Most of Online Support Groups
Canon announce new flagship studio and landscape camera codename donkey aka Canon 5DS
Once again canon are late to the party .
Nikon realised having 2 models like the d800 and d800e was a bad plan so release the d810 …
Canon have now got similar high resolution bodies with the 5ds and 5ds r.. we back in the 80’s with RS turbo ’s and cosworths !
What a glorious time that was .
It also coincides with film which is awesome too .
New cameras are always better than old cameras thats a fact .
I will be able to pick this camera up and use it to take photos of the kids .
Remember the selling point of full frame cameras was better noise performance than your crappy DX body .. well canon have managed to break this barrier and give us the double whammy of the same ISO performance as DX plus a more restrictive ISO range .. so it ’s a win-win !
Do n’t worry though they ’ve also stripped the video features away so that you ’re better buying a digital rebel .
Canon actually have a marketing department they have worked out how to charge you more for less .
This is always the case like the McClaren F1 I drive is more than my ferrari
If I want medium format I ’d pick up a film body or the much better Pentax 645Z .
The pentax does everything better .
The lenses are cheaper and you ’re not having to cram everything onto a small sensor .
Luckily no -one has heard of pentax so Canon and Nikon are safe .
The canon 5DS will perform like your Canon 7d2 but with less video options and less high iso sensitivity so you can use the 7d2 and the 5ds and get the same great performance .
As we ’ve found with the nikon high resolution bodies you need superb technique to see any measurable difference , whilst people are configuring their canon 5ds turbo RS with go faster stripes I ’ll be out making photos with my awesome film cameras and nikon d810 .
Though i can shoot great photos with my iphone too as i am so awesome .
On the plus side is makes nikon cameras a lot more attractive to people now so thanks canon and my mate Chuck must be scratching his head on this one .
Here ’s a product shot my mate chuck sent me .
Nuclear energy and energy research are among the big winners in the proposed $ 28.4 billion Energy Department fiscal 2011 budget the White House unveiled today .
The almost 5 percent increase in funding from fiscal 2010 covers a $ 36 billion boost in loan guarantee authority for nuclear power facilities for a total of $ 54 billion , $ 300 million for an innovative energy research program , and a $ 226 million increase in funding for the Office of Science for research and development of " breakthrough " technologies for a total of $ 5.1 billion .
The White House proposed the additional funds to DOE even as Obama has called for a freeze on non-military spending at 2010 levels .
Obama said his budget request would " build on the largest investment in clean energy in history , as well as increase investment in scientific research . "
In keeping with his theme that the United States is at risk of falling behind the rest of the world in clean energy , Obama said those programs will produce the " jobs of the future " in the United States .
" We also continue to lay a new foundation for lasting growth , which is essential , as well , " Obama said today at the White House .
" Just as it would be a terrible mistake to borrow against our children 's future to pay our way today , it would be equally wrong to neglect their future by failing to invest in areas that will determine our economic success in this new century . "
DOE projects did not go unscathed in the administration 's new battle to slow the deficit spending .
The administration proposed to cancel the $ 20 million renovation of the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center , a linear accelerator built 30 years ago .
The Obama administration says it no longer plays a critical role in weapons research .
" We 're saving $ 20 million by stopping the refurbishment of a Department of Energy science center that the Department of Energy does not want to refurbish , " Obama said .
Local lawmakers might disagree with the proposal , however , and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) has significant influence over DOE 's budget .
As promised , the White House 's proposed budget also eliminates funding for development of the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain , Nev. ; moves all administration to the Office of Nuclear Energy ; and " will discontinue " its repository license application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The budget includes $ 98 million to fund various state and local agencies associated with the project , to wind down the project and to provide $ 5 million for a " blue ribbon " commission to find an alternative solution to Yucca Mountain .
Energy research
The administration would continue its push to advance clean energy research and development by pouring $ 300 million into the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy , or ARPA -E , an innovative program designed to develop transformational energy technologies .
The program got its official start with a $ 15 million appropriation in fiscal 2009 and a $ 400 million boost from the stimulus .
But Congress appropriated no funds for the high - risk , high - reward research program in fiscal 2010 .
Administration officials , including Energy Secretary Steven Chu , have championed the program , and the boost in this year 's funding request is a show of confidence for the program , which has so far awarded 37 grants of about $ 4 million each .
Under the administration 's request , funding for ARPA - E would be pulled out of the Office of Science and funded separately .
The Office of Science would also see a significant jolt in funding under the president 's request .
The administration would provide the office , which operates the bulk of DOE 's research and development programs as well as 10 of the nation 's 17 national laboratories , with $ 5.12 billion , an increase of about 4.5 percent over fiscal 2010 appropriated levels .
Contributing to that boost is a $ 226 million increase in basic research and laboratory funding .
A program funding basic energy research would get a 12 percent boost over fiscal 2010 appropriated levels to discover new ways to produce , store and use energy .
The $ 1.8 billion request for basic energy sciences would support fundamental research as well as two innovative programs championed by Chu : the energy frontier research centers and energy " innovation hubs . "
In its funding request for fiscal 2010 , the administration called for funding eight hubs in various energy and engineering disciplines , but Congress provided appropriations for three .
The request for fiscal 2011 does not specify whether the additional six hubs should be funded .
Renewable energy
As with the overall DOE budget , the administration is asking Congress for a 5 percent increase for the energy efficiency and renewable energy section of the budget .
The requests reflect a sharp turn toward Democratic - favored sources of energy such as wind and solar and energy - saving methods such as weatherization .
Those increases come at the expense of the George W. Bush administration 's favorites like hydropower and hydrogen .
Weatherization programs are the biggest winner .
The administration sought $ 385 million , an 83 percent increase from the $ 210 million that Congress approved last year .
The request for wind power jumped 54 percent , from $ 80 million last year to $ 123 million this year .
The administration also wants a big boost in solar programs , seeking a hike from $ 225 million last year to $ 302 million this year , which would be a 34 percent increase .
The budget proposal recommends a 21 percent cut for the hydrogen technology program , taking it from $ 174 million to $ 137 million .
But that is not unexpected .
President George W. Bush had made the idea of hydrogen cars the centerpiece of his renewable energy and energy independence plans .
But the Obama administration essentially sought to nix the program .
It requested zero dollars for the hydrogen program and suggested limiting research to nonvehicle fuel cells .
The Senate did not share the same disdain and put $ 190 million in the bill .
In conference , lawmakers settled on the $ 174 million figure .
Hydropower , a favorite of Western developers , would also take a cut if Obama gets his way .
The administration is seeking to slice the program 's funds from $ 50 million to $ 41 million , a 9 percent cut .
The administration 's 2011 budget also includes $ 500 million to cover initial fees , or " credit subsidies , " to support the $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion in loan guarantee authority for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects .
Fossil energy
Fossil energy programs would decrease slightly from fiscal 2010 appropriated levels , but carbon capture and sequestration research , development and demonstration projects will remain strongly funded .
The president requested $ 587 million for the Office of Fossil Energy after the office was appropriated with a little more than $ 700 million in fiscal 2010 .
That figure was supplemented by $ 3.4 billion for carbon capture and storage projects in the stimulus bill .
The fiscal 2011 request includes no funding for FutureGen , a $ 2.4 billion public - private project envisioned as a commercial - scale integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) power plant with carbon capture and sequestration capability .
The program was conceived and then axed by George W. Bush 's administration before being resurrected by the Obama administration last year , although the administration has not given its final word on the project 's future .
Exelon Corp. gave a show of confidence this weekend by announcing it would join the FutureGen Alliance ( see related story ) .
And DOE is expected to announce a decision in the coming weeks about whether the project has obtained the required additional funding and cost reductions .
DOE has said it plans to spend about $ 1.1 billion on the Illinois project , but the vast majority of that funding will come from the $ 3.4 billion for carbon capture and storage in the stimulus law .
The president would cut $ 34 million in funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve compared with appropriated fiscal 2010 levels .
The requested $ 210 million would provide ongoing storage site operations and maintenance activities as well as provide further insurance against oil supply disruptions .
The president 's budget would cancel plans for new site expansion proposed by previous budgets and appropriations and instead use those funds to account for the cut .
Nuclear energy
The most significant item for nuclear energy is laid out in the loan guarantee program , but the 2011 proposed budget also provides a 5 percent increase for research and development of nuclear technology for a total request of $ 824 million .
The budget would eliminate funding for programs created under Bush including Nuclear Power 2010 and Generation IV .
Obama instead seeks to create new R&D programs " to better align program functions with strategic goals . "
The budget supports work on small modular reactors , long - term use of lightweight reactors and next generation nuclear reactors with $ 195 million for the " Reactor Concepts Research , Development and Demonstration " program .
The White House also proposes $ 99 million to work on " cross- cutting " and " transformative " solutions for the full nuclear cycle in the " Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies " program , which includes $ 24 million for a modeling and simulation hub .
The " Fuel Cycle R&D " program aimed at researching and developing waste recycling technology receives $ 201 million , a more than $ 40 million jump from the $ 136 million provided by Congress in the 2010 funding .
Nonproliferation numbers jump for NNSA
The National Nuclear Security Administration ( NNSA ) would receive $ 11.2 billion under the president 's request , a 13.5 percent increase from fiscal 2010 appropriations .
That amounts to just over 39.4 percent of DOE's $ 28.4 budget request .
In its comments on the proposed budget , the administration highlighted a $ 550 million increase in the request for programs aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation , including " full funding " of programs to secure nuclear material ; develop technology that targets nuclear testing and smuggling ; and support international treaties , controls and regulations for nonproliferation .
The request includes $ 8.1 billion to improve the safety , security and effectiveness of the nuclear weapons stockpile , a $ 750 million boost over 2010 appropriations , DOE said .
When broken out by program , NNSA 's nonproliferation activities would see a 22 percent increase in funding under the proposed budget , going from nearly $ 2.2 billion appropriated in fiscal 2010 to $ 2.687 billion .
The Global Threat Reduction Initiative would see the biggest increase , going from $ 224 million in 2010 appropriations to $ 559 million for a 67 percent boost .
That program seeks to secure vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials at civilian sites around the world and addressing nuclear material and research reactors .
Programs for nonproliferation and verification R&D and international nuclear materials protection would also see increases , while a program for nonproliferation and international security would get slightly less funding and a program for the elimination of weapons - grade plutonium production , scheduled to complete its work in 2010 , would be zeroed out from the $ 83 million appropriated in fiscal 2010 .
A program for surplus fissile materials disposition would increase by 31 percent to $ 917 million under the proposal .
In last year 's budget , that program included funding for mixed - oxide fuel fabrication , though this year 's document does not specify what that includes .
NNSA funding for the environmental cleanup of defense sites would be slightly below 2010 appropriated figures under the proposed budget , with a proposed $ 5.58 billion , or a 2.5 percent decrease .
Non-defense environmental cleanup is cut under the proposed budget to $ 238 million , after Congress provided $ 245 million for 2010 .

これはISOLATION LEVELの問題じゃないですか？1個目はREPEATABLE
READがあれば大丈夫か。2個目はSERIALIZABLEが必要かな
これについて考えてみました。説明を分かりやすくするため「 2. counts レコードの生成におけるレースコンディション」について先に考えます。
これらをふまえて 、 「 2. counts レコードの生成におけるレースコンディション」についてレースコンディションが発生しそうな3パターンと、それに対するISOLATION LEVEL 毎の挙動をまとめます。
LOCK IN SHARE MODE で実行すると何が起こるかは、以下のマニュアルが参考になります。
このレベルは REPEATABLE READ と似ていますが、 InnoDB は暗黙的に全ての単純な SELECT ステートメント を SELECT ... LOCK IN SHARE MODE にコミットします 。
1. クリック数のインクリメントにおけるレースコンディションの場合
この問題の根本は 「 プロセスA , B がそれぞれが同じクリック数取得してしまう」ことです。本来ならプロセスB はプロセ スA がインクリメントした結果の値を取得しなければなりません。
これについても 、SERIALIZABLE
ならば対応可能な問題ですが、REPEATABLE
READ だと問題が発生する場合があります。例を書きます。
プロセ スA がクリック数をインクリメントし、トランザクションをCOMMIT する前にプロセ スB が現在のクリック数を取得した REPEATABLE READ の場合、他トランザクション のCOMMIT されていない変更を見ることができません。よって、プロセスB が取得するクリック数はプロセ スA がインクリメントする前の値になります。結果、プロセスA , B 共に同じ値を新しいクリック数として書き込み、実質インクリメントは1回か行われません
SERIALIZABLE の場合、プロセ スA がクリック数を更新しているので、プロセスB のSELECT はプロセ スA のトランザクション がCOMMIT するまで待たされます。よって、プロセスB が取得できるクリック数はプロセ スA によってインクリメントされた後の値となります。結果、インクリメントは正常に2回行われます
結論とし て 「 1 . クリック数のインクリメントにおけるレースコンディション」についてもSERIALIZABLE
なら防止可能でした。
ちなみに、この例に対してはより適切な方法があります。
ここにある通り 、SERIALIZABLE
で対応する場合には、後にUPDATE
を実行したトランザクションでデッドロックによるエラーが発生します。よって、正常な動作をさせるためには、もう一度SELECT
によって値を取得し直さなければなりません。
そもそもこの問題の根本は 「 プロセスA , B がそれぞれが同じクリック数を読みとってしまう」ことでした。よって、プロセスB のSELECT 自体をプロ セ スA のトランザクション がCOMMIT されるまでブロックできれば良い訳です。そして、これを実現するのが「 SELECT 〜 FOR UPDATE 」です。このクエリを実行したプロセス( MySQL レベルではセッション ) はSELECT 対象となった行の排他ロックを取得し、トランザクション中はロックを保持します。なので、後発のSELECT
は排他ロックを獲得できるまで待たされ、ブロックされたSELECT
の実行結果には先にロックを保持していたトランザクションの実行結果が反映されるという寸法です。
さらにちなむと 、Rails のfind メソッドは 「 : lock => true 」 というオプションを渡してやると「 FOR UPDATE 」付きSELECT を発行します。但し、「 find_or_create_by」系のメソッドではこのオプションが無効なので使いどころは微妙かもしれません。
今回の問題について 、ISOLATION LEVEL のことは考えていませんでした。ツッコミいただき感謝です!勉強になりました。
It ’s been the political equivalent of an intervention : in recent weeks , Democrats have been bombarded with advice about how they should reinvent their economic agenda .
The electorate , we hear , wants Barack Obama to be more of an economic populist but less of an ambitious reformer .
He has to aggressively create jobs but also be less spendthrift .
This advice may be contradictory , but then so are the economic opinions of the many angry voters who are animating what ’s being called the new populism .
Whereas the economic populism of the eighteen - nineties and the right - wing cultural populism of recent years represented reasonably coherent ideologies , this new populism has stitched together incompatible concerns and goals into one “ I ’m mad as hell ” quilt .
The people may have spoken .
It ’s just not clear that they ’re making any sense .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
One view of this new populist uprising is that it ’s about Main Street versus Wall Street , and is grounded in voters ’ fury at the bailout of irresponsible bankers .
But that ’s too simple .
While the banks are public enemy No. 1 , there ’s a much wider - ranging anger out there , a sense that everyone except the ordinary middle - class person is getting some sort of handout .
Big Business , Big Government , and Big Labor : voters do n’t seem to like any of them .
The bailout of the auto industry , after all , was as unpopular as the bailout of the banks , even though it was much tougher on the companies ( G.M. and Chrysler went bankrupt ; shareholders were wiped out , and C.E.O.s pushed out ) , and even though the biggest beneficiaries of the deal were ordinary autoworkers .
You might have expected a deal that helped workers keep their jobs to play well in a country spooked by ballooning unemployment .
Yet most voters hated it .
Similarly , the failure of free markets during the financial crisis might have led people to think that the government should be more involved in the economy .
Instead , the percentage of Americans who think government is trying to do too much is higher than it ’s been since the late nineties .
Health - care reform offers a case study in this .
The bills passed by Congress , whatever their flaws , would do things that voters overwhelmingly say they support : extend coverage to the uninsured , ban the worst practices of insurers , and guarantee insurance for people who lose their jobs .
Yet more voters now oppose the bills than support them , with many saying that the government is overreaching .
And , while voters routinely say that the rising cost of health care is a problem , it is the bills ’ cost - control provisions — including a tax on expensive insurance plans and rules to restrain Medicare spending — that have proved especially unpopular .
On top of this , many people are just annoyed with the whole process : a survey of voters who supported Obama in 2008 but voted for Scott Brown in the recent Massachusetts Senate race found that forty - one per cent of those who opposed health - care reform were n’t sure whether reform went too far or not far enough .
In short , they do n’t know why they ’re against reform ; they just are .
It ’s a bit like Marlon Brando in “ The Wild One . ”
Asked what he ’s rebelling against , he says , “ Whaddya got ? ”
One thing voters do want is jobs .
But even here populist sentiment is at odds with itself .
People want the government to help provide jobs , but they also want it to cut the deficit .
Of course , one can worry about rising long - term debt and still think that , right now , more deficit spending is crucial to the nascent recovery .
But angry voters are n’t that nuanced in their thinking : they want the government to tighten its belt and fight unemployment at the same time .
Not that they believe that the government ’s efforts will do any good : three - quarters of Americans think that much of the money in the first stimulus program was wasted , perhaps because they ca n’t see all the jobs that the stimulus saved , only the nearly eight million jobs that the economy has lost .
The anger is understandable , and voters are under no obligation to be consistent .
But that does n’t make the new populism any less of a challenge politically , since , at the moment , voters will find something wrong whatever is done : if Democrats pass a stimulus package , they ’ll be lambasted for increasing the deficit ; if they do n’t pass a stimulus , they ’ll be attacked for not caring about jobs .
On top of that , both history and theory suggest that tough economic times make people less interested in sharing burdens , not more .
One recent study found that people who had been treated unfairly became more selfish .
It ’s hard to pass reform programs that depend on a sense of solidarity — like health - care reform or cap - and - trade — when voters are trying desperately to protect what they already have .
The temptation , then , is simply to abandon ambitious plans in an attempt to annoy no one .
But a better approach would be to recognize that voters ’ anger is less ideological than pragmatic : at heart , it ’s the product of the weak economy and the poor job market .
( The movement that today ’s populism most closely resembles is Ross Perot ’s , which arose , similarly , during a downturn . )
And while that means that there ’s no way to make voters happy without improving the economy , it also means that , if you start creating jobs , people will start to feel better .
Obviously , small initiatives that nod to people ’s concerns ( like the deficit commission ) can help .
But what matters most is getting the economy moving again — even if doing so means handing out tax credits to businesses or magnifying voters ’ frustration with government spending .
It may bring some short - term political pain , but the only way out is through . ♦
Rare copy of Beatles ' first LP found in Oxfam shop and sold to raise cash for Haiti
Rare find : The sleeve of The Beatles ' first album Please Please Me
A rare copy of The Beatles ’ first album Please Please Me found in an Oxfam shop has raised more than £ 1,300 for the charity ’s Haiti appeal .
The record – one of only 300 original pressings – was discovered in a carrier bag of junk handed in by an anonymous donor in Liverpool .
It was sold on eBay to a collector in Hampshire .
Please Please
Me hit the top of the UK album charts in May 1963 and remained there for 30 weeks .
The first pressing was released by Parlophone and is one of the most sought - after items among collectors .
Gerard O’Flanagan , manager of the Oxfam shop on Bold Street , said : ' We found the album in a bag with other items .
' We have been so busy with customers coming in to either donate cash for the Haiti appeal or donating items to be sold for Haiti .
‘ The record was in good condition , and the cover had only a bit of wear and tear around the edges . ’
' When we realised that it was the first album released by the Beatles and that it was one of the first 300 pressed , we went straight onto our eBay account and put it up for auction .
' We were holding in our hands one of the rarest and most collectable items in existence . '
Bidders were encouraged to come to the Bold Street shop to take a look at the record for themselves .
Mr O'Flanagan added : ' We are very pleased with the sale of the album .
Right now we are focusing on raising as much as possible for the Haiti appeal . '
Oxfam has a 200 - strong team working round the clock in Haiti to provide clean water , sanitation facilities , latrine slabs and hygiene kits to over 110,000 earthquake victims .
Millions of pounds have been donated by the public so far .
The Fisker Karma is going to be built around a state of the art new aluminum space - frame chassis according to a brand spanking new press release from Fisker Automotive .
Originally revealed on the 14 January 2008 at the North American International Auto Show the Fisker caused quite the stir with it ’s flowing lines and cutting edge technology , the newly revealed space - frame is harnesses NASA level engineering and promises some of the highest strength and rigidity ratings of any high - end sports car on the market .
Valmet Automotive will assemble the space frames at its facility in Uusikaupunki , Finland ( just try saying that out loud , I double dare you ) .
Pictures of the chassis are embargoed until after the unveiling at the Geneva Motorshow ( March 2 - 14 ) but we will have them here for you just as soon as we are allowed to .
Fisker is quite public about their plans to launch a second line of lower cost , high volume green automobiles by 2012 and the rumours flying around the Electric - Car - News world is that it just might slip a prototype of this all new car out at Geneva this year , which we hardly need tell you would kick up quite a frenzy throughout the motoring world .
Here ’s hoping .
Performance Specifications
0 - 60 mph – 5.8 seconds
Top Speed – 125 mph

Economy – 67 mpg ( when using onboard power generation )
Press Release
FISKER AUTOMOTIVE TO DEBUT KARMA ADVANCED ALUMINUM SPACE FRAME AT GENEVA MOTOR SHOW
IRVINE , CA – February 17 , 2010 :
The advanced aluminum space frame underpinning the Fisker Karma incorporates new levels of rigidity and strength that will give the world ’s first premium plug - in hybrid electric vehicle world - class ride and handling characteristics .
It will debut at the Geneva Motor Show March 2 - 14 , 2010 .
Fisker Automotive ’s talented and experienced engineering team designed the Karma ’s space frame around the car ’s unique Q - DRIVE ® series - hybrid powertrain , filing for multiple patents in the process .
Q- DRIVE ® consists of a 2.0 - liter turbocharged ECOTEC ® engine / generator set , a lithium - ion battery pack from A123 Systems , and a rear - mounted 403 hp traction motor assembly .
Though it forms the foundation of a large sedan the Karma space frame ’s rigidity is exceptional even when compared to today ’s sports cars .
By utilizing 5,000 - and 6,000 - series aluminum alloys and a unique extrusion - intensive architecture , the Fisker engineering team achieved the best balance between weight and size .
“ Our top priorities when we designed the Karma ’s aluminum space frame were that it have extremely high torsional rigidity and could be easily modified to accept Karma model variants , ” explained Henrik Fisker , CEO , Fisker Automotive .
“ We benchmarked some of the world ’s best cars to create an all - new space frame that will deliver an exhilarating experience behind the wheel .
A super - structural tunnel running down the car ’s centerline acts as the Karma ’s backbone .
It not only houses the battery pack but acts as a torque tube connecting front and rear sections .
For optimal strength the Karma ’s space frame is joined with 79 meters of precision CMT MIG welds and 1,058 self - piercing rivets .
Each technique is used independently only where necessary to ensure top quality and durability .
The result is an industry - leading space frame that provides a solid foundation for the Karma .
Few cars match its statistics : Static torsional rigidity – the amount the space frame resists twisting forces when entering a ramp at an angle , for example – measures more than 33,000 Newton - meters per degree ( Nm / deg ) .
Static bending rigidity – the amount the space frame resists flexing forces as the car enters a ramp straight on , for example – measures more than 23,000 N/mm .
Dynamic stiffness – the space frame ’s resistance to resonant vibrations like those felt when driving over a sharp bump or rough road surfaces — is also world class .
Priority : Safety
Thanks to intelligent engineering solutions the Karma ’s space frame also provides the utmost in occupant safety and exceeds global crash protection standards .
Front impact protection starts with a patent - pending , multi-cell tempered aluminum crush box that displaces high - impact energy away from passengers .
Its unique design allows it to be easily replaced , reducing repair costs that could lower insurance premiums .
Dual Phase 600 - Series steel reinforced components in the doors and B- pillars provide substantial side impact protection .
And the lithium - ion battery ’s location in the center of the car puts it farthest from impact areas .
Valmet Automotive will assemble the space frames at its state - of - the - art facility in Uusikaupunki , Finland .

Like the symbiotic relationship between trees and fungus , lawyers and humans have an important , interlocking relationship going back to the dawn of man.10 min read
The following is excerpted from " Some Lawyers Are People Too ! " by Hugh L. Dewey , Esq. ( 2009 ) .
Bolding has been added by LectLaw .
Minor changes have been made for grammatical correctness .
The evolution and history of lawyers is very similar to the evolution and history of mankind .
Like the symbiotic relationship between trees and fungus , lawyers and humans have an important , interlocking relationship going back to the dawn of man .
Legal anthropologists have not yet discovered the proverbial first lawyer .
No briefs or pleadings remain from the proto - lawyer that is thought to have been in existence more than 5 million years ago .
Chimpanzees , man 's and lawyer 's closest relative , share 99 % of the same genes .
New research has definitely proven that chimpanzees do not have the special L1a gene that distinguishes lawyers from everyone else .
( See Johnson , Dr. Mark .
" Lawyers in the Mist ? " Science Digest , May 1990 : pp. 43 -52 . )
This disproved the famous outcome of the Scopes Monkey Trial in which Clarence Darrow proved that monkeys were also lawyers .
Charles Darwin , Esquire , theorized in the mid-1800s that tribes of lawyers existed as early as 2.5 million years ago .
However , in his travels , he found little evidence to support this theory .
Legal anthropology suffered a setback at the turn of the century in the famous Piltdown Lawyer scandal .
In order to prove the existence of the missing legal link , a scientist claimed he had found the skull of an ancient lawyer .
The skull later turned out to be homemade , combining the large jaw of a modern lawyer with the skull cap of a gorilla .
When the hoax was discovered , the science of legal anthropology was set back 50 years .
The first hard scientific proof of the existence of lawyers was discovered by Dr. Margaret Leakey at the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania .
Her find consisted of several legal fragments , but no full case was found intact at the site .
Carbon dating has estimated the find at between 1 million and 1.5 million years ago .
However , through legal anthropology methods , it has been theorized that the site contains the remains of a fraud trial in which the defendant sought to disprove liability on the basis of his inability to stand erect .
The case outcome is unknown , but it coincides with the decline of the Australopithecus and the rise of Homo Erectus in the world .
( See Leakey , Margaret A . " The case of erectus hominid . "
Legal Anthropology , March 1947 : pp. 153 . )
In many sites dating from 250,000 to 1,000,000 years ago , legal tools have been uncovered .
Unfortunately , the tools are often in fragments , making it difficult to gain much knowledge .
The first complete site discovered has been dated to 150,000 years ago .
Stone pictograph briefs were found concerning a land boundary dispute between a tribe of Neanderthals and a tribe of Cro-Magnons .
This decision in favor of the Cro-Magnon tribe led to a successive set of cases , spelling the end for the Neanderthal tribe .
( See Widget , Dr. John B. " Did Cro-Magnon have better lawyers ? "
Natural History , June 1926 : p. 135 .
See also Cook , Benjamin .
Very Very Early Land Use Cases .
Legal Press , 1953 . )
Until 10,000 years ago , lawyers wandered around in small tribes , seeking out clients .
Finally , small settlements of lawyers began to spring up in the Ur Valley , the birthplace of modern civilization .
With settlement came the invention of writing .
Previously , lawyers had relied on oral bills for collection of payment , which made collection difficult and meant that if a client died before payment ( with life expectancy between 25 and 30 and the death penalty for all cases , most clients died shortly after their case was resolved ) , the bill would remain uncollected .
With written bills , lawyers could continue collection indefinitely .
In the late 1880s , legal anthropologists cracked the legal hieroglyphic language when they were able to determine the meaning of the now famous Rosetta Stone Contract .
( See Harrison , Franklin D. The Rosetta Bill .
Doubleday , 1989 . )
The famous first paragraph can be recited verbatim by almost every lawyer :
" In consideration of 20,000 Assyrians workers , 3,512 live goats , and 400,000 hectares of dates , the undersigned hereby conveys all of the undersigned 's right , title , and interest in and to the property commonly known as the Sphinx , more particularly described on Stone A attached hereto and made a part hereof . "
The attempted sale of the Sphinx resulted in the Pharaoh issuing a country - wide purge of all lawyers .
Many were slaughtered , and the rest wandered in the desert for years looking for a place to practice .
Greece and Rome saw the revival of the lawyer in society .
Lawyers were again allowed to freely practice , and they took full advantage of this opportunity .
Many records exist from this classic period .
Legal cases ranged from run -of - the - mill goat contract cases to the well - known product liability case documented in the Estate of Socrates vs. Hemlock Wine Company .
( See Wilson , Phillips ed. Famous Roman Cases .
Houghton , Mifflin publishers , 1949 . )
The most famous lawyer of this period was Hammurabi the Lawyer .
His code of law gave lawyers hundreds of new business opportunities .
By creating a massive legal system , the demand for lawyers increased ten - fold .
In those days , almost any thief or crook could kill a sheep , hang - up a sheepskin , and practice law , unlike the highly regulated system today which limits law degrees to only those thieves and crooks who have n't been convicted of a major felony .
The explosion in the number of lawyers coincided with the development of algebra , the mathematics of legal billing .
Pythagoras , a famous Greek lawyer , is revered for his Pythagorean Theorem , which proved the mathematical quandary of double billing .
This new development allowed lawyers to become wealthy members of their community , as well as to enter politics , an area previously off - limits to lawyers .
Despite the mathematical soundness of double billing , some lawyers went to extremes .
Julius Caesar , a Roman lawyer and politician , was murdered by several clients for his record hours billed in late February and early March of 44 B.C. ( His murder was the subject of a play by lawyer William Shakespeare .
When Caesar discovered that one of his murderers was his law partner Brutus , he murmured the immortal lines , " Et tu Brute , " which can be loosely translated from Latin as " my estate keeps twice the billings . " )
Before the Roman Era , lawyers did not have specific areas of practice .
During the period , legal specialists arose to meet the demands of the burgeoning Roman population .
Sports lawyers counseled gladiators , admiralty lawyers drafted contracts for the great battles in the Coliseum , international lawyers traveled with the great Roman armies to force native lawyers to sign treaties of adhesion — many of which lasted hundreds of years until they were broken by the barbarian lawyers who descended on Rome from the North and East — and the ever - popular Pro Bono lawyers ( Latin for " ca n't get a real job " ) who represented Christians and lost all their cases for 300 years .
As time went on , the population of lawyers continued to grow until 1 out of every 2 Romans was a lawyer .
Soon lawyers were intermarrying .
This produced children who were legally entitled to practice Roman law , but with the many defects that such a match produced , the quality of lawyers degenerated , resulting in an ever - increasing defective legal society and the introduction of accountants .
Pressured by the legal barbarians from the North with their sign - or - die negotiating skills , Rome fell , and the world entered the Dark Ages .
During the Dark Ages , many of the legal theories and practice developed during the golden age were forgotten .
Lawyers lost the art of double billing , the thirty - hour day , the 15 - minute phone call , and the conference stone .
Instead , lawyers became virtually manual laborers , sharing space with primitive doctor - barbers .
Many people sought out magicians and witches instead of lawyers since they were cheaper and easier to understand .
The Dark Ages for lawyers ended in England in 1078 .
Norman lawyers discovered a loophole in Welsh law that allowed William the Conqueror to foreclose an old French loan and take most of England , Scotland , and Wales .
William rewarded the lawyers for their work , and soon lawyers were again accepted in society .
Lawyers became so popular during this period that they were able to heavily influence the kings of Britain , France , and Germany .
After a Turkish corporation stiffed the largest and oldest English law firm , the partners of the firm convinced these kings to start a Bill Crusade , sending collection knights all the way to Jerusalem to seek payment .
A major breakthrough for lawyers occurred in the 17th century .
Blackstone the Magician , on a trip through Rome , unearthed several dozen ancient Roman legal texts .
This new knowledge spread through the legal community like the black plague .
Up until that point , lawyers used the local language of the community for their work .
Since many smart non-lawyers could then determine what work , if any , the lawyer had done , lawyers often lost clients , and sometimes their head .
Using Blackstone 's finds , lawyers could use Latin to hide what they did so that only other lawyers understood what was happening in any lawsuit .
Blackstone was a hero to all lawyers until , of course , he was sued for copyright infringement by another lawyer .
Despite his loss , Blackstone is still fondly remembered by most lawyers as the father of legal Latin .
" Res ipsa loquitur " was Blackstone 's favorite saying ( " my bill speaks for itself " ) , and it is still heard today .
Many lawyers made history during the Middle Ages.
Genghis Kahn , Esq. , from a family of Jewish lawyers , Hun & Kahn , pioneered the practice of merging with law offices around Asia Minor at any cost .
At one time , the firm was the largest in Asia and Europe .
Their success was their downfall .
Originally a large personal injury firm ( if you did n't pay their bill , they personally injured you ) , they became conservative over time and were eventually overwhelmed by lawyers from the West .
Vlad Dracul , Esq. , a medical malpractice specialist , was renowned for his knowledge of anatomy , and few jurors would side against him for fear of his special bill ( his bill was placed atop 20 - foot wooden spears on which the non-paying client was placed ) .
Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci , Esq. , was multi-talented .
Besides having a busy law practice , he was an artist and inventor .
His most famous case was in defense of himself .
M. Lisa vs. da Vinci ( Italian Superior Court 1513 ) involved a product liability suit over a painting da Vinci delivered to the plaintiff .
The court , in ruling that the painting was not defective despite the missing eyebrows , issued the famous line , " This court may not know art , but it knows what it likes , and it likes the painting . "
This was not surprising since the plaintiff was known for her huge , caterpillar - like eyebrows .
Da Vinci was able to convince the court that he was entitled not only to damages but to attorneys ' fees , costs , and punitive damages as well .
The court , taking one last look at the plaintiff , granted the request .
A land dispute case in the late 15th century is still studied today for the clever work of Christopher Columbus , Esq .
He successfully convinced an Aztec court , in Columbus vs. 1,000,000 Acres that since the Indians did not believe in possession , they could not claim the land in question .
Therefore , his claim had to be given priority .
Despite the fact that the entire court was sacrificed to the gods , the case held and Spain took an early legal lead in the New World .
As the New World was colonized , England eventually surpassed Spain as the leading colonizer .
England began sending all of its criminals and thieves to the New World .
This mass dumping of lawyers to the states would come back to haunt England .
Eventually , the grandchildren of these pioneer lawyers would successfully defeat King George III in the now famous King George III v. 100 Bags of Tea .
England by this time was now dreadfully short of lawyers .
The new American lawyers exploited this shortfall and , after a seven - year legal war , defeated the British and created the United States , under the famous motto , " All lawyers are created equal . "
England never forgot this lesson and immediately stopped its practice of sending lawyers to the colonies .
This policy left Australia woefully deficient in lawyers .
With stories of legal success common in the late 1700s , more and more people attempted to become lawyers .
This process of stealing a shingle worried the more successful lawyers .
To stem this tide as well as to create a new profit center , these lawyers passed laws requiring all future lawyers to be restricted from practice unless they went to an approved law school .
The model school from which all legal education rules developed was Harvard Law School .
Harvard , established in 1812 , set the standard for legal education when , in 1816 , it created the standardized system for legal education .
This system was based on the Socratic method .
At most universities , the students questioned the teacher / professor to gain knowledge .
These students would bill their professors , and if the bill went unfulfilled , the students usually hung up their law professor for failure of payment At Harvard , the tables were turned , with the professors billing the students .
This method enriched the professors and remains the standard in use in most law schools in America and England .
As developed by Harvard , law students took a standard set of courses as follows :
Jurisprudence :
The history of legal billing , from early Greek and Roman billing methods to modern collection techniques .
Torts : French law term for " you get injury , we keep 40 % . "
Teaches students ambulance - chasing techniques .
Contracts :
Teaches that despite an agreement between two parties ( the contract ) , a lawsuit can still be brought .
Civil Procedure : Teaches the tricky arcane rules of court , which were modernized only 150 years ago in New York .
Criminal Law : Speaks for itself .
These courses continue to be used in most law schools throughout the United States .
Despite the restrictions imposed on the practice of law ( a four - year college degree , three years of graduate school , and a state - sponsored examination ) , the quantity of lawyers continues to increase to the point that three out of every five Americans are lawyers .
( In fact , there are over 750,000 lawyers in this country . )
Every facet of life today is controlled by lawyers .
Even Dan Quayle ( a lawyer ) claims , surprise , that there are too many lawyers .
Yet until limits are imposed on legal birth control , the number of lawyers will continue to increase .
Is there any hope ?
We do n't know and frankly do n't care since the author of this book is a successful , wealthy lawyer , the publishers of this book are lawyers , the cashier at the bookstore is a law student , and your mailman is a lawyer .
So instead of complaining , join us and remember , there is no such thing as a one - lawyer town .
First picture of British schoolgirl strangled to death in freak go - kart accident in Hong Kong
Amy Rose Coxall : Scarf got caught in a go - kart engine in Hong Kong
A British schoolgirl was strangled to death in a freak accident when her scarf got caught in the engine of a motorised go - kart in Hong Kong .
Amy Rose Coxall , 15 , a student at a private international school , was racing friends around the track at the city 's Diamond Coast International Kart Circuit when the accident occurred .
Her speeding go - kart veered out of control and ran off the side of the track , spinning to a stop on the grass verge .
The girl ’s friends found her unconscious in her seat with her blue scarf pulled tight around her neck .
Police spokesman Lee Pak - ho said : ' A witness said she was suddenly pulled to one side while driving .
She was found with a scarf wound around her neck . '
Emergency services rushed her to hospital but the girl was certified dead on arrival 45 minutes after the accident at 4.30 pm yesterday afternoon .
Tragic : Friends comfort one another at a Hong Kong hospital after the British teenager was declared dead
Investigation : A police officer examines the go - kart that the victim was driving
Her shocked friends were seen weeping and being comforted by parents in local TV footage as she was admitted to hospital .
Amy Rose and her seven friends - on a week - long Chinese New Year holiday from school - arrived at around noon at the circuit which is open to children aged 11 or above .
The go - karts travel at up to 90 miles per hour and parents or guardians of children must sign a liability waiver .
Accident : Police at the go - kart track in Hong Kong
Safety : Riders must undergo a training session at the four - year - old track
Riders must wear helmets and undergo a training session including a written test and a safety video before being allowed into the go - karts at the four - year - old circuit .
People with long hair are advised to tie it up before racing .
The accident happened on the coldest day of the winter so far in Hong Kong with temperatures in the sub- tropical city falling to 6 degrees Celsius .
Police and investigators at the go - kart track in Hong Kong
Wednesday 's tragedy led to calls from Hong Kong ’s Institute of Advanced Drivers for tighter controls on go - karts , which are not currently regulated by the government because they race on private land .
In 2001 , a 20 - year - old female university student was critically injured and left brain - damaged when her scarf got caught in the wheel of a go - kart on a course in Macau near Hong Kong .
Mercedes are a little bit more optimistic as Nico Rosberg set the fastest time of the day which was hampered by wet weather late morning and early afternoon .
Schumacher had been pessimistic talking to the press yesterday but after looking at the data he was more confident as the team believes they were carrying more fuel than others .
Nico ’s time was only 0.072s slower than the other Nico , “ the Hulk ” Hulkenberg , who set the fastest time of the whole test , so far , yesterday .
He also managed to complete an impressive 128 laps , more than anyone else today .
Fastest times :
P Driver Car Best time Laps Diff. 1 Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1m20.686s 128 2 Sebastian Buemi Toro Rosso ( Ferrari ) 1m21.413s 106 +0.727 3 Jensen Button McLaren ( Mercedes ) 1m21.450s 105 +0.764 4 Rubens Barrichello Williams ( Cosworth ) 1m21.975s 101 +1.289 5 Felipe Massa Ferrari 1m22.344s 115 +1.658 6 Vitaly Petrov Renault 1m22.523s 68 +1.837 7 Adrian Sutil Force India ( Mercedes ) 1m22.606s 61 +1.920 8 Sebastian Vettel Red Bull ( Renault ) 1m23.254s 51 +2.568 9 Jarno Trulli Lotus ( Cosworth ) 1m25.059s 102 +4.373 10 Kamui Kobayshi BMW Sauber ( Ferrari ) 1m26.216s 105 +5.530 11 Timo Glock Virgin ( Cosworth ) 1m26.305 31 +5.619
Over the last 2 days , 3 different teams with different engines have produced the fastest lap times on low fuel that are very close to each other : 1 ) Hulkenberg ( Williams ) 1m20.614s ; 2 ) Alonso ( Ferrari ) 1m20.637s and 3 ) Rosberg ( Mercedes ) 1m20.686s
At the end of the session , before it was unfortunately cut short by a red flag due to Barrichello , both Rosberg and Button were putting in quick 1 m21secs laps .
Button achieved a purple sector 1 ( fastest of the session ) which was then bettered by Rosberg a short time later .
However , both drivers in those laps did not come close to Rosberg ’s time this morning which suggests that the track conditions in sectors 2 and 3 had not dried sufficiently and that both drivers could possibly go quicker than Rosberg fastest time set in the morning .
Rosberg in the Mercedes was quicker than Button at the very end of the session but of course we do n’t know the fuel loads
Most teams did race simulation runs today – Rosberg , Massa and Button were all doing 1m27s pace on a heavy fuel load at the start of their runs
Vettel was absent on track for most of the day as the Red Bull fixed a fuel pump problem
Not a good day for Kobayashi in the Sauber as his quickest time was 5.5secs off the quickest .
However , they must have concentrated solely on heavy fuel running and the rain may have caused the times to seem slower than they actually were .
His quickest time was on lap 7 of the 105 laps he completed today without any apparent technical issues .
Kobayashi put in some exciting laps in the rain … even going round in slicks at one point !

An Adobe product manager has apologized for allowing a potentially serious bug in Flash Player to remain unfixed for more than 16 months .
The admission , by Emmy Huang , product manager for Flash , came a week after Apple CEO Steve Jobs lambasted Adobe engineers as " lazy " and said when Macs crash , " more often than not it ’s because of Flash . "
Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch struck back , insisting that at Adobe , " we do n't ship Flash with any known crash bugs . "
The crash bug at issue in Huang 's blog post published over the weekend was reported in September 2008 , but it has yet to be excised from release versions of Flash .
She said a beta version of Flash scheduled for official release later this year has fixed the problem .
She went on to say the flaw should have been patched in one of the interim updates released over the past 16 months .
" I want to reiterate that it is our policy that crashes are serious ' A ' priority bugs , and it is a tenet of the Flash Player team that ActionScript developers should never be able to crash Flash Player , " she wrote .
" If a crash occurs , it is by definition a bug , and one that Adobe takes very seriously . "
The bug in version 9 of the software was reported by security researcher Matthew Dempsey on Adobe 's Flash Player bugbase .
Flash 10 was released a month later , making it impractical to fix the flaw in the next release .
The report " slipped through the cracks , " an omission that allowed the bug to languish even as other flaws were repaired in subsequent updates .
Over the past year , critics ( El Reg among them ) have assailed Adobe for a steady stream of security bugs that have been exploited in drive - by and email attacks that aim to install keyloggers and other types of malware on the machines of unwary users .
Jobs , meanwhile , timed his remarks to the release of the iPad , which is notable for completely shunning the Adobe media program .
CTO Lynch flatly rejected the criticism from Jobs , arguing that " if there was such a widespread problem historically Flash could not have achieved its wide use today . "
As if a product 's widespread adoption were a guarantee that is was free from serious defects .
Huang 's post seems to admit as much .
But its forthrightness also suggests Adobe may finally be heeding critics .
" I intend to follow up with the product manager ( or Adobe rep ) who worked on this issue to make sure it does n't happen again , " she wrote .
While the bug is said to generate only a simple crash , attackers often go on to figure out how to exploit such flaws to remotely execute malicious code .
Dempsky has additional details about the bug here .
A demo - which he warns will cause browsers to crash - is here .
" I 'm not an Apple fan boy out to prove Steve Jobs right in Apple 's decision not to support Flash on the iPhone / iPad , " he explained .
" Instead , I 'm just a software engineer who at one time had to deal with Adobe 's sorry excuse for a development platform and made an earnest effort on several occasions at helping them improve it for everyone . " ®
A 56 - year - old American man is being held in a Thunder Bay jail after police in Georgia say he tried to solicit sex with a child online .
Patrick Molesti of Woodstock , Georgia , will face a detention review hearing in Toronto on Wednesday morning via video link .
Molesti is wanted by the Cherokee County Sheriff ’s office on child pornography charges .
Police there also allege that he tried to solicit sex with a five - year - old child over the Internet .
He was arrested at the Greyhound Bus depot in Thunder Bay on Friday .
Molesti moved to the U.S. from France , and had been on the run from American authorities for almost two weeks when he was captured .
The Canada Border Services Agency said it got a tip from the U.S. Marshal ’s office that Molesti was in Canada .
Border services agents then tracked him to a bus en route from Calgary to Montreal .
He was arrested when the bus arrived in Thunder Bay , said CBSA spokesman Chris Kealey .
How Molesti got into Canada and what he was doing here is still being investigated , Kealey told the Star .
Calgary Police suspect he may have entered Canada through Montana .
Calgary Police confirmed Molesti was in the city .
Officers worked together with the RCMP , CBSA , the Toronto Police and the Thunder Bay police to co-ordinate the arrest , said Staff Sgt. Todd Zelensky , with the Calgary Police .
The investigation began when police in Cherokee County got an anonymous tip about a man trying to purchase a five - year - old for sexual gratification over the Internet .
Police began investigating the claim , conducted a search warrant and seized Molesti ’s computer , Capt .
Joe Perkins of Cherokee County Sheriff ’s office told the Star .
After obtaining another search warrant to view the data on the computer ’s hard drive , Perkins said police found images of child pornography and evidence of solicitation for a child .
There was no evidence of a rendezvous or that a predator was going to Canada to meet or retrieve a child in Canada , Perkins said .
“ It was more that he was putting out feelers , ” he said .
Perkins said Molesti was in the United States legally , but fled Cherokee County when police advised him they had a warrant for his arrest .
The next step will be to get him sent back to the U.S. to face charges there , said Perkins .
“ We ’re waiting for him to get back to Georgia so we can start our legal proceedings . ”

On Friday , 19 February 2010 , the U.S. Department of Justice announced the conclusion of its investigation into the 2001 anthrax attacks .
The DOJ maintains that Dr. Bruce Edwards Ivans , who in 2002 passed a polygraph test regarding the anthrax attacks , was the sole perpetrator .
In an investigative summary ( 640 kb PDF ) , the DOJ characterizes Ivins ’ passing of the polygraph as part of an effort to “ stay ahead of the investigation , ” alleging ( at p. 84 , fn. 51 ) that he used countermeasures to fool the polygraph :
In some sense , Dr. Ivins ’s efforts to stay ahead of the investigation began much earlier .
When he took a polygraph in connection with the investigation in 2002 , the examiner determined that he passed .
However , as the investigation began to hone in on Dr. Ivins and investigators learned that he had been prescribed a number of psychotropic medications at the time of the 2002 polygraph , investigators resubmitted his results to examiners at FBI Headquarters and the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute for a reassessment of the results in light of that new information .
Both examiners who independently reassessed the results determined that Dr. Ivins exhibited “ classic ” signs of the use of countermeasures to pass a polygraph .
At the time the polygraph was initially examined in 2002 , not all examiners were trained to spot countermeasures , making the first analysis both understandable under the circumstances , and irrelevant to the subsequent conclusion that he used countermeasures .
Although the summary does n’t state what “ classic ” signs of countermeasures Ivins allegedly displayed , Michael Isikoff of Newsweek reported in 2008 that the FBI “ concluded he ’d used ‘ countermeasures ’ such as controlled breathing to fool the examiners . ”
While FBI and DoD polygraphers claim that Ivins showed “ classic ” signs of countermeasure use , it should be noted that no polygraph operator has ever demonstrated the ability to detect polygraph countermeasures .
There are no journal articles or book chapters on how to detect them .
And retired FBI scientist and supervisory special agent Dr. Drew Richardson ’s challenge to the polygraph community to prove its claimed ability to detect countermeasures has gone without takers for more than eight years .
With regard to the psychotropic medications that Ivins had been prescribed , there are no studies on the effects of such medications on polygraph results .
Also not mentioned in the DOJ summary is the fact that the FBI searched Ivans ’s premises for , among other things , “ materials on how to defeat a polygraph . ”
Evidently , no such materials were found , or they would presumably have been mentioned in the summary .
It ’s worth noting that if Ivins had Googled “ how to beat a polygraph ” in 2002 , he likely would have found AntiPolygraph.org ’s on - line book , The Lie Behind the Lie Detector [ 1 mb PDF ] , which explains precisely how to do so .
The question of whether an alleged biological terrorist fooled the polygraph is a crucial one for national security .
The polygraph remains the centerpiece of America ’s personnel security policy –despite the conclusion of the National Academy of Sciences that it ’s junk science .
While polygraphers claim that they can now detect countermeasures , they have n’t offered any evidence to support such a notion .
It ’s not hard to imagine how FBI and DoD polygraphers–armed with the knowledge that Ivins had become the sole suspect in the Amerithrax case–could review his charts and divine signs of countermeasures in them .
In a similar manner , polygraph reviewers claimed that the charts of Aldrich Ames –the CIA turncoat who twice fooled the polygraph while spying for the Russians –showed clear signs of deception .
But such signs only became clear once other evidence pointed to Ames ’ guilt .
And Ames is but the most notorious of a litany of betrayers who have fooled the lie detector : others include Ignatz Theodor Griebl , Karel Frantisek Koecher , Jiri Pasovsky , Larry Wu-tai Chin , Ana Belen Montes , and Leandro Aragoncillo .
Time and again , the polygraph has failed to protect America ’s security .
And time and again , these failures have been rationalized away .
The polygraph operators say , “ trust us . ”
But the failure of the polygraph to detect Ivins ’ alleged deception in the Amerithrax case demands a reckoning .
There must be no more rationalizations , no more sweeping the dirt under the rug .
The evidence that polygraphers can detect countermeasures generally , and that Ivins used polygraph countermeasures specifically , must be publicly disclosed so that it may be independently and critically scrutinized .
Update :
An interview that Ivins gave to the FBI on 16 January 2008 undermines the notion that psychotropic drugs may have influenced his polygraph results or that he employed polygraph countermeasures .
The report of that interview states regarding the 2002 polygraph examination that Ivins passed ( at p. 199 of Section 4 of the Ivins ’s FBI case file ) :
Years ago , IVINS submitted to a polygraph as part of the anthrax investigation .
Prior to taking the polygraph , he did not research anything about the test , to include ways to defeat its accuracy .
Likewise , he did not take any steps to defeat the tests [ sic ] accuracy or use countermeasures .
In fact , IVINS stopped taking his anti-depression / anti-anxiety medication 48 - 72 hours before the polygraph , and he offered to provide blood and / or urine specimens at the time of the test to prove he was not medicated .
When IVINS was interviewed in March 2005 , he was asked to consent to provide handwriting examplars .
Shortly thereafter , he researched experts in the field of handwriting comparisons who could possibly be consulted about the technique .
IVINS has no explanation why he researched the handwriting analysis but not the polygraph examination .
In addition , comments that Ivins allegedly made regarding his polygraph examination suggest that he really did not understand polygraph procedure .
According to the FBI ’s report of an interview of someone who knew Ivins conducted on 5 June 2008 ( see p. 68 of Section 6 ) , this person related that :
IVINS spoke about the polygraph he took [ for the investigation ] and that he passed some questions but failed the one about taking stuff from work .
The question about taking stuff from work is a very common probable - lie “ control ” question , asked for comparison purposes .
Polygraphers secretly assume that everyone has taken stuff from work , and the examinee ’s denial is assumed to be less than completely truthful .
Polygraphers gauge reactions to relevant questions like , “ Did you send those anthrax letters ? ” against reactions to control questions like “ Did you ever take anything from work ? ”
If reactions to the relevant question are stronger , the subject fails , and conversely , if reactions to the control question are stronger , the person passes .
( For a fuller explanation of polygraph procedure , see Chapter 3 of The Lie Behind the Lie Detector . )
Ivins evidently did n’t understand the function of such control questions , something that anyone who has researched polygraphy would grasp .
Update 2 : Note that in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 , retired FBI polygraph operator Richard W. Keifer averred that “ [ b] ased on the results of scientific studies , when conducting a screening polygraph , you will have high confidence ( 99.99 % ) on decisions to clear people . ”
Regarding polygraph countermeasures , Keifer maintained , “ The danger from countermeasures , while real , is overstated . ”

Recently by Gary North : Squeaky Wheels Always Get ‘ Greeced ’
All over the Western world , central banks are under pressure from their governments to inflate .
Governments are not satisfied with short - term interest rates at historic lows , such as a federal funds rate of 0 % to 0.25 % in the United States .
Politicians want rapid economic growth , and they are convinced that this is possible after a major recession only with more fiat money .
In short , they have accurately understood the message of their college - level textbooks .
This is what textbooks have been saying for over 50 years .
This is the new , improved Keynesianism .
Keynes focused on the need for large government deficits and increased government spending , not monetary inflation .
The new Keynesianism wants large government deficits and lots of fiat money .
These twin pillars of neo-Keynesian policy are not working anywhere in the West .
They are working for now in China , which has become the world ’s bubble economy , but not in the popped - bubble economies of the West .
THE BANK OF JAPAN
On February 18 , Bloomberg ran a story on a statement by the governor of the Bank of Japan , who warned against government interference .
The government is running a large budget deficit .
It is pressuring the Bank of Japan to inflate .
The Bank has refused .
Interest rates are low today because commercial bankers still refuse to lend .
This has been Japan ’s problem for two decades .
Investors still buy the Treasury securities of their governments .
The central banks initially pushed rates down through monetary inflation ( more reserve money to supply the commercial banks ) , but today , rates are low because lenders are frightened of the private sector , and the private sector is afraid of more debt .
The central banks are not inflating , yet short - term government debt rates are extremely low .
The economic boom is nowhere to be seen .
The recovery is slow .
Traditional Keynesian textbooks say that to keep short - term rates this low , there must be rapid monetary inflation .
But these rates are low today without monetary inflation .
This fact conflicts with textbook Keynesianism .
The policy - makers are in disarray , both in the government and the central banks .
We can see this in a Bloomberg report on Japan .
Feb. 18 ( Bloomberg ) — Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa countered government pressure by suggesting it should develop a plan to contain the world ’s largest public debt .
“ It ’s important to gain trust of financial markets by showing a path for fiscal consolidation , ” Shirakawa said in Tokyo today after his policy board kept interest rates at 0.1 percent and refrained from expanding monetary easing steps .
As Hans Sennholz used to say , “ Wait a minute ! ”
If the Bank of Japan “ kept interest rates at 0.1 % , ” how did it do this ?
The governor is protesting government pressure to inflate .
The official textbook explanation for the boom - producing effects of monetary inflation is that this policy will lower interest rates .
But the bank rate has been one - tenth of one percent .
Japan ’s central bank did not “ keep ” the rate this low this week , or last week , or last year , or last decade .
It has done approximately nothing for 15 years , yet the rate stayed this low .
The Bank of Japan has barely inflated the money supply since 1994 .
M2 has rarely increased above 3 % per annum .
As a result , there has been little price deflation in Japan since 1994 .
Consumer prices fell slightly in a few years : about 1 % .
In other years , consumer prices rose a little .
You can see the chart for yourself .
So , the story of Japan ’s long - term price deflation is a complete myth .
I have discussed this before .
The Bank of Japan is not keeping the rate low .
The free market is .
Lenders want safety .
They will pay for this : low interest rates on government debt .
The rate on 10 - year Japanese bonds is 1.3 % .
With consumer prices falling at a rate of 2 % per annum — the first time they have fallen this much — 1.3 % is a real rate of return of a little over 3 % .
Not much .
Private borrowers want safety , too — by not taking on more debt .
So , rates stay low .
The Bank of Japan can of course expand its purchases of government debt .
But why should it do this ?
The government can sell its debt at low rates .
What will more fiat money do for the government ’s ability to sell its debt ?
Nothing .
The Bloomberg story goes on to say that the governor insisted that the central bank needs independence from the government .
This is the cry of central bankers at all times , in all places .
Have you ever read of the senior tenured bureaucrat in any government - protected , semi-private monopoly agency recommending that the nation ’s Congress or Parliament take over the operations of his agency , because government protection has made the agency unresponsive to the public good ?
The next time will be the first .
In his strongest warning yet on the country ’s growing debt burden , Shirakawa said governments need to “ respect ” that monetary policy is n’t aimed at funding fiscal spending .
His remarks came after Finance Minister Naoto Kan earlier this week stepped up heat on the central bank to fight deflation by saying Japan needs an inflation target of at least 1 percent .
. . .
“ Monetary policy is n’t aimed at fiscal funding , ” Shirakawa said at the news briefing .
“ It ’s aimed at achieving sustainable growth under stable prices .
It ’s important that governments respect this stance and markets have faith in it . ”
He is not alone in his protest against government interference .
“ ACCOUNTABILITY IS AUTONOMY ”
On February 17 , the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia gave a speech to the Philadelphia chapter of the World Affairs Council .
Whenever an official gives a speech to a WAC chapter , we can be sure that the official regards this as an important speech .
The media do not talk about the World Affairs Council .
There may be an occasional report about a speech at a WAC chapter , but there will be nothing said about the WAC : what it is , who belongs , and what influence it possesses .
The WAC has an important social function .
It is the single most important membership organization for the nation ’s senior elite Establishment to communicate the latest perspective to the nation ’s elite .
According to the brief entry on Wikipedia , the WAC has 535,000 members in 89 separate councils in 39 states .
There are 175 million adults in the United States .
This means the WAC ’s membership is a little over three - tenths of one percent of the adult population .
I call this an elite .
The WAC was founded in 1918 , three years before the Council on Foreign Relations was founded .
Like the CFR , the WAC officially is concerned with international affairs .
Also like the CFR , the WAC deals with domestic issues as well .
The President of the Philadelphia FED , Charles Plosser , titled his speech , “ The Federal Reserve System : Balancing Independence and Accountability . ”
This sounds boring .
For those who understand the function of the Federal Reserve and its influence , the speech is not boring to read .
The target of the first half of the speech was Ron Paul .
It was a warning against Ron Paul ’s bill in the House of Representatives that would authorize the Government Accountability Office to audit the FED .
The House ’s leadership has kept the bill from coming to the floor for a vote , despite the fact that a majority of the membership has officially supported it , and despite the fact that a majority of the House Financial Services Committee voted for it , 43 to 26 , in November 2009 .
The FED has consistently opposed this bill .
The official explanation is that this would in some way constitute interference with the FED ’s policy - making .
This argument has never been clear .
The fact that the General Accountability Office will verify the numbers in no way constitutes interference with FED policy , unless FED policy has been carried on under false numbers .
Nobody at the FED will say what is really at stake : an independent audit of the government ’s gold holdings , which are officially held for the government by the FED for safekeeping .
If the gold is gone , or if there are legal claims against it by foreign central banks as a result of FED swaps , this would constitute fraud on a massive scale .
The real power in the FED has always been the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
In all textbook accounts of the years leading up to the Great Depression , the focus is on Benjamin Strong , the President of the New York FED .
He set policy , not the Board of Governors .
The bulk of the world ’s gold holdings are stored in the vault of the New York FED .
This includes most of the deliverable gold ( 99.9 % fine ) owned by the FED as trustee of the U.S. government ’s gold .
The gold at Ft. Knox ( probably coin melt , 90 % fine ) constitutes a second holding area , said to be 20 % of the nation ’s gold .
No one knows .
It has not been audited since the early 1950 ’s , not even by the private accounting firms that audit the FED on an annual rotation basis .
The FED demands secrecy .
It proclaims that it pursues transparency , but it does not on any issue of substance .
Bloomberg News in November 2008 sued the Board of Governors under the Freedom of Information Act to find out which institutions received how much money in the October 2008 bailouts .
The Board of Governors refused to comply on this legal basis : this would expose trade secrets of the recipient banks .
Even though a district Federal judge in August 2009 ruled that the New York FED must turn over these records , the FED refused to comply .
She gave the FED five days to comply .
It did nothing for six months .
Anyone who thinks that the Federal courts have operational authority over the Federal Reserve System is ignorant of the last century of American history .
The Board of Governors appealed the ruling on January 11 , 2010 .
A ruling will not come down for months .
A recent summary of this bizarre story appeared in the New York Times .
In a rare form of candor , the writer added this observation , deep down in the bowels of his article :
The Federal Reserve has wrapped itself in secrecy since the turn of the 20th century , when a select group of financiers met at the private Jekyll Island Club off the eastern coast of Georgia and , forgoing last names to preserve their anonymity among the staff , drafted legislation to create a central bank .
Its secrecy , of course , persists today , with Ben S. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , refusing to tell even Congress which banks received government money under the bailout .
“ SECRECY IS TRANSPARENCY ”
Mr. Plosser gave the usual reasons for opposing the audit .
So , our uniquely American form of a central bank strikes a balance between centralization and decentralization ; between the public and private sectors ; and among Washington , Wall Street , and Main Street .
The result is a central bank that achieves a delicate balance : it permits policymakers a good deal of independence when conducting monetary policy but in return requires transparency and accountability to the American people .
Why does setting monetary policy require this degree of secrecy ?
Officially , the FED is rather vague on the answer .
It is all about accountability , the FED says .
You see , transparency and accountability to the American people require secrecy , so that Congress is kept in the dark .
You understand this , do n’t you ?
The elite at the World Affairs Council did not bat an eye .
“ Of course , of course . ”
There was no response comparable to a town hall meeting in a Congressman ’s district over the bailouts .
There were no catcalls .
There was polite acceptance .
From the point of view of economic analysis — the pursuit of self - interest — secrecy by the FED is required because the FED is the administrator of a cartel of government - protected commercial banks .
The government has created barriers to entry , thus creating the cartel .
Bankers do not want the government to police the cartel .
They want their own agency to do this .
They nominate the Presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks .
The big banks want to milk the cartel for all they can .
They got the bailout money , and in their view , that ended any legitimate interest Congress may have in pursuing the matter .
So , Mr. Plosser said this :
Another frequently mentioned proposal under consideration would politicize the governance of the 12 Reserve Banks by making the chairs of the boards of directors , or the Reserve Bank presidents , political appointees .
Other legislators have suggested eliminating the votes of Reserve Bank presidents on the Federal Open Market Committee .
As I hope I ’ve explained , such changes would weaken the regional and decentralized structure of the Federal Reserve System and lead to a more centralized and political institution and less effective policy .
Were regional Reserve Bank presidents or chairs to become political appointees , they might be more attuned to the political process in Washington that selected them , rather than having a public interest in the broad economic health of the nation and the Reserve Districts in which they reside .
Politicizing these important positions might also discourage some talented , public - spirited individuals to serve as part of our nation ’s central bank .
The hearts of World Affairs Council members must have swelled with pride .
“ Yes , yes , we understand .
Far be it from us to discourage some talented , public - spirited individuals to serve as part of our nation ’s central bank . ”
The message was clear : we must keep politics out of the most powerful cartel in the country .
No audit !
No control over who gets to be President of a regional FED bank !
Central bank independence means that the central bank can make monetary policy decisions without fear of direct political interference .
It does not mean that the central bank is not accountable for its policies .
Allow me to summarize :
Autonomy is accountability .
Secrecy is transparency .
George Orwell saw it coming .
Newspeak is alive and well inside the FED .
CONCLUSION
For the first time since 1914 , the Federal Reserve System is under serious attack .
The attackers are not members of the World Affairs Council .
The attackers are from the hinterlands .
The bailouts angered them in October 2008 .
The bailouts confirmed Ron Paul ’s warnings in his Presidential campaign .
The Web has made it possible for the troops to get mobilized .
The FED has never had to deal with anything like this .
It does not know how to respond .
Mr. Plosser ’s speech is an indication of just how little the FED understands public relations .
A minority of critics have seen through the Wizard of Oz ’s smoke and mirrors .
The Web has given these people access to information that could be concealed before .
The genie will not go back into the bottle .
Opposition to the FED will spread , no matter how many speeches that high - level FED officials deliver to local chapters of the World Affairs Council .

Imagine you 're a music journalist who maintains a blog .
You 've just found a great , new , virtually - unknown artist that you want to tell the world about .
How can you do so , in a way that is simple and convenient for your readers , but does not place you or your blog 's host at risk of being sued ?
Thanks to the increasingly aggressive copyright - enforcement tactics of the music industry , this has become a startlingly complicated question with no good answer .
In the latest signal of this conundrum , at least six music blogs were deleted last week by Blogger due to copyright complaints .
It 's uncertain who made the accusations that lead to the deletions , but the most likely culprit is the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , a copyright - enforcement organization which had previously filed copright takedown notices against some of the targeted blogs .
Although the takedowns were made in the name of stopping piracy , the deleted blogs do not appear to have been hotbeds of illegal file - sharing .
Indeed , some had operated for years and acquired a serious and substantial readership .
Like many music blogs and magazines , they mostly posted reviews of artists , albums and concerts .
In at least one case , IFPI 's accusations of copyright infringement were almost certainly incorrect .
Bill Lipold , author of the deleted I Rock Cleveland , has outlined in painstaking detail the ways in which he received explicit permission to post every file on his blog , including ones which were later accused of infringement and forcibly removed .
In one case , the band 's publicist wrote of the takedown , " Just so you know , this is none of our doing ... apparently , DMCA operate on their own set of odd rules , as they even requested that the ( band 's ) official blog remove the song .... What a headache ... "
In cases like this , attacks on music blogs seem to be the latest example of the widening disconnect between the goals of the music industry 's promotional wing and its enforcement wing .
Smart musicians and promoters understand that the Net is a powerful promotional tool , and know that sharing an artist 's music is the best way to earn new fans .
The IFPI , on the other hand , writes clearly in its takedown notices that " Our top priority is to prevent the continued availability of the IFPI Represented Companies ' content on the internet . "
We 've already seen this divergence of interests play out in recent fiascos surrounding bands like OK Go and Death Cab For Cutie .
And the television industry has seen similar problems in its attacks on YouTube .
In other cases , it appears that the bloggers may have posted or linked to copyrighted material without permission .
But , as targeted blogger Patrick Duffey explains , it 's often next to impossible to know exactly which content is being accused of infringement :
In their DMCA take down letters they never inform you what the infringing mp3’s are , forcing the writer to take down ALL the mp3’s in the offending post whether they have the permission to post them or not ...
If they had just included what the offending mp3’s were they could have avoided all of these headaches and bad press and we could have kept on going like any other day .
Living Ears , another targeted blog , echoes those sentiments :
One problem with these notices is that they do not mention infringing files by name .
When I post the playlist from Scene Not Heard and link to a couple of tracks , if I receive a DMCA notice , how can you tell which file is to be deleted ?
Targeted bloggers need to know these details , not only so that they can remove the file if it 's indeed infringing , but so that they can file a DMCA counter - notice in the event that the file is not infringing .
Ordinarily , the party issueing the takedown notice would be required by US copyright law to specify which content is being accused .
But , as an international organization headquartered in London , IFPI is arguing that it does n't even need to play by the USA 's rules .
" We neither admit nor accept , " they write , " ... that Google is entitled to be served a notice in compliance with the DMCA . "
Translation : IFPI is essentially threatening to sue Google under some unspecified foreign law — presumably one which lacks even the modest safe - harbor provisions available in the USA .
It 's no wonder Google felt the need to take drastic action to avoid liability , even at the expense of the resulting headaches and bad press .
By now , the affected blogs have mostly migrated elsewhere — in most cases to software like Wordpress , deployed on smaller and less well - known hosting services .
While this will buy them some time , these smaller hosting services are just as vulnerable as Google is to attacks by the IFPI and their ilk .
In fact , most smaller hosts are likely to be even less helpful to bloggers than Google has been , since they tend to lack Google 's legal resources and PR imperatives .
That being said , there are steps that music bloggers can take to protect themselves .
Though EFF has n't created resources specifically for music bloggers , many of the suggestions made in our Guide To YouTube Removals and Guide To Avoiding Gripes About Your Gripe ( or Parody )
Site will be relevant .
Note especially this list of web - hosts that have been known to show some spine when faced with legal threats over their customers ' content .
And , of course , all current users of Blogger should make regular use of Blogger 's " export " feature to back - up their work .
If this game of whack - a- mole seems familiar , that 's because it is .
The same copyright - enforcement machine that was originally designed to fight music piracy , having largely failed at that goal , has now been turned on music journalists , and — in some cases — musicians themselves .
It 's just the latest example of how legitimate speech and innovation will continue to be endangered until either Congress or the music industry takes serious steps to fix things .
Update , Feb 24 : EFF has published some Practical Advice for Music Bloggers Worried About DMCA Takedown Censorship .

US frame - up of Aafia Siddiqui begins to unravel
Pakistani victim of rendition and torture
By Ali Ismail
1 February 2010
Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui went on trial in a federal courtroom in New York City on January 19 , charged with the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan ’s Ghazni Province in 2008 .
The case against Dr. Siddiqui , 37 , is rapidly unraveling due to lack of evidence and discordant testimony from witnesses .
It is becoming increasingly evident that the charges amount to a frame - up that has been staged to cover up the fact that Siddiqui , along with her eldest son , had been held without charges in the US military ’s notorious Bagram prison in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2008 , where they were subjected to torture .
Two of Dr. Siddiqui ’s younger children are still missing .
According to the account given by US authorities , Aafia Siddiqui was taken into custody by Afghan security services in July of 2008 after they alleged having found a list of US targets for terrorist attacks as well as bomb - making instructions and assorted chemicals .
Despite these claims , Siddiqui is not charged with any terror - related offenses .
Instead , she is indicted for allegedly having seized an automatic weapon and fired on her Afghan and American captors when a group of FBI agents and US Army officers arrived to collect her .
The most serious charge against her is using a firearm in committing a felony , the gun in question being a US soldier ’s rifle .
Siddiqui was shot twice in the stomach and barely survived after medics at Bagram air field had to make an incision from her breastbone to her bellybutton to remove the bullets .
It was reported that part of her intestines had to be removed to save her life .
The accusations against Siddiqui strain credulity and have been fervently denied by her relatives , her defense attorneys , and human rights organizations , all of whom claim that she had been held in secret US detention facilities where she was physically and sexually abused ever since she disappeared off the streets of Karachi in the spring of 2003 with her three children , then seven , five , and six months old .
According to the German weekly Der Spiegel , just a few days before she disappeared Affia Siddiqui had contacted her former professor , Robert Sekuler , at Brandeis University in search of a job , complaining that there were n’t any job opportunities in Pakistan for a woman of her educational background .
Dr. Siddiqui is a Pakistani national who was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brandeis University .
In July of 2001 , she and her husband at the time were scrutinized by the FBI for their alleged association with Islamic charities .
Following the events of September 11 , 2001 the couple returned to Pakistan at a time when hundreds of Pakistanis and other Muslims were rounded up for questioning across the US .
The family resided in Karachi where Aafia Siddiqui was employed at Aga Khan University .
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , Aafia Siddiqui and her children were kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence agents on their way to the airport in Karachi .
Their whereabouts remained unknown until Aafia Siddiqui and her eldest son , Ahmed , were reported detained in Afghanistan in July of 2008 , several years after their disappearance .
While the Pakistani Interior Ministry had initially confirmed that the abduction had taken place , it later claimed to have been mistaken and stated that Siddiqui was not in Pakistani custody .
This about - face was an attempt to conceal the complicity of Pakistani intelligence services in the US government ’s rendition of Siddiqui to Afghanistan and her subsequent ordeal .
Aafia Siddiqui ’s sister , Dr. Fauzia Siddiqui , had informed the press that she and her mother had journeyed to the US in 2003 to meet with FBI officials , who had claimed that Aafia Siddiqui would soon be released .
In Pakistan , Siddiqui ’s family was repeatedly harassed and received numerous death threats from sinister forces within the Pakistani ruling elite .
The family was ordered not to make any public appeals in support of Aafia and her three children .
Between 2003 and 2008 , when Siddiqui ’s whereabouts were still unknown , the US claimed she was working on behalf of Al Qaeda .
In May of 2004 , she was listed by US officials as one of the seven “ most wanted ” Al Qaeda fugitives .
The US has also spuriously claimed that she is married to Ammar al - Baluchi , who is reported to be the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the so - called “ mastermind ” behind the 9/11 attacks .
The claim that Siddiqui was married to al - Baluchi was based solely on coerced statements made by Mohammed , who has been repeatedly tortured .
The US military and the FBI have consistently denied that Siddiqui had been in US custody prior to her arrest in 2008 .
In reality , Aafia Siddiqui spent the years between 2003 and 2008 at the detention facility at Bagram air base , where many referred to her as the “ Grey Lady of Bagram . ”
Around the same time as her staged arrest , the British journalist , Yvonne Ridley , had been bringing attention to an unknown female detainee in Bagram prison who was known as Prisoner No. 650 .
In his book Enemy Combatant , Moazzam Begg recalled hearing the woman ’s piercing screams as she was being tortured while he was imprisoned in the same facility .
According to Ridley , in 2005 male prisoners at the facility were so disturbed by her screams and sobs that they staged a hunger strike that lasted for six days .
When she was arrested in 2008 , her then - 11 year - old son Ahmed , a US citizen , was by her side .
The traumatized boy has since been repatriated to Pakistan , where he is now living with his aunt , Dr. Fawzia Siddiqui .
According to his aunt , Pakistani authorities have forbidden Ahmed from speaking to the news media .
Siddiqui ’s appearance has changed markedly since 2002 , according to her lawyers .
She has suffered a broken nose , is deathly pale , and extremely frail , weighing about 100 pounds .
When she arrived in the US , she was suffering from acute trauma , according to her lawyers , who were outraged that she did not immediately receive urgently needed medical attention .
Siddiqui had been suffering from agonizing pain from the wounds she had sustained in Afghanistan and was slumped over in her wheelchair when she arrived in court in August of 2008 .
Her trial was delayed as her lawyers argued that she was mentally unfit to participate in her own defense .
However , prosecutors eventually found mental health experts to allege that she was faking her condition to escape punishment .
Judge Richard Berman ruled that she was mentally fit for trial .
The paucity of media attention given to the trial is noteworthy , particularly given that Siddiqui was listed as a top Al Qaeda suspect .
The tabloid press in New York City , where the proceedings have received limited attention , has taken her guilt for granted , cynically dubbing her “ Lady Al Qaeda . ”
The trial is being closely watched in Pakistan , where Siddiqui ’s ordeal has outraged many and has sparked protests around the country .
From its beginning , the trial has been marked byirregularities , and the judge has gone out of his way to accommodate the prosecutors .
Not a single Pakistani journalist was granted press credentials for the opening statements last Tuesday .
Defense attorneys protested the robust security measures put in place during the trial , which obviously reinforces the notion that Siddiqui poses a security threat to the US .
In a clear violation of her rights , Judge Berman has repeatedly thrown Siddiqui out of the courtroom for what he called her “ outbursts . ”
The “ outbursts ” were Siddiqui ’s anguished claims of innocence and protests that she was tortured .
“ Since I ’ll never get a chance to speak , ” she had told the court .
“ If you were in a secret prison , or your children were tortured … Give me a little credit , this is not a list of targets of New York .
I was never planning to bomb it .
You ’re lying . ”
The trial has also been marked by contradictory testimony from prosecution witnesses , which has undermined the case against Siddiqui .
On the third day of the trial , Assistant US Attorney Jenna Dabbs displayed several photographs of the room where the prosecution claims the shooting occurred .
However , Carlo Rosatti , an FBI firearms expert who investigated the case , acknowledged last Friday that he had found “ no shell casings , no bullets , no bullet fragments , no evidence the gun [ the soldier ’s M - 4 rifle ] was fired . ”
The only shell casing from the scene was from a 9 - milllimeter pistol with which Siddiqui was shot .
On the fourth day of the trial , another FBI agent testified that the FBI never found Aafia Siddiqui ’s fingerprints on the M - 4 rifle .
The warrant officer who shot Siddiqui also took the stand , recounting the version of events laid out by the prosecution .
He claimed that on the day he and his colleagues went to collect Siddiqui , she suddenly got a hold of his rifle and aimed it at US personnel , at which point he opened fire with his 9 - millimeter pistol .
When Siddiqui yelled out , “ I never shot it , ” she was tossed out of the courtroom for the remainder of the day .
The unnamed warrant officer , who had hobbled to the stand using a cane , was also permitted to recount how he was wounded in a recent and totally unrelated roadside bombing in Afghanistan , shedding tears as he did so .
While having absolutely no relevance to the trial , the soldier ’s wounds were invoked as part of a brazen attempt by prosecutors to sway the jury .
Judge Berman ’s allowing the testimony demonstrates the rigged character of the trial .
Sensing that Siddiqui was indeed emotionally unstable , prosecutors moved to force her to testify in the hopes that she would incriminate herself .
Defense attorneys argued that she was n’t mentally fit to take the stand .
Once again , Judge Berman sided with the prosecution .
Berman warned Aafia Siddiqui that she is not permitted to speak about events prior to her arrest in July of 2008 .
Nevertheless , on Thursday Siddiqui repeatedly told the jury that she was held in secret prisons by US authorities , according to the Associated Press of Pakistan .
She told the jury how she was shot just after she peeked through a curtain in search of an escape route .
She added that it would be ludicrous to believe that a soldier would leave his gun where an allegedly dangerous suspect could get a hold of it .
“ It ’s too crazy , ” she said .
“ It ’s just ridiculous .
I did n’t do that . ”
When asked by a US attorney about the contents of her purse , which allegedly contained chemicals , bomb - making instructions and a list of US targets , Siddiqui said , “ I ca n’t testify to that , the bag was not mine , so I did n’t necessarily go through everything . ”
Siddiqui ’s lawyers have claimed the bag and its contents were planted evidence .
Her attorney , Elaine Whitfield Sharp , said back in 2008 that Siddiqui had been carrying what amounted to “ conveniently incriminating evidence . ”
“ Of course they found all this stuff on her .
It was planted on her .
She is the ultimate victim of the American dark side , ” another one of her attorneys had told the Associated Press in 2008 .
Siddiqui also told the jury that her children were constantly on her mind and that she was disoriented at the time of her arrest in 2008 .
On Friday , the prosecution called Gary Woodworth of Braintree Rifle and Pistol Club in Massachusetts to testify .
Woodworth claimed that Siddiqui had taken a 12 - hour pistol course at some point in the early 1990s .
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Woodworth was noticeably distressed when the defense team demanded to know how it was possible for him to recall a specific individual from two decades earlier , when he ’d had hundreds of students .
Woodworth admitted that he had no records or documentation to back up his assertions , insisting that he was good at remembering faces .
Also on Friday , FBI Special Agent Bruce Kamerman testified that Siddiqui grabbed the assault rifle in a fit of rage .
However , he appeared to be flustered when one of Siddiqui ’s attorneys produced his hand - written notes in which there was no mention of her grabbing the gun .
In spite of the obviously fabricated character of the prosecution ’s case , there is no guarantee of an acquittal .
Even if she is found not guilty , the fate of Aafia ’s Siddiqui ’s other two children , Mariam and Suleman , remains unknown .
Siddiqui recounts that , while she was held in solitary confinement for five years , she was endlessly forced to listen to recordings of her screaming , terrified children .
Her baby , Suleman , she said , was taken away from her immediately , never to be seen again .
She said her daughter Mariam was occasionally shown to her , but only as an obscure figure behind a sheet of opaque glass .
The horrifying case of Aafia Siddiqui and her three children is but one example of the criminal and inhuman practices of US imperialism and its ally , the Pakistani bourgeoisie .
Hundreds if not thousands of Pakistanis have been kidnapped by Pakistani intelligence services and handed over to US personnel to be dispatched to Bagram , Guantanamo and other “ black site ” torture chambers around the globe .
While the Pakistani government now claims to be doing everything in its power to bring Siddiqui back to Pakistan , its supposed efforts are little more than damage control .
London , England ( CNN ) --
A man presumed to have been in a vegetative state for five years has communicated with the outside world for the first time since suffering severe head injuries in a car crash , researchers said Thursday .
The finding by British and Belgian researchers has huge implications for the care and treatment of patients in a coma - like state .
It comes two months after a Belgian car crash victim whose condition was misdiagnosed as a vegetative state for 23 years was revealed to have been conscious the whole time .
Before the latest experiment the 29 - year - old Belgian patient , who had his accident in 2003 , had shown no sign of being aware of the outside world .
Five years ago doctors believed he slipped from a coma to a vegetative state , leaving his body functioning but without his personality or consciousness .
The researchers , based at Cambridge and Liege universities , realized that diagnosis was wrong when the man responded to questions about his life as scientists monitored activity in his brain .
Using a scanning technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , the patient 's brain activity was mapped while he was asked to answer " yes " or " no " to questions such as " Is your father 's name Thomas ? "
The patient communicated answers by wilfully changing his brain activity .
In the three - year study , 23 patients believed to be in a vegetative state were scanned using fMRI , and signs of awareness were detected in four of these cases ( 17 per cent ) , the researchers said .
The fMRI method used can decipher the brain 's answers to questions in healthy , non-vegetative , participants with 100 per cent accuracy , but it was never tried in a patient who cannot move or speak .
Dr. Adrian Owen , co-author of the research from the Medical Research Council , said : " We were astonished when we saw the results of the patient 's scan and that he was able to correctly answer the questions that were asked by simply changing his thoughts .
" Not only did these scans tell us that the patient was not in a vegetative state but , more importantly , for the first time in five years , it provided the patient with a way of communicating his thoughts to the outside world . "
Colleague Dr. Steven Laureys , from the University of Liege , said the scans had given the patient his only means of communication since the accident .
Watch Dr. Laureys explain how comas are assessed
He added : " It 's early days , but in the future we hope to develop this technique to allow some patients to express their feelings and thoughts , control their environment and increase their quality of life . "
The cases of patients in vegetative states highlight the difficulty in determining levels of consciousness in people who cannot communicate .
In the example of the Belgian patient in November who was misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative state , experts were skeptical about how a therapist expressed his thoughts by moving his fingers across a keyboard .
" That 's Ouija board stuff , " Art Caplan , a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist , told the Associated Press , according to Newsweek .

A recent study found that niacin , a form of vitamin B , is far more beneficial to heart patients with high cholesterol than is the popular cholesterol drug Zetia .
Dr. Anthony DeMaria , a leading cardiologist and editor - in - chief of thestated that the findings will eliminate Zetia from the preferred treatment options list .
Though Zetia is touted as being highly effective at reducing the levels of low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , often called " bad cholesterol " , niacin is much more effective at boosting the levels of high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , commonly termed " good cholesterol " .
Evidence reveals that niacin significantly reduces plaque buildup on arterial walls , improving blood supply to the brain , while Zetia , also known generically as , can slightly increase arterial plaque buildup .
For this reasons , doctors and experts agree that niacin is the preferred choice in maintaining proper cholesterol levels and a healthy heart .
In addition to being more effective , niacin is also a much more affordable option .
Though the trial utilized a time - released prescription form of niacin , quality niacin supplements are available over the counter that work equally as well if not better than the prescription form .
Zetia is often prescribed to lower bad cholesterol and maintain heart health , yet its track record seems to indicate the opposite effect for some .
Out of the 208 participants who engaged in the study , nine of the patients on Zetia experienced heart attacks , stroke , or they died from heart disease .
Only two on niacin bore such an outcome .
Dr. Jim Stein of the University of Wisconsin was one of several who emphasized over - prescription of Zetia , stating that doctors fail to practice evidence - based medicine when using the drug .
He recommends utilizing safer , more effective alternatives like niacin that are proven to reduce incidences of heart attack , stroke , and death .
Studies consistently show that therapeutic doses of niacin alone can raise HDL levels by up to 35 percent and lower LDL levels by 20 percent .
When incorporated into a well - balanced diet with regular exercise , the benefits increase even more .
Proper diet and exercise will actually cause arterial plaque to dissipate over time , unlike statin drugs which have never been proven to break up arterial plaque .
Niacin is naturally found in dairy products , lean meats , fish and poultry , nuts , eggs , and whole - grain or sprouted breads .
Diets rich in plant - based sterols , soluble fiber , and balanced sources of omega - 3 and omega - 6 oils will also contribute significantly to maintaining proper cholesterol levels and a healthy heart .

Obama to skip jury duty in Cook County
The jury pool at a suburban Chicago courthouse will be short one highly qualified prospect this week .
President Barack Obama had been summoned for jury duty at the Bridgeview courthouse beginning Monday .
The summons had arrived at the Obama home on Chicago 's South Side .
But a White House official said Sunday that the president has alerted the court that he wo n't be able to make it .
With his first State of the Union speech set for Wednesday , Obama has a busy week ahead .
The president is a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former professor at the University of Chicago Law School .
Tonight provides yet another example of a blogger who brought an important stories to light not being credited by the MSM , in this case , a harsh preliminary ruling against JP Morgan in a dispute involving its client Televisa .
I was going to post on Felix Salmon ’s story , which discussed some extraordinarily dishonest conduct by JP Morgan , for two reasons : first , to remind readers that the obsession with Goldman chicanery is providing a nice smokescreen for the rest of the industry , and second , for its larger legal implications .
And now we have a third reason , the MSM not giving Felix the credit it would provide to a conventional reporter .
Felix pointed out two days ago that the decision was made last month , yet the story was peculiarly ignored by the MSM ; suddenly , the story graces the front page of the Wall Street Journal .
JP Morgan in particular is being treated with a degree of respect that it does not deserve .
For instance , banking industry expert Chris Whalen derides the notion that JP Morgan was in better shape than the broker - dealers that teetered on the verge of failure in 2008 .
He describes JP Morgan as a $ 76 trillion ( notional ) derivatives exchange with a $ 1.3 trillion bank attached , and that serious turbulence in the derivatives markets would have been fatal to JPM .
And let us not forget that while Goldman has become the bank that everyone loves to hate , there is no reason to think its behavior was materially worse than that of its peers ( its brazenness and tone - deafness , however , are a completely different matter ) .
The second reason was the reasoning behind the in the smackdown by Judge Jed Rakoff against JP Morgan for its conduct involving a loan to a long - standing Mexican client , Televisa .
And now there is a third wrinkle , the Wall Street Journal ’s belated interest in the piece and how the WSJ version leaves out some key details presented by Felix , and the omissions are all of items that make JP Morgan look even worse .
Although I ’ll give a recap and discuss some of the additional issues this case raises , I encourage readers to look at both pieces in their entirety .
I think you ’ll agree that Felix ’s version is , hands down , a better job of reporting .
Brief synopsis : longstanding JP Morgan client Televisa raised $ 225 million in a loan through its subsidiary Cablevision to fund the acquisition of a fiber optics company .
But the loan closed in 2008 and JPM was unable to syndicate it .
JP Morgan turns to a bank owned by Carlos Slim ….. who happens to be Televisa ’s biggest and fiercest competitor …. for help .
As Felix explains , JP Morgan could either assign the loan to the Carlos Slim ’s bank , Inbursa , or sell it a participation .
But an assignment required Televisa ’s consent , which it refused to give .
JP Morgan then threatened Televisa , saying it would proceed and sell a 90 % participation .
Televisa responded in writing that it believed this move would violate the credit agreement .
But it gets better .
Televisa said it was willing to give the same discount to buy back the entire loan that that Inbursa had offered for 90 % .
JP Morgan led Televisa to believe it was no longer negotiating with Inbursa when it is in fact finalizing that deal .
( Note : the Wall Street neglected to mention the buyback offer and that JP Morgan misrepresented its dealings with Inbursa ) .
Felix adds :
…. this was no ordinary participation agreement , either .
It had all manner of extra bells and whistles in it , all of which were designed to ( a ) make it look very much like an assignment rather than a participation ; and ( b ) extract information from Cablevisión and hand it over to Inbursa .
As Rakoff says , “ the agreement permits Inbursa to request and receive nearly unlimited information from Cablevisión ” .
And what ’s more , if Cablevisión for any reason refuses to hand over such information , Inbursa can declare Cablevisión in default , and automatically convert the participation to a fully - fledged assignment .
Yves here .
The Journal failed to say that the participation agreement was unusual , which could leave the reader with the impression that the information demands were typical .
Without this key tidbit plus the Televisa offer to buy the loan back , it simply looks like Televisa is balking at JP Morgan , which wants to get out of the loan , having Inbursa as its only exit .
Thus a reader might conclude that the information provided was reasonable , and JP Morgan was guilty of putting its interest ahead of its client ’s only by having gone to Inbursa .
The article completely leaves out the most duplicitous , destructive action : that JP Morgan rejected what on paper was a BETTER out , selling the entire loan back to Televisa , and instead conspired with Televisa ’s biggest competitor in a scheme to suck competitively sensitive information out of Televisa .
Judge Rakoff , the same judge who rejected the initial settlement that the SEC and Bank of America had negotiated over the Charlotte bank ’s failure to disclose Merrill ’s deteriorating to shareholders pre the vote on the acquisition , was again unafraid to deliver a sharp rebuke :
JP Morgan , acting in bad faith , used the guise of a purported “ participation ” to effectuate what is in substance a forbidden assignment , with unusual provisions demanded by Inbursa that are calculated to give Inbursa exactly what the assignment veto in the Credit Agreement was designed to prevent .
JP Morgan thereby violated , at a minimum , the covenant of good faith and fair dealing automatically implied by law in the Credit Agreement …
Yves here .
I ’m actually a bit gobsmacked to see this as the basis for a ruling , and hope it stands .
I welcome input from corporate litgators , but this is my non-expert reading on what happened .
The normal basis for litigation under a contract are violations of the terms of the agreement ( although counter suits can bring in issues outside the agreement .
For instance , a colleague hired a decorator who proceeded to draft grandiose plans and refused to come up with anything within the budget stipulated at the outset .
When he fired her , she submitted an outrageous final bill , what the entire project had he completed it with her should have cost .
His attorney looked her drawings , which were blueprints and called for plumbing and walls to be moved .
They sued her for practicing architecture without a license .
She suddenly became much more willing to negotiate ) .
Now notice what happened here .
Televisa had told JP Morgan in writing that it regarded going ahead as a breach of good faith and fair dealing .
JP Morgan went ahead anyhow , because it clearly regarded this as a weak line of attack , one it thought would not fly in court .
And my understanding is that good faith and fair dealing arguments are not common outside employment law .
A “ bad faith ” argument does not claim that the other side violated a particular contractual provision , but rather operated in a way that might be permissible on a narrow , technical reading .
but flies in the face of the logic of the larger objectives of the agreement .
Good faith and fair dealing is an assumption that undergrids all contracts .
And before the “ sanctity of contracts ” crowd starts hooting and hollering , a general premise that parties will behave reasonably and perform in accordance with the objectives presupposed by the contracts is necessary for any system based on agreements to work .
It is simply impossible for contractual system to function if both parties can easily resort to narrow , legalistic readings of the deal to screw the other side .
As much as contracts often contemplate various scenarios , it would far too costly , both in negotiation and drafting costs , to devise contracts detailed enough to address all the ways sneaky people might welch on a deal .
This is merely a preliminary injunction , and Judge Rakoff has scheduled further hearings , but certainly looks like he is not buying what JP Morgan was selling .
This is a very encouraging sign , because the financial services industry has made an art form of sneaky practices and if good faith and fair dealings arguments become more successful as a tactic ( possible given how badly the industry has overplayed its hand ) that would be a badly needed counterbalance .
Unfortunately , it is far too early to tell .
This is only the first skirmish in this suit : JP Morgan might settle .
But even if the case goes to trial , JP Morgan may believe that it can get the ruling overturned on appeal .
I would not regard pursuing this suit as a wise move ; Televisa could demand that JP Morgan and Inbursa produce their documents and e-mails about the the proposed “ participation ” , particularly those unusual terms that would have required Televisa to cough up sensitive information to its biggest competitor .
Given that Televisa offered to match Inbursa ’s purchase price , it is n’t hard to imagine that JP Morgan was willing to sacrifice ( literally in this case ) its client for either some fees or a promise of future business .
Even if JP Morgan might get a verdict against it overturned on appeal , the damage to its reputation of exposing the gory details of its double - dealing would outweigh any financial winnings .

Trust made that error of judgment in a suit brought by Proctor & Gamble , and it never recovered from the repercussions of the public getting a full view of its predatory conduct .
Forty - one years ago on March 18 , 1968 , Robert F. Kennedy spoke the following words at a speech at the University of Kansas in the initial days of his campaign for the 1968 Democratic nomination for the Presidency :
I have seen Indians living on their bare and meager reservations , with no jobs , with an unemployment rate of 80 percent , and with so little hope for the future , so little hope for the future that for young people , for young men and women in their teens , the greatest cause of death amongst them is suicide .
Now , 2010 , most South Dakota reservations experience the same rate of unemployment , the same bare and meager existence , the same crises of hope in the populations of their young .
When the weather turns catastrophic , people die .
To see how you can help , please read further ( and thank you to all who have already contributed in any and every way ) .
For the past 10 days Kossacks have donated time , money , supplies and clothing to SD reservations .
Our most significant accomplishment is bypassing charitable organizations , calling the power companies and grocery stores directly and donating money to fill someone 's empty propane tank or empty refrigerator instantly .
In fact , DharmaFarmer has adopted a family for the winter and will pay their heating costs going forward .
Below are links we have gathered to donate money and clothing to some of our reservations .
Please recommend this diary to give more families a chance to receive help .
NEWS : ( my summary )
The worst of the disasters , Cheyenne River in South Dakota , should get Federal relief this week .
Some power has been restored and some water is flowing but into broken pipes .
The occupants of those homes must stay in the shelters .
Cheyenne River is requesting only monetary donations now since mailing packages may hinder larger relief efforts now .
However , the ongoing poverty conditions on other reservations continue with families who need help heating their homes and feeding their families .
ARTIC BLAST HAS ARRIVED WIND CHILL VALUES OF 25 TO 35 DEGREES BELOW ZERO ARE EXPECTED TODAY A WIND CHILL ADVISORY IS ISSUED WHEN THE COMBINATION OF WIND AND COLD TEMPERATURES CAN CAUSE FROSTBITE IN JUST 20 MINUTES .
IF YOU GO OUTSIDE ... COVER ALL PARTS OF YOUR BODY ... ESPECIALLY YOUR HEAD ... FACE ... AND HANDS .
Please provide news links in the comments and I will add .
I have received many emails from lurkers and non-members of Daily Kos who have donated money and supplies .
In addition to that our current total from the comments is : $ 11,124 in roughly one week .
However , I believe our efforts are more expansive in that MANY folk have shared our diaries with their respective networks .
We 've also had a number of Kossacks volunteer to be a part of a new team ( currently un- named ) that will focus on a continuing diary series on the current conditions of our poorest reservations and discuss proactive and preventative measures that could be taken to prevent similar disasters next winter .

The F - 35B supersonic stealth jumpjet has achieved its first hover in flight testing .
British test pilot Graham Tomlinson held aircraft BF - 1 stationary in midair 150 feet above the runway yesterday before executing a slow 70 - knot rolling landing .
The F - 35B is now in flight testing at the Patuxent River naval air station in Maryland .
The radical hover - jet also achieved another first yesterday , making its first short - roll takeoff assisted by its vertical - thrust equipment :
The F - 35B has a vertical - thrust fan , driven by a shaft from the engine , mounted in a shaft behind the cockpit .
The big fliptop lid seen in the videos covers the top of the shaft in normal flight , while the smaller dorsal doors just behind it allow extra air into the engine for high - power hovering operations .
Simultaneously , the jet 's exhaust swivels downward in hover mode .
There are also two small outlets for engine gas under the wings , to stop the jet rolling over .
The F - 35B is intended for service with the US Marine Corps , Royal Navy and RAF , replacing existing fleets of Harrier jumpjets .
There is also a normal runway - only version of the jet ( F - 35A ) which will go to the US air force and many international customers , and a version designed for carrier catapult launch and arrested landing ( F - 35C ) for the US Navy .
The right - wing media -- particularly Fox -- are stumbling all over themselves to castigate anyone who dares suggest that the ugly rhetoric that 's been unleashed in the wake of the passage of health - care reform is anything but a bipartisan affair .
Indeed , this has been the standard talking point on Fox for the better part of the past several days .
It continued Saturday on Fox News Watch , when Jon Scott 's assembled panel -- Judith Miller , James Pinkerton , Ellis Henican and Cal Thomas -- chewed over why the librul media are so intent on making the threats out to be a right - wing affair .
Miller , to her credit , tried to inject some sanity into the discussion , but she was knocked down by a lying ( par for the course ) Pinkerton :
Scott : Back to the issue of those threats , though , Judy , the broadcast networks led with the stories of threats against , you know , Democrat supporters of the health - care bill .
It seemed like it was very much driven , you know , from the Democratic side of the equation .
Miller :
Well , because most of the threats seemed to come the Right .
I mean , the bullet through the window , which now turns out to be somehow unrelated to any anger , an accident , that was a -- Pinkerton : Now , Judy , you 're a skilled reporter .
Just think of the two things you said , that the threat -- the bullet through Eric Cantor , a Republican 's window , seems to be unrelated .
But most of the threats seem to come against -- to be made by Republicans , neither of which you can prove , and your saying them is helping to feed the narrative , which is that Republicans are the bad guys again .
Bzzzzt !!!!
Sorry , Jim , but just like you did when you tried to claim you had nothing to do with the Willie Horton ads , you 're lying .
Because Miller 's claims are both easily proven , and you know it :
A : Local police have declared that the shot that hit Cantor 's window was " random gunfire " -- it was , in fact , a spent round falling to earth , which means it could not have been intentionally fired through Cantor 's window .
B : Any kind of tally will demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of threat and actual violence are being directed at Democrats by angry right - wingers .
Besides the well - reported threats against Bart Stupak and Louise Slaughter , probably the most prominent instance of this involved Alabama ex-militiaman Mike Vanderboegh 's call for angry Tea Partiers to smash Democratic Party office windows -- after which there was a spate of such smashings .
But that story , in fact , has never been reported on Fox .
Cal Thomas , however , came up with the most novel attack on Democrats for having let themselves be the subject of such violent rhetoric and behavior -- essentially a variation on Glenn Beck 's theory that Obama and the Democrats are intentionally trying to provoke a violent response from the extremist right :
Thomas : Look , when Nancy Pelosi walked through those Tea Partiers , it was like -- what should analogize this to ?
Ah , the march through Skokie , Illinois , by the Nazis ?
It was deliberately provocative !
They wanted a reaction !
Lessee ... Pelosi and the Democrats were making what was a normal , everyday trek from the floor of the House to their offices , and were confronted by angry Tea Party protesters .
Imagine if they had turned back and found another route to their offices ; then Cal Thomas would be declaring that they were " running and hiding " from the protesters , would n't he ?
Instead , they 're just like nasty neo -Nazis trying to provoke a crowd .
Sigh .
These people simply occupy a Bizarro Universe full - time now .
There is no good way to die , especially when you ’re only 21 .
I ’m like the rest of you : before yesterday , I ’d never heard of Nodar Kumaritashvili .
But something about his fatal crash in Vancouver hit me just so , at once blindsiding a place inside me where the beauty of life , the exhilaration of competition , the glory of human achievement , the searing pain of sudden death , and the dull ache of a lost lifetime of opportunity all improbably intersect .
There is no good way to die when you ’re 21 .
But if you have to go at such a young age , I suppose the best way would be quickly , while doing the thing you love .
And later , to have the world bow its head for you for a few seconds .
Finally , to have KD Lang offer up a heartbreaking rendition of Leonard Cohen ’s “ Hallelujah ” in benediction …
Rest in Peace .

From Binyamin Appelbaum and David Cho at the WaPo : Small banks lag in repaying Treasury for bailout funds
[ H]undreds of community banks have yet to return their bailouts .
More than 10 percent of the 700 banks that got federal bailouts and are still holding the money even failed to pay the government a quarterly dividend in February .
The list of 82 delinquent banks is significantly longer than the 55 banks that failed to make payments in November , according to an analysis by Linus Wilson , a finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette .
Wilson calculated that the missed payments totaled $ 78.1 million in February and that banks now have missed a total of $ 205 million in dividend payments to the government .
Many of the community banks still holding aid from the Troubled Assets Relief Program are struggling with losses on real estate development loans .
Here is the report from the Treasury .
And in excel format under Dividend and Interest Reports
There are three permanent deadbeats on the list : CIT Group ( filed bankruptcy and wiped out its $ 2.3 billion in TARP debt ) , UCBH Holdings Inc. was seized by the FDIC ( TARP lost $ 298.7 million ) , and Pacific Coast National Bank was also seized by the FDIC ( TARP lost $ 4.1 million ) .

Say hello to " the world 's first production model 3D bio-printer . "
What you 're looking at is a machine capable of arranging human cells and artificial scaffolds into complex three - dimensional structures , which result in such wonderful things as replacement liver and kidney tissue , or such simple niceties as artificially grown teeth .
All we 're told of the internal workings is that the bio- printer utilizes laser - calibrated print heads and that its design is the first to offer sufficiently wide flexibility of use to make the device viable .
Organovo will be the company responsible for promoting the new hardware to research institutions , while at the same time trying to convince the world that it's not the fifth sign of the apocalypse .
Maybe if the printer did n't have a menacing red button attached to it , we 'd all be a little less freaked out by it .
Lisa Hilton , an Oxford - educated writer , thinks we should all stop worrying and learn to love the size - zero model .
[ A ] re women really so pathologically stupid that they are unable to distinguish the fantasy of the runway from the realities of their own bodies ?
Arguably , the " size zero " debate is merely another side of the infantilized , hysterical box women thought they had clawed their way out of a century ago , an insidious means of suggesting that though we can run companies and governments we 're still not quite rational creatures , too dainty and delicate to cope with the dissonances between the Bambi- limbed aspirations of the catwalk and our own wretched , cellulite - smothered carcasses .
Advertisement
It gets worse .
Hilton praises girls who probably suffer from eating disorders for their canny choice " to conform to the demands of their industry in order to maximize their earnings " ; any questioning of the safety of the standards to which models are required to measure up is " patronizing and disempowering and reduces legitimate concerns over body issues to juvenile whining " ; and , amazingly , the most powerful thing we could all be doing is to just shut up and consume .
" We could just leave the models to get on with their job , " writes Hilton .
" Maybe the radical way to look at this season 's shows would be to enjoy the spectacle , buy the frock and get on with something more interesting ? "
On the scale of contrarianism - for - contrarianism 's sake , reading this piece , it 's as if Slavoj Zizek got a partial lobotomy , mainlined five years of Vogue , and had a week - long hallucination about the " eating disorder lobby . "
Perhaps someone should tell Hilton she could make a career out of issuing trite " challenges " to " conventional wisdom . "
Then we'd at least know what and who to avoid at the bookstore .

Though Hilton pays lip service to the health issues presented by eating disorders , and states that sufferers deserve our " respect and support , " the most serious problem with her wholly problematic argument is that she seriously under - reports the prevalence of eating disorders .
Call her an eating - disorder skeptic : she cherry - picks data from a variety of studies to show that anorexia nervosa only affects 0.5 % of the population , blithely ignoring the fact that anorexia is just one kind of eating disorder — bulimia and Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified are two others recognized in the DSM - IV , and there are plenty of people with disordered eating habits that affect their health , yet who do not meet all of the diagnostic criteria for the above .
And Hilton completely ignores a much recent and unusually comprehensive study by the NHS , which found that 9.2 % of adult women living in Britain had eating disorders .
Hilton 's eagerness to minimize the problem of eating disorders makes one rather doubt her intellectual honesty .
So , too , does Hilton 's comparison of her 0.5 % prevalence statistic for anorexia with the " 39.4 million [ American ] women suffering from obesity . "
Obesity , as defined by the medical establishment , is a straightforward matter of Body Mass Index , not health : anyone with a BMI of 27.5 or higher is considered obese .
A diagnosis of anorexia — which is , again , just one kind of eating disorder — involves fulfilling multiple clinical criteria .
Anorexia is a disease .
Obesity is an equation of height and weight , and an individual considered " obese " can be perfectly healthy .
To compare the two groups is beside the point .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
But Hilton is n't interested in making an argument based on accurate data .
She 's interested in criticizing fat people and recasting models who " choose " to subsist on too little food as " empowered " paragons of discipline .
( She does this by quoting one former model who admitted that when she was walking for John Galliano and Tom Ford , she " lived on Diet Coke and apples for two years .
For the couture , we had to get up at 4 a .m. to be sewn into the clothes and there was huge pressure to be thin .
But I made a million dollars by the time I was 20 , I bought a town house in Manhattan and put myself through Columbia .
Does that make me a victim ? "
Perhaps Hilton does not realize just how small the modeling world is , but she might consider protecting her anonymous sources a little bit better , given the number of girls who did the couture shows , walked for those clients , and attend Columbia is , well — nevermind . )
But the point is n't that the mainstream media is clamoring to paint models — and , by extension , women who approve of fashion — as " victims . "
Although some of the coverage of the so - called " size zero debate " is undoubtedly sensationalist and less - than - comprehensive , many writers are merely drawing attention to the fact that it is unfair and unsafe for an adult to ask a child of 14 to diet down to 95 lbs , and that it might well be unsound for the culture to idealize exclusively such a tiny point on the spectrum of female beauty .
Hilton 's only explanation for women who criticize the fashion industry 's standards is far more prosaic : jealousy .
Another issue that Hilton completely ignores is the question of whether the modeling industry may well attract girls already predisposed to disordered eating — and what implications this might have for the industry 's duty to be a safe working environment , if in fact it is the industry 's diktats that can push a young and already vulnerable population into seriously unhealthy territory .
It 's not hard to look for anecdotal evidence of models with eating disorders ; Crystal Renn , who lost her teen years to exercise bulimia and anorexia in order to fit into sample sizes , has said " Modeling , basically , pulled the trigger . "
Three models , Ana Carolina Reston , Luisel Ramos , and Eliana Ramos , died of complications from their eating disorders in 2007 and 2008 ; one had eaten only Diet Coke and lettuce for the week leading up to her death .
Coco Rocha has admitted the use of diuretics to control her weight in the past .
Other substances , especially Adderall , for energy without appetite , were commonplace when I was in the industry .
Ali Michael , at 17 , was sent home from Paris for gaining 5 lbs when she started to recover from her eating disorder , which had cost her her menstrual cycle .
Natalia Vodianova 's relationship with food changed dramatically when she began modeling — and her sudden , and unhealthy , post - pregnancy weight loss , both spurred her career to new heights and causef her hair to fall out .
( When she regained 9 lbs , giving her a total weight of 115 lbs , her clients and agency were displeased . )
The model pictured here , Natasha Poly , has not spoken publicly about her eating habits , but I included her photo to show just exactly what kind of beauty standard Lisa Hilton thinks is reasonable and harmless .

Broad - based studies are harder to come by ; there are remarkably few surveys of professional models ' eating habits and the prevalence of eating disorders .
However , this one , published in Psychiatry Research in 2008 [ PDF link ] , found that 18.1 % of the 55 models questioned by researchers reported " important restrictive eating " during the previous three months , compared with only 7.2 % of the control group , which was made up of women of the same age group and the same cultural background as the models .
60 % of the models surveyed reported bulimic episodes in the same timeframe ( so did 34 % of the control subjects ) .
9 % of models exercised to control their weight , 5.4 % used laxatives and / or diuretics .
9 % of models had " menstrual difficulties " ; only 2 % of the control group did .
The study authors found that 12.7 % of models had at least some of the symptoms of anorexia ; 1.8 % had all of them .
An additional 5.4 % of models had been diagnosed with , and received treatment or , anorexia in the past .
1.8 % of the models met all the clinical criteria for bulimia ; 3.6 % met some of them .
That 's a total of 25.3 % of models with some form of eating disorder .
Now , 55 models is not a large sample , and more study is clearly needed before the prevalence of eating disorders within the industry can be firmly established .
But it seems clear that , at the very least , disordered eating is vastly more common among models than the general population .
In Hilton 's tortuous construction , acknowledging the very serious health concerns this reality presents for many models is painting them as " victims . "
Hilton compares female models with male athletes — some of whom are also required to maintain less - than - healthy physiques to make a living .
69 % of jockeys skip meals , and 34 % use diuretics for weight control , and — though Hilton does n't mention it — there was also the death of 23 - year - old NFL player Thomas Herrion , whose playing weight was 310 lbs , of heart disease and studies showing a heightened risk of heart disease among very heavy players .
But rather than find these working conditions troubling , Hilton excuses them , joking that jockeys would " make any model agency proud , " and pointing out that young men who choose to endure the physical risks of these professions are " admired " while models are " portrayed as irrational and deluded . "
Models are n't admired ?
It takes an especially nimble mind to at once buy into the persistent glamorization of modeling so completely that all problems , actual and potential , presented by the profession can be written off as the ravings of jealous haters , and simultaneously to deny that the profession is glamorized at all .

" Laying off the Krispy Kremes for a few years in order to shimmy into Paige jeans is hardly on a par with being unable to menstruate , but the rhetoric of the eating - disorder lobby insultingly blurs the difference between harmless faddiness and genuine disease , " says Hilton .
( This despite the fact that her own source — the only model she apparently spoke to for this story — had to do a lot more than " lay off the Krispy Kremes " to be employable under the industry 's standards . )
I had n't heard of Paige jeans when I first read this piece , but it turns out the company has an interesting story : Paige Adams - Geller , the company founder and a former fit model , is an eating - disorder survivor .
Adams - Geller 's business is dedicated to the ( still radical , in fashion ) idea that no - one should have to starve to fit into their clothes .
In fact , she sells a bracelet to raise money for the National Eating Disorders Asssociation that bears the slogan " Be Comfortable In Your Genes . "
Funny how Hilton missed that .

MPEG LA , the patent license pool which collects royalties on MPEG video standards , has announced that Internet Video encoded with H.264/AVC
that is provided free to end users will remain royalty free until 2016 .
It had been expected that the authority would announce some level of license payment as the previously announced royalty free period was coming to an end .
All other uses of H.264/AVC , including media players , encoders and decoders , will continue to require royalties to be paid to MPEG LA .
The move will allow internet broadcasters , including YouTube and Vimeo , to continue providing H.264 encoded content .
H.264 became an issue recently when the Firefox developers decided not to support it in Firefox 's implementation of the HTML5 < video > element , due to concerns about licensing and patents .
Firefox only supports Ogg Theora encoded video in HTML5 .
Google 's Chrome and Apple 's Safari both support H.264 in HTML5 and do not support Ogg Theora .
The announcement from MPEG LA does not address those issues , but does mean that there is less motivation from the big internet broadcasters , who have been experimenting with replacing Adobe 's Flash with HTML5 based video players , to move away from using H.264 for online video .

Among the many marketing moves that tie into the upcoming blockbuster - to - be " Iron Man 2 " is a collaboration between Marvel Comics and Diesel to make -- wait for it -- Iron Man cologne .
The limited edition " natural spray " will retail for $ 67 , and is essentially a repackaging of Diesel 's " Only the Brave " scent in a container that makes me feel like a pimp Ronald McDonald is about to hit me upside the head with a golden pipe .
The whole concept cannot help but beg the question :
What exactly does Tony Stark / Iron Man smell like ?
In our imagination , l'aroma de Stark involves the scent of crisp hundos , mixed with new car smell , motor oil , and Axe body spray .
Which is to say masculine and slightly industrial , with just a splash of douchebag .
The original fragrance has been described as " leathery " and " woody " ( tee hee ) and the Diesel website calls it " a voluptuous and explosive cocktail that bears witness to a man with an identity as strong as it is present , almost magnetic , " which sounds pretty much like what I just said .

This past weekend , I overheard all too many conversations about the iPad , echoing complaints friends read online .
The most common was " Why do I need one when I already have an iPhone and a laptop ? "
Stop right there .
If you already have an iPhone and a laptop , you 're among the technology elite , and a minority .
Put your iPhone back in your pocket , close your laptop lid , and look around you .
What are other people using ?
If you 're at a Starbucks or Panera Bread , or an office that supports the iPhone , the people you see are the minority too , so you 'll have to look farther afield .
Most Americans are n't laptop and iPhone toting early adopter creatives commenting on blogs , emailing business plans , designing marketing materials or coding a startup .
Most Americans are consumers .
Most Americans spend their time on passive leisure that makes them feel happy .
Instead of observing fellow laptop users at Starbucks , go find how " most Americans " use computers .
Watch people at a public library or even at the computer aisle in a Best Buy store .
When confronted with a keyboard ( invented 1867 ) , people do n't touch type , they eyeball and poke at one key at a time .
Given a mouse ( invented 1972 ) , their gestures are tentative .
They look at the screen , then look at their hand on the mouse , move it , and look back at the screen .
They want something from the computer , but the tediousness of telling it what they want frustrates them .
Why is a tool designed in 1867 for people creating office documents , and the esoteric skill required to operate that tool efficiently , still getting in the way of people just wanting to read an email , find a book or song , watch a video , or browse friends and family pictures on Facebook ?
Why does it take a Steve Jobs to imagine most Americans do n't want an electric typewriter with a nicer screen ?
Who wants to have to learn this :
To do this :

Engineers should get out more .
This decade 's netbook form factor is still dictated by vestiges of the typewriter age and the " data input " daily routines of academia and corporate America .
Regular folk do n't type .
Regular folk poke , prod , and ogle .
How ironic , then , that regular folk may better appreciate than the technorati what the liberal elitist New York Times calls a triumph of taste ?
Great products , according to Mr. Jobs , are triumphs of “ taste . ”
And taste , he explains , is a byproduct of study , observation and being steeped in the culture of the past and present , of “ trying to expose yourself to the best things humans have done and then bring those things into what you are doing . ”

Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket , a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent .
Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle ’s African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone .
She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding , and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she ’d be admitting guilt .
Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way , the officers decided to arrest her .
One reached in , turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor .
Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant , but refused to get out , even after they threatened to stun her .
The officers – Sgt. Steven Daman , Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones – then stunned her three times , in the thigh , shoulder and neck , and hauled her out of the car , laying her face - down in the street .
There will also be a dedicated sports section – for which a deal has been signed with Perform – making a package of football programming around the 2010 World Cup in South Africa will be available .
The company hopes to sign more sports deals and is believed to be close to signing a deal with the IOC to secure the right to show the best moments from the Olympics .

An elderly man who believes the Bible allowed him to discipline his son with an alkathene pipe has been warned he could go to jail .
The man , who has interim name suppression to protect the identity of his school - age son , was to be sentenced in New Plymouth District Court yesterday but Judge Allan Roberts postponed the sentencing till March 19 and called for a new probation report after he was told the man now accepted he must change his ways .
At an earlier hearing , the man pleaded guilty to two charges of assaulting a child and assault with a blunt instrument between November 1 and December 7 .
Yesterday , his lawyer , Paul Keegan , made impassioned and extensive pleas .
" My client has resorted to the physical discipline only after a high level of provocation . "
The boy had stolen $ 1100 from his father and flashed it around school .
He had also solicited donations in what was a sophisticated fraud for a boy of his age .
The father had been at his wits ' end with his son's behaviour .
The boy suffered no injuries and the father had made an early guilty plea , Mr Keegan said .
The boy had been taken from his care by Child , Youth and Family , causing his client a tremendous amount of sadness .
The case also had a political and social background , Mr Keegan said .
The premise of spare the rod and spoil the child came from the Bible and was the traditional belief of many who still believed in physical punishment and that the state should not interfere in the way children should be brought up .
It would take society a long time to make the change , Mr Keegan said .
The judge countered that he would have no compunction in jailing a man who assaulted his wife in the same way .
" This involves kicking and hitting with an alkathene pipe , " the judge said .
Mr Keegan said nuns at his boarding school had also used weapons , such as canes and straps , and would now face assault charges if they did the same today .
" I got caned but I never got kicked by my principal , " the judge responded .
Judge Roberts said he was concerned that the father had told the probation officer that he would not change .
The father had said : " I wo n't moderate my behaviour .
I see no wrong in using violence . "
Mr Keegan said his client 's letter to the judge now acknowledged that the rules the father had been brought up with had all changed .
" I want the best for my family .
I 'm sure CYF will be able to advise and help us do that , " the father wrote .

Believe it or not , it ’s interruption :
Six studies demonstrate that interrupting a consumption experience can make pleasant experiences more enjoyable and unpleasant experiences more irritating , even though consumers avoid breaks in pleasant experiences and choose breaks in unpleasant experiences .
Across a variety of hedonic experiences ( e.g. , listening to noises or songs , sitting in a massage chair ) , the authors observe that breaks disrupt hedonic adaptation and , as a result , intensify the subsequent experience .

Even so most stuff is fairly easy with node.js , unit testing takes a little bit of getting used to .
The main difference to regular unit testing is that just because your test finishes running without an error , it does n't mean there was no problem .
But lets start with the basics .
Node.js has adopted the CommonJS assert module specification .
You may also find references to mjsunit , but node no longer uses this library .
Lets have a look at how to write a basic test with node , lets call it my - test.js :
var assert = require ( ' assert ' ) ;
// Will pass
assert . ok ( true ) ;
// Will throw an exception
assert . ok ( false ) ;
Running this test will produce the following output :
$ node my - test.js AssertionError : true == false at Object . ( my-test.js : 7:8 ) at [ object Object ] . ( node.js:928:23 ) at [ object Object].emitSuccess ( node.js:240:15 ) at [ object Object ] .
( node.js:653:21 ) at [ object Object].emitSuccess ( node.js:240:15 ) at node.js:510:29 at node .js:985:1 at node .
js:989:1
One thing to note here is that , when node dies from an exception ( which a failing assertion is ) , the exit code will be 1 :
$ echo $ ?
1
But lets have a look at a more interesting unit test .
Let 's say you are writing a " hello world " web service called hello.js :
var http = require ( ' http ' ) ;
exports .
server = http .
createServer ( function ( req , res ) {
res . sendHeader ( 200 , { ' Content - Type ' : ' text / plain ' } ) ;
res. sendBody ( ' hello world ' ) ;
res. finish ( ) ;
} ) ;
To test this service , we can write a file called test - hello.js like this :
var
assert = require ( ' assert ' ) ,
http = require ( ' http ' ) ,
hello = require ( './hello ' ) ,
callbackFired = false ;
hello .
server .
listen ( 3000 ) ;
http
. cat ( ' http://localhost:3000/' )
. addCallback ( function ( data ) {
callbackFired = true ;
assert . equal ( ' hello world ' , data ) ;
hello .
server .
close ( ) ;
} ) ;
process .
addListener ( ' exit ' , function ( ) {
assert . ok ( callbackFired ) ;
} ) ;
What 's important in this test is that we are checking for two things here .
The first is the obvious assertion that the web service outputs the content we expect , nothing too exciting here .
The second is declaring the variable callbackFired and checking its value in the process ' exit ' event .
You could get away with not doing it for this particular test , because the test would never finish without the hello.server.close ( ) line getting executed .
For more complex tests however , it becomes incredibly important to keep in mind that a callback may never fire , something you can only catch with little helper variables like this .
If you need some more inspiration for testing different stuff with node , you should start by going over the test suite that comes with it .
Let me know if you have any questions !

Star Trek Streaming Guide :
Where to Watch All the TV Shows and Movies Star Trek fandom has still managed to keep itself on peoples mind for 54 years .
Star
Trek is a show which started the beginning of the science fiction genres of shows on television which is still cherished worldwide .

With the help of streaming platforms , it is easily accessible as well .
Die - hard trekkers are known to have all the Blu-rays and DVDs which can be used to stream your favourite episode anywhere you like .
Star Trek : The Original Series
This is the Star Trek original show which started the craze that it is today .
This is the show which came a long way when it comes to most screen sci - fi which was just a monster movie .
But later with the vision of Gene Roddenberry the intelligent , allegorical sci- fi series was used to bring much more groundbreaking which was led by William Shatner as Captain Kirk , Leonard Nimoy as Spock and DeForest Kelley as Dr McCoy .
Star Trek : The Animated Series
There was also a star trek animated series which had the original cast voicing the characters with the same writers .
The Animated Series was a genuine way to help extend the original show which had visual freedom .
The format ultimately became very chunk , cheap and was amateurish .
Star Trek : The Next Generation
The next generation is set a century after the original series which brought in the conflict , which made more characters bring their best .
This provided to be a very popular approach with a new crew .
This show went on for three seasons and went on very captivating and genuinely outstanding adventures of their own .
Star Trek : Deep Space Nine Deep
Space nine is considered as one of the best star trek series which certainly had a lot to offer .
The show was not all about the starship but had a remote space station which addresses cultural divides , characters conflicts , religion , war , etc .
This is where writers started to serialise the storytelling aspect of the show .
Star Trek : Voyager Voyager is a series with the founding members of the federation starship which was stranded together 70,000 years from earth in Delta Quadrant which faces 75 - year journey home .
This trek also showed the very first female captain Kathryn Janeway which encounters all kinds of interesting new races while bringing back some old enemies after a long voyage .
Michael Panzner is bearish , and you should listen .
Why ?
The 25 - year veteran of the global stock , bond , and currency markets was one of the few who called the crisis before it happened , with a book aptly titled " Financial Armageddon . "
Today , Panzner calls a V - shaped recovery " ridiculous , " says commercial real estate is a bubble sure to burst , and is fearful that there 's far too much speculation on commodities , risky stocks and emerging markets .
In short , he says " the world is a riskier place and will continue to stay that way going forward . "
We caught up with Panzner at a panel on risk management sponsored by QFinance .
Some notes from our conversation :
On recovery , Panzer says it 's " a protracted process " but " talk about a ' V ' bottom is ridiculous . "
He also said " talk about a jobless recovery is laughable , especially in the context of the U.S. being some 70 % reliant on the consumer : "
In some respects the system is more broken than it was before .
From my perspective at least the economic model of the banking system -- the operating model is essentially broken .
Securitization does n't work .
The biggest supplier of funds and the biggest customer to the banking sector is the Federal Reserve .
In some respects the whole concept of too big to fail has been complicated by the fact you have institutions that are now too connected to care .
There 's a hubristic element that remains from the crisis of the past two years .
On dealing with the financial crisis by spending :
[ We 've ] learned the wrong lessons in terms of how to deal with the crisis .
Before we had this notion that people could slice and dice risk and make it go away .
The new version of that is the fact that large amounts of publicly created debt will somehow make the problems of large amounts of old , privately - created debt go away , which is a little bit of a non sequitur .
On the coming commercial real estate crash :
Commercial real estate seems to be the accident waiting to happen .
In my mind at least there is no doubt ... in fact it seems like a deja vu moment in terms of the way it 's playing out .
We 're getting reassurances here that it's all going to be okay , it 's this sort of contained phenomenon ... it's very reminiscent in my mind of what took place with sub- prime and the failure to acknowledge that it was a broader problem -- an institutional problem in terms of credit , in terms of risk taking .
It seems like there 's a bit of an instant replay going on with commercial real estate .
People are thinking ' well , it has n't happened yet , so it 's not going to happen . '
That 's the old Hurricane Katrina line of reasoning .
From what I can see it's a tsunami unfolding and it's going to be a real train - wreck over the next two to three years for the banking sector .
I do n't think there 's any way around that issue .
Zero .
Another deja vu moment for Panzner is government debt .
The same problems of securitization and derivatives apply : faulty assumptions , faulty models with limited data , and over - confidence .
" They 're assuming debt levels can go up forever , without putting that in any sort of reality context . "
But that rules out the black swan , which is " what happens if people do n't want to buy your debt . "
Panzer thinks we may see hyper inflation as the share of U.S. outlays relative to the deficit are about 40 % .
" It may not be such a good idea -- even though the Krugmans of the world think it is -- to spend unlimited amounts of money without thinking through the potential consequences . "
On the next financial bubbles :
I 'm a very long term bull on gold , however I believe that gold and commodities more generally , the short dollar trade , the long equity trade are all part of this gigantic risk play that is propagated by this huge amount of cheap money being pumped into the system ... I would be looking for these things to correct , perhaps violently .
He adds : " The first real uptick you get in the dollar you 'll see elephants running through a revolving door . "
Panzner says gold is the perfect example .
People say it 's a safety hedge , but why are bonds not selling off and why are emerging markets going up ?
" If you look at that they 're all moving together then you get a much clearer , coherent picture .
It 's another bubble , an echo bubble or whatever you want to call it . "
Besides gold , Panzner counts oil , basic commodities , stocks , emerging markets -- and other riskier assets -- as the stuff of speculation and over - investment .
It 's an Orwellian universe .
People keep making non sequeters and everyone else shakes their heads and says ' yeah , that 's okay ' and no one is standing back and saying ' wait a minute , that does n't make any sense at all . '
People are saying these things and acting on them but not thinking thinking them through and saying ' wait a minute , this does n't make sense .
HONG KONG — With China ’s exports soaring , even as other major economies struggle to recover from the recession , evidence is mounting that Beijing is skillfully using inconsistencies in international trade rules to spur its own economy at the expense of others , including the United States .
Seeking to maintain its export dominance , China is engaged in a two - pronged effort : fighting protectionism among its trade partners and holding down the value of its currency .
China vigorously defends its economic policies .
On Sunday , Premier Wen Jiabao criticized international pressure on China to let the currency appreciate , calling it “ finger pointing . ”
He said that the renminbi , China ’s currency , would be kept “ basically stable . ”
To maximize its advantage , Beijing is exploiting a fundamental difference between two major international bodies : the World Trade Organization , which wields strict , enforceable penalties for countries that impede trade , and the International Monetary Fund , which acts as a kind of watchdog for global economic policy but has no power over countries like China that do not borrow money from it .
Looking at the financials for light rail in Bellevue , the Tunnel option just does n’t make fiscal sense .
Here are the numbers …
A tunnel would cost 77 % more than the Vision Line ( $ 430 MM more ) .
While many claim the Vision Line would reduce ridership , the Transit study determined that ridership would only be 5 % lower .
So here ’s the killer question :
How cost efficient is the tunnel ?
Well , simply , not very .
After 50 years of ridership ( assuming light rail were ready to go today and at steady - state ridership ) , the Tunnel option would cost $ 9 PER RIDER it generates over the Vision Line .
With expected fares to cost ~ $ 3 or so , this just does n’t make sense .
The Vision Line is much more sensible , costing $ 1.06 per rider in infrastructure costs .
The answer is a no-brainer .
Generating 95 % of the ridership at about half the cost is an easy winner .
Paying over $ 9.00 per rider does n’t make any sense .
You can read the full report here .
You can read previous praise of Kevin Wallace ’s plan here .
Note : Infrastructure Cost Per Rider assumes steady - state volume over 50 years .
“ Vision Line ” allocates total riders to Total Vision Line Cost .
“ Additional Ridership Generated From Tunnel Line ” allocates the higher cost of the tunnel ( $ 430 MM ) to the additional ridership generated ( 5 % higher ridership over 50 years ) .
This candidacy will self - destruct in five seconds ...
Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Debra Medina imploded on the Glenn Beck radio program this morning when she said she did n't have an opinion on whether the US government was behind the 9/11 attacks .
Medina , who has literally come out of nowhere to quickly become a legitimate candidate in the Republican primary , first laughed when Beck said he had received emails from listeners saying she was a " 9/11 truther . "
" That 's the first time I 've heard of that accusation , " she said , not exactly denying the charge .
Government conspiracy ?
So Beck asked her straight up : " Do you believe the government was in any way involved in the bringing down of the World Trade Centers on 9/11 ? "
Easy answer , right ?
Nope .
" I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard , " Medina replied .
" There are some very good arguments , and I think the American people have not seen all of the evidence there , so I have not taken a position on that . "
That answer caused a stir in the studio .
Beck quickly followed up by asking her if she would disavow any of her staff if they were " 9/11 truthers . "
" Well , you know , that 's a federal issue .
We 're very focused on issues in Texas , on Texas state government , " she said .
" I 'm certainly not into mind control or thought policing people .
" We 've got a very diverse team in this state and that 's because Texans are standing shoulder to shoulder to support and defend the Constitution .
I frankly do n't have time , you know , to go through and do psychological testing on people and know every thought or detail that they have . "
Buh -bye
After that , Beck politely thanked Medina for appearing on his program and dismissed her future political hopes .
" I think I can write her off the list , " he said .
" Let me take another look at [ candidate ] Kay Bailey Hutchison , if I have to . "
" Rick , I think you and I could French kiss right now , " he said of Texas 's current governor , Rick Perry who is running for re-election .
" Wow , " Beck continued .
" Wow .
The fastest way back to four percent , " he said of Medina 's one - time standing in the polls .
A recent survey showed her only four points behind Hutchison with 24 percent of the vote .
What I meant to say was ...
Medina quickly put out a statement clarifying what she meant , which just so happens not to sound anything like what she said .
" I was asked a question on the Glenn Beck show today regarding my thoughts on the so - called 9/11 truth movement .
I have never been involved with the 9/11 truth movement , and there is no doubt in my mind that Muslim terrorists flew planes into those buildings on 9/11 .
I have not seen any evidence nor have I ever believed that our government was involved or directed those individuals in any way .
No one can deny that the events on 9/11 were a tragedy for all Americans and especially those families who lost loved ones . "
So , how was I ?
How'd the response go over in Texas ?
Well , if the opinion of Dallas Morning News blogger Colleen McCain Nelson is any indication , about as well as The Who performing at the Super Bowl .
" ... To me , this sounds like an effective way to put your campaign on the fast track back to the fringe , " Nelson writes .

BBC News , Laiza , northern Burma
The sharp sound of loading and unloading weapons and the barked orders of the sergeant - major cut through the mountains of northern Burma as the young cadets are put through their morning drills .
Their discipline is good , their uniforms smart and there is little doubting their sense of purpose or patriotism towards the red and green flag with crossed machetes they proudly wear on their right shoulders .
They are the next generation of the Kachin Independence Army ( KIA ) , and say they are not afraid to be the generation that fights in a civil war many fear may soon be upon them .
" The Union of Burma was formed on the basis of equality for ethnic people , but there has been inequality throughout history and we are still being suppressed , " said cadet Dashi Zau Krang .
He is 26 and has a degree in business studies , but says inequality has stopped him getting a good job and driven him to join the military .
The Kachin people say they suffer discrimination in Burma
But he is not afraid .
" The Burmese army may be the strongest in South East Asia , while we are very few , but God will help us to liberate our people to get freedom and equality .
This is our responsibility , " he said .
It is a war the Kachin people do not want and one they cannot win .
But their generals believe a 17 - year ceasefire could soon end as a Burmese army deadline approaches , demanding the forces merge or disarm .
They have already refused , and although their leaders are still pushing for a political solution , their commanders are preparing for the worst when time runs out at the end of February .
" I can't say if there will be war for sure , but the government wants us to become a border guard force for them by the end of the month , " said the KIA 's Chief of Staff , Maj Gen Gam Shawng .
" We will not do that , or disarm , until they have given us a place in a federal union and ethnic rights as was agreed in 1947 . "
The KIA and its civilian organisation have been allowed to control a large swathe of northern Burma as part of a ceasefire agreement with the country 's ruling generals .
Trade with China
They provide power , roads and schools funded by taxes on the brisk trade from China as well as the jade and gold mines and teak .
But now soldiers are being recruited , veterans are being recalled and retrained , and an ethnic army is preparing to fight perhaps the biggest military force in South East Asia .
On the car radio are freedom songs , and at one of the training camps a course in traditional dance is being run - cultural nationalism and propaganda is strong .
A BBC team travelled to an area in northern Burma controlled by the Kachin army and its civilian arm , the Kachin Independence Organisation ( KIO ) .
We were taken to training camps and outposts , but could not walk into Laiza town to talk to people on the street for fear of being seen by an extensive network of Burmese or Chinese government informers and spies .
It made forming a balanced view very difficult , but the determination and planning of the military was clear .
High on a vantage point above their headquarters , trenches are being dug and tree trunks are being hauled and hewn into gun turrets piled high with earth .
They can see the Burmese army positions from here and they know this will be just one of the front lines if fighting breaks out .
A well - oiled and highly polished large - calibre anti-aircraft gun is produced , standing on a tripod in a bunker overlooking the lush jungle valley .
Guerrilla war
The gleaming gun is a statement , a display for the visitors , but the small metal plane stencilled on the sights looks woefully optimistic .
They are organised and say they have heavy weapons , but we did not see them .
There are around two dozen ethnic groups in Burma , mostly scattered around its borders , and the biggest have been in various states of ceasefire or civil war over the past few decades .
Traditional Kachin dances now take on a military theme
The KIA is one of the biggest .
Their commanders say it includes 10,000 regular troops and 10,000 reservists , but it is impossible to know for sure .
The Burmese army is huge .
It has an air force of sorts and artillery , and the KIA knows the only way to survive will be to withdraw into the jungle and fight a guerrilla war of attrition .
But civil war would create tens of thousands of refugees and create regional instability .
" If we are attacked the other ethnic groups will support us , as they know the same could happen to them , " Gen Gam Shawng explained .
The nearby Wa ethnic group has tens of thousands of troops and resources funded by drug smuggling , and we were told a deal with them had been agreed .
Whether civil war comes here is now up to the Burmese government .
If they use this election year to solve what they see as the " problem " of the ethnic groups they will have a fight on their hands , and the region will have to deal with the consequences .

Mozilla ’s Fennec project has finally delivered the first release of Firefox Mobile for Maemo - based phones such as the Nokia N900 .
The browser offers a modern browsing experience optimized for handheld devices and includes :
HTML5 , CSS2.1 , CSS3 , SVG , Canvas and most of the newer technologies available in desktop browsers .
A clean , clutter - free interface with minimal on - screen controls , one - touch bookmarking and the awesome bar .
Tabs , zooming , search engine integration , offline browsing , a download manager , password manager , pop -up blocker , and spell - checking .
Mozilla
Weave to synchronize your bookmarks , open tabs , and history with your desktop PC .
Location - aware browsing to get maps and information relevant to your current location .
Full customization , automated updates and add - ons support .
The browser is also available on Windows , Mac OS X and Linux if you want to test mobile development on your local PC .
It ’s a undoubtedly a great browser and worth considering if you ’re a Firefox user with an N900 .
I hope it does well but , realistically , how many people can install the browser ?
Version 1.0 is available for top - of - the - range Maemo devices with Windows Mobile coming soon .
However , Android development has only just begun .
More worryingly , there are no plans for versions on the Apple iPhone / iPad , Blackberry , or Symbian platforms .
Mozilla has stated they are willing to co-operate with Apple to produce an iPhone edition but , given their recent history , I doubt Apple will be eager to offer an alternative to Safari .
Perhaps Mozilla is looking to the future and hope we ’ll all have compatible devices within a few years ?
But I ca n’t help thinking they ’ve been a little too ambitious .
Should they have produced a simpler browser which could be installed on a wide range of mobile devices ?
More advanced versions could have been developed as the market evolved .
Fortunately , Opera are still producing a number of quality mobile browsers which work on a variety of mass - market devices .
Have you tried Firefox Mobile on your phone ?
Is it superior to your other mobile browsers ?
Are you considering web application development on mobile platforms ?
A child was sexually abused , beaten and forced to eat his own vomit by carers , Leicester Crown Court has heard .
Sandra Rainford , 52 , formerly of Delaware Road , Evington , Leicester , and her 55 - year - old sister , Edna Rainford , of Wand Street , Belgrave , are on trial .
Both deny ill - treatment and assault while Sandra also denies having sexual activity with a child aged under 13 .
The court heard the boy , now 13 , was often tied up naked when he stayed with Sandra in late 2008 .
The boy , whose mother was in Jamaica , had been staying with various friends and relatives until he was left with Sandra Rainford for several weeks , the court was told .
She gave me a cup , I had to vomit in that and then drink it
Boy , 11
In a videotaped interview with police which was played to the court , the boy , who cannot be identified , described being beaten with wooden sticks , stabbed in the shoulder with a fork and forced to eat chilli peppers as well as his own vomit .
He said : " She gave me a cup , I had to vomit in that and then drink it .
" If I spilled any I had to suck it up and lick it up off the floor .
" Sometimes when she has hit me with a wire she gets vinegar and water and puts it in a spray bottle and sprayed it on my back .
" My back starts stinging and itching . "
Thrown out
The court heard police were called to the house three times after neighbours heard the boy screaming , but Sandra Rainford claimed to be alone .
He also described being given a drink which made him feel tired and waking up to find himself naked with her in bed .
He said on another day he was bound and gagged by Edna Rainford , known as " Pam " , before both sisters started hitting him .
In the videotape , the boy also described being made to wash his clothes in cold water outside naked until the early hours after Sandra Rainford told him she was going to throw him out of the house .
The court heard a relative of the sisters noticed the marks on his body and took him to a friend , who called the police .
The case continues .

The end of the year is a time where you do some cleaning .
During this activity , I found an old issue of IEEE Software where I had noticed an article as a source of interesting software development quotes about people issue .
As New Year is also the time to take good resolutions , this should help us to deal with average people that we mostly are … and with the below average developers that normally will not read this ; o )
“ Any construction project begins with raw material , and as Confucius suggests , the nature of the raw material is critical to success – so much that you should n’t even begin if the “ wood ” is poor .
Even if you have sharp , finely honed tools , your project will still fail if the raw material is n’t sound .
And what , might you ask , is the raw material of software development ?
Us. People .
We are the only raw material of consequences in software development .
[….]
So how do we prepare this material ?
Obviously , we do n’t want it to be “ rotten ” , but how can we tell ?
How can we tell if hidden voids lurk beneath the surface , just waiting to ruin the project once we start carving ?
When you lack the right material , you ’ll keenly feel its absence .
For example , warning signs might include :
* The developer who only uses one favorite solution for every problem
* Folks who do n’t learn from mistakes – or worse , are too afraid to make any
* The developer who ca n’t be bothered to tell anyone what he ’s doing and why
[ …]
Painful as it is to admit it , for most people , most of the time , the problems that come up are our own fault – not the compiler ’s , not the OS ’s , not the database vendor ’s , not our bosses ’ , and not our coworkers ’ .
Yet many people and team , when facing a disastrous problem , first embark on a search ( aka witch - hunt ) to fix the blame .
It goes somewhat against human nature , but you should always try to fix the problem , not the blame .
Remember we all write software in our heads , so it makes sense to go ahead and take responsibility for it .
“ The cat ate my source code ” just does n’t cut it anymore – when problem come up , we need to invent options , not excuses .
[ …]
The isolated , lone developer huddled over a terminal with a can of highly caffeinated cola offers not only an inaccurate and misleading stereotype , but a dangerous one as well .
Isolated developers can inadvertently duplicate other teammates ’ work , use outdated or inappropriate methods , and even build the wrong product – at least , not the product the sponsor wanted .
Instead of taking more Java and UML courses , we should work on our technical writing , public speaking , and group facilitation .
A CPU with no I / O is n’t very useful .
Neither is a developer who ca n’t communicate . ”
Source : Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas , “ Preparing the Raw Material ” , IEEE Software , September / October 2003
My only disagreement with the authors is that I think that the end users are also essential raw material in software development , but I fully agree with the idea that we should take responsibility for our own limits .
Fresh out of the University , one of the first important modification that I did created a big trouble , because I did n’t tested it with the right files , even if my supervisor suggested this to me ; o(
This taught me that being confident with my work could be good … but thoroughly testing it was even better , o )
The general conception of Link is that of a thin , short - statured boy .
While the " short " descriptor is likely true , the " thinness " is probably just an idealization of form .
In - game , Link is depicted as a formidably stout , thick creature .
His limbs are far shorter than a human's , the torso is full and squat ; this build is more like that of a badger or wolverine than a primate .
This body - shape would give him maximum leverage ( which makes logical sense when you consider that most of Link 's time is spent pushing and pulling heavy stones ) , as well as enhanced stability when facing aerial or jumping foes , like thosefucking asshole spider things that always show up when you have half a heart left and you 've been listening to that goddamn beeping for like an hour now and you finally - finally - cracked open a pot with a heart in it , only to die at the last possible second from getting pogoed on by a frickin ' jacked - up crab .
1 Pac-Man

Much like a shark , Pac - Man was a predator who relied on his mouth as his sole source of attack .
This would put the tender areas of his face in danger , so it 's likely that his large , black , shark - like eyes would also have the shark 's trademark filmy secondary eyelid to close over before striking .
Though he was a fearsome hunter , Pac - Man was also an omnivore -- he fed off live prey as well as vegetation ( see cherries ) .

Therefore he probably had a set of teeth quite similar to a human's : Longer , sharper incisors to the front , with molars to the rear .
Because Pac - Man did n't have the razor - sharp claws or other grabbing capabilities we see in most land - based predators , he probably ate most like a snake .
This connection strengthens when you notice his trademark gaping maw , which allowed him to swallow prey more quickly and use his stomach to do most of the digesting .
This also accounts for the unusual shape of Pac - Man :
We 're only familiar with the fuller , rounder body because his handlers obviously wanted to use a sedated , well - fed creature during gameplay to help limit aggression and the potential for violence .
In reality , the version we are accustomed to would only be seen in a creature that had recently caught a meal .
Between feedings , Pac - Man 's bulk would be in the form of a deflated cylindrical trail of loose skin , most resembling a used skin-condom .
The Pac - Man 's primary food source , it should be noted , is the souls of the recently deceased .
When grandpa " passes on , " it 's possible that instead of " going to a better place " he is actually quickly chased down a dark , twisting crypt corridor by an orb of teeth , before ultimately being torn apart and digested ; only his eyeballs left to be callously crapped out onto the cold stone floor .
Supplementary Information :
The female of the Pac - Man species is often distinguished by the adorable " bow " on her head .
This is another case of dangerous anthropomorphization :
The " bow " as we call it , is actually a brightly colored crest .
Bright colors and elaborate appendages in nature are often a warning sign to potential predators that the animal is venomous , and to stay away .
Nature expert R. DeVoe , formerly of the New Edition Digest , famously authored a report on this phenomenon in an expose published in the early 90s , where he also warned of the female 's deviousness by insisting that the creature 's elongated teeth , substantial girth and streamlined anterior were all further indicators that one should be wary .
This was the " Never Trust a Big Butt and a Smile " system of threat identification as outlined in his greater " That Girl is Poison " treatise .

This is the lesson that the United States government -- the government of the historic progressive , Barack Obama -- taught the children of America today :
" Children , the law is nothing but a rag smeared with blood and shit .
" It is only for suckers , rubes and losers .
" Claw your way to the top -- by any means necessary -- and the law can never touch you .
" This is the American way . "

The way America eats has to change , that ’s no secret .
Thanks to the efforts of these ten trailblazers , that change might be closer than we think .
Dan Barber , executive chef and co-owner of Blue Hill Farm Barber is the brains behind the “ Know thy Farmer ” philosophy embraced at Blue Hill Farm .
He was recently honored at the USA Network ’s Character Approved Awards for his achievements in “ green ” food cultivation and preparation .
A passionate advocate for regional farm networks , Barber continues to practice what he preaches at his family owned farms , as well as with the nonprofit Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture .
Deborah Kane , Vice President of Food and Farms at Ecotrust Last month , Ecotrust began allowing Northwest food producers and buyers to utilize FoodHub , an online resource aimed to simplify their connections with each other and increase food trade in the Pacific Northwest .
Kane continues to expound Ecotrust ’s mission to inspire fresh thinking that promotes social equity , economic opportunity and environmental well - being .

Mike Yohay , CEO of Cityscape Farms Yohay ’s Cityscape Farms continues to work to produce great - tasting fresh food for local buyers with its hydroponic greenhouses .
“ Hydroponic farming is incredibly innovative and resource economical compared to conventional farming .
It ’s well - suited for cities because you can do it anywhere , ” says Yohay .
Gary Hirshberg , CEO , Stonyfield Farm
In the past 26 years , Hirshberg has taken his organic yogurt company and turned it into an organic yogurt empire worth $ 340 million .
Stonyfield Farm does n’t just deliver high - quality food to consumers , but pays farmers 60 - 100 % more than conventional farmers , to ensure the use of sustainable farming practices .
What does he ask of his customers ?
“ When you shop , you ’re really voting for the kind of world you want .
It is power , ” he says .
“ We should use that power for good . ” Roger Doiron , founder , Kitchen Gardeners International Doiron can proudly take credit for bringing a garden to the lawn of the White House with Eat the View , a campaign that rallied Americans ’ desire to see a healthier First Family .
“ I knew this garden had been proposed in the past , and it had its champions –Alice Waters , Michael Pollan , ” he says .
“ I was n’t a rock star like them , but thought I could play the role of a roadie , making sure the mics are on and the amps are cranked up to make sure other people ’s voices were heard . ”

Jamie Oliver , chef The Naked Chef is on a mission to bring healthy food to every child in America .
His campaign , Jamie ’s Food Revolution , aims to replace junk food and processed snacks with fresh and nutritious meals , in school and at home .
ABC will air a six - part series tracking the campaign as Oliver heads to Huntington , West Virginia , which has been called the unhealthiest city in America .
If Oliver can make Huntington healthy , he might be able to make America healthy .
Melanie Cheng , founder , FarmsReach San Francisco - based FarmsReach pairs farmers up with buyers for sustainable local food systems , with plans to be nationwide by 2011 .
“ If you look at statistics , farmers markets and Community Supported Agriculture are awesome , growing distribution methods , but they still make up less than 1 % of food volume sold in the country , ” she says .
“ That ’s why we ’re working with the wholesale channel , for distributors and bigger institutions . ”
Michael Pollan , author , Food Rules Pollan ’s latest book , Food Rules , offers memorable tips on making wise eating choices .
In his new book , Pollan ( who has been described as the nation ’s most trusted resource for food - related issues ) shows Americans that “ eating does n’t have to be so complicated . ”

Dickson Despommier , Vertical Farms Project
The Vertical Farms Project is the brainchild of Despommier , a professor at Columbia , and his students .
Envisioning a world of sustainable farms housed in urban skyscrapers , the project proposes paying traditional farmers to simply plant trees on their land , in an attempt to sequester carbon from the atmosphere .
Crazy ?
Maybe .
But it ’s inspiring more thought , more solutions .
Robert Kenner , director , Food Inc. Kenner ’s documentary Food Inc. did its fair share of grossing viewers out by exposing the heinous slaughter practices ( and eating habits ) found across our country .
More importantly , the film , which showcased leaders like Hirshberg , showed that it is possible to eat healthy and enjoy it .
As a followup to my article “ Outlaw Press , aka Jim Shipman , Is a Big Crook “ , I have an comprehensive update provided by one of the artists Shipman ripped off .
The story thus far :
A small RPG Publisher ( Outlaw Press , Inc. run by James L. Shipman II ) that exclusively publishes Tunnels & Trolls RPG materials was accused of extensively using and publishing unlicensed art and text for profit by several artist and writers who own the copyright to the art and content in question .
Some of the images used by this publisher are work - for - hire art copyrighted by big - name companies like Dreamworks SKG .
Games Workshop , Upper Deck / Blizzard , and Wizards of the Coast .
The discussion about the whole matter of this publisher using unlicensed art started on this thread at RPGNet ( which is now 101 pages long , and has been closed ) .
The thread started when it was brought to the attention of an artist , Kevin Bracey , that he was wrongfully credited with the cover art of a product that had actually been created by Mauricio Herrera and used without permission .
Kevin Bracey was , however , the creator of the original cover for the product , which was changed when the work was made available in PDF format by Outlaw Press , Inc .
After repeated unanswered communications sent to the publisher by the growing number of artists who recognized their work as being used without a license , mainly as covers for his products , his Lulu and DriveThruRPG stores were taken down with all the questionable products removed .
The products were also removed from his own website for a while , but soon afterward were re-listed without showing the cover art –the most readily recognized and easily identifiable circumstance of copyright infringement .
Moreover , Outlaw Press , Inc. removed their e-mail address from their main site , although the publisher ’s actual contact details can still be found here and here .
After many more unanswered communications to the publisher , some from past contributors requesting the removal of their freely contributed material from his publications ( Tori Bergquist , Simon Lee Tranter , Ken St. Andre , Gianmatteo Tonci , and M. E. Volmar included ) as a result of their outrage and in solidarity to the affected artists , the matter was still unresolved and being ignored by the publisher who continued to sell – through his own website , Lulu ’s Amazon Markeplace and Amazon ’s CreateSpace – products that were no longer just suspect ( on a grand scale ) of copyright infringement , but whose permission by the contributing artists and writers to sell their materials had been rescinded .
Some artists , prompted by a lack of answer from Shipman , resorted to leaving notes of art theft on the Reviews section of the products listed on Amazon.com .
And eventually , all but 5 of the roughly 130 listed items were removed from the Amazon.com and Lulu ’s Amazon Marketplace stores at the request of the art ’s copyright owners who were left no choice but to contact Lulu and Amazon.com directly .
Of the 5 remaining products ( which can still be found here ) , 2 still present covers with verified unlicensed art – “ Troll ’s Blood & Old Delvers : Tunnels & Trolls Anthology ” with Jon Hodgson ’s art , and “ Lizardmen In Red Water Bay : A Tunnels & Trolls Fanpostal Novel ” with Allen Palmer ’s art .
So far , the list of artists that have confirmed the use of their unlicensed art featured on the covers of Outlaw Press , Inc. products ( without counting the 10 + contributors who have so far rescinded Shipman ’s permission to use their materials ) is overwhelming and growing ( with around 20 or so other artists who are being contacted to confirm if indeed their art has been used without permission ) .
These 30 + artists , some whose 70 + pieces of unlicensed artwork is featured on several of the publisher ’s products ( see attached PDF file ) , include :
J. P. Targete
Sylvain Despretz
Simon Dominic
Mauricio Herrera
Jon Hodgson
Daniel Horne
Michal Ivan
John Shannon
Bill Corbett
Martin McKeown
Mats Minnhagen
Ursula Vernon
Jeff Lee Johnson
Henning Janssen

Kory K .
One of the artists , Daniel Falck , wrote about the situation in his own blog .
Others have also written about the matter at :
The publisher was also accused of reprinting and selling without the author ’s permission a magazine called “ Mazes & Minotaurs , ” which is offered for free on the author ’s website .
The details of this accusation can be found here .
Moreover , most of the art identified by the artists as used without a license is art featured on the covers of this publisher ’s products , meaning that a thorough examination of the interior art used on his publications is yet to be undertaken , and that more artwork could have been used without a license by this publisher and more artists may be in reality affected by his practices .
The requests to remove freely contributed art and content , and the cancellation of the license to publish Tunnels & Trolls materials made by the makers of the Tunnels & Trolls game , Ken St. Andre and Flying Buffalo , Inc. , have so far been completely ignored , and nothing close to an apology or explanation has been offered by the publisher to anyone – although he has appeared as Shipy ( also his nickname on http://www.trollhalla.com – Ken St. Andre ’s Tunnels & Trolls website ) in this thread ( post 162 and 168 ) mocking the requests and comments about his practices made by the RPG community .
At this point , the publisher claimed that his art was bought from an art broker called David Levine ( or David Levin ) from the United Kingdom , of whom no record exists anywhere on the Web and to whom Shipman claims to have paid around $ 2000 for all the art used in his publications .
Still , after having been repeatedly informed of his use of unlicensed art , the publisher tried to sell the infringing print products through his own website and made no effort to recall or remove the publications from any of his other still active sales outlets .
Subsequently , after the posts were made by Shipy on the Trollbridge , the publisher ’s website announced on its homepage :
“ All this month we will be having a X - mas sale .
That means most of our T&T prices will be listed for half price or cheaper .
So if you are looking to buy something , this month will be the best time to do so . ”
And went on to boast about the money he was making off products that still featured all the unlicensed art in question .
“ We have lots of new T&T items planned for the coming year ( Novels , Solos , T&T Supplements and even a T&T Battle Dice Game Ken St. Andre created ) .
Our sales have continued to grow with the site statics breaking down as such ; roughly 3,241 people visit here each day , with 1 in 122 people making a purchase of $ 50 or more .
We are shipping world wide and we continue to expand . ”
It is also of note that the publisher sells a magazine called “ The Hobbit Hole , ” although the word Hobbit and its use is trademarked to the Tolkien Estate , and highly unlikely to have been licensed to an obscure independent publisher such as Outlaw Press , Inc. and / or James Shipman .
This week , and after having been contacted through e-mail by Shipman ( who cited bogus publication rights and falsely claimed owning the copyrights to freely contributed materials whose copyright was never given to him by the rightful copyright owners ) , Ken St. Andre terminated James Shipman membership at Trollhalla–St.
Andre ’s own Tunnels & Trolls fan club–after issuing the following statement :
“ Because James Shipman has shown himself to be neither truthful nor courageous nor ethical , I declare that he cannot remain a member of Trollhalla any longer . ”
Although the publisher ’s website has now been down for a few days , he continues to sell his products on E - Bay under various user names including : jimship1 , Hobbit_King , actionseller99 and selling 4u2 , using the hobbit_king@yahoo.com PayPal account .
Still , a storefront for this publisher and most of his products ( which still feature the unlicensed art ) can be found by following the product links at the Noble Knights game store here , probably selling old stock .
Not only have the actions by James Shipman been damaging and disrespectful to many , including his contributors and the Tunnels & Trolls community , but his practices have muddied reputations , impacted artists and fans alike , and cast a bad shadow on the whole RPG community and on legitimate independent publishers .
This situation needs to be exposed , if only in the hope of helping the affected artists and contributors who have been wrong by Shipman , and the RPG community and independent publishers alike .
Please help support the artists and legitimate RPG publishers by not patronizing this ripoff artist , even at discount prices .
If you are an artist or writer , do not compromise your own professional reputation by working with him .
* Shifting demographics to dampen demand - report
* Growth in car - buying population to drop to 50 - year low
* Industry will become more reliant on replacement sales
TORONTO , Feb 26 ( Reuters ) - Growth in the North American vehicle buying population is set to drop to its slowest pace in 50 years as the baby boom generation retires and cuts down on driving , according to a report by Scotia Economics released on Friday .
Boomers , those born between 1945 and 1963 , who account for 60 percent of all drivers in the United States and Canada , are heading into their golden years .
At the same time , the number of drivers in the 16 to 29 age group , is increasing at the slowest pace since the mid-1960s , the report said .
The North American auto sector is in recovery mode after one of its worst ever cyclical downturns .
U.S. and Canadian sales are expected to top 13 million vehicles in 2010 , up from 11.9 million last year , but well below the sector ’s peak of 17.4 million earlier in the decade , said Carlos Gomes , an economist at Scotia Economics , and author of the report .
“ However , unfavorable demographics , including the retirement of the baby boom generation , will dampen vehicle demand over the coming decades , leaving the industry increasingly dependent on replacement demand , ” he said .
Growth in the North American vehicle buying population will fall to 0.6 percent per year in Canada over the coming decade , and only marginally higher in the United States , from 1.4 percent over the past 50 years , the report said .
“ Growth in vehicle buying population has already been slowing since 2007 , but the downturn will intensify , and remain in place through 2030 , ” said Gomes , adding : “ the sharp fall - off in driving by retirees will have an enormous negative impact to new vehicle demand . ”
The number of North Americans 60 years or older is expected to surpass the population of young car buyers by 2013 .
Gomes said that vehicle replacement will become more important to the auto industry over the next few years , as nearly half of the 250 million cars and trucks on the road in North America are at least 10 years old .

So , a few weeks ago some robbers scaled a wall at Best Buy , cut a hole in the roof , rappelled in , and stole $ 20 k of MBP's .
A few of us were discussing how dumb it was to risk your life and going to prison for what would only yield a few thousand dollars for each member of the crew .
I think they stepped their game up , and I 'm not joking , this was in the same area :
" Thieves scaled a wall at a pharmaceutical warehouse over the weekend , cut a hole in the roof and rappelled inside to steal about $ 70 million in antidepressants and other prescription drugs , authorities said Tuesday . "
Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , said today that he plans to support the health care bill when it comes up for a vote this week .
He becomes the first Democrat to publicly disclose his intention to switch from a no to a yes vote on the legislation .
INTERACTIVE GRAPHIC
Democrats to Watch on the Health Care Vote A look at the 40 House Democrats who may decide the fate of the health care bill .
“ I ’ve decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation , ” Mr. Kucinich said at a morning news conference in the Capitol .
“ If my vote is to be counted , let it count now for passage of the bill , hopefully in the direction of comprehensive health care reform . ”
Mr. Kucinich said he was “ quite aware of the historic fight ” underway and decided to drop his opposition that the bill did not go far enough .
He said , “ I believe health care is a civil right . ”
In an interview five days ago , Mr. Kucinich said he could not support the legislation and dismissed suggestions that his vote would derail the Democratic health care agenda .
But since then , the congressman has come under extraordinary pressure from groups across the Democratic spectrum , including Moveon.org , which encouraged him to support the bill .
He said he still did not think the legislation went far enough — he has long advocated a single - payer system — but said his objections should not stand in the way of the bill .
“ In the past week it ’s become clear that the vote on the final health bill will be very close , ” Mr. Kucinich said .
“ I take this vote with the utmost seriousness .
I ’m quite aware of the historic fight , which has lasted the last century . ”
He added : “ The president ’s visit to my district on Monday underscores the urgency of this vote . ”
In a private conversation aboard Air Force One , en route to Ohio on Monday , President Obama pressed Mr. Kucinich for his support for the bill .
The White House did not know what the congressman had decided until earlier today , when his aides advised administration officials and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of his plans .
While supporting the Senate bill , Mr. Kucinich said he did not like the procedure that might be used to pass it without an up - or - down vote in the House .
“ I do n’t like much of anything about this process , ’’ Mr. Kucinich said .
Explaining factors he had considered in making his decision , Mr. Kucinich said , “ We have to be very careful that the potential of President Obama ’s presidency not be destroyed by this debate . ’’
Mr. Kucinich said he would vote for the Senate bill even though he believed it was seriously flawed .
“ Something is better than nothing — that ’s what I keep hearing from my constituents , ’’ Mr. Kucinich said .
The congressman said he would keep working for a government - financed single - payer health care system .
“ I do n’t like this bill , ’’ Mr. Kucinich said .
“ But I made a decision to support it in the hope that we can move toward a more comprehensive approach . ’’
Mr. Kucinich said he had not received anything from Congressional leaders or the White House in return for his support .
“ There was no Nebraska or Louisiana type deal , ’’ Mr. Kucinich said , referring to states that received extra Medicaid money in the Senate bill .
Mr. Kucinich ’s support of the health care legislation gives Ms. Pelosi a bit of breathing room as she searches for 216 votes needed to pass the bill , in a vote that may be taken at the end of the week .
But it does not end the vote - counting efforts that are continuing on Capitol Hill , where Democrats are still trying to persuade other undecided lawmakers to support the measure .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian communists paid homage on Friday to Soviet leader Josef Stalin , while liberals accused the Kremlin of conniving to whitewash the dictator .

Communist Party chiefs led a procession of largely elderly people across Red Square on the 57th anniversary of Stalin ’s death , laying flowers at his grave by the Kremlin wall .
The solemn visit is an annual tradition for communists steeped in nostalgia for the Soviet era .
But this year , it comes as Russia ’s bitter debate over Stalin ’s legacy sharpens ahead of May 9 celebrations marking 65 years since the Nazi defeat .
For the first time in decades , Stalin ’s image may appear among the banners and posters that Moscow authorities put up for Victory Day , which will draw foreign leaders to Moscow as guests of the government .
City plans to set up 10 information stands describing Stalin ’s role in the war have deepened animus between Russians who loathe him and their compatriots who love him .
“ Today ... the greatness of Stalin ’s era is self - evident even to his most furious haters , ” Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said after laying flowers at Stalin ’s grave .
“ We liberated the whole world , ... we built a nuclear shield , we were the first to fly into space , and we created this ( nuclear ) parity that ensured stable peace for nearly 50 years . ”
Critics call Stalin a murderer for the millions of deaths in his forced collectivization and Gulag prison camps .
They say victory in the war came despite mistakes that contributed to the devastating death toll of some 27 million Soviet citizens .
Memorial , a rights group that has documented Stalin ’s abuses , says it will put up its own stands .
“ These V - Day posters will not only insult me but also soil the memory of my father , who died with the Second Strike Army due to Stalin ’s senseless and cruel orders , ” said Lyudmila Alexeyeva , a leading rights activist and Soviet - era dissident .
After his death in 1953 , the Kremlin launched a campaign to discredit Stalin , and evidence of his abuses came pouring out during the era of openness under Mikhail Gorbachev before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 .
But Stalin ’s backers have become bolder in recent years , and praise of the iron - fisted leader more prominent .
Opinion polls show many Russians view Stalin as a talented manager and a tough wartime leader who defeated a strong enemy .
Stalin was voted Russia ’s third most important historical figure of all time in a nationwide television show .
Since former KBG officer Vladimir Putin came to power a decade ago , Russia ’s beleaguered liberals have accused the Kremlin of helping to burnish Stalin ’s image in order to justify its own increasingly tight political control .
Alexeyeva , 82 , a recipient of the European Parliament ’s top human rights award , called the sincerity of official statements into question .
“ I suspect they have sympathy for Stalin , ” she said of Russia ’s leaders .
Roy Medvedev , a prominent historian and author of many books on Stalin , said he saw Stalin as a negative figure who would never be absolved but could not be ignored .
“ For some , Stalin is a criminal .
For others , he led the state for 30 years .
The state had achievements and faults -- it had it all , ” he told Reuters .
“ Can Churchill be deleted from Britain ’s history ?
Likewise , we cannot erase Stalin from ours . ”
Do this in the interests of political research .
Google the international company , Sheridan Sheets .
Then go to Our Story and click on the 1970s segment .
And there to this day you will read : " The decade began with Mrs Andrew Peacock perched decorously on a chair , endorsing Sheridan 's newly introduced printed sheets . "
Yes , 40 years on , the British company is still dining out on the day that an Australian Cabinet minister offered to resign because his wife had done a television advertisement endorsing their bed sheets .
The issue was trivial ; the idea of resigning ridiculous .
In fact the Prime Minister of the day , John Gorton , told Peacock not be " a bloody fool . "
But it was one of the most memorable stories of the Gorton period .
Likewise the colour TV affair .
In 1982 , Michael MacKellar , a Fraser Government Minister , brought a colour TV into the country , but listed it on the customs form as black and white , therefore avoiding duty .
He was sacked , along with the Minister for Customs , John Moore , who handled the issue clumsily .
And ditto the Paddington Bear affair .
In 1984 , when Customs officials searched a suitcase belonging to the wife of Hawke Government Cabinet Minister , Mick Young , they found a Paddington bear .
Then , I 'm sure to their absolute horror , they discovered that the minister had n't declared it , therefore dodging who knows how much in duty .
Young had to resign until he was judicially cleared .
The point is that anybody who has followed politics since the 70s can instantly recall these episodes .
But who can recall the names of the 11 ministers who either resigned or were sacked during the Howard years , and the nature of their indiscretions ?
Analysts constantly bring up the occasions when ministers were sacked for relatively minor offences in the days when , apparently in some sort of misty eyed way , ministerial standards meant something .
They seem to think that these occurrences should be the precedents for now and into the future .
But many of those resignations and sackings were over the top , an overreaction to blanket media coverage at a time when political parties were still trying to come to terms with the relatively new and powerful television medium .
The sackings were wrong then and they would be wrong today , if similar circumstances existed .
The point is , all allegations of ministerial impropriety ought to be taken individually on their merits .
There never has been an unambiguous prescription for these things .
In broad terms , ministers are individually responsible to the Parliament for actions taken under their authority , and that includes people in their department and various related agencies and statutory authorities .
But even if responsibility is then established , there is no clause or precedent or convention that says the penalty must be resignation .
That again depends on the individual circumstances .
John Howard saw a political opportunity when he campaigned for office in 1996 .
He promised and eventually delivered a new code of conduct for ministers that led to the loss of five ministers in his first term .
The casualties included National Party minister , John Sharp , who was destined to lead his party , but instead walked away from politics altogether .
Another casualty was one of Howard 's senior advisers - and one of his closest friends , Grahame Morris - who said years later : " The code was written by public servants and Mother Teresa could n't have lived with it . "
One of Howard 's senior ministers , Senator Nick Minchin , told Paul Kelly in an interview for his book , The March of Patriots : " There was a feeling that Howard 's manic commitment to the code was putting nearly everybody at risk for the most mundane transgressions .
The code produced some shocking events . "
The code was eventually abandoned to the point where the latter Howard years are now dragged up as an illustration of how ministerial responsibility barely exists at all anymore .
The fact is that if a minister was held responsible - and had to resign - every time somebody under his charge screwed up - then there would be no ministers .
Putting the schizophrenic
Howard reactions to one side , prime ministers usually get it right .
The political imperative usually works .
Common sense has to apply .
There can be no inflexible prescription .
And surely common sense demands that before Peter Garrett is sacked , there should be coronial inquiries to determine why four people died , and who was responsible ?

In the game , Johnson , described as an amiable self - made billionaire who refuses to accept the responsibility of his power , starts off as a sort of sidekick to the player but then he starts to lose his grip on humanity as the story progresses .
According to an open casting call we received in 2008 , at some point in the game , after Johnson has isolated himself from the people around him and lost touch with reality , he becomes the main bad guy .

Resurrected inside a computer , Johnson will urge the player to continue testing as he discusses his take on the afterlife .

We also get a bit of insight into Johnson through this week 's Valve update of Portal which included plenty of buried hints all of which led to some fantastic quotes from Johnson :
" Science is n't about why , it 's about why not .
You ask :
Why is so much of our science dangerous ?
I say :
Why not marry safe science if you love it so much .
In fact , why not invent a special safety door that wo n't hit you in the butt on the way out , because you are fired . "
" Plus , in the event of your death , I personally guarantee that , thanks to the form you were required to sign this morning , your family will not suffer the indignities of a prolonged and costly legal battle against Aperture Science .
Trust me , I am rich , and it is a burden I would not wish on anyone . "

So we 've got an unhinged , disembodied billionaire acting as friend and protagonist .
We 've got all of the tech of Aperture Science , like that spiffy Portal gun and maybe some new toys .
And what else ?

Well , for starters , Portal 2 will introduce a cooperative multiplayer mode with an " entirely separate campaign with a unique story , test chambers , and two new player characters , " according to a product description from Gamestop .
The online retailer also lists the title as a standalone game priced at $ 49.99 for PC and $ 59.99 for Xbox 360 , which may or may not be placeholder ( just like that Mac logo on the PC version 's box art . )

The final piece of the puzzle may be revealed on the Game Informer cover , which seems to hint at the possibility of the game leaving the stark confines of the lab and going abroad .
So when is this dark comedy coming out ?
This coming holiday season , according to Steam 's announcement today , just like Plunkett guessed in 2008 .

One final clue .
There were certain letters underlined in the official Portal 2 announcement .
Here are the underlined letters , and one number : drattmannh0nee .
That 's the latest log in for the Portal 2 BBS ( drattman / h0nee ) , spitting out more ASCII art and text file madness .

The Dutch government collapsed at the weekend , making it the first European and Nato administration to fall because of the war in Afghanistan .
The fourth fall of a government under the prime minister , Jan-Peter Balkenende , in eight years could end his career and is certain to usher in a period of political uncertainty that could bring big gains for the extreme anti-Muslim right .
The end of Balkenende 's centrist coalition , mainly of Christian and social democrats , means that the almost 2,000 Dutch troops in Afghanistan , based around Uruzgan , south - west of Kabul , will start pulling out in August and be withdrawn by the end of the year .
" If nothing else will take its place , then [ the Afghan mission ] ends , " Balkenende told Dutch television yesterday .
" The image of the Netherlands is far from flourishing abroad .
They do not understand what we are doing . "
The Netherlands could set a precedent , encouraging other European countries to get cold feet about their presence in Afghanistan .
" The moment the Netherlands says as sole and first country we will no longer have activities at the end of 2010 , it will raise questions in other countries and this really pains me , " Balkenende said .
While the prime minister sought to extend the Afghan mission , under strong pressure from Nato allies and Washington , his Labour party coalition partner opposed the extension and walked out of crisis talks on Saturday , spelling the end of the government two years into its term .
The Dutch withdrawal is a blow to President Barack Obama and comes as the US and Nato troops mount their biggest operation in Afghanistan for years .
The Americans have been pressing for more European troops in Afghanistan and voiced satisfaction with European pledges of some 9,000 extra forces in recent weeks .
But the Americans are demanding that the Europeans supply 2,000 trainers for the Afghan army and police .
" The one most important shortfall is in the category of trainers , " said a senior US official .
" We 'd like them [ Europeans ] to step up .
We 'd like every ally to put up more trainers .
This is critical . "
The Dutch Labour party 's vehement opposition to remaining in Afghanistan is popular , bringing it instant opinion poll gains at the weekend .
But a general election is expected in May , with all eyes on the controversial populist anti-Islam maverick , Geert Wilders , who is poised for a major electoral breakthrough .
Wilders ' Freedom party currently has nine of 150 parliamentary seats , but he came second in last year 's European Parliament elections and an opinion poll at the weekend put him neck - and - neck for an election victory .
" We can have excellent results in the next few months and it can only change the Netherlands for the better , " Wilders told Reuters .
According to the weekend poll , Balkenende 's Christian democrats would take 26 to Wilders ' 24 seats in parliament .
The fourth fall of a Balkenende government in eight years suggests he could be replaced as Christian democrat leader .
" It is embarrassing , " said the NRC Handelsblad newspaper .
" There is good reason to doubt [ Balkenende 's ] qualities as a leader . "
In 1983 , U2 frontman Bono was a scrappy upstart on the world music scene , and he sang about how " nothing changes on New Year 's Day . "
But the 2010 version of Irish rocker is a world - traveling , President - meeting , New York Times op - ed- penning factotum — and he 's demanding some New Year 's changes , especially from ISPs .
Forget acting like " dumb pipes " or even the Post Office ; ISPs must now take a lesson from China and start proactively filtering copyrighted content .
Bono's NYT column offers up ten big ideas for the next decade .
It 's an entertaining read , especially when he suggests that the US government use its current investment in car companies like GM to bring in designers like " Steve Jobs and Jonny Ive from Apple " to make cars " sexual objects " once again .
( We 'd love to see Ive 's take on that quintessential non-sexy suburban vehicle , the minivan , for instance . )
But Bono also warns of a coming apocalypse , one that will swallow the movie business the way it has already devoured music and the newspaper ... and this is where some serious questions arise .
Did you know , for instance , that the big problem newspapers have faced in recent years is copyright infringement of their tiny text files ?
We were not aware that this was one of the main problems for an industry battered by craigslist ( classified ads ) , hammered by sites like Zillow and Realtor.com ( real estate searches ) , hampered by easy access to other big national newspapers on the Internet , stung by the current economics of free ad - supported online access , etc , etc .
Bono 's contention is that " the only thing protecting the movie and TV industries from the fate that has befallen music and indeed the newspaper business is the size of the files . "
This , a truism from three years ago , certainly has a kernel of truth to it — but to call it the " only " thing saving movies is ridiculous .
File size alone is no long a defense against movie file - sharing , and someone willing to pen the lyrics " Force quit , and move to trash ...
Restart and reboot yourself ...
Password : you ! " ( from the song " Unknown Caller " ) should know this .
What we see , in fact , is box office receipts rising to record - setting levels over each of the last three years , even as bandwidth exploded and P2P hubs became even simpler to use .
This is n't a complete picture of the industry , but this one data point alone puts the lie to the idea that people simply wo n't pay money for experiences and objects that they value .
When it comes to music , there are other key questions :
Why are live concert revenues way up ?
What role has the shift to digital singles rather than full album sales played in the major label revenue decline ?
If piracy is such a problem that deputizing ISPs is needed , how is it that labels like EMI are actually growing their revenues ?
It 's important to think about the root cause of the change in these markets , because knowing the cause leads to proposing the solution .
In Bono 's case , because the issue is simply about bandwidth — people will just take whatever they want once it 's easy enough — the solution is about the bandwidth providers .
" We ’re the post office , they tell us ; who knows what ’s in the brown - paper packages ? " he writes .
" But we know from America ’s noble effort to stop child pornography , not to mention China ’s ignoble effort to suppress online dissent , that it ’s perfectly possible to track content .
Perhaps movie moguls will succeed where musicians and their moguls have failed so far , and rally America to defend the most creative economy in the world , where music , film , TV and video games help to account for nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product . "
The music industry did attempt to " rally America " to defend its economic practices , and America wanted nothing to do with the mass lawsuits that the industry eventually had to halt .
Is Bono seriously suggesting that the far more invasive practice of turning ISPs into wiretappers would somehow find public traction as a great idea necessary to defend Hollywood ?
This is n't the current " three strikes " idea , either , since it directly charges ISPs with the responsibility to do the tracking , or at least to cooperate with it .
And ISPs would have great difficulty implementing the plan , thanks to encryption .
( This could be bypassed in some cases by trawling BitTorrent swarms for IP addresses , etc. , but such a plan would essentially turn an ISP into a content identification company .
Identifying copyright content — and , remember , this would only be copyrighted content that was n't supposed to be transferred — passing along its own wires would be quite difficult .
But one of Bono 's most appealing qualities is his self - mockery , and he calls himself one of the " least sympathetic " voices for the cause .
" Note to self : Do n’t get over - rewarded rock stars on this bully pulpit , or famous actors , " he suggests .
" Find the next Cole Porter , if he / she has n’t already left to write jingles . "
It 's only a couple of paragraphs , and as such the idea is n't fleshed out .
But I wonder what got Bono thinking about " thieving " ISPs in the first place ?
The following is the first episode from Mark Dery ’s nonfiction novella , How I Lost One Leper Messiah , and Gained Another .

— Ed .
As Jesus was on his way , the crowds almost crushed him .
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years , but no one could heal her .
She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak , and immediately her bleeding stopped .
“ Who touched me ? ” Jesus asked .
When they all denied it , Peter said , “ Master , the people are crowding and pressing against you . ”
But Jesus said , “ Someone touched me ; I know that power has gone out from me . ” — Luke , 8:42 - 46

A teenage girl is crying , sobbing inconsolably , her face a tear - streaked mask of sweet anguish .
She ’s English , dressed in schoolboy drag : a white dress shirt and blazer , topped off with the regulation necktie .
Pinned to her jacket is a photo button of David Bowie in character as Ziggy Stardust .
She exhibits all the emotional stigmata of Ziggymania , a hormonally fueled religious hysteria that convulsed Anglo - American teen culture from 1972 until 1974 , if not later .
We ’re watching her in a 1973 report on the Bowie phenomenon by the BBC news program Nationwide , uploaded to YouTube .
“ They said ‘e was comin ’ ‘ round the back !
I ’ve been waiting for ages to see ‘ im , ” she wails , agonized at missing the star ’s limousine arrive .
“ Why ’re you so upset ? ” a bemused interviewer asks , across a generational chasm .
She looks up , incredulous at the man ’s inability to grasp the obvious : “ He ’s smashing ! ” Another girl crowds into the frame , as radiantly happy as her friend is distraught .
“ I kissed his hand ! ” she gasps , in the grip of some mystical eros .
“ I kissed his hand !
I went ( mimes kissing Bowie ’s hand ) ; Oh , he ’s lovely ! ”
●
It pleased our Lord , one day that I was in prayer , to show me His Hands , and His Hands only .
The beauty of them was so great , that no language can describe it . [ … ]
You will think … that it required no great courage to look upon Hands … so beautiful .
But so beautiful are glorified bodies , that the glory which surrounds them renders those who see that which is so supernatural and beautiful beside themselves .
— Saint Teresa of Ávila , “ Chapter XXVIII : Visions of the Sacred Humanity , and of the Glorified Bodies , ” from The Life of St. Teresa of Jesus , of the Order of Our Lady of Carmel

Ziggy Stardust , for anyone who was n’t a teenager in the seventies , is the protagonist of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars , Bowie ’s 1972 concept album about a Martian prophet of “ soul love ” who touches down on a doomed Earth .
Proclaiming an astro - hippie gospel of transcendence through free love ( “ let all the children boogie , ” unquote ) , Ziggy seizes on rock stardom as the most effective media pulpit for his message .
Not content with mere celebrity , he imagines himself a “ leper messiah . ”
But , like too many telegenic holy men , he ends up seduced by his own Cult of Personality : “ making love with his ego / Ziggy sucked up into his mind ” ( “ Ziggy Stardust ” ) .
In the Ziggy outtake “ Sweet Head , ” he sings , “ Your faith in me can last / Besides , I ’m known to lay you , one and all , ” then tosses off a line calculated to outrage : “ Till there was rock , you only had God . ”
In the end , he ’s murdered by his crazed fans , torn limb from limb onstage .
His jealous backing band , The Spiders from Mars — who had “ bitched about his fans ” and toyed with Golgotha - friendly fantasies of “ crush[ing ] his sweet hands ” — wash their hands , Pontius Pilate - like , of the whole sordid business : “ When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band . ”
In concert , Bowie became Ziggy , introducing himself and his band as “ Ziggy and the Spiders . ”
Forehead emblazoned with a gilded moon , hair dyed drop - dead red and spiked into a Kabuki frightwig , he was a vision of posthuman beauty , with a face like Garbo ’s death mask and a leer on loan from Alex , the ultra-violent punk in A Clockwork Orange .
And the costume changes — a whole clothes rack ’s - worth of them , each more jaw - dropping than the last : sci - fi samurai in a tear - away kimono ; camp Flash Gordon in a skin - tight jumpsuit ; gay - pride sumo wrestler in a sequined jockstrap ; Surrealist burlesque dancer shimmying in a man - bra made of glitter - skinned mannequin hands .
Freeze - framed in the eerie pulsations of a strobe , with the raunchy proto-punk of the Spiders squalling behind him , Bowie — Ziggy ? — seemed truly Not of This World , especially to teenagers trapped in the have - a- nice - daymare of ’70s suburbia .
He was a spiked cocktail of ladyboy vulnerability and George Grosz grotesque , the Frankensteinian spookiness of his shaved eyebrows and morgue - slab pallor clashing with his androgynous physique and feline grace .
Even his weirdly mismatched eyes — the result of a boyhood fistfight that left one pupil permanently dilated and different - colored — marked him as a resident alien .
“ It was quite scary to see someone on stage who did look like an alien , ” recalled a Bowie fan named Bernard .
“ I remember I got really confused and at one point I really did think he was something alien … in all that Ziggy get - up , he was such an awe - inspiring figure . ”
At the height of Ziggymania , Bowie ended each concert with Ziggy ’s swansong , “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll Suicide . ”
The song builds , cresting in a hymnlike refrain worthy of a Broadway curtain - closer : “ Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful / Gimme your hands ‘ cause you ’re wonderful . ”
Peaking , the song crashes with Ziggy ’s last words , caught at the moment his orgasmic cry turns into an agonized wail , as his fans rip him to shreds : “ Oh gimme your hands ! ”
By all accounts , Bowie ’s then - wife Angie dreamed up the gimmick of having Bowie extend a pleading hand toward the crowd as the song crescendoed .
Soon enough , the gimme - your - hands shtick was as formalized as the laying - on of hands at a faith - healing revival — a spotlit rite of communion between a worshipful crowd , desperate to touch the “ leper messiah ” ( “ Ziggy Stardust ” ) , and a star who flirted with delusions of messianic grandeur .
In truth , Bowie was haunted by the fear that he would be rock ’s first martyr , a blood sacrifice to celebrity culture .
He exorcized his fear ( even as he indulged his Saint Sebastian complex ) before a howling crowd , in Ziggy ’s passion play .
Offstage , his calculated blurring of the boundary between media myth and private self brought him perilously close to living out the Ziggy - esque martyrdom of his paranoid fantasies .
Part 2 : At 14 , the author , stranded in 1974 suburbia , has his born - again Christian brain short - circuited by the gender - bent but heart - stoppingly beautiful Ziggy .
" You would n't spend £ 20,000 on a car then put cheap tyres on it , would you ? "
That might seem like powerful argument for road safety , but it 's the kind of line being trotted out in high street electrical stores to sell HDMI cables .
These short , unexciting - looking wires are used to connect devices such as Blu-ray players and games consoles to modern , flat screen televisions .
HDMI cables rarely come included with new gadgets and while they can be bought for as little as 95 p , some retailers stock models costing up to £ 110 .
Many shoppers report being steered in the direction of more expensive HDMI cables by eager sales staff , who claim higher prices equal better picture quality .
Kerry Lennox contacted Newsbeat .
She said : " I recently bought a home cinema system and was informed by the shop assistant that I would need to buy a £ 50 HDMI cable .
I bought one for £ 10 from a well known supermarket chain . "
Marcus Hodges wrote : " I 've got a really expensive one and a cheap one for £ 12 .
To be honest , they 're exactly the same ! "
One professional HDMI sceptic is technology reviewer James Holland .
" Blu Ray players and the TVs they hook up to are completely digital , so you are talking about ones and zeros , " said James .
" The cable itself is n't contributing to the quality of that picture at all .
It is just moving it from one place to the other .
It 's the electronics at both ends that do the hard work . "
Shopping test
Unlike their analogue predecessors , SCART cables , HDMI sends sound and pictures encoded in digital form , theoretically making it less vulnerable to interference .
Dr Eric Chowanietz , Principle Lecturer in Media Technology at De Montfort University , believes there is little to support the claims made for pricier models .
As you connect more and more items together , say an HD box and games console , or multi channel amplifier , you will need better and better quality cables to maintain the quality of the signal Chris Jenkins , tech labs manager
He said : " You would n't buy a more expensive printer cable and expect to print higher quality documents .
" The document quality depends on the printer and it is much the same with a digital system . "
Newsbeat went on a mystery shop with 20 - year - old student Ed Trencher .
In each store he asked which cable he should buy for connecting an Xbox 360 to a HD television .
John Lewis : " They said their cheapest cable was £ 19.99 and I should n't spend any more because they all do the same thing . "
Micro Anvika : " The guy said HDMI is HDMI and the cables should n't really differ .
The cheapest one , he tried to sell me , was £ 29.99 .
The most expensive one they had was £ 95 and he said there was n't really much difference between them . "
PC World : " They tried to sell me a £ 39.99 HDMI cable which was , apparently , clearer picture quality . "
Currys Digital : " They said I should buy the £ 69.99 HDMI cable because it provided a much better picture quality over the cheaper version , but for some reason [ the assistant ] decided to knock £ 20 off . "
Quality cable
Currys and PC World both offer HDMI cables priced between £ 19.99 and £ 119 .
A statement from DSGi , which owns the two chains said : " We always aim to help our customers find the right product for their choice of hardware by clearly explaining the differences between the cables and our staff receive training on these products .
" The choice of HDMI cable is mainly determined by the level of signal purity that the consumer is looking for in the connection between playback device and television . "
The company said that some cables were more expensive than others because the materials used in them , such as copper wiring , were of a higher quality .
One expert who supports that claim is Chris Jenkins , tech labs manager for Future Publishing group , behind Home Cinema Choice .
He argues that more expensive cables do make a difference , especially in more complex home cinema setups and over cable runs of longer than one metre .
" As you connect more and more items together , say an HD box and games console , or multi channel amplifier , you will need better and better quality cables to maintain the quality of the signal .
" £ 120 cable for your first purchase ?
No .
But certainly do n't try to get away with a £ 1.99 cable "
Chris ' advice is to budget around 10 % of a system 's price for HDMI cables .

Scientists have been able to reach into the mind of a brain - damaged man and communicate with his thoughts .
The research , carried out in the UK and Belgium , involved a new brain scanning method .
Awareness was detected in three other patients previously diagnosed as being in a vegetative state .
The study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that scans can detect signs of awareness in patients thought to be closed off from the world .
Patients in a vegetative state are awake , not in a coma , but have no awareness because of severe brain damage .
Scanning technique
The scientists used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) which shows brain activity in real time .
They asked patients and healthy volunteers to imagine playing tennis while they were being scanned .
In each of the volunteers this stimulated activity in the pre-motor cortex , part of the brain which deals with movement .
This also happened in four out of 23 of the patients presumed to be in a vegetative state .
Please turn on JavaScript .

I volunteered to test out the scanning technique .
I gave the scientists two women 's names , one of which was my mother's .
I imagined playing tennis when they said the right name , and within a minute they had worked out her name .
They were also able to guess correctly whether I had children .
Questions
This is a continuation of research published three years ago , when the team used the same technique to establish initial contact with a patient diagnosed as vegetative .
But this time they went further .
With one patient - a Belgian man injured in a traffic accident seven years ago - they asked a series of questions .
He was able to communicate " yes " and " no " using just his thoughts .
The team told him to use " motor " imagery like a tennis match to indicate " yes " and " spatial " imagery like thinking about roaming the streets for a " no " .
The patient responded accurately to five out of six autobiographical questions posed by the scientists .
For example , he confirmed that his father 's name was Alexander .
The study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre in Cambridge and a Belgian team at the University of Liege .
Dr Adrian Owen from the MRC in Cambridge co-authored the report : " We were astonished when we saw the results of the patient 's scan and that he was able to correctly answer the questions that were asked by simply changing his thoughts . "
Dr Owen says this opens the way to involving such patients in their future treatment decisions : " You could ask if patients were in pain and if so prescribe painkillers and you could go on to ask them about their emotional state . "
It does raise many ethical issues - for example - it is lawful to allow patients in a permanent vegetative state to die by withdrawing all treatment , but if a patient showed they could respond it would not be , even if they made it clear that was what they wanted .
The Royal Hospital for Neurodisability in London is a leading assessment and treatment centre for adults with brain injuries .
Helen Gill , a consultant in low awareness state , welcomed the new research but cautioned that it was still early days for the research : " It 's very useful if you have a scan which can show some activity but you need a detailed sensory assessment as well .
" A lot of patients are slipping through the net and this adds another layer to ensure patients are assessed correctly . "
She said the hospital did a study of 60 patients admitted with a diagnosis of vegetative state and 43 % could communicate .

This is a GUI frontend to the genetic programming assignment given in this subject .
The aim is to evolve a wall - following robot .
The program provides multiple visualisations of the process .
It was written with Janice Leung - many thanks for the beautiful widgets !
Developed on ( but not for ) Linux using Python and its bindings & add- ons : PyQt , PyOpenGL , PIL and psyco .
README available .
It contains more information about the code used to render the robot & world .
The clickable screenshots above show ( from left to right ) :
COMP3141 ' Software System Design and Implementation ' was run by Amir Michail of CSE at UNSW , Sydney .
The source code and media are attached at the bottom of this page .
Make sure you have successfully installed Python and the associated libraries and bindings mentioned above before trying to run this program .
Also note there are a number of Python - coded goodies available in the source code :
I hope this code helps you better understand these concepts and / or teaches you new things , as it did me !
----------------------------------------------
--- README by Balint Seeber & Janice Leung ---
---------------------------------------------- -----------------
--- GP_Imp.py ---
-----------------
Our GP_Imp2.py has been used in this assignment .
Modification has been made to the implementation to help drawing the program tree in TreeGraph .
The modifications are the following : - New variables for the program node + x and y positions + level number - New functions for the program node + resetData( ) to reset the new variables added + getTreeHeight( ) to get the height of the program tree + getSensorValue( ) to check whether the direction of the robot is at wall
We originally attempted to the the Solution 2 from the website , however due to optimisations program nodes would be re-used , as were their new tree data ( above ) .
This would result in tree graphs looking like the nodes had been ' crossed over ' too .
--------------------
--- GP_Interface ---
--------------------
This is an interface to the GP_I mp . py file .
As the GP_Imp implementation continuously evolves each generation without yielding to other tasks , it is not a good solution that would ensure GUI responsiveness .
Thus this interface is created to enable iterative evolution over a custom ' step size ' .
After the evolution step is completed , the function returns and the main program can process pending GUI events after which it can run the next iteration , and so on , until it finishes the entire process .
------------------- ---
Main Window ---
-------------------
In the menu , user can select the following : - File - View - Window - Help + File | - New | - Open | - Save >
As usual ( saving saves all data , once a saved document is loaded , - Save As | settings will be restored , along with the generation / individual - Close | last being viewed , previous robot position , etc ) - Close Document | + View - View Histogram |
When selected , new views of the current tree / graphs will be - View TreeGraph > displayed .
The views will change as the views in the main window - View GenerationGraph | change ( for example , as the current individual / generation is selected or the robot moves around ) .
+ Window | - New Window | - Cascade >
As usual - Tile | - Close Window | + Help - About |
As usual ----------------------
--- SettingsDialog ---
----------------------
This is the settings dialog which allows user to enter the info as described in the assignment spec .
It will pop up when a new document has been opened / when the user clicks on the setting button in the ChildFrame .
These settings are saved along with the document .
An important feature here is that once an evolution run has been completed , the user can bring back up the settings dialog , increase the generation count ( perhaps altering some other settings ) and can continue running the evolution from where it left off ( allowing continuity ) .
------------------
--- ChildFrame ---
------------------
It consists of the following widgets which are separated by splitters : - GenerationControl - RoomView - Fittness Frequency - TreeGraph - VisualisationControl - GenerationsGraph
*************************
*** GenerationControl *** *************************
This conists of : - Settings button - Generate button - Generation label - Generation slider +
Settings button
When this is clicked , the setting dialog will pop up and allow the user to set the info .
+ Generate button
When this is clicked , the program will generate the population as specifed in the settings .
While the evolution is running , it will appear as a Cancel button .
If the user presses this the evolution will be cancelled ( but not erased ) .
If the user wishes to continue , he / she simply has to click it again to finish the rest of the run .
+
Generation label
This shows the current generation number and will be updated as the evolutionary simulation is progressing .
+
Generation slider
This shows the current generation number and is acting as the progress bar .
Ths slider can be moved to show visualization of different generation .
Once changed , the histogram will show data for this new generation and the individual list in the VisualisationControl area will be updated with the new generation 's individuals .
**************** *** RoomView *** ****************
This is a 3D visualization of the map and the robot .
When the robot becomes stuck ( fails to move indicating a dead - end in the program ) , flames will come out from the teapot head of the robot and it will go off when the robot starts moving again ( whether backward , retracing it 's steps , or when a new starting position is selected , or when a new individual is picked ) .
By holding the Shift button , user may choose a new position for the robot to walk from with the current program by simply clicking on the tile in 3D .
Controls : Click / select with Left mouse button .
Click / drag : Left : rotate camera Middle : translate Right : Zoom Mouse wheel : zoom
The animation / particle system is taken care of by timers set in the widget .
They cause the engine to tick over and move the robot / particles .
When the robot moves into a new square , a callback is called which passes through the new robot position to the document ( which in turn emits a signal to other views so they update themselves ) .
The trail is drawn so one can see the part it 's drawing out ( creating by storing the positions it walks across as it goes ) .
*************************
*** Fittness Frequency *** *************************
All of the fittness values of one generation will be used to construct the histogram with fittness as the x-axis and frequency as the y - axis .
A dictionary has been used to tally the frequency of the fittness values when data has been added .
When the histogram is drawn , the frequency of a range of fittness values ( depending on the number of bars on the graph ) will be added up and stored in a list .
The height of each bar will be depended on the values in the list .
QPainter has been used in drawing the histogram and QPixmap to store the picture after it has been painted ( increased re-draw time ) .
***************** *** TreeGraph *** *****************
This is the visualization of the program tree .
The tree has been first evaluated bottom - up to calculate the positions of each node .
Then the tree will be checked left - to - right depth - first to see if any node will overlap with one another on the same level .
This can be checked by using " getLeftChildOnSameLevel " ( with the help of " getRightmost " tree traversal ) to get the node on the left of the current node .
If overlapping occurs , then the current node will be moved accordingly to the right .
QPainter has been used in drawing the tree and QPixmap to store the picture after it has been painted ( increased re-draw time ) .
Different types of program nodes have been painted with a different color .
The sensor node will be painted a darker red if that sensor node is active as the robot walks across the map .
Resizing is automatic ( depending on the tree size ) so the widget is embedded in a scroll view for easier viewing .

This is a 3D graph with generation as the z - axis ( depth ) , individual as the x-axis ( going across ) and fittness as the z - axis ( going up ) .
This uses very basic 3D drawing to draw ' quads ' ( 4 - sided polygons ) with height given by the surround individual 's fitnesses in current / next generations .
The camera controls are the same as the RoomView .
**************** *** 3D NOTES *** ****************
OpenGL was used to render the 3D graphics .
( PyOpenGL bindings to make it work in Python ) .
The Python Image Library was used to load textures ( required to load more advanced images , eg : Targas for use of alpha ( tranparency ) maps .
A point to mention is that the ThreeD.py file was written as a general wrapper for rendering basic objects / scenes in Python .
This is used to render the various parts of the robot individually , applying rotational transforms on certain objects to make it 's arms / legs move .
The origin of the actual 3D data itself is worth note :
Any arbitary model can be created using a 3D animation program .
A program was then written to open this model export from the animation program and then convert it into a Python code file that actually contains the raw 3D data ( including references to used textures ) .
The program uses two such converted files : ' sky.py ' and ' character.py '
These files contain the raw 3D data which is interpreted by the ThreeD wrapper so that a simple '.render ( ) ' on the scene can be called to make it display on screen .
The advantage is that a new , more complex , textured character could be created and simply dropped into the directory ( replacing the existing character ) and the new model would appear - no change to the code is necessary !
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Sales of new U.S. homes plunged 11.2 % in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000 , the lowest rate on record dating back to 1963 , the Commerce Department estimated Wednesday .
The third - straight drop in sales on a month - to - month basis was unexpected .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch forecast sales to rise slightly , to a pace of 355,000 , with buyers taking advantage of a new federal tax credit .
Read our complete economic calendar and consensus forecast .
" The housing market remains very , very distressed , " wrote Dan Greenhaus , chief economist for Miller Tabak & Co .
" There may have been some weather - related issues playing havoc with the sales data but clearly , these results are extremely unnerving , " wrote Jennifer Lee , an economist for BMO Capital Markets .
" There is nothing positive to glean from this report . "
U.S. stock markets fell after release of the report , which coincided with release of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who said the economy remains fragile and needs low interest rates for an extended period of time .

Data on sales for December were revised higher to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 348,000 , up from 342,000 previously reported .
Sales of new homes are down 6.1 % compared with January 2009 's 329,000 units , which was the previous record low .
The number of homes for sale rose 0.4 % to 234,000 in January .
At the January sales pace , it would take 9.1 months to sell that inventory , up from 8.0 months in December and the highest monthly supply since May .
Government statisticians have low confidence in the monthly report , which is subject to large revisions , and large sampling and other statistical errors .
In most months , the government is n't sure whether sales rose or fell .
The standard error in January for instance , was plus or minus 14 % .
Read the full government report .
The government says it can take up to five months to establish a statistically significant trend in sales .
Over the past five months , sales have been on a 362,000 seasonally adjusted annual pace , down from 382,000 in the five - month interval through December .
Sales had risen fairly steadily in the first half of 2009 before plateauing last fall .
Seasonally adjusted sales have now fallen three months in a row .
With mortgage rates still very low and prices down , most analysts had concluded that the recent decline in sales was due to the impending expiration of the first - time homebuyers ' credit in November .
As it happened , Congress extended the tax credit through June and expanded it to include repeat buyers .
But the tax credit did n't help sales in January .
Sales of new homes are recorded once a sales contract is signed , not at closing .
Some homes are sold before ground is broken on construction .
Details
Home builders had been slashing their inventory of unsold homes for more than a year to a 38 - year low before January 's 1,000 increase .
The number of homes for sale that are under construction fell to a record low of 100,000 .
Builders have cut back on production of new homes , but they still face headwinds from unsold existing - homes as foreclosures continue to mount up .
If a home is n't sold before it 's finished , it 's taking a record 14.2 months to sell it after completion -- a reflection of the mismatch between more expensively priced homes in the inventory and lower - priced homes that have been selling .
The median sales price of a new home sold in January was $ 203,500 , down 2.4 % compared with a year earlier .
Cheaper homes were selling better than expensive ones : 47 % of sales were for less than $ 200,000 , up from 43 % in December .
Meanwhile , 38 % of sales were for $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 , down from 41 % in December .
Sales were down in three of four regions : down 35 % in the Northeast , down 12 % in the West and down 10 % in the South .
January 's sales were up 2 % in the Midwest , the government 's data showed .
Sofia Maldonado was commissioned by the Times Square Alliance to create a mural in one of the most famous intersections in the world .
But some people - including
Fox reporters - are n't too happy about Maldonado 's choice of subjects .

Maldonado is a Puerto Rican / Cuban artist who describes her work on her website as showing " an evident blend of fashion trends , the Latina female aesthetic and various street culture elements . "
Fittingly , the Times Square mural is loud , large ( it stretches 92 feet down West 42nd ) , vibrant , and suddenly controversial .
There did n't actually seem to be too much outrage , until Fox News stepped in and asked several bystanders and a community advocate what they thought of the piece .
Tony Herbert found the mural offensive and disrespectful to Black and Latina women .
" Women should be depicted with cell phones and briefcases , that 's to show the professionalism of how women have broken the glass ceiling to accomplish what they 've accomplished , not to come back to this , " he told Fox 5 reporters .
Another woman was upset that it was n't more inspirational : " " What I want to see is something that motivates me , something that makes me want to be more than I am . "

At the end of the segment , Maldonado gets a chance to speak , and she seems pretty happy that her mural has generated so much discussion .
She counters the claims that it shows a negative stereotype by pointing out that she is representing " a female aesthetic that normally is n't seen in Times Square .
Women who dress like this should be respected in society the same way as women with briefcases . "
She says the women in her mural are strong women with strong , healthy bodies .
Her interest in street culture further informs the depiction of women - and the resulting anger .
These are not the women people want to see in the tourist capital of New York .
Not only do they lack briefcases , but they reflect a type of femininity that is rarely celebrated in mainstream culture .
A few of them are dressed in revealing clothing , which has lead some to suggest that Maldonado painted a group of prostitutes , but alongside a woman wearing a tiny top and long nails is a skateboarder gliding through the red background and a lady with a knuckleduster that reads " Liberated . "
The figures are connected by a certain aesthetic , but they are also individuals , a variety of different women , deserving of no less respect than a woman in a business suit .
But the detractors will not be swayed .
A group of angry New Yorkers came together last night to protest Maldonado 's mural and ask that it be removed from Times Square .
The rally was organized in party by social networking group New York City Black Professionals and aimed to " defend the honor " of minority women .
Their call to arms calls the mural a " slap in the face : "
This is not even about the Latina artist and or her expression of how she sees NY she was only painting what they commissioned her to do in order to get her paycheck .
They had the power to say no , this is not what we wanted , however they did not and the end result was a slap in the face of every woman of black and brown decent .
Our sisters pay taxes , they spend money in this city and they help to raise up our communities , we cannot allow or afford these racial bigots to be the only ones to be seen and heard .
Please come out and lets strike a blow for all the woman in our city .

The real question seems to boil down to whether or not Maldonado 's images are perpetuating negative stereotypes , or simply reflecting a specific fashion aesthetic .
After reading about her work , and searching through some of her other pieces , I 'm inclined to go with the latter .
Why should we view these figures in a negative light ?
There is n't too much information available about the rally , which leads me to think that maybe not that many people actually showed up .
So far there is no word about the mural 's future , but it is currently slated to stay up until April 30th .

In 1998 , the entire alternative energy industry barely even registered as a political player in Washington , spending a mere $ 2.4 million on lobbying the federal government .
Meanwhile , in the same year , the oil and gas , electric utilities and mining industries spent a combined $ 142 million advancing their own legislative interests .
That landscape , however , has changed considerably .
By 2007 , the alternative energy industry had begun to drastically increase its lobbying spending , almost doubling its expenditures from the previous year .
In 2009 , alternative energy organizations shelled out an unprecedented $ 30 million to protect and promote their interests on Capitol Hill .
The alternative energy industry ’s lobbying expenditures have grown to 12 times from its 1998 level .
In comparison , oil and gas spending and mining spending have grown less than three times their 1998 amount , and electric utility spending has grown to just twice its 1998 amount .
The growing involvement of the alternative energy industry in legislative affairs is reflected not just in increased spending , but also in the number of companies and organizations that employ federally registered lobbyists .
In the late 1990s , only about 20 alternative energy industry organizations used federal lobbyists .
By 2009 , there were about 200 alternative energy companies and organizations employing lobbyists to help advance the industry ’s interests .
The American Wind Energy Association is one of those organizations that recently and significantly increased lobbying efforts .
Until 2008 , AWEA failed to crack the $ 1 million mark in annual lobbying expenditures — and most years , it spent less than $ 500,000 .
In 2009 , its expenditures experienced a drastic increase , and the group spent almost $ 5 million on lobbying for issues related to the wind power industry .
But why did AWEA , and scores of other alternative energy corporations , trade organizations and non-profits , get involved in legislative affairs so suddenly and with such gusto ?
The involvement stems from the growth in number of alternative energy companies , which was made possible by the growth in popularity of wind power in the national consciousness , said Christine Real de Azua , an AWEA spokeswoman .
Real de Azua states that this , in turn , increased AWEA ’s ranks by more than 1,000 new business members in 2009 alone , many of them “ companies entering or seeking to enter the wind turbine supply chain . ”
Last year “ was a record year for wind power in the U.S. , ” Real de Azua said .
“ The industry installed 10,000 megawatts last year , enough to generate as much new electricity as three new nuclear plants . ”
The recent involvement of AWEA in federal affairs , she said , “ reflects the urgency of the industry ’s number one priority — passing a national renewable electricity standard with aggressive , binding near - and long - term targets , as part of comprehensive energy and climate legislation . ”
Azua de Real cites “ market certainty ” as a concern of AWEA ’s members , who need legislative support of their industry “ in order to expand their operations and invest in new manufacturing as well as new wind farm facilities . ”
She added that it is imperative to the members of AWEA that the U.S. government “ steps up and clearly commits to developing renewable energy . ”
AWEA cites the sheer potential of wind energy and the opportunity for job creation as two key points that their lobbyists emphasize in the fight for favorable legislation .
Not as drastic but certainly notable is the increased lobbying by the Solar Energy Industries Association .
Until 2007 , the organization had never spent more than half a million dollars on federal lobbying efforts .
In 2009 , it spent more than $ 1.6 million .
Monique Hanis , an SEIA spokeswoman , attributes the increase in lobbying presence to a growth in membership that enabled the organization to expand legislative activities .
She explains how in late 2008 , SEIA ’s increased lobbying pressure paid off when Congress “ passed the eight - year extension of the solar investment tax credit , ” which allowed the organization to move on to lobbying regarding climate , renewable energy standards , green jobs and appropriations .
The goal of spending more money than ever before on federal legislation , Hanis says , is “ to remove market barriers so that solar can compete fairly with other energy sources and we can expand the amount of solar used in this country . ”
SEIA has already seen positive gains from their increased expenditures , Hanis said .
The group ’s lobbyists were successful in promoting several provisions of the stimulus bill , such as the “ lifted cap on solar investment tax credit for residential solar water heating systems . ”
In addition , the industry ’s increased presence on Capitol Hill has “ built bipartisan support of and knowledge about solar . ”
But while alternative energy interests are just getting acquainted with K Street , the oil and gas industry has been a permanent resident for years .
Since 1998 , the oil and gas industry has never spent less than $ 50 million on lobbying in any given year , and in 2009 , it reported $ 168 million in lobbying expenditures .
Does a rise in alternative energy lobbying threaten to erode the oil and gas industry ’s political power ?
Probably not , said American Petroleum Institute spokesman Bill Bush , adding that he is “ not concerned ” about the alternative energy industry ’s efforts and “ not aware of any impact ” they ’re having on the petroleum industry ’s fortunes .
Bush also emphasized that the oil and gas industry “ understands that there is a role for alternative energy ” and has “ invested billions in it . ”
He added , however , that “ on various issues , we may be on different sides . ”
In 2009 , API focused on energy legislation and “ issues related to access to oil and natural gas development , ” Bush said .
The institute spent more than $ 7.3 million in 2009 on federal lobbying efforts after spending between $ 2.8 million and $ 4.8 million each year on lobbying between 2002 and 2008 .
As this decade moves forward , climate and energy policy remains a key issue in Congress .
Barack Obama labeled such legislation a high priority long before he became president , and people and political action committees associated with the alternative energy industry responded with campaign contributions of $ 173,500 .
The oil and gas industry poured more than five times that amount into Obama ’s campaign coffer , but gave most of its presidential campaign contributions to Sen.
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
Sens. John Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) are currently drafting a bill to address the nation ’s energy needs .
The bill , if passed , could certainly become a major political victory for Obama .
Although most of the conversation regarding the drafting of legislation has revolved around the question of greenhouse gases and the proposed “ cap - and - trade ” policy , the bipartisan bill also makes a point of emphasizing job creation and the use of renewable energy .
In a statement in February , Kerry promoted his energy bill by stating , “ Americans want us to be energy independent .
Moreover , every job created in the course of energy independence is a job that stays here at home . ”
And with political focus on alternative energy constantly expanding , the lobbying power of the alternative energy industry may soon become as plentiful as Great Plains breezes and desert sunshine .

PANAJI : Goa police on Friday suspended a police inspector , a head constable and three constables for their alleged links with a drug peddler .
Deputy Inspector General of Police Ravidnra Yadav said that police inspector Ashish Shirodkar along with four other policemen , earlier attached to the Anti-Narcotic Cell , was suspended after video footage showed Israeli drug peddler Atala boasting about his links with a cop .
Yadav said that the crime branch will initiate inquiry into the controversial tape which was uploaded on a website .
Atala was caught on camera claiming that Shriodkar used to steal drugs from the Anti-Narcotic Cell Locker and push it back into the market through him .
Washington ( CNN ) -- " Electronic cigarettes " that vaporize nicotine juice to inhale instead of smoke from burning tobacco do not deliver as promised , according to research at Virginia Commonwealth University .
" They are as effective at nicotine delivery as puffing on an unlit cigarette , " said Dr. Thomas Eissenberg , at the school 's Institute for Drug and Alcohol Studies .
His study , funded by the federal National Cancer Institute , is the first by U.S. doctors to check the function of so - called " no - smoke tobacco " devices , which are unregulated in the United States for sale or use .
The units are shaped like a cigarette and contain a battery that heats a filament to vaporize liquid nicotine in a refillable cartridge .
Smokers buy the devices to get around no -smoking restrictions and to attempt to quit conventional cigarettes .
Some users nickname what they 're doing as " vaping " instead of smoking , to reflect the vapor produced by the heating element .
The devices are marketed as an alternative to smoking , but retailers avoid making claims about health or safety .
Fans have established a Web site , www.e-cigarette-forum.com.
Founder Oliver Kershaw said the site " is the largest e-smokers community online with some 26,000 members , most of whom are in the U.S. "
Jimi Jackson , a former tobacco smoker in Richmond , Virginia , who sells electronic cigarettes , is convinced there are immediate health advantages in avoiding the known cancer - causing substances in the smoke of a burning cigarette .
" I smoked 37 years , and when I found them , I was , like , ' Thank , you Jesus , ' " Jackson said with a laugh , as a reporter visited his shop , No Smoke Virginia , coincidentally just a few blocks from where the research was conducted at Virginia Commonwealth .
In March , the Food and Drug Administration imposed a ban on continued imports of the devices , pending regulatory review for any health risks .
The latest clinical evidence suggests users are not getting the addictive substance they get from smoking tobacco .
" These e-cigs do not deliver nicotine , " Eissenberg said of the findings he expects to publish in an upcoming issue Tobacco Control , a product of the British Medical Journal Group .
This past summer , Eissenberg recruited smokers without prior experience using e-cigarettes to volunteer to use two popular brands of the devices for a set period .
The 16 subjects were regularly measured in a clinical setting for the presence of nicotine in their bodies , their reported craving for conventional cigarettes , and certain physiological effects such as a change in heart rate .
" Ten puffs from either of these electronic cigarettes with a 16 mg nicotine cartridge delivered little to no nicotine , " the study found .
But the units may deliver hazardous chemicals , according to preliminary checks by federal regulators .
In a notice to importers , the FDA blocked continued shipments after finding diethylene glycol , a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans .
The government 's statement noted there are no health warnings on the products , and that " the FDA analyses detected carcinogens , including nitrosamines . "
The notice of the import ban says " the product appears to be a combination drug - device , " that " requires pre-approval , registration and listing with the FDA " in order to be marketed in the United States .
A company challenging the import ban claims in federal court documents to have sold 600,000 of the devices in a year 's time through a network of 120 distributors in the United States .
" We are on the verge of going out of business , which is why we are suing the FDA in U.S. District Court , " said Washington , attorney Kip Schwartz , representing a company called " Smoking Everywhere , " a U.S. wholesaler that was importing the devices from China .
The lawsuit questions the FDA 's authority to block shipments of a non - tobacco product , and says the agency has violated its statutory process for product review .
Liquid nicotine is available on the open market through pharmaceutical houses and vendors who sell e-cigarettes .
A judge January 14 ruled the FDA does not have such authority , but the agency has taken the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals , which has yet to decide the case .
The appeals panel issued a stay against the judge 's ruling until it can rule on the agency 's appeal .
Meanwhile , based on the judge 's ruling , lawyers for the importers have filed a request to compel the FDA to lift its import ban , saying the agency is not likely to win its appeal .
The filing says " although e-cigarettes have been sold since 2007 , FDA has not identified a single instance , either in this Court or below , of an adverse health effect from e-cigarettes . "
President Obama , who has described himself as an occasional smoker , has been offered one of the devices by Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns .
The Republican lawmaker 's office said the president did not respond .
An administration spokesman last year said the White House was not aware of the offer .
In a copy of a letter to the chief executive dated March 26 , Stearns wrote , " I have recently given out e-cigarettes to a few members of Congress and they have become quite a hit . "
Sales of the devices continue at shopping mall kiosks and small storefront retailers , apparently drawing from stock imported before the FDA began to block shipments from overseas suppliers .

In the late 1700s , the Industrial Revolution brought about considerable advances in agriculture , manufacturing , and transportation throughout Europe .
Steam - powered contraptions paved the way for large - scale production and large - scale disasters in many industries , and the business of beer - making was no exception .
The availability of new technologies , coupled with the spirit of competition , led to a brisk battle of oneupsmanship among Britain ’s beer barons .
Over a span of a few decades , many of them upgraded from humble kegs to massive vats , and Londoners were all too happy to imbibe the abundant brew .
London ’s Meux ’s Horse Shoe Brewery on Tottenham Court Road was home to a colossal brewing vat , one of the largest London had ever seen .
It was twenty - two feet tall and sixty feet wide , so voluminous that its owners supposedly celebrated its completion by hosting 200 dinner guests within the titanic beer tank .
Afterward it was promptly put into service fermenting 135,000 gallons of beer alongside the brewery ’s collection of not - quite - as - massive vats .
Little did its owners know , however , that this new ale reservoir had been constructed with a regrettable imperfection .
Sometime during the day on 17 October 1814 , one of the twenty - nine metal belts which supported the tank separated , presumably due to a defect .
The other twenty - eight support straps lacked the strength to maintain the tank ’s integrity on their own , so they each snapped in quick succession .
The monstrous vessel finally ruptured , loosing over a million pounds of beer .
The liberated liquid crashed into the brewery ’s other vats and dashed them to pieces , adding their contents to the surge of frothy brew .
The building ’s brickwork walls gave way , and Meux ’s Horse Shoe Brewery vomited over 323,000 gallons upon the unsuspecting city .
Directly in the path of this flash flood of beer was the an area known as St. Giles , a densely populated low - income parish of London .
The massive amber river caused pandemonium in the streets , knocking some buildings from their foundations and totally demolishing others .
Men , women , and children were buried in the rubble of ruined structures .
Surprised Londoners were whisked off their feet by the fast - moving wall of beer , many of them becoming injured when they were dashed upon walls .
Beer barged into buildings through doors and windows , drowning several people in their own homes and flooding basements .
One eyewitness later told his tale to the New York newspaper The Knickerbocker :
All at once , I found myself borne onward with great velocity by a torrent which burst upon me so suddenly as almost to deprive me of breath .
A roar as of falling buildings at a distance , and suffocating fumes , were in my ears and nostrils .
I was rescued with great difficulty by the people who immediately collected around me , and from whom I learned the nature of the disaster which had befallen me .
An immense vat belonging to a brew house situated in Banbury street , Saint Giles , and containing four or five thousand barrels of strong beer , had suddenly burst and swept every thing before it .
Whole dwellings were literally riddled by the flood ; numbers were killed ; and from among the crowds which filled the narrow passages in every direction came the groans of sufferers .
As the foamy wave finally settled , the uninjured bystanders gathered their wits and sprang into action .
With cups , pots , cans , and kettles , the people of London rushed to the scene to save as much of the beer as possible .
Those unable to find proper containers used their cupped hands to lap up the tepid pools of dirty beer , or simply drank it directly off the road .
The streets became so clogged with enthusiastic beer connoisseurs that organized rescue efforts were severely hampered .
After several hours , the stranded were plucked from the rubble and the beer - soaked victims were taken to the hospital .
Apocryphal reports said that the unmistakable smell of ale permeated the building , convincing some of the other patients that they were missing out on a beer party elsewhere in the hospital , and that the surlier patients participated in a violent protest of this unfair treatment , leading to a few additional injuries .
In all , eight people were killed by the drink that day ⁠
— Ann Saville , Eleanor Cooper , Hannah Bamfield , Catherine Butler , Elizabeth Smith , Mary Mulvey , Thomas Mulvey , and Sean Duggins⁠ — due to “ drowning , injury , poisoning by the porter fumes , or drunkenness . ”
Their coffins were lined up in a yard , where passers - by could leave coins to help pay for the funerals .
It took weeks for the smell of beer to completely fade from St. Giles .
Meux ’s Horse Shoe Brewery was eventually brought to court over the devastating calamity , but the judge and jury ultimately blamed no one .
The tsunami of beer , they concluded , was simply an “ Act of God . ”
Calvin L. Graham , who gained attention as the boy who lied so he could enlist in the Navy at age 12 during World War II , died Friday in his house in Fort Worth .
He was 62 years old .
He died of heart failure , said his stepson , Ronnie O'Donley .
The young Mr. Graham was a gunner on the U.S.S. South Dakota while it was buffeted by the Japanese in the Battle of Guadalcanal in 1942 .
He was struck in the jaw and mouth by shrapnel while his battleship suffered 47 enemy hits .
Though seriously wounded , he helped pull other crew members to safety .
The next year , the Navy discovered Mr. Graham 's age .
He became known to headline - writers as the " baby vet " after the Navy gave him a dishonorable discharge and revoked his disability benefits and his decorations , including a Purple Heart and Bronze Star .
Sought Return of Medals
In later years he struggled to get the decorations and the benefits back and to get an honorable discharge , retroactively .
He was aided by political figures like the Senators Lloyd Bentsen , a Democrat , and John G. Tower , a Republican , both of Texas .
Scores of university halls of residences and lecture theatres in the UK were judged " at serious risk of major failure or breakdown " and " unfit for purpose " , a secret database obtained after a legal battle by the Guardian reveals .
Some of the most popular , high - ranking institutions , such as the London School of Economics , had 41 % of their lecture theatres and classrooms deemed unsuitable for current use , while Imperial ­College London had 12 % of its non-residential buildings branded " inoperable " .
At City University , 41 % of the student digs were judged unfit for purpose .
Universities argue they have spent hundreds of millions in refurbishment since the judgments were made two years ago and use some of the buildings for storage purposes only .
The government agency that holds the information , the Higher Education Funding Council for England ( Hefce ) , was forced to reveal it after an information tribunal ruled in the Guardian 's favour , agreeing that it was in the public 's interest for the data to be made public .
Hefce is thought to have spent up to £ 50,000 trying to conceal the data from the Guardian , which requested it two and a half years ago .
The newspaper 's ­barrister , Aidan Eardley , said the case would make it harder for government agencies to withhold information in future .
The database , which aims to help universities compare the condition of their estate with their competitors , shows more than 90 % of higher education institutions had at least 10 % of their buildings judged below the " sound and operationally safe " category .
One in 10 institutions had at least 10 % of their estate judged inoperable and at serious risk of major breakdown .
Universities employ surveyors to judge the condition of their estate according to four categories : as new ; sound and operationally safe ; operational but in need of major repair and inoperable ; posing a serious risk of major failure and breakdown .
The surveyors also record whether buildings are suitable for student living , teaching and learning under four more categories , from " excellent " to " unsuitable for current use " .
Heriot - Watt University in Edinburgh , Leeds Metropolitan University and Nottingham Trent University had 42 % , 36 % and 21 % respectively of their lecture theatres , libraries and all other non-residential buildings in the " inoperable " category .
City and Glamorgan universities had 41 % and 26 % respectively of their halls of residence deemed unfit for purpose .
The LSE , Glasgow School of Art and the university of Bolton had 41 % , 34 % and 27 % of their lecture theatres and classrooms billed in this category .
Property consultants who advise universities said that , at its most extreme , buildings deemed inoperable could break fire regulations , have leaks and rot .
The database revelations come a week after the government announced that university grants for capital projects , such as new buildings , would be cut by 14.9 % in cash terms to £ 562 m in 2010 - 11 .
Vice - chancellors have said they will have to shelve new building plans to make the cuts .
The LSE said it had spent more than £ 107 m on new buildings while a spokesman for Imperial College said the institution had spent on average £ 100 m annually over the last three years " to provide the highest quality facilities for its students and academic staff " .
Heriot - Watt said it had undertaken a " full condition " check of its buildings that was particularly rigorous and that millions had been spent on upgrades since then .
Blackwater Took Hundreds of Guns From U.S. Military , Afghan Police
Created : February 23 , 2010 21:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

Employees of the CIA - connected private security corporation Blackwater diverted hundreds of weapons , including more than 500 AK - 47 assault rifles , from a U.S. weapons bunker in Afghanistan intended to equip Afghan policemen , according to an investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
On at least one occasion , an individual claiming to work for the company evidently signed for a weapons shipment using the name of a “ South Park ” cartoon character .
And Blackwater has yet to return hundreds of the guns to the military .
A Blackwater subsidiary known as Paravant that until recently operated in Afghanistan acquired the weapons for its employees ’ “ personal use , ” according to committee staffers , as did other non-Paravant employees of Blackwater .
Yet contractors in Afghanistan are not permitted to operate weapons without explicit permission from U.S. Central Command , something Blackwater never obtained .
A November 2008 email from a Paravant vice president named Brian McCracken , obtained by the committee , nevertheless reads : “ We have not received formal permission from the Army to carry weapons yet but I will take my chances . ”
[ Security 1 ] As a result of Blackwater ’s disregard for U.S. military restrictions on contractor firearms , four employees of Paravant — which held a subcontract from defense giant Raytheon to train Afghan soldiers — under the influence of alcohol opened fire on a car carrying four Afghan civilians on May 5 , 2009 , wounding two .
That incident , occurring less than two years after Blackwater guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad , prompted the committee ’s investigation .
“ In the fight against the Taliban , the perception that the Afghans have of us is critical , ” Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , the chairman of the committee , told reporters Tuesday afternoon .
“ It ’s clear to me that if we ’re going to win that struggle , we need to know that contractor personnel are adequately screened , they ’re adequately supervised and they ’re adequately held accountable . ”
Levin will hold a hearing on Blackwater ’s Afghanistan contracts Wednesday morning .
The committee ’s investigation points to the contrary .
Blackwater personnel appear to have gone to exceptional lengths to obtain weapons from U.S. military weapons storehouses intended for use by the Afghan police .
According to the committee , at the behest of the company ’s Afghanistan country manager , Ricky Chambers , Blackwater on at least two occasions acquired hundreds of rifles and pistols from a U.S. military facility near Kabul called 22 Bunkers by the military and Pol-e Charki by the Afghans .
Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of all U.S. military forces in the Middle East and South Asia , wrote to the committee to explain that “ there is no current or past written policy , order , directive , or instruction that allows U.S. Military contractors or subcontractors in Afghanistan to use weapons stored at 22 Bunkers . ”
On one of those occasions , in September 2008 , Chief Warrant Officer Greg Sailer , who worked at 22 Bunkers and is a friend of a Blackwater officer working in Afghanistan , signed over more than 200 AK - 47s to an individual identified as “ Eric Cartman ” or possibly “ Carjman ” from Blackwater ’s Counter Narcotics Training Unit .
A Blackwater lawyer told committee staff that no one by those names has ever been employed by the company .
Eric Cartman is the name of an obnoxious character from Comedy Central ’s popular “ South Park ” cartoon .
Blackwater personnel invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination when approached by the committee to explain the weapons acquisitions from 22 Bunkers , according to committee staff .
Sailer , who is still deployed to Afghanistan , told the committee that he thought Blackwater was signing for the weapons to train Afghan police , a task it has never conducted .
Not all of the guns received from Blackwater have been returned to the Afghan government — and , according to committee staff , many only began to be returned after staff approached the company for an explanation .
“ It was represented to us that all the weapons had been returned ” to 22 Bunkers , Levin said .
“ That is not true .
Hundreds of them were not returned . ”
Asked if that meant Blackwater lied to Congress , Levin replied , “ They misrepresented the facts , and I ’d like to leave it at that . ”
Raytheon did not renew Paravant ’s contract for training the Afghan army , which expired in September .
Blackwater still holds a contract with the State Department worth millions of dollars to protect diplomats in Afghanistan .
While that contract expires this year , Politico reported on Tuesday that Blackwater , now renamed Xe Services , might acquire a new multimillion - dollar contract from the Defense Department to train Afghan police — the same police force that Blackwater ’s weapons diversions from 22 Bunkers deprived of hundreds of pistols and rifles .
This is not the first time Blackwater has faced allegations of diverted weapons .
In 2007 , company employees came under federal investigation for improperly shipping hundreds of weapons to Iraq , some of which are believed to have been sold on the black market and acquired by a Kurdish terrorist group .
A Blackwater statement at the time said allegations that the company was “ in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless . ”
The New York Times reported in November that the company is negotiating with regulators over “ hundreds of millions of dollars in fines ” associated with the illicit weapons shipments .
In January , Blackwater ’s founder , Erik Prince , confirmed to Vanity Fair that his 12 - year - old company — which has earned more than a billion dollars through government contracts in the past decade — was involved in a nascent terrorist assassination program run by the CIA , among other CIA activities .
“ I ’m paying for all sorts of intelligence activities to support American national security , out of my own pocket , ” Prince told the magazine .
Additionally ,
The Nation recently reported that Blackwater assists the Joint Special Operations Command with the terrorist manhunt in Afghanistan and Pakistan , including with the operations of JSOC ’s armed unmanned drones .
Levin said his inquiry had uncovered “ inadequate oversight by the Army over this contract . ”
The Florida - based Army office supposedly overseeing the contract did not even have a contracting officer representative in Afghanistan when the Paravant employees shot at Afghan civilians on May 5 , 2009 .
Yet as early as December 2008 , concerned Raytheon personnel informed that Army office that Paravant personnel were carrying unapproved weapons .
An officer in Afghanistan responsible for training Afghan soldiers told the committee , “ We should have had better control . ”
Additionally , Blackwater personnel in Afghanistan , including those involved in both the May shooting and an earlier improper weapons discharge from December 2008 , have been cited for , among other infractions , drug and alcohol abuse and , in one case , an “ extensive criminal history . ”
Wednesday ’s hearing is expected to receive testimony from current and former Blackwater / Paravant officers , including Brian C. McCracken , the former Paravant vice president who now serves as Raytheon ’s chief Afghanistan program officer ; Fred Roitz , a Blackwater vice president ; and John Walker , a former Paravant program officer .

Ontario electricity ratepayers are about to get zapped with yet another increase on their energy bills .
On Monday , Ontario Power Generation announced it is asking permission to raise its rates next January by 9.6 per cent – the equivalent of about $ 2.75 a month .
The Crown agency ’s move comes a week after the Star revealed that a new $ 4 - a - year tax will be slapped on hydro bills to pay for $ 53.7 million in Liberal conservation programs .
Combined with the implementation of the harmonized sales tax on July 1 , which will increase consumption levies on energy bills to 13 per cent from 5 per cent , it ’s a three - pronged jolt for consumers that one industry insider said is “ the perfect storm . ”
But OPG president and CEO Tom Mitchell pointed out that the rate hike , only the company ’s second since 2005 , was one that had been put off last year due to the recession .
“ We deferred our rate application once but we must go to the OEB ( Ontario Energy Board ) this year to make a request for an increase in our regulated rates , ” Mitchell said in a statement .
Any increase by the energy titan — which generates 70 per cent of Ontario ’s electricity and operates nuclear reactors , hydroelectric stations , and coal - and gas - fired power plants — would be in effect for two years .
At Queen ’s Park , officials said the government , which is facing re-election in October 2011 , was watching the situation .
“ OPG is communicating an intent to file an application at the OEB .
What they are doing is speaking with stakeholders about the content of the application at this point , ” a Liberal insider said Monday .
The timing of OPG ’s pitch is not helpful to Premier Dalton McGuinty ’s government , which is bracing for backlash once the 8 per cent provincial sales tax is blended with the 5 per cent federal GST on July 1 .
The government has also been weathering criticism for the new conservation levy .
Both Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath have hammered McGuinty for “ nickel - and - diming ” Ontarians with new taxes , surcharges , and fees .
The opposition parties have also warned that even more new levies lie ahead .
Tory energy critic John Yakabuski predicted last week that a tax similar to the conservation charge the Star exposed on March 20 would also be imposed on natural gas bills .
“ Enbridge and Union Gas representatives told the general government committee that the McGuinty Liberals want to slap the new energy tax on home heating bills , ” said Yakabuski ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke ) , referring to recent testimony at a legislative committee .
“ You ’ve been found out about your secret back - door tax on hydro .
Are the McGuinty Liberals going to tax home heating fuel , too ? ”
Horwath , for her part , said the government is simply out of touch with the daily costs Ontarians face .

“ Here ’s what everyday people in this province face :

* Regular soda drinkers had 87 percent higher risk
* Theory is that sugar fuels tumors
WASHINGTON , Feb 8 ( Reuters ) - People who drink two or more sweetened soft drinks a week have a much higher risk of pancreatic cancer , an unusual but deadly cancer , researchers reported on Monday .
People who drank mostly fruit juice instead of sodas did not have the same risk , the study of 60,000 people in Singapore found .
Sugar may be to blame but people who drink sweetened sodas regularly often have other poor health habits , said Mark Pereira of the University of Minnesota , who led the study .
" The high levels of sugar in soft drinks may be increasing the level of insulin in the body , which we think contributes to pancreatic cancer cell growth , " Pereira said in a statement .
Insulin , which helps the body metabolize sugar , is made in the pancreas .
Writing in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers & Prevention , Pereira and colleagues said they followed 60,524 men and women in the Singapore Chinese Health Study for 14 years .
Over that time , 140 of the volunteers developed pancreatic cancer .
Those who drank two or more soft drinks a week had an 87 percent higher risk of being among those who got pancreatic cancer .
Pereira said he believed the findings would apply elsewhere .
" Singapore is a wealthy country with excellent healthcare .
Favorite pastimes are eating and shopping , so the findings should apply to other western countries , " he said .
But Susan Mayne of the Yale Cancer Center at Yale University in Connecticut was cautious .
" Although this study found a risk , the finding was based on a relatively small number of cases and it remains unclear whether it is a causal association or not , " said Mayne , who serves on the board of the journal , which is published by the American Association for Cancer Research .
" Soft drink consumption in Singapore was associated with several other adverse health behaviors such as smoking and red meat intake , which we can't accurately control for . "
Other studies have linked pancreatic cancer to red meat , especially burned or charred meat .
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer , with 230,000 cases globally .
In the United States , 37,680 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in a year and 34,290 die of it .
The American Cancer Society says the five - year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients is about 5 percent .
Some researchers believe high sugar intake may fuel some forms of cancer , although the evidence has been contradictory .
Tumor cells use more glucose than other cells .
One 12 - ounce ( 355 ml ) can of non-diet soda contains about 130 calories , almost all of them from sugar .

In addition to new App Store software , National Public Radio and The Wall Street Journal also plan to create specific versions of their Web sites completely devoid of Adobe Flash for iPad users .
This week Peter Kafka with MediaMemo revealed that both NPR and the Journal will convert at least some portions of their Web site to load properly on the iPad .
The custom - built sites will feature the same content and run concurrently with the traditional and iPhone / mobile - friendly versions of each Web site .
" Visitors to the newspaper 's front page will see an iPad - specific , Flash - free page , " Kafka said of the Journal 's iPad Web site .
" But those who click deeper into the site will eventually find pages that havenât been converted . "
The news comes weeks after Virgin America revealed it dropped Flash content from its new Web site in order to allow users with iPhones to check in for flights .
But the Journal and NPR are both also creating App Store software specifically for the iPad , suggesting that content providers are taking a multi-pronged approach to Apple 's forthcoming multimedia device .
Kinsey Wilson , head of digital media for NPR , declined to give Kafka an advance look at the organization 's forthcoming iPad application or Web site , but did provide a hint as to what the experience could be like .
" Wilson says that while iPhone apps are a ' very intentional experience ' — you load the thing up and seek out specific content — he thinks the iPad will be a ' lean back device , ' " Kafka wrote .
" That 's traditionally the distinction multimedia types use to differentiate between a computer and a TV .
Intriguing . "
The exclusion of Adobe Flash from the iPad and subsequent comments attributed to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs , in which he allegedly called the Web standard a " CPU hog , " have led to a considerable amount of debate over its merits and shortcomings .
Contributing to the conversation in January was Google , which added support for rival format HTML5 to the most popular video destination on the Internet , YouTube .
The beta opt - in program is available only for browsers that support both HTML5 and H.264 video encoding .
Apple , too , has placed its support behind HTML5 .
CALGARY — The Canadian oilsands suffered another public relations blow after two major U.S. retailers announced they were shunning fuel from there in favour of greener gasoline for their fleets .
Organic foods grocery chain Whole Foods Market and household accessories chain Bed Bath & Beyond said Wednesday they were actively seeking alternatives to oil - sands fuels to reduce their carbon footprints .
Wednesday ’s announcements underscored the need for Alberta ’s oil patch to step up their communications campaign and dispel misconceptions around their operations , said federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice .
“ The oilsands , at the end of the day , are an essential part of the overall supply - demand balance in North America , ” Mr. Prentice told the Calgary Herald .
“ But they do have to be developed in an environmentally responsible way .
Industry , in particular , is going to have to tell its story and explain the real facts . ”
It remains to be seen if there is significant backlash from Canadians against these retail operations .
“ I do n’t want anything more to do with ( them ) , ” said Calgary resident Jeff Thornborough .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , if someone does n’t want to do business with me , and I ’m an Albertan and take it personally , I do n’t want to do business with you . ”

Ever wanted your power outlet to turn itself off when your connected gadgets have charged ?
A recent outlet design aims to solve just that problem , saving you money on electricity bills in the process .
Sustainable student designer Conor Klein is the brain - power behind the outlet regulator concept .
Conor 's design does not require any human interaction due to its ejection action .
Once any connected gadgets reach their fully charged state .
the outlet 's cable will eject itself from the walls socket , stopping any energy consumption , as the below video demonstates :
Klein told PCWorld that his idea for the unique outlet design can be compared to that of a parasite , adding : " Most of our electronics lack the ability to know or act when they should stop taking energy .
The leech knows , and when it is full of blood simply falls off its host .
I saw there was an increasing need for something that could mimic this as more and more products turn electronic . "
Although other solutions are already available , Klein detailed that the physical ejection of the attached cable was an important design facet of the regulator , claiming the action provided clairty and engagement for users .
The working prototype of the power regulator , which is housed in ABS plastic , was developed over the course of a semester .
Now , how long will it be before we see such smart design ideas applied in mainstream consumer electronics ?
Only time will tell .

They came to think of themselves as the forgotten army - the men who endured years of suffering in Japanese Prisoner of War Camps during World War II .
Yet many of the survivors , when they came back , never spoke of what they had seen and suffered .
Now , one survivor of the camps has broken his 65 - year silence .
Alistair Urquhart , then a 22 - year - old Gordon Highlander from Aberdeen , became a prisoner of war without firing a shot .
This is a story of almost unimaginable suffering .
The POWs were transported deep into Thailand on rice trucks that were more like steel coffins .

He , with hundreds of others , was marched through the jungle to a prison camp .
Many died from dehydration and exhaustion on the long march .
They were then put to work on the building of a railway .
It involved cutting a path through a sheer stone cliff face the men came to call Hellfire Pass .

The men survived on a few handfuls of rice a day .
Many succumbed to disease - cholera , beriberi , tropical ulcers .
Their weight fell to five or six stone .
Beatings were routine .
In the 1957 film Bridge on the River Kwei the men whistle Colonel Bogie and the officers valiantly defy their Japanese guards .
Alistair Urquhart says it was not so .
The film sanitises the depths to which the men sank on the building of the infamous railway bridge .
For years he went barefoot and naked except for a simple loin cloth .
After another death march through the jungle , Alastair Urquhart was taken back to Singapore and , with 400 other men , loaded into the hold of a cargo ship .
There was standing room only .
It was airless , fetid , the heat baking .
Many died here too .

He spent five days and night alone on a barge .
By the time he was picked up by a Japanese whaling ship , he was dehydrated , hallucinating and close to death .
He ended up in a camp in mainland Japan .
He was there when the war ended .
But his prison camp was a few miles from the city of Nagasaki .
The blast of hot air from the bomb that fell on August 9th knocked him off his feet .
Within days he was on his way home .
He arrived in Aberdeen in November .
For years he 'd dreamt of being re-united with his family .
When , finally , he was , they scarcely recognised each other .
Those who returned came home to a country that did not understand what they had endured , and which , for the most part , did not want to know .
Like many of his generation , Alistair Urquhart did n't speak about his experience for 60 years .
His wife died after 46 years of marriage without knowing any of it .
I am breaking my silence now , he writes in his book , to bear witness .
I am a lucky man , but I am also an angry man , and my business with Japan is unfinished .
Germany has atoned .
Young Germans know of their nation 's dreadful crimes .
But young Japanese are taught nothing of their nation 's guilt .
Alistair Urquhart 's book , The Forgotten Highlander : One Man's Incredible Story Of Survival During The War In The Far East , is published by Little , Brown .

Plutus , the Greek god of wealth , did not have an easy life .
As the myth goes , Plutus wanted to grant riches only to the " the just , the wise , the men of ordered life . "
Zeus blinded him out of jealousy of mankind ( and envy of the good ) , leaving Plutus to indiscriminately distribute his favors .
Modern - day Greece may be just and wise , but it certainly has not had an ordered life .
As a result , the great opportunity and wealth bestowed by European integration has been largely squandered .

One of the greatest dangers to society is the phone charger .
The BBC News
has been warning us of this since 2005 :
“ The nuclear power stations will all be switched off in a few
years .
How can we keep Britain ’s lights on ?
... unplug your
mobile - phone charger when it ’s not in use . ”
Sadly , a year later , Britain had n’t got the message , and the BBC was forced
to report :
“ Britain tops energy waste league . ”
And how did this come about ?
The BBC rams the message home :
“ 65 % of UK consumers leave chargers on . ”
From the way reporters talk about these planet - destroying black ob -
jects , it ’s clear that they are roughly as evil as Darth Vader .
But how evil ,
exactly ?
In this chapter we ’ll find out the truth about chargers .
We ’ll also in -
vestigate their cousins in the gadget parade : computers , phones , and TVs .
Digital set - top boxes .
Cable modems .
In this chapter we ’ll estimate the
power used in running them and charging them , but not in manufacturing
the toys in the first place – we ’ll address that in the later chapter on “ stuff . ”
The truth about chargers
Modern phone chargers , when left plugged in with no phone attached ,
use about half a watt .
In our preferred units , this is a power consump -
tion of about 0.01 kWh per day .
For anyone whose consumption stack is
over 100 kWh per day , the BBC ’s advice , always unplug the phone charger ,
could potentially reduce their energy consumption by one hundredth of
one percent ( if only they would do it ) .
Every little helps !
I do n’t think so .
Obsessively switching off the phone - charger is like bailing
the Titanic with a teaspoon .
Do switch it off , but please be aware how tiny
a gesture it is .
Let me put it this way :
All the energy saved in switching off your charger for one day
is used up in one second of car - driving .
The energy saved in switching off the charger for one year is
equal to the energy in a single hot bath .

Gordon Brown is to correct his evidence to the Iraq Inquiry after accepting defence spending had not risen in real terms every year under Labour .
The PM , chancellor during the war , said he now accepted it " did not rise in real terms " in one or two years .
The Tories said it was a " humiliating climb - down " for the prime minister , whose evidence to the inquiry had been criticised by former defence chiefs .
Mr Brown told MPs he had written to the inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot .
Mr Brown appeared before the inquiry into the Iraq War on 5 March , and denied starving UK armed forces of equipment when he was chancellor .
Cash terms
He told the inquiry that the defence budget was " rising in real terms every year " - but House of Commons figures showed this was not the case .
A research note prepared last October showed defence spending had fallen in real terms in four years - 1997/8 , 1999/2000 , 2004/5 - at the height of the Iraq War - and 2006 / 7 .
Asked at prime minister 's questions on Wednesday if he would correct the record , Mr Brown said : " Yes .
I am already writing to Sir John Chilcot about this issue . "
He should apologise for the fact that under his watch our troops have not had the equipment they need to do the job .
Nick Harvey
Lib Dems
He said defence spending had risen from £ 21bn in 1997 to around £ 40 bn this year and " grows every year in cash terms " .
But he said : " Because of operational fluctuations in the way the money is spent , expenditure has risen in cash terms every year , in real terms it is 12 % higher , but I do accept that in one or two years defence expenditure did not rise in real terms . "
Mr Cameron said it was the first time in three years he had heard Mr Brown " make a correction or a retraction " and said there had been real - terms cuts and " at last the prime minister has admitted it " .
' Fantasy figures '
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said later : " This is a humiliating climb - down for Gordon Brown as his attempt to rewrite history has failed and his fantasy figures have been exposed . "
He said Mr Brown should be called back to the Iraq Inquiry .
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Nick Harvey said Mr Brown should go further : " He should apologise for the fact that under his watch our troops have not had the equipment they need to do the job . "
The increase in defence spending has been absolutely clear and significant over the last 13 years
PM 's spokesman Mr Brown 's spokesman said the PM had " taken the first opportunity " to tell MPs about his mistake but would not say when he first became aware of it .
Asked how Mr Brown had made the mistake , Downing Street said budgets were " pretty complex " and defence was one of the biggest .
" One has to accept that the broad direction and the increase in defence spending has been absolutely clear and significant over the last 13 years , " he told reporters .
But Colonel Richard Kemp , a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan , told the BBC that the overall 12 % real - terms rise should be looked at in the " context of very , very substantial military commitments in Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as the significant difference between defence inflation and normal inflation " .
' Gruesome accommodation '
He added : " The 12 % rise - particularly also in comparison to rises in expenditure on other departments - is not a great deal . "
And former head of the Army Gen Sir Mike Jackson told BBC Radio 4's PM programme : " The important thing is that overall , has defence been given the right resources to do what it 's been asked to do both operationally and non-operationally ?
I do n't think it is appropriate for people to criticise us for not providing what we did provide
Gordon Brown
" And the answer to that , I think , is no it has n't .
We still have soldiers still living in gruesome accommodation for example . "
Mr Brown was criticised over his evidence to the inquiry by former heads of the armed forces Lord Guthrie and Lord Boyce .
But , in an interview earlier this month , the prime minister said : " I think they are wrong .
To be honest , I do n't think it is appropriate for people to criticise us for not providing what we did provide .
" The urgent operational requirements that were asked for by our forces were always met . "

With space shuttles still launching and landing , NASA is n't keen to talk about what will happen to the iconic vehicles after they 're retired .
But the competition among institutions to land a space shuttle for public display is heating up .
Last December , NASA issued a “ request for information ” to educational institutions , science museums and other organizations about their interest in acquiring a space shuttle .
The space agency estimated it would cost about $ 42 million to prepare the vehicle and deliver it via a modified 747 Boeing aircraft carrier .
About 20 institutions — including a group of bidders led by Space Center Houston — responded .
Since then , however , the space agency has been mum .
“ We 're still in a holding pattern , ” said Robert Pearlman , editor of collectSPACE.com , a Web site for space history enthusiasts .
“ I do n't think anyone in the program really wants to talk about retiring the orbiters while they 're still flying them . ”
With the recent safe return of space shuttle Atlantis to Kennedy Space Center , NASA now has five shuttle missions scheduled during the next year before it retires the vehicles .
The retirement date could be extended by President Barack Obama , who is expected to decide on the future of NASA 's human spaceflight program during the next few months , but the shuttle 's end is coming .
As part of NASA 's conditions on receiving a shuttle , institutions must promise to display the vehicle indoors and commit to ongoing costs for its upkeep and care .
It will take time to raise funds to acquire the shuttle and prepare a facility in which to house it , but so far NASA headquarters in Washington has not indicated when it will make a decision .
“ NASA 's primary focus is to ensure that the space shuttle safely and successfully completes its mission — finishing the assembly of the International Space Station by the end 2010 , ” said NASA spokesman John Yembrick .
“ It is premature to speculate on when a final decision will be made . ”
The Smithsonian 's National Air and Space Museum is guaranteed one of the vehicles .
The institution already has space shuttle Enterprise — which was used as a test vehicle in atmospheric flights but never flew in space — on display at its Udvar - Hazy Center in Chantilly , Va .
Discovery is Smithsonian's
NASA has confirmed that it will give the Smithsonian space shuttle Discovery , which the institution prizes for its role as the return - to - flight orbiter after both the Challenger and Columbia tragedies as well as its role in launching the Hubble Space Telescope .
That leaves Atlantis and Endeavour as the two remaining orbiters that have flown in space .
And once it receives Discovery , Pearlman said the Smithsonian is likely to loan out Enterprise to another institution .
Pearlman said Kennedy Space Center — where the shuttles are launched from and serviced — seems a highly likely choice given that transporting the vehicle there would be no problem .
And he believes Houston has a very good chance as well , given its role as the space shuttle program 's headquarters , home of mission control and the place where most astronauts live .
“ I actually think that as long as we can raise the money to assure there will be a facility and support it , I think Johnson has a terrific chance of getting it , ” Pearlman said .
The 20 bids came from a varied group of institutions around the country , from Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in Oregon to the Tulsa Air and Space Museum in Oklahoma .
The 20 bids came from a varied group of institutions around the country , from Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in Oregon to the Tulsa Air and Space Museum in Oklahoma .
Houston 's bid is led by Space Center Houston , which wants to house the vehicle on its property adjacent to Johnson Space Center , said the center 's chief executive officer , Richard E. Allen Jr .
“ Space Center Houston is working along with Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership and other partners in Houston and the state because we think it 's going to take a broad - reaching effort to make it happen , ” he said .
“ You have to raise all the money to prepare a shuttle , and you also have to raise the cost for a building .
Any time you 're trying to raise money in those amounts , it 's a big undertaking . ”

These studies always drive me to despair .
According to a BBC report : " There is a strong link between heavy Internet use and depression , UK psychologists have said .
The study , reported in the journal Psychopathology , found 1.2 % of people surveyed were ' Internet addicts , ' and many of these were depressed . "
And I 'll bet a lot of them drink too much and can recite every flavor of Ben & Jerry's .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Personally , I do n't believe in Internet addiction any more than I do the " addiction " that allegedly afflicts Tiger Woods .
Call these matters compulsions , call them anti-social behavior , call them bad habits , but do n't lump them in with smoking , alcoholism and other drug addictions .
As was chronicled recently by my Network World colleague Jeff Caruso , the Internet -- in this case Facebook and Twitter , specifically -- has been accused of causing all manner of medical and psychological harm , including but not limited to brain damage , cancer , teenage suicide ... even rickets .
And it 's more than a matter of semantics , too .
Once these " addictions " become labeled as such they lend credence to the belief that the activities themselves are somehow harmful , online gambling being a primary example of these times that frosts my butt .
Moreover , depression is serious business and " linking " it to something as nebulous as " Internet addiction " trivializes a genuine illness .
Much of this is media driven , of course , as the BBC story says of the researchers here : " The Leeds University team stressed they could not say one necessarily caused the other , and that most Internet users did not suffer mental health problems . "
Well that 's a relief .
Yet we get this scare quote , too , from one of the researchers : " While many of us use the Internet to pay bills , shop and send e-mails , there is a small subset of the population who find it hard to control how much time they spend online , to the point where it interferes with their daily activities . "
Is there any part of that sentence that anyone finds the least bit surprising ?

A colony of fur seals has moved 1,500 km away from the Galapagos Islands , a Peru - based organisation which monitors the aquatic mammals has said .
The Organisation for Research and Conservation of Aquatic Animals says the fur seals have swum to northern Peru because of rising temperatures .
It is the first time fur seals have set up a colony away from the islands , Orca says .
Average sea temperatures off northern Peru have risen , monitors say .
Measurements from the Peruvian Geophysics Institute indicate the sea surface temperature in the northern Peruvian provinces of Piura and Tumbes have consistently risen from an average of 17C to 23C over the last 10 years .
The temperature is much closer to the sea temperature around the Galapagos Islands , which averages about 25C .
Now that the conditions of the sea around northern Peru are so similar to the Galapagos , they say , even more fur seals and other new marine species could start arriving .
The Galapagos Islands are located more than 900 km west off continental Ecuador .
Ever since the English naturalist , Charles Darwin , first visited the islands more than 150 years ago , they have become known as a living museum of evolution .
Correction 8 February :
An earlier version of this story had the species incorrectly as sea lion .
The mammal in question is fur seal .
The measurements of average sea temperatures were taken by the Peruvian Geophysics Institute , and should not have been attributed to Orca as in the earlier version .
The earlier version had a reference to the temperature rise being caused by climate change .
This has been removed as the relevant research is still in its early stages .
“ It ’s a safety problem , not only for us but car drivers , ” said Clayton Boyce , the spokesman for the American Trucking Association , which has fought rest stop closings in Virginia and elsewhere .
“ We think it is a pretty bad idea . ”

The Arizona Transportation Department has suffered an ever - ugly combination of large cuts and unforeseen costs .
More than $ 500 million of the transportation budget was recently diverted to the state ’s general fund — a common move among struggling states — and the department has closed 12 field offices , deferred $ 370 million in highway construction projects and cut 10 percent of its staff .
Further , two winter storms recently battered the north of the state , at a cost of roughly $ 4 million to the department .
The roughly $ 300,000 a year it cost to operate each rest stop was something the department decided it could no longer manage .
“ People think , ‘ You just go in and change the toilet paper , do n’t you ? ’ ” said Kevin Biesty , the government relations director for the Transportation Department .
“ The answer is , no , we have to maintain the water quality , we have do maintenance to the buildings and so on .
Some of those places in the middle of nowhere are like their own little cities . ”
Mr. Patterson ’s bill , which is supported by a majority of legislators , Republicans and Democrats , would allow local governments , American Indian tribes and private groups to pay to keep the rest stops open .
The problem is that most localities in the state are broke , too .
Further , federal law prohibits states ( including Arizona ) with Interstates built after 1956 from privatizing or commercializing their rest areas .
“ This bill does n’t really give us any new tools , ” Mr. Biesty said .
Gov. Jan Brewer , a Republican , wrote to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood last month asking that the restriction be rescinded to allow the state more flexibility .
SACRAMENTO , March 30 ( UPI ) -- A California mother said she had her 11 - year - old son hold a sign on a street corner for three hours to apologize for being disrespectful to his teacher .
Cassandra Rollins of Sacramento said she and Ahmad Rollins ' father decided to have the boy apologize to his fifth - grade teacher by holding a sign detailing his offense and remorse on the busy corner of Truxel Road and West El Camino Avenue , KCRA -TV , Sacramento , reported Tuesday .

Rollins said her son's worst offense was calling the teacher a " jackass . "
" It 's important to respect authority , and I hope parents agree with me , " she said .
Ahmad Rollins said he learned his lesson from the punishment .
" I am not going to call my teacher any names , or call anyone any names anymore , " the boy said .

I was reading Beautiful Teams the other day .
In chapter 2 , Scott Berkun talks about “ Ugly Teams ” and weighs in with an opinion on academic scores and how they tell you nothing about a persons aptitude ( of course when I say “ person ” , in my mind that translates to – “ developer ” :) ) .
I ’ve heard similar opinions so many times now that I felt like I had to champion the other side of the argument .
Here are some quotes :
“ If we go beneath the superficial , perfect grades often mean the perfect following of someone else ’s rules ” or “ They ( good grades ) are not good indicators of passionate , free - thinking , risk - taking minds ” or “ The tragedy of a team of perfect people is that they will all be so desperate to maintain their sense of perfection , their 4.0 in life , that when faced with the pressure of an important project their selfish drives will tear the team apart ” or “ Beautiful people are afraid of scars : they do n’t have the imagination to see how beautiful scars can be ”
Frankly I have to say – that is all so much bullshit .
How is it that in the world of software , mediocre grades have come to be equated with creativity and flair and flashes of genius .
“ Oh , he is an academic underachiever you say – well that must mean he is a creative , entrepreneurial go - getter who thinks outside the box ” .
You see they just did n’t get the poor guy at university , it is so sad that his genius has been overlooked .
What a load of rubbish , why is it that this side of the argument is never vociferously argued by people with perfect GPAs and a record of academic excellence ?
Sure , poor grades can be an indicator of a creative mind but they can also indicate laziness , inability to concentrate , lack of knowledge and skill , inability to complete tasks , poor interpersonal skills etc .
Good grades can sometimes mean slavish obedience ( rarely ) , but are more likely to indicate , superior knowledge , better study skills , adaptability , great teamwork skills , quicker mind etc .
It is beyond me how high academics can possibly indicate lack of passion and creativity .
So you want to employ some people , you have some high academic achievers and you have some mediocre ones , who do you hire ?
Do consider the average Joe , those grade jockeys are just law - abiding drones , Joe is the radical who is going to revolutionise the industry , he just needs the right kind of motivation .
What about motivation then ?
Lack of the right kind of motivation is often cited as the reason for average academic performance .
If only our underachieving friends had the “ right ” kind of motivation , they would be brilliant .
Well , it ’s not as if the high achievers get their kicks out of boring lectures and worked examples .
The difference is that the high achievers are able do well and motivate themselves despite the banality and minutia .
So which skill is more valuable , ability to self - motivate no matter what , or passively waiting for the “ right ” type of motivation ?
Are you sure you have the “ right ” kind where you are ?
Let ’s get this one out of the way , cause it will inevitably come up .
Yes , there are plenty of people in the world of software who had average ( or worse ) grades when they were studying , but have since “ made it ” .
They gained kudos , money , the acceptance of their peers ( either or all of those ) there is no arguing this point .
But that in itself is the problem , these academic underachievers who succeed have the spotlight cast upon them , because people did n’t expect it of them .
They get hailed and written about – see , even the average Joe can make it .
Thing is – they are the exception , not the rule .
These people succeeded “ despite the fact ” and this is the very reason why they are interesting .
People love an underdog story , makes us feel good , nobody wants to hear about the brilliant guy who lived up to his potential and made it big , as per expectations .
Rather than looking at high academic achievers as conformist drones , let me paint another picture for you .
Those who get good grades are the ultimate survivors .
They enter an environment , evaluate it critically to figure out what skills they need to succeed and thrive in said environment .
They then put in the effort to gain and / or sharpen these skills .
At this point they can apply their knowledge and skills with precision to get to the top of their environment and stay there .
Excellent academic results are just a side - effect .
And you know what , it ’s not as if being a high achiever is black magic , all it takes is a little bit of work and practice ( I am so going to cover that in a later post ) .
So yeah , good grades make better programmers , hell , good grades make better anything .
And there is nothing that stops a high achiever from being a passionate , free - thinking , risk - taker .
When faced with the pressure of an important project high achievers wo n’t get torn apart by their selfish desire for perfection , infact they will be better able to adapt and achieve superior results because that is what they do – evaluate their environment and figure out what is needed for them to succeed .
Beautiful people ( academically speaking ) are not afraid of scars , but they do have the knowledge and skill to avoid the scars when they can and create superior scars when they have to .

Scientists in France have transformed the chemical energy generated by photosynthesis into electrical energy by developing a novel biofuel cell .
The advance offers a new strategy to convert solar energy into electrical energy in an environmentally - friendly and renewable manner .
In addition , the biofuel cell could have important medical applications .
These findings have just been published in the journal Analytical Chemistry .
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert solar energy into chemical energy .
In the presence of visible light , carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) and water ( H 2 0 ) are transformed into glucose and O 2 during a complex series of chemical reactions .
Researchers at the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal ( CNRS ) developed a biofuel cell that functions using the products of photosynthesis ( glucose and O 2 ) and is made up of two enzyme - modified electrodes .
The cell was then inserted in a living plant , in this case a cactus .
Once the electrodes , highly sensitive to O 2 and glucose , had been implanted in the cactus leaf , the scientists succeeded in monitoring the real - time course of photosynthesis in vivo .
They were able to observe an increase in electrical current when a desk lamp was switched on , and a reduction when it was switched off .
During these experiments , the scientists were also able to make the first ever observation of the real - time course of glucose levels during photosynthesis .
This method could offer a new means of better understanding the mechanisms of photosynthesis .
Furthermore , the researchers showed that a biofuel cell inserted in a cactus leaf could generate power of 9 μW per cm2 .
Because this yield was proportional to light intensity , stronger illumination accelerated the production of glucose and O 2 ( photosynthesis ) , so more fuel was available to operate the cell .
In the future , this system could ultimately form the basis for a new strategy for the environmentally - friendly and renewable transformation of solar energy into electrical energy .
Alongside these results , the initial objective of this work was to develop a biofuel cell for medical applications .
This could then function autonomously under the skin ( in vivo ) , drawing chemical energy from the oxygen - glucose couple that is naturally present in physiological fluids .
It could thus provide power for implanted medical devices such as , for example , autonomous subcutaneous sensors to measure glucose levels in diabetic patients .
Los gobiernos de todo el mundo están llevando a cabo legislaciones para obligar a todos los clientes de móviles de prepago ( sin contrato ) a identificarse con el fin de prevenir delitos y combatir el terrorismo .
El Gobierno mexicano también reguló esta materia pero parace que los usuarios se están mostrando insumisos a la medida .
Cuando falta menos de un mes para venza el plazo dado hace un año por la Administración , sólo se han registrado 38,9 millones de teléfonos celulares hasta el 15 de marzo , de un total de 83,5 millones que operan en el país , por lo que los 44,6 millones de aparatos restantes sin registro podrían ser suspendidos en pocos días .
" Para el 10 de abril de 2010 , todos los teléfonos móviles que existen en el país - ya sean líneas de prepago o pospago - deberán estar dados de alta en el Registro Nacional de Usuarios de Telefonía Móvil ( Renaut ) " , recordó en un comunicado la Comisión Federal de Telecomunciaciones .
Las autoridades advirtieron de que " de lo contrario , la línea será suspendida sin ninguna responsabilidad por parte del proveedor de servicios " .

Los clientes de móvil prepago tendrán seis meses más para identificarse
Hace un año , el Gobierno mexicano comenzó el registro de celulares en el Renaut como una medida para evitar las extorsiones , secuestros y otros delitos que se cometen mediante el uso de teléfonos celulares .
Según un informe del Consejo para la Ley de Derechos Humanos , entre 2001 y 2007 en la Ciudad de México cada día se registró un promedio de 200 extorsiones vía telefónica , de las cuales en el 37 % de los casos se pagó el rescate .
No obstante , once meses después del aviso sólo el 46,5 % de los aparatos han sido registrados en este listado en manos de las autoridades .
De confirmarse esta baja masiva de líneas , las compañáis - Telcel , Telefónica , Iusacell - Unefon , y Nextel - podrían dejar de ingresar 6.900 millones de pesos ( 400 millones de euros ) al mes .
Además , la penetracíón de la telefonía móvil caería a niveles de hace cinco años , pasadno del 78 % a menos del 50 % .
Desde distintos ámbitos se ha pedido una prórroga de al menos un año para poder cumplir con la ley y el PRI ha presentado una iniciativa en este sentido .
En España , el plazo venció el pasado mes de diciembre , peor el Ministerio de Interior concedió una prórroga de seis meses .
El registro consiste en relacionar el número telefónico con la Clave Única del Registro de Población ( CURP ) .
Las autoridades recordaron que se puede registrar el número telefónico por medio de un mensaje de texto con los datos del CURP y también por medio de los centros de atención .
Las compañías que ofrecen el servicio de telefonía móvil deben conservar durante un año la información de cada cliente , en la cual se incluye , además , el registro de llamadas y mensajes que salgan o entren en los móviles .
Esta información podrá ser utilizada por las fiscalías en caso de investigaciones de delitos de extorsión , amenazas o secuestros .
- Coming to you live from my sofa and Olevia flat screen , it ’s time to have a look at the original WWE WrestleMania , as we gear up for numero twenty six .
So journey back in time with me as we go to an era where muscleheads were becoming all the rage , and Vince McMahon panhandled to celebrities to enhance his product .
I ’m talking about 1985 , of course .
- March 31 , 1985 from Madison Square Garden in NYC .
At this point , I was in a crib , doing my best Randy Orton impression into a pair of Swaddlers .
I even had the same range of facial expressions as Orton , to boot .
The commentators are Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura , who can shill for the product while maintaining a sense of gravitas .
Are you listening , Michael Cole ?
VINTAGE BURN !
- I ’m watching the un-edited 1998 VHS version , which means no songs are dubbed over .
This is great for many reasons , including …
-AN INSTRUMENTAL OF EASY LOVER !
Why has n’t Phil Collins hosted Raw ?
He CAN ’T be busy .
Vince McMahon voices over the opening bit , listening off each match in a voice so wooden that my surround sound speakers need to be liberated from splinters .
Is this really the man who held up his end of the Austin feud on the mic ?
- All things told , I ’d roll in the hay with Cyndi Lauper .
1985 Lauper , that is .
- Lights out !
Mr. Kennedy ’s mic !
Truly the MSG I remember !
Screw production value !*
Also , it ’s Howard Finkel ’s first of 25 Mania appearances , forecasting a legacy of dependability and excellence that may never be matched .
So he gets pushed aside for Lillian Garcia and Justin Roberts .
Life ?
Fair ?
Really ?
(* Bill Watts had a bumper sticker that said this )
- Mean Gene Okerlund is here to sing the National Anthem , and he “ needs help ” from those in attendance .
To say the least .
Gene speeds through his version of the song , looking off index cards all the while ( classy ) .
Gorilla Monsoon calls Okerlund “ unbelievable ” .
I do n’t think that ’s hyperbole , kids .
- Ventura has the scrotes to compare Okerlund to Robert Goulet .
“ I do n’t care if won a tag team match with Hulk Hogan .
Can he croon ?
Papa ….. I like it when you callll me big Pa- paaaaaaaa ”
- Lord Alfred Hayes takes us to pre-recorded ( you know , recorded earlier as opposed to later ) from Tito Santana and The Executioner ( a slimmer Buddy Rose ) .
He calls them “ two super wrestlers ” , which does n’t sound bush league in the least .
Santana ’s interview is rather basic ( more emotion than Charlie Haas , less than Phil Lafon ) , and Rosecutioner says that he ’s a “ big leaguer ” .
Because that red , nylon mask just screams “ star quality ” , after all .
- Funny moment during the ring intros , as Executioner ’s weight is “ unknown ” .
I used to make the same joke about Andy Reid , honest .
- Ahh , a ‘ criss cross ’ between the two men , which serves no purpose , other than to “ look pretty ” .
If a match in 1985 had 2 criss crosses , a flying forearm , and a backdrop , you could legally call it a “ spotfest ” .
- Ventura says WrestleMania is like Woodstock , as the match begins to get clumsy and awkward .
Given the way that Santana and Rose are stumbling through this , they look like Janis Joplin revelers , I guess .
Also , for a ‘ big leaguer ’ , Rosecutioner is sporting some nice love handles and arm flab .
Kind of the Mo Vaughn of his era .
- Nice !
I ’d forgotten the spot where Santana leg presses
Rose over the top rope , with him landing seated in a ringside chair .
If that was Sabu , he ’d have missed the chair .
And the floor .
There ’s no telling where he would have ended up , really .
- A flying forearm and Figure Four end it to give Santana the win .
You know , if you had to do a Money in the Bank match in 1985 , who would be in it ?
Santana , Jimmy Snuka , Ricky Steamboat , Randy Savage , the Harts , and The Bulldogs ?
I think I just blew my own mind .
- The way Alfred Hayes keeps moving his eyes before each prerecorded interview , you ’d think he was being questioned about the whereabouts of a missing child .
“ My WORD , I have no idea as to what you allude to , officer … . ”
- Next up is King Kong Bundy vs. SD Jones in a rather unassuming , yet historically noteworthy match .
It ’s also noteworthy for the promo beforehand , in which Jones speaks a beautiful blend of “ Jamaican ” and “ autistic ” .
On an upside , Jones is sporting a nylon ring jacket so gaudy , that it ’s sure to be in Lady GaGa ’s hall closet .
- And just like that , it ’s over !
Corner slam , avalanche , and big splash in 24 seconds for Bundy !
Wait , no , my stopwatch broke part way through , so it ’s actually NINE seconds .
This is the one time where Vince McMahon lied about a number by actually LOWERING it .
Monsoon and Ventura lie so convincingly about the fraudulent time , that they ’re immediately invited to speak on Linda McMahon ’s behalf at the next stockholder meeting .
- I just took nine seconds to get another Vitamin Water .
Maybe it was twenty four .
You do n’t know , do you ?
And you never will .
- Up next , Ricky Steamboat takes on pre-Doink , pre-lumberjack Matt Borne .
Just look at Borne .
Bad hair , bland promo .
Are we certain that he ’s not Evan ’s dad ?
- So here we go , future NWA World Champion vs. a guy who once beat Crush senseless with an arm that was loaded with batteries .
IT ’S WRES - SUH-MAY-NEE-UHHHHH !!!!
Borne immediately wins me over by doing the classic 1980 ’s “ atomic drop sell ” that every heel was required to do , where your body goes wobbly and you appear ready to mess your pants .
In other words , Borne looks like the victim of one of Curt Hennig ’s ribs .
- Gorilla Monsoon calls WWF “ the Mecca of professional wrestling ” , saying that nobody does wrestling better .
Why , that would seem to imply that there ’re other wrestling promotions !
Good thing Monsoon was untouchable , or McMahon woulda had him returning to the ring to do jobs for Terry Gibbs by week ’s end .
- You know , it ’s a shame that Borne never amounted to more than just a midcard character .
He ’s holding his own beautifully with Steamboat , and has a natural villainous streak , even if he looks like John Ritter if Ritter were a fugitive here .
- Steamboat finishes with a sloppy high cross body .
Good , fluid match that was way too short .
If this were on Raw today , it ’d STILL be too short .
Though you could play a drinking game for everytime Cole says “ VINTAGE DRAGON ” !
Vintage Dragon ?
I think I ordered lobster lo mein from there once .
- Hayes informs us that the next match will feature two “ great stars ” .
It ’s between Brutus Beefcake and David Sammartino .
Well , Lordship , you ’ve lied to us .
Beefcake does n’t even cut a promo beforehand , relying on manager Johnny Valiant ( who ’s dressed like a 55 year old deadbeat who wants you to believe that he exercises regularly ) .
- David brings out his father , the legendary Bruno Sammartino , who outpops the kid 27 - 1 .
Seriously , it ’s like Bruno is Stacy Keibler , and David is Test .
Though I ’m not anxiously awaiting Bruno to shimmy his legs over the middle rope .
Maybe you are , but not me .
- This match is atrociously sloooooow , so here ’s a fun anecdote .
At a convention a few years ago , David Sammartino called Mick Foley a disgrace to the industry .
I dunno , Mick a disgrace ?
I ’m fairly certain no one goes running up to Mick and says “ OHMIGOSH !
I am SUCH a HUUUUGE fan …… of your dad ! ” .
No wonder David has rage issues .
- A double DQ ends the abomination , as the crowd is clearly enamored with watching Bruno beat the crap out of Valiant .
Here ’s an idea : leave David home , and let Bruno beat up three or four guys who take the mic and make fun of Italians .
Would anybody object to this ?
Next , we have Greg Valentine and Junkyard Dog for the Intercontinental Title .
Valentine , who never wore shades regularly until he teamed with Honky Tonk Man , has a pair on for his promo .
Wearing sunglasses during a wrestling promo is a red flag that says “ I shift my eyes a lot and look awkward when I speak ” .
Somebody get a pair for Lord Alfred !
JYD has no problem speaking , coming off like the world ’s most polite version of John Shaft .
That ’s a compliment .
-ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST !
Already , the soundtrack for this show beats the modern WWE .
Compare this to Tiffany ’s “ I ’M INSATIABLE ! ” that sounds like something Miley Cyrus will write when she ’s 21 and counting down the days until she gets out of Matawan .
- See , now here ’s a good basic match : the charismatic face and the treacherously determined heel .
Valentine gives himself up to the cheer spots ( dog headbutts ) and then takes control with torturous holds to allow JYD to sell pain to the fans .
It does n’t have to be complicated .
- This moment of self - righteousness brought to you by Vitamin Water !
TRY IT !
- Jimmy Hart , managing Valentine , just took a WICKED bump , getting knocked off the apron and landing backfirst on the concrete .
He ’s like Jack Evans , except he can cut a promo .
Yeah , I went there .
- Cheap ending , as Valentine uses the ropes to score the pin , but it gets overturned when Tito Santana ( dressed for a night at the discotheque , looking to score some E perhaps ) reports that Valentine cheated .
So the match is restarted , but Valentine walks off , weirded out by Tito ’s shirt and slacks .
I ’m with the Hammer , who retains the IC Gold .
- Up next , Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff challenge for the WWF Tag Team Titles against the US Express , who are two “ fine young athloots ” .
Hayes said it , not me .
Mike Rotunda and Barry Windham look splendid in their polo shirts , while Rotunda ’s promo is basically him saying “ When I become a tax man , I ’m going after Barry ’s dad and brother for counterfeiting ” .
Okay , he did n’t say it , but it ’s my rant , so get off my cloud here .
- The Express have “ Born in the USA ” , which is a GREAT theme to have .
If you ’re Sean Penn .
- Also of note , Volkoff sings the Soviet National Anthem , giving the camera crew a chance to pan the crowd , showing enough bad perms to fill one of my old Health books .
Did you ever go through your health book and laugh with your friends at the bad clothes and hair in the pictures ?
You did n’t ?
Liar .
- Solid match , as any match where Sheik tries to sell pain is perversely entertaining .
After a cane shot to Windham , the foreigners steal the gold .
Post - match , manager Freddie Blassie claims that he never even brought a cane to the ring .
He ’s immediately offered a position in the Reagan Administration .
- Time now for the $ 15,000 Bodyslam Challenge , between Andre the Giant and Big John Studd .
Great bit from the pre-promo , where Studd and Heenan are showing off the money , and Okerlund tries to paw through it about 7 - 8 times .
I never would have guessed that he would have run an exploitative hotline in WCW , would you ?
- I always liked Andre because he hardly sold for anyone .
He would just ignore the worked punches and such in a subtle fashion .
Even a guy the size of Studd , Andre just would n’t give an inch .
It should be noted that Studd is wearing Wilt Chamberlain ’s smoking jacket in the ring this afternoon .
It ’s a good look for him .
- Punch .
Chop. Punch .
Kick .
Punch .
Chop. Kick .
Chop. Punch .
They need to come out with a Dance Dance Revolution game where the options on the stomp mat are “ punch , chop , kick , and sell ” .
Ta da !
You ’ve just worked an Andre match from later in his career !
- The amount of bear hugs and facelocks in the match , along with the strikes , make this into a predecessor for UFC .
The only difference is that Ventura does n’t come off as a low life jocksniffer like Joe Rogan .
- Andre catches Studd ’s foot , and I swore that Studd would try for an enzuigiri .
That ’s what I got for watching this at 2 AM .
- Andre slams Studd and begins to throw the money to the crowd .
I think WWE should employ this practice after every lackluster PPV event , just as a show of faith .
You can Vince do it himself while performing that classic “ fake laugh ” of his , just for effect .
After the match , Andre cuts a promo with Mean Gene where he sounds like a heavily inebriated Scott Hall .
In other words , he sounded just like Scott Hall .
- Women ’s title time , as Leilani Kai defends against Wendi Richter , who has Maria ’s current make - up scheme going .
Too bad that she does n’t have Maria ’s looks .
It ’s amazing how mall hair can make any woman look hideous .
Not that Wendi had a chance anyway .
According to Wikipedia , Wendi was 23 here .
REALLY ?!?
Did she develop a taste for Old Crow when she was 11 ?
- For the record , Kai does n’t look much better .
I thought it was Jamie Farr at first .
Kai assures us that she ’ll have her “ hand in Victor ” after the match .
I ’m supposed to have a witty joke here ?
-“ OH GIRLS ….. JUST WANNA HAVE FUH-HUN !!!!! ” .
Do n’t EVER try to cover this again , Miley .
- If you ’ve seen one women ’s match from the 1980 ’s , you ’ve seen em all .
Hairdrag !
Awkward bodyslam !
Kick !
Look at the cellulite jiggle !
For the record , I ’m not trying to sound misogynistic here .
Even Gloria Steinem can’t defend this drek .
- Go figure , the match ends with a bad cross body and a nearly - botched rollover , as Richter gets her title back , and allows Cyndi Lauper to cut a promo that was at least coherent , thus putting Lita to shame .
- Let ’s just move on
- Main event time , and here are the celebrities : guest ring announcer Billy Martin ( booooooed by the fans of the team he MANAGED to the WORLD SERIES ) , guest timekeeper Liberace ( why is he even here ? ) , the Rockettes ( outpopping David Sammartino ) , and guest outside enforcer Muhammad Ali ( who probably would have declined had it not been for Larry Holmes scrambling his brains ) .
Pat Patterson is the inside official ( THAT’S why Liberace ’s here ) .
- Rowdy Roddy Piper , and Paul Orndorff , along with Cowboy Bob Orton , are led to the ring by a Scottish bagpipe precession .
Men in kilts ?
How much leeway DID Patterson get for booking appearances for this show ?
Meanwhile , Orndorff looks overly tense here .
That ’s like saying “ Michael Cole sounds utterly clueless here ” .
-“ It ’s the …EYE OF THE TI - GER , IT ’S THE THRILL OF THE FIGHT ! ”
- Hulk Hogan and Mr. T hit the ring along with Jimmy Snuka , as it ’s turning into a madhouse .
Ever wonder why WWF took off and the other territories did n’t ?
Just look at the pageantry and showmanship on display here .
If you do n’t find any of this to be good fun , then you ’re either a boring person or a liar .
Or both , like Paul Roma .
- Mr T ( wearing some nifty pajama pants ) actually shows off some “ mad skillz ” as the kids say .
He really missed his calling in wrestling , executing the very basics .
With his charisma , tell me that you do n’t turn him heel and pit him against Hogan at WrestleMania 2 for the title .
MONEY !
- Speaking of money , Piper was the greatest heel of all time .
To hell with Ric Flair .
- Hip toss !
Scoop slam !
Mr. T ’s one move up on Kevin Nash !
- Barring the aforementioned heel turn , Hogan and T could have easily faced Volkoff and Sheik for the tag titles .
Tell me that ’s not a money idea .
Even better , years later , the shoot interviews where Sheik threatens to humble “ that no good disrespectful punk Mr T ” would be priceless .
See ?
You ’re marking out right now .
- After a miscommunication , Orton accidentally clobbers Orndorff with his cast and Hogan scores the pin .
Lesson learned : it takes interference to beat Paul Orndorff , even if you ’re the Hulkster .
Vader could n’t do it , so what chance does the Hulkster have ?
- Afterward , the faces celebrate in the locker room , and Snuka cuts a promo in English .
Truly , a banner night for all .
- So what happened ?
WrestleMania helped pave the way for pay per view , helped modernize the industry , and brought wrestling to a national level that led to a lot of good as well as bad , much like the story of any great rock band .
Can this show be any better ?
- YES IT CAN !
THE AXEL FOLEY THEME OVER THE END CREDITS !
ROCK OOOOOOT .
-CYNIC SAYS : Every WrestleMania is recommended viewing , but this one gets a bigger pass , since it was the first one out of the womb .
While much of the action is primitive and awkward , it ’ll give you a great perspective on how things came to be .
A staggering 24 future Hall of Famers appeared at this event , and it ’s a nice primer for younger fans to get a sense of wrestling history .
Rock n Wrestling , indeed .

The American middle class ideal is lionized around the world .
It is the core of what has made this country great .
The land of opportunity and endless wealth so long as people worked hard enough .
It was an implicit contract workers made with this country .
Well that vision is now quickly coming under attack by the corporate structure with banks being the main culprits leading the American middle class to the edge of financial ruin .
The average American is looking at their current economy and wondering what ever happened to the security that was once provided to the “ greatest generation ” era .
The Wall Street crowd after devouring their bailouts is telling Americans that this is simply how the market corrects .
Yet at the same time , they are offering record bonuses to their elite .
The same banking crowd that led this country to the financial edge is now rewarding itself with massive bonuses ( taxpayer funded ) while jobs are being lost and no industry is emerging to provide work to the middle class .
As tough as it may be for many to swallow we are in a class warfare struggle .
That is why you are seeing populist rage growing in both of our entrenchment political parties .
If you are wondering why those on Wall Street have a hop to their step , it is because the stock market wealth is concentrated in the hands of very few :
The top 1 percent control 42 percent of financial wealth in the United States .
Now think about that fact .
Let us assume you have saved diligently for a few years into your 401k .
Before the crisis hit , you had amassed $ 100,000 ( much higher than the median amount for Americans but we ’ll just use this to highlight our point ) .
At the low , that $ 100,000 was probably down to $ 50,000 even being diversified .
With the major run up , the amount might now be back to $ 75,000 to $ 80,000 .
Has the life of the average American really changed ?
This money is actually retirement funds and this amount is not going to make a big difference in the way people live on a day to day basis .
Yet those in the top 1 percent with the current shift have seen billions go their way and this does make a big difference since many draw off capital gains on a yearly basis .
The 401k structure is problematic in many ways .
It is a method to lure in money from people to give them a taste of the Wall Street money machine .
Most of these funds are designed for retirement .
And with massive baby boomers retiring in the next few years , billions of dollars in funds will be sold into the market ( which ironically will add pressure on prices because of demographic shifts ) .
This will push prices down right when people will start drawing from their nest egg .
The notion that you can garner 7 percent each year into infinity is a fallacy that has been exposed in this market crash .
We have been getting richer as a nation overall .
This is true .
But why is it so hard for average Americans to now get by with two incomes when one income seemed adequate 40 years ago ?
The income gains have largely gone to the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2005 :
Source : Wikipedia
The above gains are inflation adjusted over three decades .
While income did increase across categories this distribution was not even .
It was largely shifted to the top of the pile .
Now it would be one thing if the top was being run by companies that actually provided jobs for a large part of America .
But it is n’t .
You have CEOs of Manhattan banks that are trading derivatives on toxic mortgages and betting up oil futures all so they can skim the system for money .
How has that added value to our country ?
It has n’t .
All it has done is transformed part of our economy into one subsidized taxpayer casino at the expense of the working middle class .
If you want to visualize this class division , it would roughly break down like this :
But even here , the top 1 percent is n’t even reflected .
Even working families with say a nurse and an engineer can bring in $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 a year .
But with things like the AMT even this tranche is feeling the burden .
The big transfer of wealth is going to the top 1 percent :
“ ( Wikipedia ) As of 2005 there are approximately 146,000 ( 0.1 % ) households with incomes exceeding $ 1,500,000 , while the top 0.01 % or 11,000 households had incomes exceeding $ 5,500,000 .
The 400 highest tax payers in the nation had gross annual household incomes exceeding $ 87,000,000 .
Household incomes for this group have risen more dramatically than for any other .
As a result the gap between those who make less than one and half million dollars annually ( 99.9 % of households ) and those who make more ( 0.1 % ) has been steadily increasing , prompting The New York Times to proclaim that the “ Richest Are Leaving Even the Rich Far Behind . ”
Indeed the income disparities within the top 1.5 % are quite drastic .
While households in the top 1.5 % of households had incomes exceeding $ 250,000 , 443 % above the national median , their incomes were still 2200 % lower than those of the top .01 % of households .
One can therefore conclude that almost any household , even those with incomes of $ 250,000 annually are poor when compared to the top .1 % , who in turn are poor compared to the top 0.000267 % , the top 400 taxpaying households . ”
So we see where the money is really going .
Even if we break down a family in California earning $ 100,000 you can see what was once considered rich is no longer the case :
And for those out in high cost states they will realize that a $ 350,000 home does not buy you much even after the tremendous crash in housing values .
The cost of healthcare is rising and college costs are going up so with one child , they will want to set aside some money if they want to see their child have a decent college education when they are ready to go .
And keep in mind that making $ 100,000 puts you in the top 17 percent of households in the U.S. :
So in reality , we should look at household that brings in $ 65,000 per year to get a more accurate feel of what the middle class is going through :
So after taxes , this family is taking home $ 4,240 a month .
With rising taxes , higher food costs , healthcare rising , and wages stagnant you can see how the middle class is falling behind on a daily basis .
We can further breakdown the class distribution as follows :
We do have class in our system and the biggest misnomer that has been perpetrated is that somehow , our goals are aligned with those of the banking Wall Street elite .
How much longer do people need to realize that both political parties seem to serve one master and it has an address on Wall Street ?
The debates and battles seem to amount to this charade because once it comes time for policy , nothing gets done .
Even Elizabeth
Warren who is fighting for basic consumer rights is finding it even hard to get through because of banking lobbyist :
“ It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one - in - five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house .
But it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one - in - five chance of putting the family out on the street — and the mortgage wo n’t even carry a disclosure of that fact to the homeowner . ”
The battle has gotten intense .
Credit card companies have been doing criminal activities by jacking fees up and setting up traps for consumers before simple regulations come into effect .
Banks have pulled back on lending to average Americans while profits from stock speculation have soared .
They do n’t call it speculation but label it as hedge funds , proprietary trading , or some other Orwellian language that hides the true nature of the system .
With the underemployment rate at over 17 percent and bankruptcies , foreclosures , and other financial distress rising for average Americans one small chunk of our population is benefitting on the backs of bailout funding .
This has been characterized as it “ taking a plunder ” to rip off the village :
So what you do is take from the public :
Source : It Takes a Pillage
And give to the people that created this crisis :
I completely agree with Elizabeth Warren who is adamantly arguing that we are at a cross -road in terms of defending the middle class of this country .
Instead , Wall Street enjoys the fact that Americans are split down the middle on issues and fighting over petty things while trillions keep rolling into their coffers .
Time to wake up and see what is really happening to our nation .

The U.S. Border Patrol and local law enforcement agencies in northwest Ohio restrain and interrogate Latinos about their immigration status based solely on their Hispanic appearance , a federal lawsuit filed by the Ohio - based Farm Labor Organizing Committee ( FLOC ) charges .
One case cited in the lawsuit refers to a person who was pulled over because the light over his license plate was dim .
When he presented his valid Ohio driver ’s license , the officer demanded proof of immigration status not only from him but also from each of his five passengers .
All six were lawful permanent residents , but their brown skin seemed to be cause enough for the local enforcement agent to intrude upon their civil liberties , said FLOC spokesperson Beatriz Maya .
FLOC ’s suit argues that these practices violate the U.S. Constitution ’s Fourth Amendment which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures , as well as the Fifth Amendment ’s guarantee of due process and equal protection of the law .
“ I think it is imperative that we not only address this issue , but tell them to quit it , ” says Baldemar Velasquez , FLOC founder and president .
“ Stop spreading fear in the Latino community and start doing the serious police work . ”
Racial profiling in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan worsened after the Bush administration significantly increased the Border Patrol ’s budget , according to Maya .
New offices opened along the border with Canada , affecting Michigan and Ohio residents .
FLOC argues that the Border Patrol may have had difficulty justifying the increased budget and has tried to create numbers by going after farmworkers and other Latinos in the area .
Other parties in the class action law suit include several FLOC members , Advocates for Basic Legal Equality , the law firm of Murray and Murray , Co. L.P.A. , and the Immigrant Worker Project .
“ In some cases ” , says ABLE attorney Mark Heller , “ the U.S. Border Patrol has offered to come and restrain and interrogate persons that the local law enforcement agencies have already seized , violating the 14th Amendment ’s guarantee for due process and equal protection of the law .
There really is no legitimate defense to what they are doing . ”
Maya listed three ways supporters can help :
1 . The lawsuit currently has 12 plaintiffs but FLOC is certain , says Maya , that there are hundreds more who have suffered this discriminatory practice .

The campaign to legalize marijuana in California kicked off this week , just days after the initiative made the ballot , with a radio ad saying many law enforcement professionals know marijuana laws have failed and calling the measure “ a common sense solution . ”
The ad features Jeffrey Studdard , a former school district police officer and reserve L.A. County sheriff ’s deputy .
Studdard says that he has “ seen firsthand that the current approach on cannabis is simply not working , ” explaining that the fight against marijuana has led to “ violent drug cartels ” and “ dealers in our schools and our streets ” without reducing consumption .
He concludes by saying the Regulate , Control and Tax Cannabis Act , which would allow cities and counties to authorize pot sales and tax them , would raise billions and allow police to focus on violent crime .
Kim Raney , chief of the Covina Police Department and a spokesman for the California Police Chiefs Assn. , called the ad “ completely false and misleading . ”
He predicted that law enforcement groups would line up against the initiative .
“ This is really the first attempt to legalize drugs , ” he said .
“ This is just a Trojan horse .
The first of an incremental strategic attempt . ”
Previewing the coming debate , he took issue with Studdard ’s contention that marijuana prohibition has spawned cartels and the implication that legalization would undercut them .
“ It ’s obviously naive to think that Mexican drug cartels and Asian drug cartels are not going to be involved , with all the money at stake , ” Raney said .
The spot , which lasts about a minute , will run for at least a week in the Bay Area and Los Angeles , but the campaign hopes to raise the money to keep it on the air and plans to add other radio and television spots featuring police officers , judges , doctors , teachers and parents .
The commercial concludes by soliciting support .
Dale Sky Clare , a spokeswoman for the campaign , said , “ The common theme has always been cops versus hippies , but the reality is that many law enforcement officers agree that prohibition has failed . ”
In the ad , Studdard says police officers support the measure , but campaign officials could name only two former officers in California , including Studdard , as well as a few former California prosecutors and judges .
Studdard is identified in the ad as a former sheriff ’s deputy .
He said he worked full - time for the Walnut Valley Unified School District and volunteered as a reserve deputy between 1990 and 2001 .
Studdard , who taught drug education in the schools and made marijuana arrests , said he was severely disabled by a back injury in 2003 and tried pot .
He said it allowed him to give up painkillers , stimulated his appetite and changed his views on prohibition .
“ It ’s not going to go away , ” he said .
“ It ’s been here for 7,000 years . ”

Renault has this morning officially confirmed that it is to remain in Formula One in 2010 and beyond , though a " large stake " of the team has been sold to Genii Capital which is owned by Luxembourg businessman Gerard Lopez .
The official statement reads as follows :
Renault has decided to maintain its commitment to Formula One and welcomes the perspective of a strategic partnership with Genii Capital , a Luxemburg based firm specialized in new technologies , brand management and motor sport .
Following the proposed sale of a large stake of Renault F1 Team to Genii , both partners will operate the team together .
The letter of intent signed by the two companies should be concluded in early 2010 .
In 2010 , the team will retain its name , its identity and the core ingredients that led to the successes achieved in 2005 and 2006 .
The team will continue to be supplied with engines by its sister company in Viry - Châtillon , which is also pleased to have received a renewed commitment from Red Bull Racing for the 2010 season .
After 35 years in the sport , Renault today announces a new phase for its F1 programme , consistent with Formula One 's drive for cost efficiencies .
Formula
One remains one of the biggest sporting spectacles in terms of annual television audiences and media exposure .
Renault therefore believes that the impact of Formula
One in terms of image , and brand awareness worldwide , particularly in new , emerging markets , will continue to play a key role in fulfilling the company 's growth objectives in years ahead .
Bernard Rey , Renault F1 Team President , said : " I am delighted to welcome Genii Capital as our new strategic partner as I am sure that their enthusiasm and business expertise will create a new dynamic for the team , the staff , and our partners .
Altogether , we look forward to competing again at the highest level in Formula One .
Today 's announcement also confirms Renault 's commitment and trust in the sport 's governing bodies to improve the green credentials of Formula One . "
Indeed , in making such a decision , Renault not only demonstrates its commitment to its fans across the world , its employees in Enstone and in Viry , and the FIA , FOA and FOTA but it also believes in the positive impact of promoting relevant technologies in synergy with its product plan .
" With the ongoing evolutions of the Formula One regulations , Renault will be able to entertain its fans , while promoting a leaner and sounder Championship .
We will show Renault 's skill when it comes to developing high - performance , fuel - efficient cars " said Bernard Rey , Renault F1 Team President .
The important cost reduction measures , made possible by the collective work within FOTA , have already improved significantly the operating cost base .
With the anticipated sale of a stake in its F1 operational base in the United Kingdom to Genii Capital , Renault achieves today another step that will definitely bring F1 participation to an affordable level for the Group .
In addition , the new partnership will contribute to procuring the team the resources to compete sustainably at the highest level , and creates a great opportunity to modernise its governance .
Their confident faces smile out from billboards across the city .
Their promotional grins are plastered across double - decker buses , subway light boxes , even on TV .
These are Hong Kong 's " star tutors , " accorded near - celebrity status for their ability to make learning fun and help students pass exams in everything from English to chemistry .
Tutoring is common in Asia , where intense emphasis on grades and exams means parents are willing to shell out .
More than half of Hong Kong 's youths get assistance outside school , a recent survey found .
The industry here is especially competitive and commercialized as tutors mimic the city 's showbiz industry to attract students and grab a share of the $ 460 million market .
" Those images of fame and stardom have been sustained and re-invented in different forms , resulting in tutors now packaging themselves as the superstars of the education sector in order to appeal to students , " says Gerald Postliglione , a professor at the University of Hong Kong .
Star tutors spare no costs on publicity .
Even tutors who belong to one of the four major chains here must self - promote .
But successful tutors can command hundreds of students .
Those at the very top see their lives splashed across the pages of the city 's gossip magazines , revealing how many luxury cars they drive or properties they own .
Some reports put their salaries as high as $ 1.5 million a year .
One English tutor , Richard Eng , is famous for his love of Ferraris .
Critics worry that the emphasis on good looks and brand names sends youths the wrong message , but some tutors say the gimmicks are indispensable – and that the results are real .
" The marketing is only for attracting students – we still need to deliver to keep the students coming back , " says Antonia Cheng , an English tutor at Modern Education , a major chain .
Ms. Cheng says she tries to make English fun , using interactive methods and discussing contemporary issues .
Cheng gives out her phone number ; many tutors also are on Facebook .
" Teachers communicate in a way we understand , unlike at school , which we find really boring , " says Casper Chan , a high - schooler .
Tutors have capitalized on changes roiling the educational system since 1997 , when Hong Kong reverted to China .
The government introduced " mother - tongue teaching " to popularize Cantonese in the classroom , but that weakened English proficiency and was scrapped .
It also recently switched to a more US - style " 3 - 3 - 4 " system for junior high , high school , and college .
This year it introduced liberal studies in high school , to improve critical thinking skills .
" There 's been a lot of confusion ... in the last few years .
Tutor centers have to be result - oriented , " says Trino Chan , who recently opened his own center .
" When the system does n't deliver what parents expect , they are willing to pay for tutors .
This is why there will always be money to be made in tutoring in Hong Kong . "

BOSTON — Should a teacher who ca n’t speak fluent English to her students be allowed to stay in the classroom ?
The outcome of Phanna Rem Robishaw ’s case against the Lowell School Department and Lowell School Committee holds statewide ramifications for the state ’s educational system .
Today , the state Supreme Judicial Court was scheduled to hear arguments from Robishaw , a former Lowell teacher who was fired for failing an English - fluency test , after a lower - court judge upheld the firing , saying the teacher ’s English proficiency was “ utterly incomprehensible . ”
In 2002 , Massachusetts ’ voters passed Question 2 , requiring all school superintendents to attest to the English fluency and literacy of their teachers where “ the teacher ’s fluency is not apparent through classroom observation and assessment or interview assessment . ”
Robishaw was given an Oral Proficiency Interview test to evaluate her English fluency .
The test has been criticized for lacking a definition of what is “ proficient ” or “ fluent ” in English .
Also , it was pointed out that non-native - speaking teachers had to demonstrate fluency in English , while “ native speaking ” teachers were assumed to be fluent in English .
Robishaw , a native of Cambodia who is now a U.S. citizen living in Lowell , sued the city , claiming a $ 1.3 million breach of contract after she was fired as a classroom instructor at the Greenhalge Elementary School in June 2003 .
She had worked for the city ’s schools for 11 years and had tenure .
An arbitrator sided with Robishaw , saying there was “ no just cause ” to fire her , and awarded her 18 months of back pay and benefits .
But on appeal , Middlesex Superior Court Judge Dennis Curran in 2008 overturned the arbitrator ’s decision .
Curran relied on a tape of the teacher ’s Oral Proficiency Interview test in making the reversal .
Curran wrote that he listened to Robishaw ’s test tape and “ found it to be utterly incomprehensible . ”
Transcripts of the superintendent ’s hearing and the arbitrator ’s hearing show Robishaw had “ great difficulty both in expressing herself and understanding the examiner ’s questions , ” the judge wrote .
“ Clearly , if an adult has difficulty in ascertaining what Robishaw is saying , a young child would face even greater difficulty , ” Curran added .
His ruling continued , “ To sacrifice schoolchildren at the altar of political correctness is an act I decline to endorse . ”
Attorney James Hall , who represents the Lowell School Committee , wrote in court briefs that it is “ readily apparent to any layperson that Ms. Robishaw is not proficient enough in English to teach in a mainstream classroom . ”
Robishaw ’s attorney , Srinivas Ramineni , wrote in court documents that Curran was wrong because absent fraud , courts may not vacate a 2006 arbitrator ’s award even if there was an error of law or facts .
He accused Curran of “ trampling ” on Robishaw ’s right to due process and accused the judge of not being qualified to assess fluency .
Ramineni said the arbitrator excluded the unauthenticated test tape from his original ruling , so it should not be introduced at this stage of the litigation .
Robishaw was teaching elementary school in Cambodia when her village was taken over by the Khmer Rouge .
After marrying , she immigrated to the U.S. and in 1992 , she earned a bachelor ’s degree from Westfield State College .
By 2002 , Robishaw had taught for 17 years in Massachusetts and accrued 54 master ’s degree credits for accreditation in different fields of teaching .
That same year , Robishaw began teaching at the Greenhalge School .
After several years as a transitional bilingual teacher , she was assigned as a classroom teacher .
Throughout her career , Robishaw had received satisfactory evaluations until 2002 , when fluency testing began .
Robishaw , along with three other Cambodian teachers , received unsatisfactory English evaluations .
In a 2003 lawsuit , Robishaw claimed the unsatisfactory evaluations were done with the purpose of getting rid of all the Cambodian teachers .
Ramineni described the evaluations as “ scathing and derogatory . ”
Kia , the little car company that could , recently unveiled its Kia Ray concept vehicle .
With 20 inch wheels and a solar cell imbued roof the concept is quite something to look at , using the same essential shape as the Prius and Leaf , an aerodynamic must for reasons of efficiency , the Ray makes intelligent use of solar cells to partially recharge the batteries , the Ray also features regenerative braking and plug - in capabilities .
Using it ’s litium - ion battery array the Ray can travel 50 mile on a full charge and is the capable of using the built in gasoline engine to travel a total range of 750 miles .
If Kia can produce the Ray for the same or a slightly lower price point than the Prius / Leaf / Volt cars they will almost certainly find themselves a significant niche in the eco - green - car market .

Looking for proof the recession is still here in full - swing ?
Look no further than the latest batch of unemployment data .
43 out of 50 states saw unemployment rise last month , with New Jersey alone hitting a 33 - year high of 10.1 % .
Looks like America 's still stuck in dire straits .
----------------------------------------------
AP : Unemployment rates rose in 43 states last month , the government said Friday , painting a bleak picture of the job market that illustrated nationwide data released two weeks ago .
The rise in joblessness was a sharp change from November , when 36 states said their unemployment rates fell .
Four states -- South Carolina , Delaware , Florida and North Carolina -- reported record - high jobless rates in December .
New Jersey 's rate , meanwhile , rose to a 33 - year high of 10.1 percent while New York 's reached a 26 - year high of 9 percent .
Analysts said the report showed the economy is recovering at too weak a pace to generate consistent job creation .
" A lot of states that had started to add jobs ( in November ) gave up those gains in December , " said Sophia Koropeckyj , managing director at Moody 's Economy.com .
Texas and Georgia lost more jobs in December than they had gained the previous month , she noted , while Arizona and South Carolina lost nearly as many as they had gained .
That is consistent with nationwide trends .
Employers shed a net total of 85,00 jobs in December , the government said earlier this month , after notching a small gain of 4,000 jobs in November .
In another nationwide trend , long - suffering states like California and Michigan saw their jobless rates stabilize even as they continued to bleed jobs .
That 's because thousands of frustrated workers gave up hunting for work and dropped out of the labor force , which means they are n't included in the unemployment rate .
California lost 38,800 jobs .
But its unemployment rate was unchanged at 12.4 percent , the fifth - highest in the nation .
That 's because 107,000 people , or 0.6 percent of the state 's workforce , gave up and stopped job - hunting .
Michigan shed 15,700 jobs , but 31,000 people left the labor force .
That caused the state 's jobless rate to fall slightly , to 14.6 percent from 14.7 percent .
Michigan has the nation 's highest unemployment rate .
Nationally , more than 600,000 people left the labor force in December , according to government data .
The large exodus from the labor force indicates that " unemployment is a lot worse than the numbers suggest , " Koropeckyj said .

I have been thinking a lot recently about how to apply agile development principles to investing and key aspects of startup development such as team building .
That ’s also the thread connecting my two recent posts on VentureHacks .
Both stem from the agile principle of delaying decisions until the last responsible moment .
The first post is about agile startup fundraising .
The follow - on post is about agile startup team building .
If you ’ve read and liked these posts , let others know .
The same question came up a few times in different forms in the comments to the second post :
@ Nivi Simeon , can you tell us how you structure ownership and control so you can fire your co-founders if necessary ?
This is a complex topic that has a business and legal side to it .
I ’m no lawyer , so I ’ll look at things from a business perspective .
I will mention legal terms and example language for illustration purposes only — for details , consult a lawyer .
This is n’t just CYA .
There are a lot of possibilities and variations that need to be thought through and for that you need legal and tax advice .
This post addresses the lifecycle of founder agreements and the key compensation and control parameters in them .
A companion post suggests ten rules for building better founding teams .
Urban legends
Let ’s start by dispelling some myths :
There is a standard founder agreement .
Well , there is and there is n’t .
Every major law firm and every VC firm tends to have some type of template .
These templates can have meaningful variations , some of which are founder - friendly and some of which are not .
Most partners , be they lawyers or VCs , tend to tweak the standard with their own language .
Even if you are an experienced entrepreneur , you ’ve probably only seen a few founder agreements in your life .
Almost anyone can benefit from a great lawyer or an adviser who ’s seen dozens of these from different law & VC firms .

All founders have the same agreement .
Yes , it is convenient for all founder agreements to be based on the same template with the only difference being the number of shares .
Do n’t confuse a convenience with a requirement .
In the last four companies I ’ve co-founded , there were several founder agreement types .
In two cases this was because of the special role I played as a part - time co-founder .
In one case the CEO had a different vesting schedule because he had spent a lot more time than the rest of the founding team on the idea .
In another case , for good reasons , four founders had three meaningfully different agreement types .

Founder status == founder agreement .
Founding status can be bestowed on anyone .
That ’s a decision a founding team can make for many reasons .
As long as the decision is public and definitive , from an external perspective there is no issue .
This can be a convenient shortcut to separate someone ’s status ( founder ) from their role ( employee or contractor or advisor , etc. ) and the legal documents specifying its rights & responsibilities .
Which founder agreement ?
There are several critical points in a startup ’s life when founder agreements are put together .
There tend to be verbal agreements between founders for a period of time before anything is put to paper .
Lawyers tell me that in many cases verbal agreements are enforceable , especially if someone did work based on the verbal agreement .
It helps to communicate and set expectations clearly .
It also helps to have some discoverable record of the agreement .
An email would do .
At some point pre-incorporation , the founding team may create a written agreement , often in the form of a letter .
It outlines key points of agreement between founders around IP ownership , equity ownership , vesting , etc .
The FastIgnite one is two pages .
The goal of the letter is to be simple and readable so that everyone is comfortable and aligned on the main issues .
Perhaps the most important paragraph is the pre-formation agreement .
It requires the various parties to behave during incorporation in a way that effects the agreement .
It can be something along the lines of :
Pre-Formation Agreement .
If the addressee of this letter consists of one or more individuals , rather than a business entity , the individual (s ) , by his ( their ) signature (s ) below agree (s ) that they will cause any business entity formed by them within 24 months of the date of this letter agreement to conduct business in the Field of Interest to enter into an agreement with me identical to this letter agreement , whereupon this agreement shall become void .
If such individuals do not form a business entity to conduct business in the Field of Interest , but instead sell or assign their developments and technology in the Field of Interest to an unrelated party , I shall be entitled to [ this will vary based on the type of founder ] of the net consideration received by reason of such sale or assignment .
Pre-incorporation , removing a founder is complicated primarily by the potential lack of clarity around his or her rights and obligations and hence the consequences of the removal .
For example , without a clear vehicle ( a company ) to contribute intellectual property into , a founder who walks away may mean that the future company wo n’t own its own IP .
This is typically not a problem , unless the company becomes very valuable and the founder who walked away decides that she is owed something .
During incorporation , the couple of pages of this letter will be turned into somewhere between 20 and 50 pages of mostly boilerplate legalese .
The number of separate documents may vary but they fall into two categories :
Those related to equity , typically a restricted stock purchase agreement ( RSPA ) and associated escrow and other agreements .
Those related to other matters : IP assignment , invention disclosure , non-solicitation , non-competition , termination , etc .
At this point , there is a precise , well - defined legal framework for resolving conflicts that ca n’t be addressed through other means .
However , founder agreements are not set in stone and it is common for them to be tweaked by a little or a lot during the first financing by professional investors .
How to handle that or avoid it altogether is something I ’ll do a post on if there is interest .

Founder roles , agreements and removal strategies
Different founders contribute different assets and capabilities and can play multiple roles .
Their agreements tend to reflect this and , hence , the strategies for a founding team to remove these founders differ .
Note that investors have additional tools at their disposal but that ’s a separate topic .
Employee .
Compensation is a combination of cash ( post funding ) and common equity that is subject to vesting if professional investors are involved .
There is some up - front vesting acceleration .
The common number is 25 % but , depending on the length of time and contributed resources , it can be up to 50 % .
( See my post on the best vesting schedule . )
The rest of the equity typically vests monthly with no cliff for 3 - 5 years .
Founders have rights as shareholders .
They have voting rights which may entitle them to force or veto certain key decisions , e.g. , hiring or firing the CEO , selling the company , raising money , etc .
You need to understand the voting thresholds for key decisions and think very hard about whether you want to allow any one founder to have too much control .
If you are the lead founder , this may not be an issue but it should be an issue for the founding team as a whole .
Another issue to watch out for is any significant vesting acceleration on termination without cause outside of a change of control ( an exit ) .
A little bit is OK .
A lot is unreasonable .
Yet another issue is the price at which the company can repurchase unvested shares .
To make this cheap for the company , you want the price to be the par value of the shares .

Investor .
Founders who also invest get additional equity in the company with no vesting .
Some get common equity for their investment .
Smarter founders structure things such that they get preferred equity together with other investors .
The smartest founders who put money in their own businesses put it through a separate preferred class of stock before other investors come in .
As preferred shareholders they will have additional rights .
With the right legalese , even a small shareholding can exert a huge influence and make it near impossible to remove the founder .
The only way to remove their equity holding in the cap table is by buying them out or through a recapitalization of the company .
In this case you have to consider whether they are common or preferred holders and , in the latter case , their anti-dilution protection , pay - to - play provisions and willingness to participate in the recap financing .
A much better approach is to restructure their holding during an investment , at the point of maximum leverage .

Advisor .
The structure depends on the nature of the advisory work .
Very early on , if the equity ownership is small , the advisor equity may have no vesting .
An example would be when someone gives you an idea and you run with it without their involvement .
Typically , advisors tend to have shorter vesting periods ( one or two years ) .
If you like them and they have been helpful , you sign them up for another term .
Sometimes , the vesting is milestone - based ( upon the close of a financing ) or performance - based ( signing up customers , doing deals , recruiting ) .
Advisors tend to have 100 % acceleration on change of control .
Typical advisory agreements have simple termination clauses .
As long as that ’s the case , there should be no major issues in removing an advisor founder .

Service provider .
Like the advisor role , a service provider can do many different things .
The difference is that there is some type of cash component or cash equivalent value associated with the services .
There are multiple ways to handle this before the company has cash .
It can be deferred , with or without interest , to be paid after a financing or once revenues start coming in .
Alternatively , it can accrue into equity at some pre-defined price - per - share , usually the next round ’s , perhaps with a slight discount .
For example , you hire a consultant for five months at $ 10 K / mo and then you raise $ 500 K on $ 1.5 M pre .
For her services , the consultant will own common stock equal to $ 50 K / $ 2 M or 2.5 % of the fully - diluted capitalization of the company .
If equity compensation and vesting are aligned with how value is delivered , terminating a service provider founder should be no problem .

Board member .
Board members differ from other parties in that they are purposefully difficult to remove .
Therefore , they tend to worry less about vesting schedules .
Founder directors often get the same initial acceleration as employee founders .
They get 100 % acceleration on change of control .
Independent of shareholder rights considerations , whether it is easy or difficult to remove a founder board member depends on the rules of board composition .
Be wary of board seats by entitlement .
Rather than giving board seats to individuals , give them to ( groups of ) classes of equity and check whether the voting process does n’t automatically give any one founder the right to be the board member .
If a board member founder is not entitled to a seat , then there are various other processes described in the bylaws which may affect his removal .

Executive board member .
Typically , the agreement is a mash - up of a board member and a service provider agreement .
The usual role that fits this is a founding executive chairperson .
Initial vesting typically matches employee founders .
Further vesting accelerators are common , e.g. , on follow - on financings or the recruitment of a CEO .
The removal strategies are the same as for a board member .
The same person can be in multiple roles and may even have multiple agreements .
While there are no “ best founder agreement structures , ” just as there are no best vesting schedules , there are certain principles of approaching founder agreements that can be helpful in building stronger and more agile founding teams .

Let me know what you think in the comments or on Twitter @simeons .
The Republican National Committee spent tens of thousands of dollars last month on luxury jets , posh hotels and other high - flying expenses , according to new Federal Election Commission filings , including nearly $ 2,000 for " meals " at Voyeur West Hollywood , a nightclub featuring topless dancers simulating lesbian sex .
The RNC spent more than $ 17,000 on private jet travel in February as well as nearly $ 13,000 for limousines , according to the documents .
The GOP 's main political committee also ran up tabs at numerous posh hotels , including the Beverly Hills Hotel ( $ 9,000 ) ; the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons ( $ 6,600 ) and the W Hotel in Washington ( $ 15,000 ) , and spent more than $ 43,000 on its controversial midwinter meeting in Hawaii , not including airfare .
The disclosures create another spending controversy for the RNC and its chairman , Michael Steele , who has come under steady fire from Democrats and some fellow Republicans for his financial stewardship of the organization .
The RNC said in a statement Monday that it was investigating the Voyeur West Hollywood expenditure , which it said was " a reimbursement made to a non-committee staffer . "
The committee also said it was requesting that the money be returned and emphasized that Steele was not at the event .
" The chairman was never at the location in question , he had no knowledge of the expenditure , nor does he find the use of committee funds at such a location at all acceptable , " the RNC statement said .
The committee had more than $ 22 million on hand when Steele arrived last year , but is down to under $ 10 million now despite raising $ 96 million during that time , records show .
A previous dustup over Steele 's spending habits prompted party leaders to approve new restrictions requiring more oversight and competitive bidding for contracts over $ 100,000 .
The Daily Caller Web site , which first noted the new Federal Election Commission filings , also reported that Steele had initially suggested that the RNC should purchase a private jet for his travels after he first took over the job .
Steele 's spending habits have prompted angry complaints from wealthy GOP donors and party officials , who fear the chairman is making poor financial decisions and undercutting the GOP 's attempt to cast itself as the party of fiscal responsibility .
" Nothing surprises me , " said one former RNC aide , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
" It definitely speaks to the desire for first - class accommodations over there . "
The Feb. 4 expenditure of $ 1,946 at Voyeur West Hollywood is listed as " meals " on the RNC disclosure form .
Visitors to the chic nightspot have included Hollywood celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Leonardo DiCaprio ; press reports indicate the club is open to the public three nights a week and otherwise hosts private parties .
Few here last week knew many of those facts but that did not seem to matter .
The dancing and drumming was part of a natural rhythm of life that after nearly 10 centuries was as much about culture as it was about faith .

“ It ’s a festival of happiness ! ” shouted a cook , Muhamed Nadim , over the din , when asked what was being celebrated .
“ People feel comfort here . ”
Vast crowds of men walked barefoot , pushing past police barricades and vendors selling fabrics and sweets .
A neon sign advertising chicken with the words “ Chicks , Chicks , Chicks ” glowed in a second - floor window .
Underneath it , brightly lit bookstores remained open , their owners gazing out at the crowds .
One of them , Naeem Ashraf Rizvi , settled easily into a conversation with a foreigner about life in Pakistan .
The overwhelming majority of Pakistanis are Sufi , he explained , and despise violence inflicted by the more hard - line Deobandis , the school of thought that was supported by General Zia .
Last year was Pakistan ’s worst for militant attacks since 2001 , with the death toll more than triple what it was in 2006 .
“ Sufis have not spread terrorism , ” Mr. Rizvi said , his small daughter on his lap .
“ We are its victims . ”
The violence , he said , has damaged not only Pakistan , but also the reputation of Muslims , who he said “ are seen with suspicious gazes everywhere in the world . ”
Bob Barr , of all people , stands up for the White House :
The criticism has included such childishness as blasting Obama for waiting a few days before making a national speech on the incident .
For heaven ’s sake , the president was briefed on the incident from the moment it occured ; he made statements almost immediately indicating his concern and that he was being regularly briefed ; he took time to gather the facts and meet with his national security team ; and then he appeared publicly to give a rational , measured , but hard - hitting response .
And for this , a former vice president criticizes him .
The Watchmaker Argument
Hi friendly readers .
I know a lot of you may have many different beliefs and philosophies on life .
Now this is all well and good , but regardless of what beliefs you may hold , please , for the benefit of everyone , do not use the following argument .
You may have heard this argument before , as it comes in many forms .
It is often called the watchmaker argument , or the watchmaker analogy .
It has been described in many different ways by many people , but the basic idea is this :
Walking through a forest , you discover a watch lying on the ground .
Due to its complex nature , you assume it is designed by some intelligence .
Thus , by this reasoning , since life is even more complex , it must have also been designed by some intelligence . "
This statement does have an element of truth to it .
If you did not know what a watch was , and you were walking through a forest , and discovered one , you would probably correctly determine that it was designed by some intelligence .
This argument however , has many other problems , which I will soon discuss .
But first , l'd like to introduce you to Steve .
Steve is a professional hypothetical man , who conveniently has never seen a watch in his life .
Let 's put our hypothetical friend in our hypothetical forest , and see what he discovers ...
Steve has mistakenly raised a good point .
Trees , animals , even rocks all have varying levels of complexity .
So by the argument 's own admission , should n't the watch blend in with the " designed " forest around it ?
If we singled out the watch , would n't that mean that the watch is somehow more designed than the rest of the forest ?
Yet we likely would single out a watch in a forest .
So what leads us to single out the watch ?
Perhaps the answer is not complexity , but something far simpler .
Life occurs in nature .
It is self sustaining , has a mechanism for change and reproduction .
Watches , on the other hand , do not occur in nature , and do not have a mechanism for change or reproduction .
Watches for example , have not roamed the earth for millions of years reproducing and slowly changing over time .
Thank you Steve .
Let 's examine a more current use of this argument .
" Look at this camera .
It must be designed because of how complex it is .
Now look at the human eye .
Like the camera , it is also complex .
Thus , the human eye must have been designed . "
Firstly , one should note that regardless of whether or not the conclusion is true or false , the analogy itself is a logical fallacy .
Let 's take a look : 1 . A camera is complex , thus it is designed .
2 . The human eye is complex , thus it is designed .
This is a non sequitur .
Steve makes those all the time , let 's ask Steve .
Thank you Steve , this is a perfect example : 1 . A cupcake is colorful , thus it is delicious .
2 . A bird of paradise is colorful , thus it too is delicious .
In both of these analogies , we first describe some true feature of an object ( a camera is designed ; a cupcake is delicious ) .
We then try to come up with an explanation for this feature ( the camera 's complexity ; the cupcake 's color ) .
In both cases the explanation is not proven , yet we apply it to a different object anyway ( the eye , also complex , is designed ; a bird of paradise , also colorful , is delicious ) .
This brings us to the true nature of this argument .
Namely , if something is complex , it must be designed .
But is complexity really what makes an object designed ?
Steve 's assertion , however crude , is probably correct .
That bizarre rock formation is most likely designed .
Would you call that rock formation complex ?
Not especially .
Then what is it about this rock formation that makes it appear designed ?
Very simply , it is because rocks with that shape , and that arrangement do not occur naturally , and we have no natural mechanism to explain their arrangement other than chance .
Essentially , either someone put those rocks there , or they happened to fall that way .
Since the idea of someone placing those rocks in that formation is more plausible than chance , it 's reasonable to assume design in this case .
However , if these rocks were found on the moon ...
Exactly !
Finally , let us for the sake of argument , accept that the premise is true :
Anything that is complex , must be designed .
Would n't we then by our own premise , have to accept that the designer itself , which is complex by definition , must also be designed ?
It seems that the watchmaker argument , in the end , is self - defeating .
CLEVELAND , Ohio —
After turning the lights on in 1976 at Cleveland police headquarters , officials still can't shut them off .
Light switches were never installed .
That will change after the city pays consultants to install switches in parts of the nine - story building downtown and make energy improvements in other city buildings .
The cost for the entire project : $ 792,000 .
City officials said the work will be paid for with federal grants .
City Council 's Public Safety Committee this week passed an ordinance Wednesday to award contracts for the work .
The measure awaits a vote by the entire 19 - member council .
It costs about $ 1 million each year to light , heat and cool police headquarters , Safety Director Martin Flask said .
The city hopes to at least rewire two floors of the building so the lights can be turned off , Flask said .
" I do n't think there 's 15 light switches in that building , " Flask said .
Cleveland faces a $ 23 million deficit this year and is looking for ways to cut costs .
The 24 - hour lights are a stark contrast to Mayor Frank Jackson 's office .
He keeps the lights dark in his office because he has enough natural sunlight .
The move saves money and make others energy conscious , city officials said .
Flask did not want to speculate on why light switches were never installed when the building opened during Mayor Ralph Perk 's tenure in 1976 .
" I do n't know the logic , " he said .

If you build it , he will come , ” Ray Kinsella , the farmer in the 1989 film “ Field of Dreams , ” hears , mystically , as he walks through his cornfield .
So at seemingly ruinous cost , he razes the cornfield and builds a ball field , and is rewarded with an endless stream of ticket buyers stretching to the rural Iowa horizon .
In 2008 , the Chinese built a ball field — boy , what a ball field — known worldwide for its lattice - like architecture as the Bird ’s Nest .
Alas , after the 2008 Olympics , the ticket buyers have n’t come .
Right now , the Bird ’s Nest serves as a winter amusement park known as the Happy Ice and Snow Season .
In April , a promoter may stage a celebrity rock concert to “ establish China as a world leader for global peace and a healthier planet . ”
Or not .
After that , the government says it may build a shopping center there .
The accompanying photographs , shot at locales for the 2008 Beijing Olympics , succinctly depict the loneliness of where the long - distance runner once strode .
In a week when the United States contemplates how long its future will be spent deep in debt , they also hint at how much its greatest creditor is pinning its own hopes of building wealth on dreams .
After 15 years , one of the most successful names in Formula One returns to the grid with the launch of the Lotus T127 .
Note that we said " name , " not necessarily " team , " since Lotus F1 Racing is not officially affiliated with Group Lotus , the carmaker and engineering firm .
There is a somewhat tenuous relationship , since the team that began as Litespeed is largely backed by the Malaysian government , and Malaysian automaker Proton owns Lotus .
The team actually acquired the rights to the Lotus name for F1 racing purposes from David Hunt , brother of the late world champion , James Hunt .
While the team is new , it 's staffed by F1 vets , including technical director Mike Gascoyne and drivers Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen .
Lotus F1 Racing also operates out of the Racing Technology Norfolk ( RTN ) facility where the 2003 Le Mans- winning Bentley Speed 8 was developed and built .
There 's an upside to the relative lack of major sponsors for the reborn Lotus racing team : the car is liveried in the traditional green and yellow colors used up until the late 1960s .
Just as those late - '60s Lotus Type 49s introduced the Cosworth DFV to F1 , the T127 will be one of several cars using the latest Cosworth V8 this year .
Hopefully , things work out better than the last time we saw Lotus on the track .
Fans can follow the team at its new website , http://www.lotusracing.my .
There 's a video of the T127's first shakedown run at Silverstone after the jump .
[ Source : Lotus F1 Racing ] % Video - 1062 % Lotus Racing today unveiled its 2010 challenger , the Lotus Cosworth T127 , at a glittering event in London 's Royal Horticultural Hall .
Team Principal Tony Fernandes was joined on stage by Chief Technical Officer Mike Gascoyne and drivers Jarno Trulli , Heikki Kovalainen and Fairuz Fauzy to take the wraps off the car in front of a 500 strong live audience .
As the lights came up the car 's stunning green and yellow livery was seen for the first time , striking an emotional chord with both young and old alike and evoking memories of some of motor racing 's most iconic moments in an entirely contemporary fashion .
Tony Fernandes gave his thoughts on the astonishing achievement the Lotus Racing team has accomplished in launching the car just five short months since the team was granted its entry to the FIA Formula One World Championships , saying : " I am extremely proud to be here today and to be able to show the world the fruits of the team 's hard work over the last five months .
It 's humbling for me and my fellow shareholders , Kamarudin Meranun and SM Nasarudin to see how a team that five months ago did n't even exist is now a thriving workforce , full of enthusiasm and passion for Lotus Racing and the challenges ahead and capable of producing such a beautiful machine in such a short time .
" Now we 've achieved two major milestones ; confirming our entry and unveiling our car , but now the real work starts .
Next we move on to testing and the season ahead and I 'm confident that the team will exceed expectations wherever we go , and will do so on a wave of support around the world that has been growing daily since we first unleashed Lotus Racing back in September ' 09 .
" Mike Gascoyne added his thoughts , saying " The last few months have been some of the most challenging of my career , but it 's been a challenge the whole team and I have thrived on since we first started work on the car up in Norfolk .
I 'm delighted that we 've reached this point , and now we have a beautiful car that gives us a great base to work from for the season ahead and a fighting chance of going racing in the right way , with a winning mentality .
The hard part starts now , and I know everyone in the team and I are up for whatever lies ahead .
" The Lotus Racing T127 is powered by Cosworth and will use an Xtrac gearbox and , in line with all 2010 teams , will be running on Bridgestone tyres .
Late December saw the announcement that the A5/1 encryption technique used by GSM cellphones was vulnerable to a new attack , raising questions about how the cellular industry would respond .
There was some thought that the transition to 3G service , which is already well under way , could be relied on to limit the risk of attack , as 3G communications uses a different encryption system .
For anyone planning on that response , however , this week 's news is not so good : researchers have described an attack on 3 G 's KASUMI system that requires only a few hours on a typical PC .
The KASUMI system is based on an encryption technique called MISTY , which belongs to a general class of techniques called Feistel encryption .
These are rather complex , with multiple keys being combined , and a recursive , multiround encryption processes that alternates the order of different functions .
A sense of the complexity can be had by looking at the diagram on a page that describes it .
Unfortunately , a full MISTY encryption is apparently computationally expensive , making it less than ideal for an application where time and processing power are in short supply .
The KASUMI algorithm was developed specifically to simplify the MISTY system , and make it " faster and more hardware - friendly , " in the words of the new study 's authors .
Supposedly , the simplifications did n't reduce the security of the protocol , but the new research suggests otherwise .
The math behind the attack is rather complex but , distilled down , relies on sending multiple inputs through the encryption process that differ by known values , and look for pairs of pairs that show key similarities .
These similarities allow the authors to determine when related encryption keys are being used , and then identify some of the bits in these keys .
According to the paper , " our unoptimized implementation on a single PC recovered about 96 key bits in a few minutes , and the complete 128 bit key in less than two hours . "
That should meet almost nobody 's standard of secure .
[ UbuntuWomen ] Testimonials for the Ubuntu Women Project Leadership Position
Hi , On Thu , Jan 7 , 2010 at 10:22 PM , Matt Zimmerman < mdz at ubuntu.com > wrote : >
It 's my understanding that having the Community Council select a leader , as > opposed to having an election , is fairly unusual .
I do n't think there 's an > established process for how this works .
My reaction to this was the same as Matt 's and I 've raised it with the CC already , but I think it 's also worth clarifying here so that ( a ) any misunderstandings in the Ubuntu Women community are avoided , and ( b ) in case other teams are thinking of using this as a precedent .
I agree that this is unusual .
The CC will usually be involved in appointing team councils , but not team leaders .
The reason for that is that councils take delegated powers from the CC ( appointment of Ubuntu members , conflict resolution etc ) and therefore it's thought to be appropriate that the CC have involvement in those appointments .
The process set out on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation applies to such appointments .
However in the case of an ordinary community team ( artwork , documentation , marketing , translation , ubuntu - women , local community teams and so on ) the CC is n't involved in the appointment of any leader and the team is left to figure out their own processes and leadership , if indeed they wish to have a leader at all - many do n't .
For teams where a leader is appointed , I think my own expectations would be that they would be selected either by consensus of the whole team or by election within the team on which all participants in the team can vote .
This is the first instance that I can recall where the CC has been involved in the appointment of a leader in a community team , outside the team councils that I 've referred to above .
For that reason I agree with Matt that this is unusual .
The CC might become involved if there is a conflict about leadership within a particular team .
However , I do n't understand that to be the case here .
As I understand it , the CC has become involved in this through the specific request of the UW team .
I do n't quite understand what the reasons are but personally I do n't have a problem with the CC being involved , provided that it 's understood that its involvement was at the request of the UW team itself , and that the CC as a matter of principle does n't seek to impose its choice of leader on this or any other community team other than under the procedure set out in the Delegation document and in specific instances like this one .
So with that background , here are my answers to the specific questions Matt raised : >
Can you tell us a bit about how the CC will make their determination ?
Is it > fair to say that the expectations on >
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommunityCouncil/Delegation apply , as well as the > UW - specific material on >
http://wiki.ubuntu-women.org/UbuntuWomen/LeadershipNominationsProcess/January2010?
No , I do n't think the delegation page applies .
As far as I can see , the CC will simply try to select the best candidate for the job by evaluating the candidates wiki pages and looking at the UbuntuWomen wiki page . >
If the CC is making this choice on behalf of UW constituents , who will they > consider those constituents to be ?
I do n't think the choice is made on behalf of UW constituents , I think the CC is simply picking their preferred candidate .

Scientists have identified areas of the brain that , when damaged , lead to greater spirituality .
The findings hint at the roots of spiritual and religious attitudes , the researchers say .
The study , published in the Feb. 11 issue of the journal Neuron , involves a personality trait called self - transcendence , which is a somewhat vague measure of spiritual feeling , thinking , and behaviors .
Self - transcendence " reflects a decreased sense of self and an ability to identify one 's self as an integral part of the universe as a whole , " the researchers explain .
Before and after surgery , the scientists surveyed patients who had brain tumors removed .
The surveys generate self - transcendence scores .
Selective damage to the left and right posterior parietal regions of the brain induced a specific increase in self - transcendence , or ST , the surveys showed .
" Our symptom - lesion mapping study is the first demonstration of a causative link between brain functioning and ST , " said Dr. Cosimo Urgesi from the University of Udine in Italy .
" Damage to posterior parietal areas induced unusually fast changes of a stable personality dimension related to transcendental self - referential awareness .
Thus , dysfunctional parietal neural activity may underpin altered spiritual and religious attitudes and behaviors . "
Previous neuroimaging studies had linked activity within a large network in the brain that connects the frontal , parietal , and temporal cortexes with spiritual experiences , " but information on the causative link between such a network and spirituality is lacking , " explains lead study author , Urgesi said .
One study , reported in 2008 , suggested that the brain 's right parietal lobe defines " Me , " and people with less active Me-Definers are more likely to lead spiritual lives .
The finding could lead to new strategies for treating some forms of mental illness .
" If a stable personality trait like ST can undergo fast changes as a consequence of brain lesions , it would indicate that at least some personality dimensions may be modified by influencing neural activity in specific areas , " said Dr. Salvatore M. Aglioti from Sapienza University of Rome .
" Perhaps novel approaches aimed at modulating neural activity might ultimately pave the way to new treatments of personality disorders . "

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not be meeting United States President Barack Obama during his expected visit to the AIPAC Conference in the US in a few weeks , sources in the PM's Office confirmed Saturday .
The sources said a meeting will not be held because President Obama will not be in Washington at the time of Netanyahu 's visit .

A two - way street Yoram Ettinger Admiral Mullen 's visit reaffirms US - Israel ties based on mutual strategic interests , Yoram Ettinger says A two - way street
However , the two leaders are expected to meet in an international conference on nuclear terrorism to be held on April 12 of this year in Washington .
Meanwhile , officials at Netanyahu 's office expressed satisfaction over the findings of an annual Gallup poll published this week .
For the first time since 1991 , more than six out of every 10 Americans ( 63 % ) endorse Israel 's position rather than the Palestinian stance in respect to the Mideastern conflict .
' Leap in support not coincidental '
According to the poll , held at the beginning of the month , 15 % of Americans endorse the Palestinian side , while 23 % support both sides , neither side , or hold no opinion .
" The American public 's high - level support for Israel stems from a deep sense of the way and values shared by both nations , " a source at the PM's Office said .
" The leap in the support for Israel in the past year , to the highest rate in 20 years , is also not coincidental . "
A senior political source said he hopes that the American public 's " unequivocal support for Israel will make it clear to the Palestinians that they would do well to enter peace talks , and that it would be a shame for them to waste time in a futile wait for Israel 's diplomatic isolation in the US . "
An official in the PM's Office added : " Netanyahu , who is known by the American public for 30 years now , invested great efforts in explaining Israel 's policy in the US in recent months .
He had done so in his last three visits to Washington and New York , and he does it every week in meetings in Israel with Congress members and American public opinion leaders .
He also intends to do it in his upcoming trips to Washington in March and April . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon said on Monday it would expand secretive Special Operations units , deploy more unmanned aerial drones and increase aid to countries like Yemen to fight al Qaeda in a shift away from Cold War priorities .
In unveiling the Pentagon ’s proposed $ 708 billion budget for the 2011 fiscal year that begins in October , Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared that decades of Pentagon planning , focused on waging two major conventional wars at the same time , had been “ overtaken by events . ”
Faced with insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq , and growing al Qaeda safe havens in Yemen and Somalia , Gates said Pentagon war planners now faced “ a world where arguably the most likely and lethal threats will emanate from failed or fractured states . ”
“ We must prepare for a much broader range of security challenges on the horizon , ” he told reporters .
As part of the shift in priorities , Special Ops funding would grow by nearly 6 percent to $ 6.3 billion , enough to add up to 2,800 more elite troops and increase the military ’s “ irregular warfare ” capabilities , budget documents show .
The 2011 spending plan , subject to congressional approval , would also increase the number of advanced unmanned aerial aircraft , including single - engine Predator and Reaper drones , in war zones from 37 to 67 over the next two years .
Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said increasing flexibility was key in waging a successful counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan .
Documents show the Pentagon wants to set aside more than $ 1 billion in funding that could be doled out by local commanders to undercut the Taliban and increase support for the U.S. - backed government in Kabul .
In a counterinsurgency fight , Mullen said , these funds “ are faster , more precise and more impactful than bullets . ”

CYBER WARFARE
The Defense Department said it was also putting cyberspace on a par with land , sea , air and space as a potential conflict zone , and developing new ways to operate there , according to a top - level Pentagon strategy review .
It said the Defense Department was building a cadre of cyber experts to defend more than 15,000 different computer networks it operates across 4,000 military installations worldwide .
An alleged failed plot by a militant trained by Yemen - based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to blow up a U.S. airliner bound for Detroit on Christmas Day has increased support in Washington for stronger counterterrorism measures abroad .
The proposed 2011 budget calls for expanding the Pentagon ’s main publicly disclosed program for training and equipping security forces in countries like Yemen , from $ 350 million to $ 500 million , documents show .
Washington has quietly increased assistance to Yemen in the last two months , providing satellite and surveillance imagery , and intercepted communications to help the country ’s security forces carry out strikes on al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Critics say the internal security and intelligence services that could receive the support were major human rights abusers and that an expanded Pentagon role risked fueling anti-American sentiment and boosting al Qaeda ’s standing .
Yemen is expected to get at least $ 150 million in security assistance , but Pentagon officials did not offer a breakdown .
U.S. officials also said the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development would increase their funding for Yemen to $ 106.6 million from $ 67.3 million the previous year , with most of the rise for security .
Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew said the money would improve Yemen ’s air force intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance capability , fund counter - terrorism training for its security forces and offer support for the country ’s coast guard , border guard and special operations forces .
2009 was a bad year , but it was nt 1933
---------
With another 85,000 net jobs lost in December and the unemployment rate still at 10 percent , some in Washington are calling for additional measures to stimulate the economy .
But what makes anybody think additional government spending will be any more effective than the hundreds of billions Washington already has spent ?
I have no desire to minimize the severity of unemployment or the hardship it causes .
Most of us have had to deal with it at some time .
But the statistics also provide a lot of wiggle room for manipulation and mischief .
Since 1940 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) has provided a variety of information on the populations employment status , derived from the Current Population Survey , a complicated monthly random sample of approximately 60,000 households used to compute various measures of the unemployment rate .
For the past two months , for example , the rate designated U - 3  total unemployed , as a percent of the civilian labor force ( official unemployment rate ) has stood at 10 percent .
In October , it was 10.2 percent .
Those official unemployed are basically those who are not working but have attempted to find a job in the past four weeks .
The broadest measure of unemployment is  U - 6.  BLS defines this as total unemployed , plus all marginally attached workers , plus total employed part time for economic reasons , as a percent of the civilian labor force plus all marginally attached workers .
This rate stands at 17.3 percent .
Theres more to the story .
A note attached to the BLS research explains :  Marginally attached workers are persons who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the recent past .
Discouraged workers , a subset of the marginally attached , have given a job - market - related reason for not looking currently for a job .
Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available for full - time work but have had to settle for a part - time schedule . 
One doesnt need to devote a lifetime to studying how these statistics are defined and measured to realize that they tend to overstate unemployment .
For example , people designated U - 3 or officially unemployed can have taken any number of actions to qualify as having actively sought a job over the past four weeks , including ( 1 ) contacting : an employer directly or having a job interview ; a public or private employment agency ; friends or relatives ; a school or university employment center ; ( 2 ) sending out resumes or filling out applications  ; ( 3 ) placing or answering advertisements  ; ( 4 ) checking union or professional registers ; and ( 5 ) some other means of active job search . 
So , if you are out of work and tell CPS data collectors that three weeks ago you asked Uncle Charlie whether he knew of any jobs , you qualify as officially unemployed .
Many of those classified as marginally attached workers  and included in the U - 6 measure are even more questionable .
After all , they admit they are neither working nor actively searching .
Merely saying they want and are available for a job  but have looked though not in a month , doesnt show much interest in employment .
Many commentators have insisted from the onset of the recession that we have plunged into a second Great Depression .
The evidence so far does not confirm such severity .
By taking an extremely loose view of what constitutes unemployment , we can say that perhaps one worker in six is out of work .
But in 1933 , the official unemployment rate was nearly 25 percent , and perhaps another 25 percent of the labor force was made up of persons working part - time who wanted full - time work .
So the U - 6 rate then was close to 50 percent .
Last year may not have been the best of years , but it was miles away from 1933 .

Daniel Harlan , a slight man with a wispy beard going gray , is just another face in the crowd in San Francisco .
He is homeless , a street panhandler .
Most people would n't give him a second glance except for his constant companion , a pug- nosed Himalayan cat named Samantha .
The cat made him stand out among panhandlers .
Now the cat is gone .
Stolen , Harlan thinks .
Harlan is 58 .
He has had a tough life :
You can see it on his face , and the cat is probably his only friend in the world .
" It 's the only thing he really cares about , " said Harlan 's brother , Stephen Kent , a rancher who lives in Oklahoma .
Somebody took Harlan 's cat Friday from a homeless encampment under a freeway off - ramp near Eighth and Harrison streets .
Harlan had gone off to buy some food for himself and Samantha at a nearby store with money he 'd gotten panhandling .
He left the cat on a leash tied to his tent .
" Somebody just untied the leash and took her , " he said Monday .
" I was only gone for a few minutes , and when I got back she was gone . "
Harlan went looking for the cat in the area , and when he returned after a while , somebody had made off with his battered tent , too .
He went to the police , but they had no time to search for a homeless man 's cat .
He went to the SPCA , too , and the animal control shelter .
No luck .
Nobody had seen Samantha .
She 's easy to recognize : gray , short hair and a pug nose ; the cat looks like it ran into a wall .
" There 's only one like it in San Francisco , " Harlan said .
Samantha and Harlan had their brief moment in the spotlight when Chronicle photographer Mike Kepka took their picture for a story about Market Street , and it ran on SFGate .
Harlan came to The Chronicle for help Monday .
He hopes somebody might see the cat 's picture in the paper or on SFGate and help bring her back .
" I bet somebody stole her to sell her for money , " he said .
" She 's a very expensive cat .
I paid $ 2,200 for her back in Oklahoma , back when I had money nearly four years ago .
" She is leash - trained , " he said , " She 's not afraid of dogs and she 's friendly with people .
She keeps me calm , and she helps me out , " he said .
" She 's with me 24/7 . "
Harlan is originally from around Muskogee , Okla . , and used to work in construction in Oklahoma and Texas .
He did OK , but his luck turned bad when he bought a big motor home hoping to move around the country .
" But it broke down , " he said , " I got it fixed and it broke down some more .
I had to sell it for $ 500 . "
He said he bought an old pickup truck , but it broke down , too .
" Every mechanic in the world took advantage of him , " said his brother , Kent .
Harlan and Samantha stayed with Kent for a while , then headed to California .
" I told him , they got hard times there , too , " Kent said .
" But he was in California before and he wanted to go back . ''
It 's on old , sad story .
" He 's a pretty good guy , just down on his luck , " said Kent .
" He used to drink , but not anymore .
That cat keeps him calm .
He 's a good cat , very smart . "
Harlan gets about $ 975 a month from Social Security ; the rest he gets from the kindness of strangers .
He has a sleeping bag and a cell phone ; even homeless people have cell phones these days .
His number is ( 415 ) 724-0095 .
" I 'll give a reward , " Harlan said .
" I will . "
The Defense Department has moved to lift a decades - old policy that prohibits women from serving aboard U.S. Navy submarines .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates notified Congress in a letter signed Friday that the Navy intends to repeal the ban on female sailors on subs .
At issue is the end of a policy that kept women from serving aboard the last type of ship off - limits to them .
The thinking was that the close quarters aboard subs would make service by both sexes difficult to manage .
Congress has 30 days to weigh in .
A defense official told the Associated Press that numerous physical changes to submarines would have to be made but that cadets who graduate from the Naval Academy this year could be among the first Navy women to take submarine posts .

US administration to block vote on Turkey ' genocide '
The vote of the US committee sparked outrage in Turkey The Obama administration has said it will seek to block a controversial bill describing as genocide the World War I killing of Armenians by Turks .
A congressional panel on Thursday approved the resolution , paving the way for a possible vote by the House .
But US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the administration would " work very hard " to prevent this .
Turkey voiced strong protests after the vote and recalled its ambassador from Washington for consultations .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country had been accused of a crime it did not commit , adding the resolution would harm Turkish - US relations .
President Abdullah Gul said Turkey - a key Nato ally of the US - would " not be responsible for the negative results that this event may lead to " .
Change of position Mrs Clinton - who had urged the House Foreign Affairs Committee not to hold the vote - said on Friday : " We are against this decision .
Now we believe that the US Congress will not take any decision on this subject . "
MASS KILLINGS OF ARMENIANS
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians killed by Ottoman Turks in 1915 - 6 Many historians and the Armenian people believe the killings amount to genocide Turks and some historians deny they were orchestrated More than 20 countries regard the massacres as genocide
Media ask :
What next for vote ?
Firm ties will survive genocide row Q&A : Armenian genocide dispute
The resolution - approved by 23 votes to 22 by the committee - calls on President Barack Obama to ensure that US foreign policy reflects an understanding of the " genocide " and to label the killings of Armenians as such .
A similar resolution was approved by the same committee two years ago , but did not go forward to the House after pressure from the George W Bush administration .
Turkey is a major partner in US efforts to stabilise Afghanistan and Iraq , and lies on a key route taking oil and natural gas to Western markets .
Ankara accepts that atrocities were committed but argues they were part of the war and that there was no systematic attempt to destroy Christian Armenians .
During his campaign for the 2008 election , Mr Obama promised to brand the mass killings genocide .
Mrs Clinton has acknowledged his administration 's change of opinion on the issue , saying circumstances had " changed in very significant ways " .
In October last year , Turkey and Armenia signed a historic accord normalising relations between them after a century of hostility .
Armenia wants
Turkey to recognise the killings as an act of genocide , but successive Turkish governments have refused to do so .
Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died in 1915 , when they were deported en masse from eastern Anatolia by the Ottoman Empire .
They were killed by troops or died from starvation and disease .
Armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognised internationally as genocide - and more than 20 countries have done so .

Rajinder Singh is flicking through the Pakistani channels on his Sky box from his sofa in Wellingborough , Northamptonshire .
Dressed in a crimson turban , he sits a metre from the ­enormous screen , translating the odd phrase for my benefit .
He 's trying to show me why he 's determined to join the British National Party – the only party he considers " brave " enough to " break out of the burkha called ­political correctness " .
Last year , the Equality and ­Human Rights Commission forced the BNP to change its constitution on the grounds that restricting membership to ­" indigenous Caucasians " broke the Race Relations Act .
A new constitution is expected to be agreed at a party meeting this Sunday , and if it 's amended both Singh and the BNP think he would be ideal as the party 's first non-white ­recruit .
Communications and campaigns ­officer Martin Wingfield has personally endorsed him on his blog , calling for the party to " adapt and survive and give the brave and loyal Rajinder Singh the honour of becoming the first ethnic minority member " .
Singh is a 78 - year - old Sikh , a retired primary school teacher and a father of two , who left India for the UK in 1967 .
He says he 's been loyal to the BNP since he first heard BNP leader Nick Griffin on television in late 2001 .
" He used the word ' Islam ' .
And I thought , ' He 's brave , he has conviction , ' " Singh says .
" I thought , ' It 's amazing what you 've said : I 've always been thinking that , since my childhood . ' "
He wrote Griffin letters of support and eventually provided him with a character reference at his 2005 trial for inciting racial hatred .
Singh has voted for the BNP in every local and general election since discovering them .
" I could n't keep away . "
It feels strange to hear these words from a man in a turban , but Singh ­admits he 's only wearing it for my ­benefit .
He 's not a religious man and is clean shaven , but he wore a turban the first time he ever had " media exposure " – on BNPTV , the party 's online ­channel – and has decided to do so whenever speaking to the media because " the message carries more weight " coming from a turban - wearing Sikh .
His " message " is simple and ­depressingly familiar : he fears that Britain is becoming an Islamic republic , and Islam is dangerous .
" Most of them behave very nicely , but suddenly when they get together in the mosque and ­listen to the preaching , they acquire a collective identity that is formidable .
It 's the collective being that frightens me . "
Islamophobia is not uncommon among Hindu and Sikh immigrants , but Singh 's personal history makes his all the more acute .
Born in West Punjab in 1931 , he witnessed the violence of Indian partition firsthand .
Millions of Sikhs , Hindus and Muslims were killed during partition , his father among them , murdered when Singh was only 15 .
He lays the blame squarely with Muslims .
Why does n't he blame the British , the architects of partition ?
­" Britain had a role to play , " he concedes , " but the violence sprang from the Koran .
The Muslim answer to reasoned argument is knife , dagger and bomb . "
This thinking gives Singh an affinity with even the most diehard BNP ­members .
He 's been to several party meetings and says he never feels awkward in their company .
" They treat me normally , " he insists .
" I feel at home . "
I ask if he thinks many BNP members can tell the difference between Sikhs , Hindus and Muslims .
" They might think of me as a Paki , " he replies .
" I 've had people shout ' Paki Go Home ! ' when I walk down the street .
But that speaks much about the ' Paki ' reputation – it's a negative reaction to Pakistan . "
When it comes to BNP policy , Singh knows what he 'll be endorsing with his membership .
He thinks voluntary ­repatriation in exchange for cash would be " something excellent , something supreme " because only those who are truly loyal to the UK would choose to stay here rather than take the money .
When I ask about BNP plans to give " native Britons " preference in the job market , he says this has always been unofficially the case , and spelling it out in law wo n't make any real difference to the lives of people such as him .
Are n't the BNP racist , I ask ?
" Pre-amendment , yes , " he replies .
" They are trying to soften up .
Should n't the nation welcome that ?
It 's a positive move if they get people like me , and if I 'm sitting in a BNP meeting they wo n't say ' Throw all of them out ' because they 'll realise one of ' them ' is among ' us ' . "
But the BNP were forced to extend their membership beyond " indigenous Caucasians " , they did n't choose to .
Surely they still feel the same about non-whites ?
" Initially the child is forced to go to school , then it becomes his habit , and then he voluntarily goes when he sees the point of it , " says Singh .
Fellow Sikhs have shunned him , but Singh thinks they are misguided .
" Every Hindu and Sikh comes from a country that was a victim of Islamic aggression , " he says .
" Every Hindu and Sikh should be praising the BNP and thanking God that something has appeared that may guarantee that this country is not overwhelmed . "
The BNP are hungry for a more ­acceptable face , and they recognise Singh may be the perfect person to provide it : he 's an articulate man with a readily exploitable , deep - seated bitterness .
It 's clear to me that they 've used him whenever they 've needed to appear legitimate – at Griffin 's trial , and now that they face legal action if they fail to change their constitution .
" I may be being exploited , " Singh says , " but there 's a good underlying cause .
They will be diluted . "
Then he smiles .
" All parties use people .
If they do n't , they will fail . "
Will the BNP let non-whites join ?
If it helps them exploit hatred , yes
So this is where it gets interesting .
Will Rajinder Singh , with his strategically worn turban and his visceral hatred of Muslims , become the all - new face of the BNP ?
The Sikh has been used for PR purposes , but will the core membership welcome him ?
He is change , but is he the change they want ?
We 'll know a bit more on Sunday when the BNP membership votes on whether it will acquiesce to the demands of the Equality Commission and accept applications from those of all races and ethnic backgrounds .
Logic says they will .
But when was the far right and its ragbag ever logical ?
If it all goes well for Singh , he wo n't be the first oddball to sit uneasily within the ranks of Nick Griffin 's followers .
Pat Richardson , a senior BNP councillor in Epping , Essex , is Jewish and it does n't bother her that co-adherents do a nice line in anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial .
" I distinguish between my Jewishness , which is a religion , and my support for the BNP , which is purely political , " she has explained .
In Barking , we see Laurence Rustem , who is half Turkish .
He 's OK , because in the words of one of the party 's former election candidates , he is only " half a wog " .
And it 's the half that is n't that counts .
The weekend vote could change much for Singh , but it will also be crucial for Griffin , who sees genuine opportunity if he can only persuade the members to re-brand their party , however superficially , as rightwing but not obviously racist .
It 's the old dilemma ; ideological purity v electability .
It is his hunch that there are enough people disgruntled with other groups of people to make a recast BNP quite popular , and there might be something in that .
Go on to the streets and listen to the white English complaining about the Poles , the Poles being rude about the Russians , black Britons carping about Asians , Hindus being disrespectful of Bangladeshis , Singh and his ilk getting stuck into the Muslims .
We live on the thin line between love and hate and given the chance , Griffin – still the extremist but ever the pragmatist – would site his party there and exploit those differences rather than defy the law and face oblivion .
But that was n't what much of the membership signed up to .
Tricky .

Boocock was told he is likely to serve much longer than the minimum term A 19 - year - old man has been given an indeterminate jail sentence for the kidnap and rape of an 86 - year - old woman in a Bradford care home .
A judge at Bradford Crown Court told Dale Boocock , from the Woodside area of the city , his crime was " appalling " .
Boocock , who admitted rape and kidnap , was told he would serve a minimum of four years and nine months .
The elderly woman was assaulted at a home in the Buttershaw area of Bradford in the early hours of 15 September .
She needed hospital treatment at the time of the attack and has since died of natural causes .
The court heard Boocock had been on bail for a series of house burglaries at the time of the attack .
Whatever the cause of death was , her prognosis deteriorated rapidly as a result of what you did that night and she died two months later
Recorder Colin Burn
The judge , Recorder Colin Burn , said Boocock would probably serve " very much longer " than the minimum sentence .
He said the defendant posed a significant risk to the public , particularly vulnerable people .
He told him : " You were released on police bail for September 13 matters and you went on to commit other offences of rape and kidnap , perpetrated against an elderly , infirm and extremely vulnerable victim living in nursing accommodation .
" You had no thought for her whatsoever .
You forcibly removed her from her bed , you dragged her outside at night into the garden , causing her injury , and you raped her outside , leaving her in dreadful distress and unrest on the ground .
" I have no doubt that , whatever the eventual cause of death was , her prognosis deteriorated rapidly as a result of what you did that night and she died two months later . "
' Beyond belief ' Det Ch Insp Jon Hoyle , of West Yorkshire Police , said : " Dale Boocock has been sentenced to imprisonment after pleading guilty to the kidnap and rape of an 86 - year - old lady , the circumstances of which can only be described as vile and beyond belief .
" The only consolation I can offer the family is that Boocock was arrested soon after the offence and has been dealt with by the courts quickly and he will remain in prison for a very long time .
" However , this will never make up for the loss of a wife , a mother , a grandmother , great grandmother and friend , after she tragically passed away just seven weeks after the incident .
" During my short involvement with this family it became apparent that she was a very special person to many . "
Anchor Homes , which owns the Bradford care home , welcomed Boocock 's sentence .
Area manager Louise Gibson said : " Following the attack , we organised counselling sessions for staff at the home and we extended this help to residents .
" We spoke to the next of kin of every resident , offering them support and reassurance and the opportunity of individual meetings with them , and we are continuing to do so . "

Artist : Bertell
Track : Beat It Up
Producer : Bryan - Michael Cox
Album : Goin Hard
For those who have exhausted the possibilities offered by the Kama Sutra , new Capitol Records signee Bertell 's here to suggest a few new ways to – ahem – Beat It Up .
On the second half of his current dual single ( released along with hit Bun B collabo She Bad ) , the Booth newcomer lets listeners know know just how sexually adventurous he is , inviting a female to try out the “ VIP position ” in the club bathroom before enjoying a little white - knuckle action on the way back to his place .
Getting it in while rocketing down the freeway at 80 miles per hour may be a really , really bad idea , but Bertell spins the potentially life - threatening scenario into one crowd - pleasing R&B - pop jam , showcasing his smooth vocal stylings over Bryan - Michael Cox ' uniquely seductive mix of glittering synths and warm strings .
If Beat It Up has you screaming , “ Ey , ey , ey , ey , ey ey ! ” well , your first order of business should probably be a cold shower – but after that , you 'll definitely want to keep it locked for the latest on Bertell 's Goin Hard LP , currently set to hit stores in spring of next year .

The Government is being urged to lift GST to 15 per cent and impose a property tax to create room for big cuts to personal income and company tax rates .
In a report labelling the current tax system broken , a Government ordered inquiry into the tax system says the burden for paying tax is falling disproportionately on workers who do n't receive working for Families benefits while the wealthiest earners are avoiding tax by shifting income into trusts , rental properties and other savings vehicles .
But its recommendations are likely to be controversial and include :
* Raising GST from its current 12.5 per cent rate to 15 per cent ;
* Collecting more tax from rental properties by setting an assumed rate of return which would stop investors claiming big losses as they do currently ;
* Introducing a land tax , to be levied on all property
* Removing the 20 per cent depreciation loading on plant and equipment
* Removing tax depreciation on buildings if evidence shows they do not depreciate in value
* Changing the rules surrounding tax on foreign owned companies .
The measures would be balanced by lowering the top rate of tax to at least 33 per cent - down from 38 per cent currently .
There would also be compensation to beneficiaries and superannuitants for the higher cost of buying products and services due to the rise in GST .
The Government has so far been lukewarm on the prospect of a property tax but has not ruled out a rise in GST and seems certain to proceed with measures targeting property investors .
The Government delayed its second round of tax cuts last year because of the recession but today Finance Minister Bill English raised expectations when commenting on the recommendations out this afternoon .
" The Government certainly has an interest in them ( cuts ) , " Mr English told reporters .
" We need a package that raises about the same revenue as it does now .
We do n't have the luxury of the previous tax package where you could give away revenue , so if we give any away it has to come from somewhere else . "
He also signalled lowering the company tax .
" The ideal is ( Australians ) are following us - not us following them - so let 's see if we can achieve that . "
TAX WORKING GROUP
The Tax Working Group , headed by academic Bob Buckle , was set up with the support of the Government to look at ways to bring the top personal , corporate and trust rates together .
Professor Buckle said the group 's initial intention had been to put out a short report on its findings but " it grew " .
Its final report today is more than 70 pages long .
He said the group had concluded New Zealand 's tax system was broken and urgently needed fixing .
" The group 's strong view is that reform is necessary if New Zealand is to have a fair tax system that minimises the costs of raising taxes , reduces barriers to productivity and growth and positions it well for future challenges . "
It found that :
* New Zealand relied heavily on the taxes most harmful to growth , particularly corporate and personal income taxes ; there was a major hole in the tax base concerning the taxation of capital and Working for Families created very high effective marginal tax rates .
* The tax system also lacked coherence , integrity and fairness - the income tax burden was disproportionately borne by PAYE taxpayes since many with wealth could restructure their affairs to shelter income from taxes or to enable people to receive social support
* There were significant risks to its sustainability because of international competition for capital and labour , especially from Australia .
CAUTIOUS RESPONSE
Mr English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne responded cautiously to the major recommendations in the report .
" The Government 's focus in 2010 is increasing New Zealand 's economic growth and productivity , " Mr English said .
" There is no doubt that good tax policy can play a role in that . "
" For ordinary New Zealanders , we 're particularly keen to ensure that our tax system rewards effort , encourages savings and helps families to get ahead . "
The Government also wanted a tax system that helped move the country away from its recent preoccupation with borrowing and consumption .
But any changes would have to be " fiscally neutral " - meaning that revenue would have to be found somewhere else within the tax system if personal taxes were cut - because the Government still faced several years of budget deficits .
Mr English said the group 's report was one of several reviews the Government would be considering in the lead - up to the May budget .
Mr Dunne said he shared the working group 's concerns about the incentives for wealthier individuals to shelter income in trusts and companies .
" This is inherently unfair to the wage and salary earner who is then left to bear a disproportionate share of the personal tax burden . "
He was also concerned about the manipulation of family income in some instances to obtain Working for Families tax credits .
" There is growing evidence that trusts and companies , and highly geared residential rental properties , are being used to reduce taxable income and so qualify for Working for Families .
" Such abuse potentially places an unfair burden on the 60 per cent of families who do not receive Working for Families tax credits . "
TAX BALANCE
The top 10 per cent of income earners now pay 44 per cent of all personal income tax , the working group has found .
The group says the burden on high income earners is even higher once those on Working for Families , New Zealand Superannuation and other benefits are included .
Under that scenario , the top 10 per cent of taxpayers shoulder 76 per cent of the tax burden .
It said that the effect of Working for Families , which distributes state - funded benefits to families with children , was that many who received it effectively paid no income tax at all .
Personal income tax makes up the lion 's share of revenue collected by the Government - income taxes account for $ 28.5 billion or 53 per cent of all tax revenue , company taxes make up 17 per cent , GST raises 21 per cent of all tax revenue and excise duty such as petrol and tobacco taxes raised a further $ 4.8 billion or 9 per cent of all tax revenues .

There are numbers in sports and then there are numbers in sports .
56 . Joe DiMaggio .
88 . UCLA basketball .
8. Michael Phelps .
18 . Jack Nicklaus .
100 . Wilt Chamberlain .
511 . Cy Young .
38,387 . Kareem Abdul - Jabbar .
( We 'll leave 73 , 70 , 66 and 762 out of the conversation for obvious reasons . )
You do n't need me to tell you if we 're talking about hits , or gold medals , or majors , or points , or wins , or homeruns .
You already know .
Kobe Bryant already owns one of these iconic numbers thanks to that January night four years ago when he hung 81 points on the Toronto Raptors .
Now he owns another .
Bryant reached 25,000 career points on Thursday , a staggering total that just 14 other players have reached in the 63 - year history of the NBA , with a free throw in the second quarter against Cleveland .
" That 's what I do best , " Bryant said on Sunday .
" Steve Nash is a great passer , I 'm a great scorer .
It 's what I do . "
It 's what he does oh so well .
With flair and pizzazz .
With precision and panache .
With first - quarter free throws and fourth - quarter game winners .
From darn - near half court against Miami and from literally behind the backboard against Oklahoma City .
On the block and on the wing .
A pull - up jumper off the glass and a spin move into a finger roll .
While the rest of his peers in the league are racking up followers on Twitter , he is amassing points .
He scores .
Always has .
Always will .
" I think it just came easiest to me because , at an early age [ when I was ] five or six years old , I could put it in my left hand , put it in my right and that age , if you can go left against those kids it 's like shooting fish in a barrel , " Bryant said about his earliest scoring memories .
" I just became more curious about it the better I got at it all the way until now . "
" This is a guy that uses the open floor well , " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said when asked to sum up Bryant 's offensive assault .
" He knows how to post up .
He drives .
He can shoot it -- he increased his shooting range and capabilities over the years .
He finds a way to score .
It 's not the most important thing but he knows it carries a lot of weight .
He has the invincibility idea that there 's no one out there that can stop him [ … ] he carries that attitude with him . "
Pau Gasol also praised Bryant 's mentality .
More and more Americans have come to believe that gay , lesbian and bisexual people should be able to serve openly in the military without punishment , a new poll released by the Center for American Progress revealed this week .
The poll showed that 54 percent of Americans favor repealing the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” law passed by Congress in 1993 .
A mere 35 percent oppose a repeal .
More than two - thirds of self - identified Democrats , 55 percent of independents , and more than four in ten Republicans support allowing gays , lesbians and bisexuals to openly serve .
Strong majorities both in House districts believed to be in serious contention for the 2010 elections and in states with competitive Senate races support repealing the 17 - year old law .
A diversity of demographic groups support the repeal , the survey also showed .
Some 64 percent of Catholics , 61 percent of white married women , and 59 percent of whites aged 50 - 64 support overturning the law .
The survey suggested that improved attitudes towards gay , lesbian and bisexual people over the past few years have contributed mainly to the changes in public opinion about open military service .
Similar polls conducted for CBS / New York Times and Fox News showed similar majority support for repealing the law .
Polls of military service members show that large majorities are comfortable with open service by gays , lesbians and bisexuals .
According to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network , as many as 65,000 gay , lesbian and bisexual men and women serve in the military .
More than 12,000 have been expelled from service as a result of the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy .
Pollsters connected with the White House in 1994 believed that President Clinton ’s support for what was at the time considered a liberalization of military policy on this issue contributed to the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress .
Ruy Texiera of the Center for American Progress told reporters that he believes people ’s feelings about the issue have shifted dramatically since the 1990s .
“ I think it ’s kind of an open and shut case in the court of public opinion based on our and other data , ” he said .
Stanley Greenberg , of Greenberg , Quinlan , Rosner Research , the polling firm that gathered the data , agreed .
“ I think people have moved to a different place on tolerance , they ’ve moved to a different place on the role of the military … and want to see this policy reversed . ”
Leading voices in the military community have urged repeal of the law , further suggesting how far even the military has come on the issue .
Earlier this month former Chair of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Colin Powell expressed his support for changing the law , as did current Chair Adm .
Mike Mullen .
National Security Advisor James Jones , a former Marine General , also urged repeal of the law .
Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said , “ The truth is that there are no more excuses , the death knell for Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell has been rung and now is the moment to send this law into the history books where it belongs . ”
Congress could pass the repeal as part of its Department of Defense authorization bill later in the year .

FETÖ suspects with forged papers nabbed in Greece
Greek police on Sept. 30 detained five members of the Fetullah Terrorist Organization ( FETÖ ) , the group behind the 2016 defeated coup in Turkey , for forgery in the capital Athens , according to the local media .
Five years of exhaustive research has yielded the key to thwarting “ the most dangerous animal on the planet : ” its nose .
Scientists at two American universities have pulled apart the 70 different and distinct receptors that work in a mosquito ’s nose , or antennae , and let the insects navigate a deadly accurate course for human flesh .
The discovery represents a major advance in the all - out war by scientists around the world and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to eradicate malaria .
“ This is a significant , quantum leap forward , ” Laurence Zwiebel , professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , told the Star on Tuesday .
The Zwiebel lab has been working closely on mosquito research with the lab of John Carlson at Yale University .
Their findings have just been published in the journal Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Mosquitos “ have evolved so elegantly and so efficiently into truly the most dangerous animal on the planet , ” responsible for killing millions of people with malaria , he said .
Will the discovery ever turn into a drugstore bug repellent ?
That ’s part of the whole plan , said Zwiebel .
Money from commercial repellents , which would be created by the private sector , would help pay for spreading the protective net in the developing world , he said .
What this most recent research has done is figure out that the “ extraordinarily complex and highly specialized 70 receptors work together ” in a mosquito to sniff out their human targets .
“ They can find and choose a person many , many metres away , flying upwind , no less , ” said Zwiebel .
( By comparison , humans have 600 receptors or more ) .
Once receptors were found , the scientists then had to figure out how to “ hyper- excite or block ” them with a new kind of repellent or attractant .
“ We throw the kitchen sink at it , ” said Zwiebel .
“ We ’ll test 100,000 different things to find the one that makes the receptor so crazy , the mosquito will go away . ”
Field tests in Kenya and Ghana are verifying the discoveries , with the idea of creating “ no - fly zones ” in buildings .
Malaria “ is truly a Biblical disease that has been around forever .
We ’re using 21st century technology and are on the cusp of what previous generations have never been able to do . ”
Will science and Gates Foundation money eradicate malaria in Zwiebel ’s lifetime ?
“ Yeah , I do think we have a pretty good shot .
This is a real world issue .
Part of our agreement is that the profit has to be used to provide access to this material in the developing world . ”
Vanderbilt scientists transplanted the receptors into frog eggs ;
Yale scientists into fruit flies .
In both cases , the results create a medium that researchers can more easily work with , said Zwiebel .
“ I look at mosquitos now as a truly beautiful machine that has perfected what they do .
They sleep , they probably dream and they are not stupid little insects .
They learn . ”

Somali mother of four has no right to live here ... but we have to give her a council house
Standing proudly with her arm draped over her 36in television , this is the Somali woman who must be given a council house even though she has no right to live in Britain .
Nimco Hassan Ibrahim - who lives with her four children on benefit handouts - was granted the right to the home by EU judges yesterday because she was once married to a Danish citizen who briefly worked in this country .
The landmark judgment means the 34 - year - old migrant and her children will soon be packing up their impressive collection of furniture and electrical equipment when they are given a new house .
Funded by the taxpayer : Nimco Ibrahim and her children will soon be moving their 36 - inch TV to a state - subsidised home
Although Miss Ibrahim claims her income support payments were suspended during the legal action , she has somehow bought a Playstation 3 games console , computer and a high - quality speaker system .
Equally impressive is the enormous sofa from which she watches TV each night .
Lying on the floor in her lounge are some of the latest film releases - including a pirate DVD copy of the sci - fi movie Avatar .
And although she lives in a temporary accommodation in Harrow , Middlesex - funded by the local council - she has managed to install a high - speed internet connection .
Speaking to the Daily Mail last night , Mrs Ibrahim said : ' I deserve to be given a proper house .
This one is too small for all of us .
Ruling : The European Court of Justice has said Miss Ibrahim is entitled to benefits in the UK as she is the primary carer of the child of a migrant worker
' I do n't think it 's fair that the council has put us up in temporary accommodation .
It 's not right that they have hounded us for four years .
All these threats of eviction have made me feel very ill .
' The law says that I can get a better house so I 'm looking forward to a better life .
' I have suffered psychological problems because of all this .
' To be honest , I was expecting the worst from the court and I 'm relieved it has ended .
Now I can enjoy my life .'
Mrs Ibrahim does not work and spends her day looking after her children Abdirahman , 12 , Abdifatah , 10 , Deka , eight , and Mustapha , four .
She refused to reveal how she could afford her electrical goods and furniture .
The landmark EU judgment opens the door for hundreds of thousands of unemployed foreigners to claim both state benefits and council or housing association homes .
In particular , it means migrant families from Poland and other Eastern European countries will for the first time have a right to council housing and state benefits even if they have worked for only a brief period in Britain .
It comes at a time of heavy demand for council housing from hard - pressed British families - and as ministers have been promising families in disaffected Labour heartlands that local people will have first call on council homes .
The judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said Mrs Ibrahim must be given a home because ' a parent caring for the child of a migrant worker who is in education in the host member state has a right of residence in that state ' .
' That right is not conditional on the parent having sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system . '
Mrs Ibrahim fled war - torn Somalia to Ethiopia with her family when she was 15 .
She married Mohamed Yusuf in Ethiopia before the pair moved to Denmark where he holds citizenship .
The pair came to Britain seven years ago .
After eight months working as a bus driver , Mr Yusuf began living on benefits .
When they were stopped in March 2004 , he left the country .
Mr Yusuf 's departure ended Mrs Ibrahim 's right to stay in the UK and her right to receive benefits , but six years later , she lives on £ 1,000 a month through child tax credits , child benefits and child disability allowance .
Her accommodation is paid for and she also uses the NHS , even though she is not entitled to free medical care and has no insurance cover .
Her three - year legal battle was funded by the charity Shelter .
The UK Border Agency said it was ' disappointed ' , while Harrow council - which lost the case and has to give a home to Mrs Ibrahim - said European judges were determining British immigration policy .
Housing chief Barry Macleod - Cullinane said : ' We are very concerned - with this outcome , as it appears to establish a major new legal precedent over benefit claims .
' It could well prove to be a floodgates judgment in that people who have not yet contributed to this country or who do not have the means to sustain themselves can now seek immediate help from state welfare services .
' This judgment would seem to make the EU policy of free movement impossible unless one greets new migrants at Heathrow with sizeable welfare handouts . '
At last !
Have they finally found a ' weapon of mass destruction ' in Iraq ?
They have been searching in Iraq for the past nine years , 10 months and 15 days .
Today , the hard work finally paid off as soldiers found one of those elusive ‘ weapons of mass destruction ’ that Saddam Hussein was supposed to have been hiding .
So is it all round to Tony Blair 's house for celebratory drinks ?
Explosive discovery : Iraqi army officials with the rocket they found
Unfortunately the discovery came just a few days late for the former prime minister , who could have used the extraordinary find as proof he was right about Iraq all along during the Chilcot Inquiry .
But from the looks of the rocket , it would appear unlikely it could be deployed anywhere in 45 minutes , let alone be fired at the UK , as a certain dossier led us to believe .
The bomb is thought to have been buried by Saddam Hussein 's regime before the UK and U.S. invasion of Iraq started in 2003 .
Iraqi guards were as surprised as the rest of us to discover the ' missile ' during an operation in Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib suburb .
It is not yet known whether the seven - metre rocket is armed with a warhead .
Shaun Of The Dead 's Simon Pegg becomes a bodysnatcher in new film ... with Gollum as a sidekick
With previous roles in zombie movie Shaun Of The Dead and Moors murderer Ian Brady in TV drama Longford , Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis 's latest film project is just as grizzly .
Pegg , 40 , and Serkis , 45 , play Edinburgh serial killers William Burke and William Hare respectively in the forthcoming black comedy Burke and Hare .
Dressed in Georgian clothing , the actors were spotted looking sinister in a dark and gloomy - looking Old Fishmarket Close off Edinburgh 's Royal Mile last night .
Lock your doors : Simon Pegg and Andy Serkis , as serial killers William Burke and William Hare , filming on Old Fishmarket Close off Edinburgh 's Royal Mile last night
The real - life Burke and Hare , who hailed from Ireland , were responsible for the deaths of at least 17 people from 1827 until 1828 .
After murdering their victims , the pair then went on to sell the bodies to Dr Robert Knox , who dissected them in his anatomy classes at Barclay 's anatomy school in Surgeon 's Square .
They were assisted in their crimes by Burke 's mistress Helen M'Dougal and Hare 's wife Margaret Laird .
The pair were eventually caught when one of their lodgers tipped off the police after finding the body of their last victim , Marjory Campbell Docherty , under her bed .
Return of the bodysnatchers : Pegg and Serkis play serial killers who sold their victims ' bodies to an anatomist
As the evidence against them was weak , Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he testified against Burke - which he did - so the latter was found guilty and hanged in January 1829 .
After serving a short time in prison , Hare was released in February 1829 and left Edinburgh , never to be seen again .
The movie , directed by John Landis , who was responsible for Michael Jackson 's Thriller video , started filming on location in London and Edinburgh earlier this month .
Burke &
Hare also stars Australian actress Isla Fisher as Burke 's love interest Ginny and Pegg 's former Spaced co-star Jessica Hynes as Hare 's wife .
New friends : Pegg posted a picture of himself with co-star Tim Curry
Enthusing about his on - screen love interest Fisher , Pegg said : ' Thoroughly enjoying working with Shannon from Home & Away .
Now I 'm only one degree of separation from Mr. Fisher .
Bonza .'
The film also stars Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson as Dr Knox , Tim Curry as Dr Monroe , as well as comedians Ronnie Corbett and Bill Bailey .
Clearly excited about working with Curry , Pegg posted a photo of himself with the actor on his Twitter page last week .
He also wrote on his growing friendship with his partner - in - crime Serkis : ' Really enjoying working with Andy Serkis .
Genuinely lovely person and a fine , fine actor .
Great watching him work . '
Burke &
Hare is due for release later this year .
Hellenistic Monarchs
down to the Roman Empire
The Hellenistic
Age suffers from some of the same disabilities , in the estimation of Classicists , as Late Antiquity , i.e. it does n't measure up to the brilliance of the Golden Age of Greece and of late Republican and early Imperial Rome .
However , the Hellenistic world , although mostly not bothering with characteristic Greek experiments like democracy , is where Greece actually became a cosmopolitan culture , a sort of pre-adaptation for the Roman world .
Just saying that the Bible begins with the book of Genesis , Γένεσι ς , a Greek word , reflects the degree to which the older cultures of the Middle East came to express themselves in Greek .
Several of the Hellenistic Kingdoms , mainly in Anatolia ( Armenia , Pontus , Cappadocia , etc. ) , are domains of non-Greek peoples .
The Hellenistic
Age lasts almost exactly 300 years , from the death of Alexander in 323 BC to that of Cleopatra in 30 BC .
In the first fifty years , down to 281 BC , we witness a bewildering scrimmage of the Successors fighting over Alexander 's Empire .
After this shakes down to the Kingdoms of Ptolemaic Egypt , Seleucid Asia , and Antigonid Macedon we get a period of relative stability until the arrival of Rome .
The Roman defeat of Macedon in 196 and of the Seleucids in 188 begins a period of steady decline .
In short order Parthia has mostly overrun Iran ( 185 ) , Judaea is independent ( 164 ) , and Macedon is gone ( 146 ) .
All that is left is a bevy of small states and the absurd dynastic circuses of the Seleucids ( until 63 BC ) and the Ptolemies ( until 30 BC ) , all this under the shadow of a hegemonic Rome .
Thus , in its last century , with Rome already occupying Macedon and Greece , the Hellenisitic Age had lost both its cultural heartland and its own internal dynamic .
Parthia closed in from the East , as Rome inevitably tidied up from the West .
The Parthian defeat of the Romans at Carrhae in 53 BC foretells the ultimate frontiers and balance of power in Western Asia , where a rough status quo would persist until the arrival of the Arabs , more than 600 years later .
Meanwhile , although the literature does not seem as brilliant as the Golden Age of Greece , mathematics , science , and technology develop rapidly .
Archimedes very nearly develops calculus .
Eratosthenes estimates the size of the Earth with an accuracy that will not be surpassed until Modern times .
Hero of Alexandria builds a kind of steam engine .
This remains little more than a toy , but the same cannot be said of the immense engines , often of war , that Hellenstic technology otherwise produces .
It is all inherited by the Romans , perhaps symbolically with the killing of Archimedes at Syracuse by a Roman soldier in 212 ( during the Second Punic War , 218-201 ) .
The tables and narrative are mainly based on E.J. Bickerman , Chronology of the Ancient World [ Cornell University Press , 1968 , 1982 ] , Peter Green , The Hellenistic Age , A Short History [ The Modern Library , 2007 ] , Michael Grant , From Alexander to Cleopatra , The Hellenistic World [ Collier Books , 1982 , 1990 ] , John Boardman , Jasper Griffin , & Oswyn Murray , Greece and the Hellenistic World , The Oxford History of the Classical World [ Oxford , 1988 ] , F.E. Peters , The Harvest of Hellenism , A History of the Near East from Alexander the Great to the Triumph of Christianity [ Allen & Unwin , 1970 , 1972 ] , C. Bradford Welles , Alexander and the Hellenistic World [ A.M. Hakkert Ltd. , Toronto , 1970 ] , W.W. Tarn , Hellenistic Civilization [ Meridian Books , 1961 , 1966 ] , E.M. Forster , Alexandria , A History and a Guide [ 1922 , Anchor Books , 1961 , Oxford , 1986 ] , James Romm , Ghost on the Throne , The Death of Alexander the Great and the War for Crown and Empire [ Knopf , 2011 ] , Robin Waterfield , Dividing the Spoils , the War for Alexander the Great 's Empire [ Oxford , 2011 ] , and Bruce R. Gordon 's Regnal Chronologies .
The genealogies now are supplied or corrected from the Erzählende genealogische Stammtafeln zur europäischen Geschichte , Volume III , Europäiche Kaiser - , Königs - und Fürstenhäuser , Ergänzungsband [ Andreas Thiele , R. G. Fischer Verlag , Second Edition , 2001 ] , which has a section specifically of Hellenistic monarchs .
Of primary sources , it is remarkable that a lot of the information about this period comes from an epitome by Photius , the Patriarch of Constantinople ( 858-867 , 877-886 ) .
His Βιβλιοθήκη , Bibliotheca , contains a summary of A History of Events After Alexander by the Roman historian Arrian of Nicomedia ( an early member of the Second Sophistic ) .
Arrian , who wrote a surviving account of the campaigns of Alexander , the Anabasis Alexandri , continued the story in the book that was lost after the time of Photius .
As often happens with ancient authors ( whose spirit is continued in Photius ) , Photius may have written so extensive a summary because he was aware that there were not many manuscripts lying around of the original .
By the many misadventures of the history of Constantinople , copies were either never made or were destroyed along with the existing manuscripts ( possibilities with the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204 , to the Turks in 1453 , or in the occasional fire that breaks out even in modern libraries , e.g. the Los Angeles Public Library in 1986 ) .
We may be reminded that only a single copy of the Secret History by Procopius survived to make its way to the Vatican Library , while only a single Latin manuscript of the De rerum natura by Lucretius was ever found .
The maps are original , though largely based on those in The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History , by Colon McEvedy [ Penguin Books , 1967 ] .
A reference is made to the maps of Tony Belmonte , which are used on the Rome and Romania page .
Kingdoms listed under the Seleucids are those that broke away from the Asiatic part of Alexander 's Empire that largely had been inherited by Seleucus , though a couple of them , like Armenia , were actually only under Seleucid control briefly .

But he did n't fail , and Persian power crumbled before him as it did behind him .
His long trek through Central Asia might then seem foolish and Quixotic , but it followed the precedent of Cyrus the Great in securing the area for Persia in the first place , and involved the pursuit of Darius III ( who was treacherously deposed and then murdered by his retainers ) .
Unlike Cyrus , Alexander avoided dying on the campaign .
Instead , he found a wife , Roxane , Ῥωξάνη ( played memorably by Rosario Dawson in the otherwise forgettable Alexander [ 2004 ] , by Oliver Stone ) -- , Rušanak in Modern Persian -- daughter of Oxyartes , a King in Sogdiana , both of whom he had captured taking the " Sogdian Rock . "
And then he invaded India .
India was really terra incognita to the Greeks .
They would now gain some familiarity with it , but Alexander 's foray would be the first , and last , invasion of India from the West until the Arabs arrived in 644 -- although invasions from Central Asia would continue , as they had in the past ( e.g. the Kushans ) .
Alexander was invited into India by Omphis , the King of Taxila , who wanted help against his enemy Porus , who ruled the land between the Jhelum and the Chenab .
After some fighting to secure his rear , Alexander crossed the Indus , arriving at Taxila , and then advanced on the Jhelum , where Porus waited with a large army , contesting passage .
This was the first river of the modern Punjab .
To the Greeks it was the Ὑδάσπης , Latinized as Hydaspes .
The battle would be named for it .
A perilous crossing on the flank , and a hard fought battle , left Porus in Alexander 's power , to be granted his own kingdom back , as Alexander headed East .
The next river was the Chenab , Ἀκεσίνης , or Acesines .
Fighting along the way , next was the Ravi , the Ὑδραώτης , or Hydraotis .
And finally Alexander arrived at the Beas , the Ὕφασις , or Hyphasis , a tributary of the Sutlej , Greek Σαράδρος , or Latin Hesidrus .
Alexander 's crossing of the Jhelum was no mean feat , and we should reflect that the later failure of Perdiccas to cross the Nile against Ptolemy resulted in his murder , delivering a mortal blow to the continued unity of Alexander 's Empire , and ultimately , fatefully precipitating the deaths of all the remaining members of Alexander 's own family , including his children .
Alexander perhaps cannot have known that Perdiccas would not match him in military ability , but the consequences would be devastating .
Alexander was ready to cross the Beas and go down to the Ganges for further conquests .
This was territory that previously the Greeks had hardly even heard of , and Alexander may actually have thought that the Ocean , having circled around from Gibraltar , was nearby .
But it was getting a little too far from home for most of the Army .
The soldiers were mutinous .
So Alexander , after some histrionics , turned back .
A nice version of this , however , is told by the Jains .
The Greeks were impressed with the " naked philosophers , " the homeless ascetics , they encountered in India .
The Jains preserve , barely , this tradition of ascetic nudity , and now say that Alexander decided to give up further conquests after being persuaded of their futility by Jain monks .
Alexander , however , did not otherwise seem to suddenly turn towards asceticism , so the explanation from the Greek historians of unrest in the ranks seems more likely .
The monks do n't seem to have particularly encamped on the banks of the Beas .
Returning to the Jhelum , Alexander prepared to leave India by sailing down river .
At the confluence of the Ravi , there was a short siege and sharp battle .
Alexander went over the wall of a citadel alone , and for a while fought the Indian host by himself .
Before long others came over the wall , and then opened a gate to the whole army , but meanwhile Alexander had been gravely wounded , with a lung pierced by an arrow .
This was a serious wound -- if it had developed into a pneumothorax , the Greeks would not have known what to do about it -- but , after thought dead , Alexander recovered with some difficulty .
Meanwhile , the army returned to Babylon , part by sea , and part over the difficult lands in the south - east of Iran .
Everyone was throughly exhausted , and Alexander may have ended up not in the best of health .
The day of Alexander 's death , 11 June 323 , is preserved in cuneiform on a Babylonian tablet .
It is 29 Aiyaru on the Babylonian calender .
Although nothing was done to preserve his body for several days , it was in such good condition when the embalmers arrived that at first they thought he was still alive .
This has led to some modern medical opinion that Alexander was in fact not dead , but in a coma .
On the other hand , an incorruptible corpse is a mark of particular holiness in Christianity , Buddhism , etc. ( including The X - Files ) .
We do n't really think of Alexander as saint - like or divine today ; but his death was curiously at the same age as that believed for Jesus , 33 years , and he still is considered an actual prophet in ʾ Islâm .

In 322 , Ptolemy stole the body of Alexander being transported in State to Macedon .
It would lie in a tomb in Alexandria until disappearing from history , centuries later .
In fact , Alexander himself had requested burial in Egypt .
At least that is the word put out by Ptolemy .
On the other hand , there had long been a prophecy that the Argead dynasty of Macedon would end if there were ever a king ( like Alexander ) who was not buried in the family cemetery at Aegae .
In the table at right , the final members of Alexander 's Bodyguard are identified with a yellow star .
The Guard traditionally had seven members , but Alexander added Peucetas as an eighth when he and Leonnatus shielded Alexander 's body after the King was struck in the chest by an arrow .
Alexander , as we have seen , had ( foolishly ) vaulted off a wall into the middle of the defenders of a city in India .
The arrow punctured a lung , and Alexander almost died .
The Bodyguards figure prominently among the Diadochi .
The table shows the most significant of the Diadochi .
This only includes the actual Companions of Alexander and thus does not extend into the second generation , e.g. figures like Cassander and Demetrius .
While Eumenes , who had previously been no more than a secretary , defeated the alliance at Cardia in 320 , killing Craterus and Neoptolemus ( the latter by his own hand ) , Perdiccas himself botched an invasion of Egypt and was assassinated .
Eumenes was declared an outlaw but , despite losing the battle of Orcynia to Antigonus and retreating into the fortress of Nora ( 319 ) , maintained himself until forming an alliance with the subsequent Regent , Polyperchon .
As such , he was able to raise new forces and defeated Antigonus at the Coprates River near Susa , battled him to a draw at Paraetacene north of Persepolis ( 317 ) , and defeated him at Gabiene ( or Gabene ) in 316 .
However , at Gabiene Antigonus captured the opposing camp , and Eumenes was betrayed and delivered to Antigonus , and to his death , by his own men -- the veteran Ἀργυράσπιδε ς , Argyraspides or " Silver Shields " -- in exchange for their possessions , which included their families .
Since Eumenes was Greek , his Macedonian troops did not feel much personal loyalty to him .
Indeed , his nominal allies were constantly plotting against him and challenging his authority -- his ostensive ally at Gabiene , the Satrap of Persis , Peucestas , held back from the battle from an obvious understanding with Antigonus .
Nevertheless , the Argyraspides also betrayed their Macedonian commander , Antigenes , whom Antigonus burned alive out of some twisted animus .
This is a sad comment on the spirit of Alexander 's Successors , that only a Greek genuinely supported the Kings ( i.e. Philip III and Alexander IV ) and the loyal Regents .
The fall of Eumenes was the end of any control of the Regency over the Empire .
Eumenes stands as the Last Faithful Successor , undone by the self - interest of everyone else ( especially Ptolemy and Antigonus ) , including the veterans of Alexander who betrayed him .
Since Antigonus then reasonably did not trust the Argyraspides , their reward was to be dispersed among dangerous frontier posts .
Verily , they had their reward .
Antigonus also did not trust Peucestas with any independent authority , although he spared his life .
The successes of Eumenes , and his tragic end , seem to have received little attention in most treatments of Hellenistic history .
I took a whole class in Hellenistic history at UCLA in 1968 , and over the years acquired a number of books about the Hellenistic Age , and I knew little about Eumenes .
I did not find his story treated in full , at least so as I would notice , until the recent Ghost on the Throne and Dividing the Spoils , cited above .
These are superior books .
Since Eumenes was the Last Faithful Successor to Alexander , and his conflict with Antigonus , involving several great battles , is a matter of high drama and considerable military interest , this is not a matter of isolated significance .
I find its neglect puzzling , both as history and simply as drama .
At the same time , the fall of Eumenes is an ominous and portentous moment in the collapse of the unity of Alexander 's Kingdom and the protection of his kin .
Philip III ended up murdered by Alexander 's mother , Olympias , in league with Polyperchon , in 317 .
This set a very bad precedent for the treatment of the Royal family .
Roxane and Alexander IV with Eumenes , the Last Faithful Successor
Alessandro Varotari ( 1588-1649 ) , il Padovanino
We should reflect on the tragedy of the faithlessness of the " Friends " and Companions of Alexander .
The King Alexander died with three wives and one former mistress .
All were eventually murdered .
He had two sons .
Both were murdered .
His brother , mother , and sister were all murdered .
Indeed , the entire Argead dynasty of Macedon was exterminated .
Unfortunately , some of these murders were done by those ( like wife Roxane and mother Olympias ) who later would be victims themselves .
But the lineage was finished off through the actions or the complacency of those who had sworn oaths to respect the succession of Alexander IV .
Cassander drove Polyperchon from his position .
He then murdered Olympias and would soon display his ambition to forget the Empire and simply become sovereign in Macedonia .
Alexander IV and his mother Roxane were imprisoned , isolated , and then quietly murdered by Cassander -- so quietly that we do n't really know when , but the guess is that it was around 310 or 309 .
Alexander IV 's " official " reign , and the fiction of a unified empire , was maintained for a few more years , until Antigonus and Demetrius ( 306 ) and then Lysimachus , Seleucus , Ptolemy , and Cassander ( 305 ) had all proclaimed themselves Kings in their own right -- 305 is the point where the Canon of Kings ends the reign of Alexander IV .
Alexander would have come of age in 305 , so presumably , if he was not then King , or even still living , other arrangements were called for .
All the Successors , of course , had sworn Oaths to surrender their authority to Alexander at his majority ; but the Loyalist cause had really died with Eumenes , as it would then be literally exterminated by Olympias and Cassander .
Oddly enough , Cassander seems to have buried Philip III , his wife Eurydice ( or Adea ) , Alexander , and Roxane in lavish tombs at Vergina .
Philip 's tomb was first unearthed in 1977 and was at first thought to be that of Philip II .
What Cassander thought he was doing , after the faithlessness and treachery of his behavior , is puzzling .
The " Star of Vergina , " , is an artifact of the tombs .
The modern Republic of Macedonia used it on its flag , but produced a modified version after protests by Greece .
The chronology of this period includes some uncertainties .
Thus , the death of Perdiccas may be seen dated to 320 or 321 .
I have been revising things in line with Robin Waterfield 's Dividing the Spoils , the War for Alexander the Great 's Empire [ Oxford , 2011 ] , which uses 320 ; but some inconsistencies may be found .
I have also been introducing Waterfield 's system of dividing the fighting into six " War of the Successors , " which go from the disputed Regency of Perdiccas to the death of Lysimachus , the last of the Bodyguards , in 281 .
I doubt that this is original with him , but I do not have other sources that use it .
As Waterfield admits , the fighting covered by these divisions is nearly continuous , so it may be a reach to divide it at all ; but there are definitely phases of the fighting , and some division is helpful .
In the First War , the focus is on Perdiccas and Eumenes .
In the Second War , Eumenes still supports the loyalist Regent Polyperchon .
The Second , Third , and Fourth Wars involve Antigonus disposing of Eumenes , emerging as the dominant Successor ( nominally as the deputy of Polyperchon ) , and then being defeated by the combination of all the others , led by Lysimachus .
The Fifth War contains and disposes of Demetrius , although the threat of the Antigonids nevertheless continued ; and then the Sixth eliminated Lysimachus , who , with Macedon , Thrace , and Asia Minor in hand , was in a position to repeat the career of Antigonus .
Seleucus stops that ; and then , despite Seleucus ' own assassination , the division of the lands is essentially finalized : Ptolemaic Egypt , Seleucid Asia , and then , after another few sharp conflicts , Antigonid Macedon .
The following genealogy shows the marriages of Alexander and his generals to women with Persian , especially Royal Persian , connections .
In fact , all the Persian women here are related to the Royal family except Roxane , who was the daughter of a local ruler in Bactria ( Oxyartes , which sounds suspiciously like the brother of Darius III , but it is separately attested ) .
Most of this does not fit on the larger genealogy below , even when that only includes Alexander 's generals who became Kings .
The marriages we see here mostly did not work out well .
The marriage of Nearchus to the unknown daughter of Barsine may have endured , for all we know , since we do n't know what happened to Nearchus after 312 .
Craterus was actively hostile to Alexander 's plan of intermarrying his men with Persians , but then he was killed in battle in 320 .
Meanwhile , however , he had married a daughter of Antipater and put away his Persian wife , Amastris -- he actually arranged another marriage for her ( to Dionysius of Heraclea Pontica ) , where she had three children .
She later , briefly , married Lysimachus , who avenged her after she was , bizarrely , murdered by her own sons .
We do n't know how indifferent Ptolemy or Eumenes may have been to their wives , but Ptolemy never had any children with his , of whom we shortly hear nothing , and Eumenes did not live long , killed in 316 .
Compare with the full genealogy of the Achaemenides , which also contains some of this .
Sisygambis is sometimes regarded as the sister , rather than the cousin , of her husband .
The following combined genealogy covers early Macedonia , Epirus , the Macedonian Great Kings and Regents , Magas of Cyrene , and later Macedonia .
The genealogy of the Seleucids and Ptolemies is given separately below .
The intermarriages here between the Diadochi are bewildering , and hard to link intuitively in just two dimensions .
The Antigonids succeed to Macedon , but then only rule for four generations , a century , with the last of the line , Perseus , already a vassal of the Romans .

Πύῤῥος
Pyrrhus 's adventure in Sicily was followed shortly thereafter by the First Punic War , 264- 241 , by which Rome defeated Carthage , conquered Sicily , and became in consequence the Great Power of the Western Mediterranean .
Rome 's First Illyrian War , 229 - 228 , resulted in a Roman protectorate , the first Roman possession in the Balkan 's , on the border of Epirus .
The Cimmerian Bosporus , in the Crimea , was a very long lived Greek and Hellenistic colonial kingdom that passed under Roman protection and survived all the way to conquest by the Goths .
This span , over very different eras , all by itself makes the kingdom of great interest .
Only Armenia and kingdoms in the Caucasus were more durable as Roman client states .
The list is given in E.J. Bickerman , Chronology of the Ancient World [ Cornell Univesity Press , 1968 - 1982 ] , pp. 132-133 .
The obscurity of this realm is evident in the circumstance that it is not shown on any of Tony Belmonte 's maps .
It is , however , followed in The Penguin Atlas of Ancient History , and is shown from that source in the Animated History of Romania .
The often dual dates reflect uncertainty over which Julian calendar year matches up with the Greek year , which starts in the Autumn , in question .
The greatest obscurities in dates are in the third century , when the sources even for Roman history are n't all that great .
The absorption of the kingdom by the Ostrogoths , who dominated the Ukraine at the time in the fourth century , is a portent for the trouble that the Empire proper was going to have with the Goths in the fifth century .
Antigonus Monophthalmos ( Μονόφθαλμος , Monóphthalmos , " One Eyed " ) , an old general of Philip II , did not rule over Macedonia but would be the first of Alexander the Great 's generals to proclaim himself a King in his own right .
Having disposed of Eumenes , and after tossing Seleucus out of Babylon , Antigonus holds the lion 's share of Alexander 's empire , as we see in the map for 315 .
After a few years , during which Seleucus returns to Babylon , and Alexander IV is apparently killed , Antigonus proclaims himself , and his son Demetrius , Kings ( 306 ) .
Ptolemy , Seleucus , Cassander , and Lysimachus soon followed suit ( 305 ) .
In 311 , Seleucus , backed by Ptolemy , launches a daring expedition back to Babylon and succeeds in detaching the Eastern lands of the empire from Antigonus .
Two attempts were made to unseat Seleucus .
Nicanor , the Satrap of Media installed by Antigonus , quickly marches against Babylon , with superior forces , but is then surprised in his camp and defeated .
Invading Iran in turn , Seleucus defeats Nicanor and kills him in personal combat .
With Seleucus away scooping up the East , in 310 Demetrius himself marches on Babylon , which was in the hands of a Seleucid lieutenant , Patrocles .
Having fought his way into the city , Demetrius is called away in 309 to deal with Ptolemy .
His lieutenant , Archelaus , is then driven away by the returning Seleucus , whose situation is now apparently secure .

His enemies ( with the perhaps prudent exceptions of Cassander and Ptolemy ) converge on Antigonus .
Although the toughest old bird in the fight , perhaps feeling all of his eighty years , he is defeated and killed by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the climactic battle of Ipsus in 301 -- perhaps the largest battle of the era ( ending the " Fourth War of the Successors " ) .
This puts an end to his ambitions and his Kingdom .
His son , Demetrius I Poliorcetes ( Πολιορκητής , Poliorkêtés , " Sieger of Cities , " though his greatest siege , of Rhodes , was a failure -- in whose celebration the Rhodians built the Colossus of Rhodes ) , survived the battle -- it is unclear whether , leaving the field in pursuit of the defeated allied cavalry , he simply never returned or was prevented from rejoining the fight by the elephants of Seleucus .
Nevertheless , Demetrius possessed a considerable fleet , had occupied a good part of Greece , and also continued to hold Cyprus , Sidon , and Tyre .
Despite everyone 'e impression and best wish , he continued to be a player and is simply cut loose to seek his own fortune .
This includes the throne of Macedonia ( 294-288 ) , where , however , his actions , attitudes , and ambitions failed to win him much in the way of love , loyalty , or support .
His project to invade Asia foundered on desertion by the Macedonians and then deposition by Pyrrhus and Lysimachus .
Despite other possessions falling away ( Cyprus and the Phoenician cities ) , Demetrius invades Asia anyway , is led deep into the interior , and then , as Seleucus tempts the desertion of his men , is captured in 285 -- the effective end of his Kingship .
After this roller coaster ride of ambition and daring , Demetrius is treated well enough by Seleucus , but his health became the worse for drink , and he died in 283 .
He had left his son , Antigonus II Gonatas , behind in Greece ; and so , just as in the previous generation , the son is left with a kind of starter set to rebuild the kingdom lost by the father .
This is what he did .
With a great defeat of the invading Celts , and despite being ejected by Pyrrhus ( as he had done his father ) for a year , Antigonus successfully installed his line in Macedonia ( cf. the maps below ) .
It continued until Roman conquest in 168 .

There is a course on the Hellenstic Age issued by The Teaching Company ( " The Great Courses " ) , " Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age " [ 2000 ] , given by Jeremy McInerney , an Associate Professor of Classics at the University of Pennsylvania .
McInerney is an engaging lecturer , but he seems to be impatient with narrative history , which is a serious drawback for the life of Alexander and the early years of the Successors .
This results in an astronishing gap in his treatment .
After introducing Antigonus Monophthalmos , showing his central kingdom on two maps , and mentioning Demetrius , McInerney never does get around to describing what happened to either of them .
This means that the Battle of Ipsus , one of the most dramatic events of the age , goes unmentioned .
Nor do we ever hear anything of the conflict of Antigonus with Eumenes , who himself is never mentioned .
Even worse , indeed shockingly worse , we are never told how the Antigonids , either Demetrius or Antigonus Gonatas , come to the Throne of Macedon .
Since this involves the subsequent history of Macedonia until the Roman Conquest , it is an astonishing oversight .
When McInerney moves on to discuss Hellenistic sculpture , he lists the major successor Kingdoms he has considered -- but Macedonia is conspicuous by its absence .
I do n't know how he could have done this .
Similarly , McInerney ignores Lysimachus until mentioning him in passing in relation to the establishment of Pergamum , showing his kingdom only on a map of Pergamum .
McInerney 's impatience also results in some simple distortions .
Thus , he describes Perdiccas as turning on Ptolemy , invading Egypt , and being assassinated as his army was about to cross the Nile .
This ignores the provocations and disloyalty of Ptolemy , manifest in the theft of Alexander 's body , and the fact that Perdiccas had already tried to cross the Nile and was repulsed .
I know that the Wars of the Successors are confusing ; but , really , if you are going to teach a course , you should be able to get them straight and not leave out major and formative events .
Having skipped over and / or distorted such events , McInerney then devotes two whole lectures to essentially defending the Greeks against possible charges of anti-Semitism , the sort of anachronistic and irrelevant exercise that can easily obsess the modern , politically correct academic .
It adds nothing to an account of Hellenistic history .
As noted elsewhere , the issue would be more relevant to Manethô 's treatment of the Jews .
But then Manethô was not a Greek .

Never as strong as under Seuthes III , the new Thrace is , if anything , more obscure than the old and now generally remains outside the control of the Hellenistic Kingdoms .
It disappears off many of the historical maps for the period , as we would expect if it was never organized enough to project its sovereignty , diplomatically or militarily , or participate in events .
In retrospect , it does not seem to have ever been appropriate as a base for one of the major Successors .
Lysimachus got a bad deal .
Lapsing back into their marginal place on the boundary of civilization , the Thracians were only finally reduced to vassalage by Rome .

Antigonus did an excellent job of founding a durable kingdom .
His grandfather would have been proud of him , perhaps not the least because he also lived to be over eighty .
And he ruled Macedonia itself close to forty years .
He was tough , resourceful , and resilient .
His strategy in Greece involved the key strategic locations that his father Demetrius had managed to acquire and preserve , and that for a while then were almost the only possessions of the Antigonids .
These places were the Piraeus , the port of Athens ( and often including a garrison in Athens itself ) , Corinth , Chalcis , and Demetrias .
Chalchis was situated at the narrowest point in the passage between the island of Euboea and the mainland .
Demetrias , founded and named after his father Demetrius , was at the head of the Pagasaean gulf in Thessaly .
It became a seat of the monarchy , thanks to its strategic location .
Indeed , Corinth , Chalcis , and Demetrias came to be called the " Fetters of Greece , " Πέδαι Ἑλληνικαί , at least by the time of Philip V [ Polybius , The Histories , Volume V , Book XVIII , 11:5 , W.R. Patton , Loeb Classical Library , Harvard , 1926 , 2006 , p.106-107 ] ; and their possession was consistent with the policy of Antigonus , not to conquer Greece , but to prevent the formation of powers that might unify the country and challenge Macedonia .
He himself lost Corinth , perhaps the most strategic location of all , to the Achaean League in 243 , but the city was then returned to Antigonus Doson in 223 to secure his support .
It remained in Macedonian hands until after the defeat by the Romans at Cynoscephalae in 197 , when the Romans " freed " the city in 193 , but then , of course , garrisoned the Acrocorinth -- as they did Chalcis and Demetrias .
Rome thus inherited the " Fetters " and their function .
The possession of such strategic locations is reminiscent of 19th century Britain holding bases such as Gibraltar , Malta , and Singapore .
We also might be reminded of the Arab garrison cities in the early days of ʾ Islâm .
Antigonus founded a durable kingdom , but the dynasty was destined to last only three more generations , pretty much through no fault of its own .
Macedonia became the first of the Hellenistic successor kingdoms to feel the wrath of Rome .
This started with the Second Punic War , 218- 201 , when Hannibal 's invasion and victories in Italy ( like Cannae , 216 ) made it look like Rome might actually be defeated by Carthage .
To Philip V , a Macedonian alliance with Carthage then seemed reasonable .
When fortune turned against Carthage , a peace was patched up ( 205 ) , but Roman revenge could be expected after the final and decisive defeat of Carthage ( 202 ) .
Unlike the Hellenistic monarchs , the Roman Republic did not forgive or forget what it regarded as betrayals .
When revenge came ( 197 ) , Macedon permanently lost its position in Greece and any real freedom of action .
The final reduction of Macedonia coincided with the Third Punic War , 149 - 146 , when Carthage itself was conquered and destroyed .
Both Africa and Macedonia became Roman provinces .
As the Hellensitic Kingdoms are forming , the city of Rome has occupied most of Central Italy .
The Second Samnite War ( 327-304 ) secured Roman domination .
The next real contest would be with the Greek cities in the south .
The Greeks derived aid from Pyrrhus of Epirus ( 281-278 ) , but this was unavailing .
Tarentum surrendered in 272 , leaving the Romans in complete control of Southern Italy .
By 270 , the Roman Republic is all but coextensive with Italy .
Only the Po Valley , still Celtic ( and even called " Cisalpine Gaul " ) , is unoccupied .
After the fall of Lysimachus , the assassination of Seleucus , and the establishment of Antigonus Gonatas in Macedonia , the successor Kingdoms have shaken down to just three .
This gives the form of things for a while , still pretty early in the Hellenstic Period , just fifty years after the death of Alexander .
That a generation and more has passed is now conspicuous .
Alexander 's own Bodyguards and generals are gone .
Antiochus ' name is even today preserved in the name of the city of Antioch , Ἀντι όχεια , though its modern name , Antakya , is in a language , Turkish , that would have been no more familiar to the Hellenistic Greeks than Navajo .
Fifty years later things do n't seem all that different , but big changes are in the offing .
The Romans have defeated Carthage in the First Punic War ( 264-241 ) and secured Sicily , after a long and difficult campaign .
Roman victory , however , was mainly effected by the defeat of the Carthaginian navy .
Carthaginian forces on Sicily thus could be isolated .
Rome became the dominant naval power in the Western Mediterranean , and Carthage would never be able to seriously challenge this .
In a way , this is bewildering .
The Phoenicians had lived on the sea for centuries , and the Romans had barely shaken the mud off their sandals .
Some of the worse Roman naval defeats in the war were the result of the weather , for which the Romans had no sailor 's sense .
But the Romans defeated the Thalassocracy of Carthage and kept it defeated .
Once the war was won , the Romans continued to press their advantage , occupying Sardinia and Corsica ( 237 ) and gaining a toehold in Illyrium and Epirus ( 228 ) .
The Second Punic
War is soon to break out .
This will radically alter the balance of power , making Rome dominant in the West and inflicting a defeat on Macedon .
Worse will soon follow .
Meanwhile , Bactria is the first part of the Kingdom of Seleucus to become alienated and independent , though under its Greek ( shortly to become Buddhist ) Kings , it is still a fully Hellenistic successor Kingdom .
Antiochus III has come to the throne , but he has not yet engaged in the campaigns that will earn him the epithet " the Great . "
Nor has he encountered the misfortune , the Romans , that will turn his achievements , like those of the Macedonian Antigonids , to nought .
While the Diadochi are the high profile players in Hellenistic history , Greece itself continued to consist of city states .
Some , although occasionally subject to foreign , mainly Macedonian , control , largely preserved their independence and long continued as autonomous players .
Athens and Sparta are conspicuous in this category .
Leagues of cities were already familiar from Greek history , but to the extent that they represented real power , they usually reflected the dominance of one member .
The League of Delos thus became the instrument of Athens .
The League of Corinth was created by Philip II of Macedon to control Greece , while maintaining the fiction that the Greek cities were independent .
As the Hellenistic Age developed , however , we have the new phenomenon of leagues which become politically and military important in their own right without being dominated by a particular member , much less some other power .
These were the Aetolian League , mainly in the mountains north of the Gulf of Corinth , and the Achaean League , beginning along the north coast of the Peloponnesus .
Neither league began near what had hitherto been centers of Greek power , and the Aetolians were in an area that had barely passed from tribal to urban organization -- though their acquisition of Delphi around 300 ( or in 290 ) gave them one of the symbolic centers of Greek religion and identity .
In the course of events , the Aetolians achieved temporary control over Boeotia and Thessaly .
The Achaeans eventually annexed Sparta but then displeased Rome with its treatment .
They each developed something like a federal structure , with a League Assembly and the annual election of a president or general ( strategos ) to lead the whole .
The Achaean League especially was well led by Aratus , who was president every other year ( he could not succeed himself ) from 245 to 213 , and was followed by Philopoemen of Megalopolis from 208 until his death in 182 .
The Aetolians made the mistake of allying with Antiochus III against Rome , and the Romans reduced them to a vassal status in 189 .
The Achaeans also eventually fell afoul of Rome , and in 146 the Romans sacked Corinth and dissolved the League .
Among the hostages that Rome demanded from Achaea in 167 was the historian Polybius , who ended up observing a great deal of Roman history , like the Third Punic War ( 149 - 146 ) .
Both leagues were the only Greek precedent for the kind of federal structure of government that was attempted in the United States Constitution .
The name of the Achaean League lived on in subsequent history .
The name of the Roman province that included the Peloponnesus , Athens , and Boeotia was " Achaea " ; and when the Crusaders divided up Romania after the Fourth Crusade , the Peloponnesus became the Principality of Achaea .

The last two Wonders were then actual products of the Hellenistic Age , in the 3th century .
The Colossus of Rhodes was constructed by a surviving Greek city state , to celebrate its delivery from the siege of Demetrius Poliorcetes in 305 ; but then the Pharos Lighthouse was one of the supreme symbols of Hellenistic Monarchy , built by Ptolemy I and II in the first and greatest city of Alexander , marking its location , day and light , on the edge of the otherwise flat and undistinguished Delta of Egypt .
The Colossus of Rhodes , ὁ Κολο σ σὸ ς Ῥόδιος , did not survive long as constructed .
It fell in an earthquake in 226 BC .
It 's reconstruction was prevented by an inauspicious oracle .
The ruin , however , was a tourist attraction until the island was seized by the future Caliph Muʿâwiya in 654 AD .
According to Theophanes Confessor , Muʿâwiya sold the bronze statue , 1370 years after its construction , for scrap to a Jewish merchant .
The weakness of the statue , 108 feet tall , was apparently in the ankles , which supported the whole weight of cast bronze .
These snapped in the earthquake .
If the statue had straddled the entrance of the harbor , as has been imagined , the structure never would have stood at all .
By contast , the Statue of Liberty , where the statue alone is 151 feet tall , the legs are concealed by robes , and within is actually an iron superstruture , designed by no less than Gustave Eiffel ( 1832 - 1923 ) , who went on to build his eponymous tower in Paris .
The visible statue is thin plates of copper attached to the superstructure .
Something about the Statue of Liberty , however , may commemorate the Colossus , namely the seven rays on the crown , which are part of the iconography , not of the goddess Liberty , but of the sun god Helios .
As on the Colossus .
The Pharos Lighthouse , ὁ Φάρος τῆ ς Ἀλεξανδρείας , lasted much longer , ultimately collapsing during earthquakes itself , in 1303 & 1323 AD , under the Mamlûks .
The durability and visibility of the Lighthouse may explain why it was only added to the list of Wonders during the Middle Ages .
We do not see it in the list by Antipater of Sidon above .
After the collapse , reconstructed as a still surviving fort ( the Fort of Qaitbay , , 1477 ) , the massive masonry blocks of the Lighthouse can even now be inspected .
Within the fort a mosque seems to echo the elements of the structure of the Lighthouse , with square , circular , and octogonal shapes .
The Crusaders built a fort out of the Mausoleum also , and it is hard to know how much damage it may already have endured .
The Temple of Artemis suffered more than one act of destruction .
The pre-Hellenistic temple was set on fire by an aronist in 356 .
The Goths damaged the rebuilt temple in 268 AD , during their raids of the Third Century .
It is unclear whether this completely destroyed the temple or not .
As the area of Ephesus silted up , the site was buried .
When excavated after its discovery in 1869 , the " Englishman 's Pit " subsequently filled up with water .
It then looked like a small abandoned lake with a few stones and columns visible above water .
Much of the stone may have been taken for other projects , including the Church of Sancta Sophia in Constantinople .
The Statue of Zeus from Olympia was relocated to Constantiople at its building , along with masses of other Classical statuary of whose existence we still seem to be learning , and kept at the Lauseion Palace .
When the Palace burned in 475 , the statue was lost , along with others , such as the famous Aphrodite of Cnidus .
But there are other reports that the statue of Zeus had not been moved to Constantinople at all , leaving its fate uncertain .
Most uncertain of all is the fate of the Hanging Gardens .
Archaeologists have been entirely unable to identify a possible site for the Gardens in the excavations of Babylon .
Because of this , some now doubt whether the Gardens even existed , at least in the form commonly described ( on terraces , etc . ) .
It is hard to know what to make of this , since Babylon was a place familiar to many Greeks , already from the Golden Age , but then to thousands of them in the time of Alexander .
In any case , Babylon was slowly abandoned under the Seleucids , and the Emperor Trajan only found ruins when he visited the site in 117 AD .
Σέλευκος , Seleucus , although at one point a refugee with Ptolemy I , returned across the desert to Babylon in 311 to ultimately appropriate the lion 's share of Alexander 's empire .
This dramatic event , counted as Seleucus ' first regal year , was continued as the Seleucid Era , the first continuous count of time in world chronology , soon to inspire the similar Arsacid Era of Parthia .
The beginning of the Seleucid Era is given as 312/311 because the Babylonian New Year was in the Spring but the Seleucid year for the Greeks was reckoned from the previous Fall ( September or October ) .
There is also the residual uncertainty about Hellenistic dating .
E.J. Bickerman , for instance , positively asserted that Seleucus reconquered Babylon " in August of 312 " [ Chronology of the Ancient World , Cornell University Press , 1968 , 1980 , 1982 , p.71 ] , while a more recent treatment by Robin Waterfield says , " In the spring of 311 he [ i.e. Seleucus ] was given a thousand men by Ptolemy and set out from Palestine to Babylonia " [ Dividing the Spoils , Oxford , 2011 , p.123 ] .
While we may have more confidence in up - to - date scholarship , sometimes older analyses are later vindicated .
As recounted above , Seleucus had to fend off two major efforts against him to recover Babylon for Antigonus Monophthalmos .
With Babylon secure , he was able to take control of the vast Iranian hinterland , the geographical bulk of Alexander 's Empire .
However , Seleucus leaves India to the growing power of the Mauryas , and was compensated with war elephants that he then began to breed himself .
Having defeated and killed Antigonus ( 301 ) and Lysimachus ( 281 ) , Seleucus was about to add Thrace to his kingdom when , stepping out of the boat in Europe , he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus , whom he had taken in as a refugee from his father , Ptolemy I. Ceraunus is also said to have killed Seleucus while they were hunting together near Lysmacheia , which had been Lysimachus ' capital on the Gallipoli peninsula .
Ceraunus claimed the throne of Thrace and Macedon , while the rest of Seleucus ' domain passed to his half - Iranian son Antiochus .
The capital of the kingdom , Seleucia , founded on the Tigris , began to replace Babylon as the metropolitan city of the region , but it did not achieve the historical significance and permanence of Alexandria in Egypt .
Instead , it was ultimately replaced by the neighboring new capitals of the Parthians , Ctesiphon , and of the Abbasid Caliphs , Baghdâd .
A more permanent city of historical importance and fame would be Antioch in Syria ( now in Turkey ) .
While Seleucid authority was never fully established over several kingdoms in Anatolia , like Armenia and Pontus , more distant areas , like Parthia and Bactria , began to drift away .
Antiochus III stopped this process and began to reverse it , marching to India and wresting Palestine from the Ptolemies , but then had the misfortune to become the first Seleucid to clash with Rome .
His defeat in 190 began a steep decline for the kingdom .
By 125 , the Seleucids would be confined to Syria .
Their last 60 years would be consumed with pointless dynastic conflict and fragmentation , and 14 years of Armenian occupation .
Then Rome would pick up the pieces .
Pompey " settles the East " in 63 BC with the annexation of the remaining Seleucid lands and the reduction of other local states , like Judaea , to Roman clients .
With the Seleucids , as with the Ptolemies , we have a genealogy that gets more complicated as time goes on .
This happens as brothers and cousins begin to contend for the Throne , but also as intermarriage , particularly with the Ptolemies , becomes increasingly more confusing .
A name so famous in Egypt , Cleopatra , actually derives from a Seleucid marriage , Cleopatra a daughter of Antiochus III .
Three of her grandchildren marry back into the Seleucids .
Cleopatra
Thea marries three Seleucids ( although there seems to be some question about the parentage of Alexander Balas ) and has children by all of them who eventually become Kings .
Cleopatra V Selene marries her brother , Ptolemy IX , and then two Seleucids , the son ( Antiochus VIII , following her sister ) and grandson ( Antiochus X ) of her own cousin ( Cleopatra Thea ) .
The dynasty ends with the five sons of Antiochus VIII and their cousin fighting among themselves as the Kingdom crumbles .
Two members of the next generation wrap things up , after Tigranes II of Armenia took over ( 83-69 ) , until the Romans pick up the pieces in 63 .
The last King , Philip II , bears the interesting epithet of Φιλοῥώμαιος , " Philorhomaeus , " " Roman Lover . "
Hamilcar Barca , the Carthaginian commander in Sicily during the First Punic War , prepared for the future by moving to Spain and enlarging Carthaginian possessions there .
He even founded a " New Carthage , " the Latin version of whose name , Carthago Nova , still exists , as Cartagena ( in both the Old World and the New ) .
" Carthage " was Καρχηδών in Greek and Carthago in Latin .
Polybius , who had occasion to refer to Cartagena many times , actually just calls it ἡ Καινὴ πόλι ς , the " New " city , probably not realizing that , in Phoenician , Carthage itself was already the " new city . "
The Second Punic War ( 218-201 ) is then initiated by Hamilcar 's son , Hannibal .
With Carthaginian control of the sea lost , but a successful new domain in Spain , Hannibal decided to beat the Romans at their own game , not only to defeat them on land but to actually invade Italy and do it there .
Crossing the Alps with his war elephants , Hannibal created one of the most dramatic and memorable campaigns in world history .
In three years , Hannibal inflicted three crushing defeats on the Romans , at the Trebia River in 218 , at Lake Trasimene in 217 , and finally at Cannae in 216 .
Cannae , where Hannibal executed a double envelopment of four Roman Legions , surrounding and annihilating them , established a military ideal , a Holy Grail for tactics , for all subsequent military history .
Envelopment of one or both flanks of the enemy would always be a key to victory .
The Duke of Marlborough typically could effect a breakthrough leading to envelopment , with Oudenarde the most like Cannae , although only part of the French Army was involved .
Robert E. Lee , or the incompetence of subordinates , defeated the attempts of Ulysses S. Grant at envelopments in 1864 , until that was achieved at Five Forks in 1865 , soon leading to Lee 's surrender .
The Schliefen Plan in World War I was to " brush the Channel " and envelope the French with the German Right .
This failed , as the German Right was not as strong as intended , and the French rushed out troops , in taxicabs , to reinforce their Left .
In 1940 , however , the Germans punched through the Allied middle with tanks and enveloped the Left from behind , pinning it against the Channel , to surrender or be evacuated -- at Dunkirk .
That move was more like Marlborough than like Hannibal .
On the map at right we see a subsequent battle at Cannae , in 1018 , when Romania , the Mediaeval Roman Empire , defeated an attack and rebellion by the Lombards of Benevento .
This was at the height of Roman power in the South of Italy .
However , that power would vanish by the end of the century because of the advent of a new and unanticipated enemy , the Normans , who started as Roman mercenaries but then began their own rebellion .
After the original Cannae , the Romans tried to avoid battle in Italy .
This was the explicit strategy of Fabius Maximus Verrucosus , called Cunctator , " Delayer . "
Not all were happy with such a strategy , but it had begun to look like a Roman army could not face Hannibal in battle without being destroyed .
In this way , Hannibal , with no resources to besiege Rome or other cities , lost the initiative .
Meanwhile , a Roman army reduced Spain , defeating Hannibal 's brother Hasdrubal .
Then , the victor of Spain , Scipio Africanus , invaded Africa in 204 .
Hannibal finally left Italy to defend Carthage itself , and then was defeated at Zama in 202 , as the Numidian cavalry , always essential to Carthaginian armies , foolishly deserted to the Romans .
Hannibal fled as far as Bithynia , where he took poison in 183 rather than be surrendered to the Romans .
Carthage was reduced to a rump state in Tunisia .
Roman historians tried to explain Hannibal , in one sense , with a story that Hamilcar had made the young Hannibal swear an oath of emnity against Rome .
We might ask now , when did the Romans swear their oath of emnity against Carthage ?
Neither Hamilcar nor Hannibal ever needed any such oath .
Roman aggression was evident from the outset .
Where Hamilcar was fighting in Sicily , Phoenicians had lived for centuries , while Rome had no people or legitimate interests in the island .
It was simply a Roman invasion , and all the subsequent actions of the Republic were of the same sort .
The Barcas needed no oaths , because Roman intentions were obvious .
Conquest .
Well , they got their conquest , but it was a near run thing .
If Carthage had actually had a tithe of the resources that Rome had at that point , Hannibal would have smashed Rome like a bug .
And I think they knew it .
In those terms , the nobility and genius of Hannibal Barca shine out even from the pages of hostile Roman historians .
He was morally superior to his enemies , and they richly deserved the damage , the shock , and the fright that he inflicted upon them .
This was a great man ; yet also as a general his courage , his audacity , his strategic and tactical brilliance may even be without equal in world history .
The very image of his elephants crossing the Alps is something iconic and incomparable , while this passage was no mean feat in its own right .
While Caesar grieved over the murder of Pompey , Aurelian left Zenobia to comfortable retirement in Rome , and the British wined and dined Cetshwayo , the defeated King of the Zulus , in London , the Romans of Hannibal 's day , simply out of spite wanted to murder him , and ignobly hounded him to the ends of the earth .
The British themselves were not always without spite , as in the treatment of the last Moghul Emperor and the execution of his sons .
Much of the shame of that is that the elderly Bahâdur Shâh II was not really an independent agent , was not responsible for the outrages of the Great Mutiny , and was in fact still the nominal sovereign of the British in India !
On the other hand , Hannibal , with full responsibility , can be blamed for no atrocities .
He was fighting for the very life of Carthage , whose terms the Romans blatantly affirmed by later exterminating the entire population of the city .
They obviously hated the Carthaginians with a relentless passion , when Carthage had never done them any harm except in self - defense .
Demolishing the city and sowing the land with salt , the Romans wanted Carthage erased from history .
Fortunately , it was the Roman historians themselves who prevented that from happening , and the city later was actually rebuilt .
As with the Trojans in the Iliad , anyone reading Polybius or Livy is bound to admire the conquered more than conquerors .
Yet no Trojan stands out with anything like the sublime patriotism and genius of Hannibal .
Achilles chased Hector around Troy , and then dragged his body around the city in the same way ; but no Roman enemy got any such satisfaction from Hannibal .
Scipio at last could defeat him , but Hannibal got clean away .
Macedon made the mistake , when Hannibal looked like a winner , of joining Carthage against Rome .
Although bailing out when the tide turned , Philip V nevertheless became the target of Roman vengeance once Carthage had been dealt with .
The Second Macedonian War ( 200 - 196 ) has now permanently reduced the Macedonian domain .
Carthage for the moment suvives , but only until the Third Punic War ( 149 - 146 ) , when it is annihilated .
Meanwhile , Antiochus III , the Great , has marched to India and defeated the Ptolemies , driving them out of Asia .
These great successes will shortly be undone by the first Seleucid clash with Rome , the Syrian War ( 192-188 ) .
In the aftermath of the Second Punic War , we thus have a unification of the Mediterranean basin , where the power of Rome begins to stretch from one end of the Sea to the other .

Galatians were actually Celts from central Europe .
They seem to have arrived south of the Danube by 280 , disrupting the Thracian and Macedonian Kingdoms .
They founded an ephemeral and poorly attested state in Thrace itself and then invaded Greece in 279 , killing Ptolemy Ceraunus .
This threw Macedon into chaos , which was not relieved until Antigonus Gonatas defeated the invaders in Greece in 277 and assumed the Macedonian Throne .
Meanwhile a group crossed the Bosporus and established themselves in Anatolia , creating the durable and memorable domain of Galatia .
At first led by tribal chiefs , they were long organized in local " tetrarchies , " only becoming a kingdom after the arrival of the Roman Pompey in 63 BC .
Their capital , Angora ( or Ancyra ) , has given us the modern name of varieties of cat , goat , and rabbit , two of which are used for their hair .
The modern city , Ankara , is now the capital of Turkey .
The idea of Celts in the middle of modern Turkey now seems so strange that it sounds like a Monty Python skit .
Of the lists given here , only the rulers of Pergamum would actually have been Greeks .
We can see non-Greek influences in the names of the multiple " Mithridates " of Pontus and Commagene .
This name means the " gift , " dates , of the Iranian god Mithra ( Sanskrit Mitra ) .
This is a Persian name whose modern form is Mehrdâd , of whose meaning many modern Iranians may be unaware .
The cult of Mithra becomes one of the popular Roman mystery religions , Mithraism .
The Galatians and the ancient peoples of Anatolia , however , except for the Armenians , gradually disappeared from history .
This was at first under Greek influence , as literate people came to write only in Greek .
Indeed , when the Emperor Nicephorus I colonized people from Anatolia into Greece itself , it leaves us wondering how many modern Greeks are actually descendants of Cappadocians , Galatians , etc .
Eventually , however , the Turkish conquest erased whatever may have remained of all of them in their homeland .

Menander Soter Dikaeus ( , Milinda in Pali ) is an important figure in the history of Buddhism , as the king in the Milindapanha , " Questions of Milinda , " where he asks the sage Nagasena about Buddhism .
As Greek Bactria absorbed Buddhist influence , Buddhism reflected Greek artistic influences , and perhaps more .
About the time of Menander 's death ( 130 BC ) , the Yüeh - chih pushed into Bactria -- subsequently to move into India as the Kushans .
Then the Sakas under Maues ( 97 - 58 BC ) invaded India and broke up the remaining Greek kingdom in the Indus Valley , with one part of it remaining in the Kabul Valley , another on the Left Bank on the Indus .

Caria , although very close to the Doric Greek areas near Rhodes , was nevertheless not a Greek kingdom .
It 's principal claim to fame comes from two rulers , Mausolus and his sister Artemisia II ( who , being named after the goddess Artemis , may show Greek influence , or indicate the likelihood that Artemis was not originally a Greek goddess ) .
Although this kind of brother - sister marriage would be typical of the Hellenistic Period , thought to be inspired by Egypt , and Mausolus is usually thought of as a Hellenistic monarch , he was in fact ruling under the Persians and even his sister , who survived him , died before Alexander arrived .
Nevertheless , at his capital of Halicarnassus , he began a great tomb , finished by his sister , which became one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
The Μαυ σ ωλεῖον , Mausoleum , then gives its name to any great stone burial building .
The original survived well into the Middle Ages , before donating its stone to ( Crusader ) fortresses .
An earlier Artemisia , " the Valiant , " had her own claim to fame .
Commanding Carian ships for the Persians at the Battle of Salamis in 480 , she saw the way the battle was going and determined to escape .
Geting away involved ramming and sinking another Carian ship .
Xerxes , watching the battle , thought that Artemisia had sunk a Greek ship and commented that , " My men have become women , and my women men . "
I am not aware of Xerxes ' reaction when he discovered the truth .
It does n't seem to have affected the tenure of the dynasty .
The rulers of Caria were never Kings .
They were recognized by the Persians as " Dynasts , " and sometimes as Satraps , and by some of their subject Greek cities as " tyrants , " i.e. monarchs who were not traditional Kings .
Mausolus ' relative freedom of action never grew into independence .
Caria became subject to Macedon as it had been to Persia .

Soon Ptolemy might well make a claim to priority among his peers by virtue of possessing the mummified body of Alexander himself ( stolen on its trip back to Macedonia ) and ruling from the city of Alexandria , Ἀλεξάνδρεια , the first such city founded by Alexander , which became the greatest Hellenistic city , and the Second City of the Roman Empire ( at first , second after Rome ; later , second after Constantinople ) until the Arab Conquest .
In far off in India , where " Greek " was Yavana , , Yavanapura , , seems to have been the name of Alexandria itself [ note ] .
The site of Alexandria had been familiar to Greek sailors for centuries , and it had an Egyptian name , , rendered into Greek as Ῥακῶτι ς .
The island of Pharos , Φάρος , just off the coast , is even mentioned in the Odyssey , the home of immortal Proteus and his daughter Eidothea , where Menelaus is detained for twenty days on his way home from Troy , although the island is described as a day 's voyage from the coast , when it is in fact within sight of it [ IV:355 , Homer , The Odyssey , Volume II , translated by A.T. Murray , Loeb Classical Library , Harvard , 1919 , 1995 , p.145 ] .
Pharos would be giving its name to the Pharos Lighthouse , built at the East end of the island -- one of the Seven Wonders of the World .
Alexandria would also be distinguished by the Museum , Μου σεῖον , i.e. the place of the Muses ( more a university than a museum ) , with its great Library , something later called a βιβλιοθήκη , Latin bibliotheca -- or librarium -- so that , for instance , in French bibliothèque is a library but librairie is a bookshop .
The Great Library was founded with the advice of the philosopher Demetrius of Phaleron , who lately had been the Macedonian governor of Athens ( from 317 to 307 , until the city was taken by Demetrius Poliorcetes ) .
The Library was intended to have every book in the world in it , but with the provision that this be in Greek translation .
Reportedly , ships were searched for books , which , if the Library did not already have them , were seized , copied , and then returned ( hopefully before the ship had left ) .
Although the precise location of the Library is unknown , it is believed to have been in the Bruchion District , adjacent to the Museum and the Royal Palace .
Subsequently , under Ptolemy II , another library is believed to have been created at the Serapeum , the temple to the invented Ptolemaic god Serapis .
The Mediaeval Roman scholar John Tzetzes ( d.c.1180 ) reports that the main Library contained " 400,000 composite books and 90,000 single books , " while the " external " section -- the Serapeum ? -- contained 42,800 papyrus rolls [ N.G. Wilson , Scholars of Byzantium , Duckworth , 1983 , 1996 , p.195 ] .
It is not clear where Tzetzes got his information , but he had access of sources from the Hellenistic
Age that are lost to us , including the actual catalogue of the Library made by the poet Callimachus ( d.240 BC ) , the Pinakes .
In Jewish tradition , related by Josephus , a friend of Ptolemy II Philadelphus , Aristeas , wrote to Jerusalem , under Ptolemaic rule at the time , to ask the High Priest Elazar for permission to translate the Torah ( the Pentateuch ) from Hebrew into Greek .
Elazar agreed , and selected 72 translators who then produced the Septuagint .
While the " Letter of Aristeas " is sometimes said to be a Hasmonean , or later , forgery , Simeon ben Gamaliel , president of the Sanhedrin in the 1st century AD , ruled ( according to the Palestinian Talmud ) that the Torah could be written in Greek as well as Hebrew [ cf .
Alfred J. Kolatch , This is the Torah , Jonathan David Publishers , Middle Village , New York , 1988 , pp.46 -49 ] .
Since the Library would have wanted the Bible in Greek , especially with a large Jewish community in Alexandria , and the Bible certainly was translated thereabouts at the time , this lends some weight to the " Letter of Aristeas , " or some equivalent .
While the Library is sometimes said to have been burned by the Arabs in 641 AD , it is likely that the original had already been destroyed .
When that would have happened is an obscure and controversial matter .
Both Plutarch and Ammianus Marcellinus positively assert that the Library burned in the course of the fighting between Caesar ( hold up in the Palace with Cleopatra ) and ( her brother ) Ptolemy XIII , when Caesar set fire to hostile ships , and the fire spread into the city .
However , other writers , like Dio Cassius , provide details that appear to go back to a lost treatment by Livy , that the fire was confined to the harbor area , where it chanced that some scrolls were burned .
While it is not clear whether these scrolls were actual books , or simply blank papyrus stock , it does mean that the libraries escaped harm .
This seems consistent with a subsequent visit of Strabo ( d.c.24 AD ) to the apparently undamaged Library .
Luciano Canfora argues in this vein [ The Vanished Library , A Wonder of the Ancient World , 1987 , translated by Martin Ryle , University of California , 1990 ] , also citing Orosius ( c.418 AD ) .
However , Orosius understands that books were burned , and gives a figure of 400,000 , which sounds like the magnitude reported for the whole Library [ Orosius , Seven Books of History against the Pagans , translated with an introduction and notes by A.T. Fear , Liverpool University Press , 2010 , p.296 ] .
A.T. Fear agrees with Canfora that Livy , the source for Dio , Orosius , and others , had only given a figure of 40,000 ( & Confora argues that his is also the number in alternative manuscripts of Orosius ) and allows that the burned books or scrolls may indeed have been in harbor warehouses [ p.297 , note 226 ] .
It is a shame that what were really the contemporary sources for these events have been lost .
The testimony of Plutarch and Ammianus , however , is an indication that by their time , the Library was gone .
This is puzzling in the case of Plutarch , who died after 120 AD , since the likely occasions for the destruction of the Library are all subsequent to this .
The best candidate may be the earliest .
The Emperor Aurelian retrieved the East from Zenobia in 272 AD .
Egypt was part of Zenobia 's acquisitions , but the records place all of the fighting in Syria and Palmyra .
On the other hand , Ammianus says that " under the rule of Aurelian , the quarrels of the citizens [ of Alexandria ] turned to deadly strife ; and then her walls were destroyed and she lost the greater part of the district called Bruchion , which had long been the abode of distinguished men " [ Ammianus Marcellinus II , translated by J.C. Rolfe , Loeb Classical Library , Harvard , 1940 , 1986 , pp.303-305 , boldface added ] .
So Aurelian , in reoccupying Egypt from Zenobia , had to deal with some kind of riot or revolt in Alexandria , in the course of which most of the Bruchion was destroyed , perhaps taking the Library with it -- although Ammianus does not actually say so ( perhaps because he already thinks that the Library burned in the days of Caesar ) .
Yet this is the most specific information from antiquity about destruction in the appropriate quarter of Alexandria .
Ths next possibility for damage to the Library is when Alexandria was burned and / or looted as the Emperor Diocletian put down the revolt of Achilleus in 298 AD .
We do n't have very good information about this , but it sounds like the city , under siege for eight months , suffered widespread damage .
Politically , this looks like a more serious event , and a more protracted war , than in the reign of Aurelian .
Yet its results are more a matter of inference .
Robin Waterfield apparently does not consider the events under Aurelian or Diocletian as decisive .
He does not cite any specific evidence , but he thinks that the tsunami of 365 AD , reported ( again ) by Ammianus , may have " devastated " the Library [ Dividing the Spoils , the War for Alexander the Great 's Empire , Oxford , 2011 , p.137 & p. 239 , note 14 ] .
I have not seen such a suggestion elsewhere , but we do know what a wall of water can do to buildings and books ; and Alexandria was certainly vulernable and badly hit .
This is a tempting possibility , but the theory is entirely speculative .
Meanwhile , we know that the Serapeum was destroyed in 391/392 AD , as the Emperor Theodosius closed pagan temples .
There is no specific reference to the destruction of its library , so , for all we know , the library may already have been destoyed ( in line with earlier events ) , or the books may have been dispersed .
If the destruction of the Great Library was ultimately the doing of the Arabs , we do have a story about it .
In his Taʾrîkh al - Ḥukamaʾ , ʿ Alî ibn al - Qifṭî ( c.1172-1248 ) relates a dialogue between ʿ Amr ibn al - ʿÂṣ , the conqueror of Egypt , and John Philoponus .
John asked what was to be done with the books of the Library , and ʿ Amr wrote an inquiry to the Caliph ʿ Umar .
The Caliph replied that if the books therein duplicated the Qurʾân , then they were unnecessary , and if they did not , or contradicted it , they were superfluous or pernicious .
Either way they should be destroyed .
ʿ Amr ordered that the books be used to fire the public baths , which were thus fed for six months .
This story , however , is only attested in much later sources .
ʾ Al - Qifṭî writes in the 13th century , six hundred years after the events .
An earlier version of the story , and perhaps its source , is related by Eutychius ( 877-940 ) , the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria ( 933-940 ) .
But Eutychius is still three hundred years after the event , and he may also be suspected of some bias and hostility in the matter .
Just as significant is the internal incoherence of the story .
John Philoponus was well known in Islamic philosophy , as Yaḥyâ an - Naḥwî , , " John the Grammarian . "
He had , however , died around 570 , decades before the Islamic Conquest of Eqypt , with his works subject to comment by the younger Simplicius , who died around 560 .
So the exchange between John and ʿ Amr cannot have happened , which casts doubt on the whole business .
Willing to believe worse of Christians ( who destroyed the Serapeum ) than of Muslims , Gibbon dismissed the account .
All things considered , the misadventures of earlier Roman history would seem the more likely explanation for the loss of the Great Library .
All the mystery , confusion , and speculation about the fate of the Library can have curious effects .
In a book about irrational numbers , the mathematician Julian Havil refers to " the staged destruction of the academic riches of Alexandria : "
... the Romans ( seemingly in 48 B.C.E. ) razed the great Library of Alexandria with its estimated 500,000 manuscripts , the Christians ( in 392 C.E. ) pillaged Alexandria 's Temple of Serapis with its possible 300,000 manuscripts , and finally the Muslims burnt thousands more of its book ( in about 640 C.E. ) .
[ The Irrationals , A Story of the Numbers You Can't Count On , Princeton University Press , 2012 , pp.11 - 12 ]
So Havil has come away with the impression that the Library was destroyed all over again on more than one occasion .
One wonders what he has been reading , especially as the numbers he gives are larger than are featured in the primary sources -- approaching a million books , depending what " thousands more " means for the Arabs .
And the accidental fire in the day of Caesar is now converted into a deliberate act , that he " razed the great Library . "
I do n't know why Caesar could possibly have wanted to destroy the Library .
Perhaps he has been confused with the Caliph Omar .
Well , why not .
Perhaps every reference to the loss of books , or damage to the city , was true .
That 's one way to look at it .
An equal or greater mystery than the fate of the Library is that of the tomb of Alexander the Great , the Sema or Soma , Σῶμα , which contained the mummified body of Alexander , after it had been transported from Babylon and stolen by Ptolemy I . With attested visits from Julius Caesar to Caracalla , references to the tomb continue into the Middle Ages , as with the great traveler Masʿûdî ( 896-956 ) , with uncertainty increasing about whether the original tomb is being shown , or something else has become misidentified as the tomb .
Subsequently , references simply disappear , and we are left with no hint of what happened to it .
One thing that was later being shown as the " tomb " of Alexander turned out to be the sarcophagus of Nectanebo II , which now is in the British Museum .
How this could have happened is discussed at the link .
Various efforts have been made to locate any evidence of its foundations under modern Alexandria , but the results seem negative or inconclusive .
There is also now the story , or speculation , that the tomb was actually at the Siwa Oasis , which Alexander had visited in his own lifetime , to consult the Oracle of Amun .
However , I am aware of no reference in ancient history to the tomb being there , while references to persons like Julius Caesar visiting the tomb do not involve accounts of the demanding journey that would have been necessary to reach the oasis .
So I expect that , if any evidence of the tomb survives , it lies buried under today 's Alexandria .
Perhaps the strangest claim about the great Library of Alexandria derives from " Afro - Centric " claims about Egypt , specifically that the Library held the ancient wisdom of Egypt and that Greek philosophers , like Aristotle , " stole " Greek philosophy from it .
There is so much about such an idea that is preposterous , yet in the 1990's I saw sober academics from Princeton University calmly asserting that Aristotle had " stolen " his philosophy in that way -- not anyone , actually , who knew anything about Aristotle or Egypt -- and , certainly , anyone denying the claim might worry about being accused of racism .
While , in response to such things , it was typically noted that Aristotle had died before the Library was even built , the problems with the claim go far deeper than that .
Not just the Library , but the entire city of Alexandria did not exist in Aristotle 's lifetime .
This was because Alexandria was not an Egyptian city at all , but a Greek one , founded by Alexander the Great .
Which is why it is named after him .
Still -- , ʾ Al - ʾIskandarîya .
In the era of the Ptolemies it would never be an Egyptian city , even as no Ptolemaic monarch ever learned Egyptian , except , it seems , for the last one , Cleopatra VII .
Since Alexandria was a Greek city , its Library was a Greek library .
If the Library had held the wisdom of the Egyptians , then one would expect its books to be in Egyptian .
Which means that Aristotle would have been unable to read them .
Indeed , while one expects that there were many Greeks who would have learned to speak Egyptian , there is no record of any Greek or Roman writer who had learned Egyptian , said so , and wrote knowledgeably about it .
The Greeks expected foreigners , βάρβαροι , to learn Greek .
And later writers who wrote , for instance , about hieroglyphics , like Plutarch , obviously did n't really know anything about them and said absurd things that confused scholars until the 19th century .
At the same time , even Greeks who must have learned some Egyptian did not thereby necessarily learn to read hieroglyphics , which were associated by all with the Egyptian priesthood , whose motivation to teach such things to foreigners was miniscule or non-existent .
It is possible that some Greeks might have learned to read or write the cursive script of Demotic ; but , again , we have no information from anyone who would have done so , or would have known anything about it .
Finally , there were going to be Egyptians who wrote about Egypt in Greek , beginning with Manethô .
Someone like Manethô , who clearly had access to Egyptian sources , such as King Lists , was at pains to present Egypt in the best possible light and to promote its greatness and importance .
And he liked the idea that some Greek philosophers , like Thales or Pythagoras , had come to Egypt ; but somehow it escaped him that Aristotle had taken all of his thought out of a Library that had not yet existed , and did n't have books in the Egyptian language anyway .
So this whole business is a modern fantasy of ethnic and , truly , racist mythologizing .
Besides the translation of the Bible , another consequence of the presence of the Jewish community at Alexandria may have been the growing use , even by pre-Christian pagans , of the seven day week .
This was , to be sure , not directly associated with Judaism , but with a version of the week produced in Alexandria in terms of the seven planets .
The " planetary " week is preserved in most of the languages of Francia , even while there is nothing of the sort in modern Greek , Hebrew , or Arabic .
Few languages , perhaps only Welsh and English , retain all the planetary names , with Jewish and Christian terms , usually for Saturday and / or Sunday , intruding elsewhere .
" Sunday , " indeed , retains the strongest pagan association as , even for Constantine , it commemorated the veneration of Sôl Invictus , the state god of the Tetrarchy .
Φιλάδελφος , " Philadelphus , " " brotherly ( or sibling ) love , " was a name assumed by Ptolemy II because he had married his sister , Arsinoë ( Ἀρσινόη , also Φιλάδελφο ς -- compounds are declined in the Second Declension [- ος ] even when feminine ) .
This was in immitation of Egyptian mythology and became a Ptolemaic practice .
Later , when Κλεοπάτρα , Cleopatra ( VII , picture below right , bas relief from Deir el Bahri ) met Julius Caesar in 48 BC , she was already married , at 16 , to her brother and co-ruler , Ptolemy XIII .
She also happened to be at war with him !
Caesar helped defeat her brother , who died in the process .
Formally marrying a younger brother , Ptolemy XIV , Cleopatra actually lived with Caesar , and went back to Rome with him in 46 .
After Caesar was assassinated in 44 , she returned to Egypt , killed her brother , and formally associated her son by Caesar , Caesarion , with her as Ptolemy XV .
The conquest of Egypt by Octavian / Augustus , resulted in Cleopatra and her new Roman protector , Anthony , committing suicide , and Caesarion being killed by Octavian .
In the clever HBO series Rome ( 2005 - 2007 ) , Caesarion is actually the natural son of a Roman solider , not Caesar , a soldier who is himself charged with killing the boy , but who , of course , saves him instead .
The series ends with the two of them walking off together .
At the beginning of the table above , and at left , we see the names " Ptolemy " and " Cleopatra " as they were written in hieroglyphics .
Since Egyptian did n't write vowels , and did n't have the letter " l , " certain glyphs have been adapted to write the vowels and " l " in these Greek names .
The Egyptian values of the glyphs are shown in red , and the alternate Greek values in blue .
The name " Ptolemy " on the Rosetta Stone , which was identified by the royal cartouche wrapped around it , was the beginning of the decipherment of hieroglyphics -- although the evident use of vowels confused matters for a little while .
Even here , however , not all the vowels are well indicated .
" Ptolemy " leaves out an " e " and ends by poorly representing the group " aio " in Greek .
The name " Cleopatra " ( Cleopatra I was a Seleucid princess who married Ptolemy V ) ends with the consonant " t , " which in Egyptian indicates the feminine gender ending and is only pronounced as the vowel " a . "
At the very end is the determinative of an egg , which evidently is used to reinforce the feminine gender ending .
In the strange political project of turning all Egyptians into Nubians , or even Nigerians , the Ptolemies pose a special challenge , since they were n't Egyptians at all but are nevertheless roped into the business because Cleopatra is too famous an Egyptian not to actually have been an Egyptian .
The easiest p

What a sad day for North Carolina ’s 5th Congressional district .
Rep .
Foxx was one of just 13 House members to vote against H RES 362 , a bill “ Expressing the support of the House of Representatives for the goals and ideals of the National School Lunch Program . ”
If you ca n’t say “ yes ” to the “ goals ” of America ’s national school lunch program , then what the heck can you say “ yes ” to ?
America ’s national lunch program provides a mid day meal to over 30 million school kids every day and snacks for children in after - school programs .
The School Lunch Program operates in public schools , non-profit private schools , and some child care facilities .
Its goal is to provide “ nutritionally balanced , low - cost or free lunches . ”
1 - in - 7 children in North Carolina lives in a household that is forced to reduce food intake , alter normal eating patterns , or go hungry because they lack the money or resources to obtain adequate food .
More than 800,000 NC school children take part in the National School Lunch Program each day .
In 2007 , even before the current recession hit , 7 out of 10 children in Alleghany County participated in the school lunch program .
Almost that many children got free or reduced lunches in Surry , Wilkes and Ashe counties , and more than half the children in Yadkin and Forsyth counties participated .
What was Rep .
Foxx thinking ?
Maybe she was still mulling over the words of Rush Limbaugh who said just this February about our national school lunch program : " It never occurs to the parents to go to the grocery store ? "
I doubt Rush Limbaugh has ever gone hungry , and it looks like Rep .
Foxx is n’t having any trouble finding her next meal either .
In fact , maybe she should get out of the Washington House members ’
Longworth cafeteria a little more often , where on Tuesdays she can dine on Wild Mushroom , Cheese Stuffed Ravioli at a discount and where the coffee comes from Pura Vida .
At least that ’s what the “ United States House of Representatives Dining Service Website ” says .
Most people outside of North Carolina who have ever heard of this unfortunate batshitcrazy extremist just know Virginia Foxx for her tight embrace of bigotry and radical right buffoonery .
Everyone knows she hates immigrants and she hates gays and she hates ... well ... she sure hates public education .
She just does n't believe in it .
Like so many Republicans , she does n't think education is for everyone , just for the wealthy .
Yesterday she had an opportunity for a two - for - one , a chance to show her disdain for needy children and for public school with one nasty vote .
My own congresswoman , Diane Watson , introduced a simple resolution yesterday ( which had over 50 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle ) , H.Res.362 .
It expresses the House 's support for the goals and ideals of the National School Lunch Program and " recognizes that our pupils deserve access to high - quality , safe , and nutritious meals in school . "
It passed 403 - 13 , every Democrat and 155 Republicans , including the entire GOP congressional leadership voting in favor .
So who could possibly be against this ?
Let me give you a hint .
Every single member of the North Carolina congressional delegation , DemocratsRepublicans voted in favor , except one .
Yes , of course , Virginia Foxx joined the hateful likes of hard core anti-America fanatics like Paul Broun ( R - GA ) , Scott Garrett ( R- NJ ) , Doug Lamborn ( R- CO ) , Cynthia Lummis ( R - WY ) , Tom McClintock ( R - CA ) , and Ted Poe ( R - TX ) , no one who is taken seriously by anyone in Washington .
This was about a program that the important agricultural interests in western North Carolina heartily support .
But , as usual , Foxx was n't looking out for the interests of her own constituents -- not the needy families she spits on but not even the well - connected AgriBusiness firms she 's usually sucking up to !
As you may know , Blue America has endorsed her opponent , plainspoken farmer and carpenter Billy Kennedy from Watauga County .
This morning we asked him how he left about Foxx 's bizarre vote .
It 's past time to retire Virginia Foxx back to her taxpayer subsidized Christmas tree farm and get her out of a position where she can continue hurting American families .
The woman is demented .
Please consider a contribution to Billy 's grassroots campaign

Economists tend to add more to the aggravations of everyday life than explain them .
Not this economist .
By Sam Pizzigati
Moshe Adler , Economics for the Rest of Us : Debunking the Science that Makes Life Dismal .
New York : The New Press , 2010 , 217 pp .
Do you , like Chuck Berry , “ go for that rock and roll music ” ?
Do you yearn to take your “ loved one over cross the tracks , ” or anywhere else , to hear some up close and personal ?
Then maybe you ’ve been wondering , over recent years , why the bands you adore seem to be touring less these days — and charging more for the concerts they do give .
Or maybe you worry more about Social Security checks than concert tickets .
And maybe you wonder why the average Social Security check today does n’t reach what an elderly person needs to pass the poverty line .
Or maybe you wonder why the CEO at the company where you work makes more in a morning than you make in a year .
You have questions .
In his new Economics for the Rest of Us , Moshe Adler has answers .
Good ones .
And his answers all revolve , sooner or later , around our world ’s increasingly unequal distribution of income and wealth — and power .
Adler teaches economics at Columbia University .
The vast majority of his colleagues in faculties of economics do n’t just oppose any moves to make that distribution more equal .
They tout , Adler notes , “ a theory that justifies the process that creates inequality to begin with . ”
Economics for the Rest of Us blasts away against that theory — and all the other contortions economists go through to make the case that “ what ’s good for the economy ” must always be what ’s “ good for the rich . ”
In fact , as Adler explains with entertaining examples , growing concentrations of income and wealth at society ’s summit make our lives far more “ dismal ” than they would be if we distributed resources and power more equitably .
Take those rock concerts , for instance .
Back in 1980 , in a considerably more equal United States than we have now , 73 percent of rock concerts in large venues charged the same ticket price for all seats .
To get a good seat , a dedicated fan only needed to show up early .
Fast forward a generation .
By 2003 , only 26 percent of concerts charged the same price for all seats .
And the best seats had increased the most in price .
Nothing strange , notes Adler , in any of this .
In a relatively equal society , with little difference in income between the rich and everyone else , monopolistic vendors have “ little to gain from selling only to the rich . ”
But that all changes when the rich go mega .
Vendors can charge more for their wares — and not worry if their less affluent customers can’t afford the freight .
The end result of this rising inequality : Average - income rock fans , observes Adler , “ must now content themselves with fewer live concerts because rock stars can now make more money charging higher prices and performing less . ”
To add insult to injury , a growing number of the gigs rock stars do perform come before audiences open to rich people only .
Elton John charges $ 1.5 million for a 90 - minute performance at a private party .
The Rolling Stones : up to $ 10 million .
In the grand scheme of things , of course , our world can survive the shenanigans of ungrateful and greedy rock - and - rollers .
But the same dynamics of inequality that aggravate rock fans help explain why so many people can’t afford AIDS drugs or stay in college or buy a home .
So what do we do ?
We need to ditch the “ pseudoscience ” that mainstream economics so often propagates , Economics for the Rest of Us advises , and press for new economic rules and regulations that can “ check the unfair distribution of the fruits of our labor . ”
One such rule , suggests author Adler , could “ set a maximum ratio at any given company between the highest executive compensation and the lowest worker ’s wage . ”
Most economists wo n’t like that notion at all .
After spending some time with this invigorating new read from Moshe Adler , you most likely will .

Up until now , the United States has operated under a " fractional reserve " banking system .
Banks have always been required to keep a small fraction of the money deposited with them for a reserve , but were allowed to loan out the rest .
But now it turns out that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wants to completely eliminate minimum reserve requirements , which he says " impose costs and distortions on the banking system " .
At least that is what a footnote to his testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services on February 10th says .
So is Bernanke actually proposing that banks should be allowed to have no reserves at all ?
That simply does not make any sense .
But it is right there in black and white on the Federal Reserve 's own website ....
The Federal Reserve believes it is possible that , ultimately , its operating framework will allow the elimination of minimum reserve requirements , which impose costs and distortions on the banking system .
If there were no minimum reserve requirements , what kind of chaos would that lead to in our financial system ?
Not that we are operating with sound money now , but is the solution to have no restrictions at all ?
Of course not .
What in the world is Bernanke thinking ?
But of course he is Time Magazine 's " Person Of The Year " , so should n't we all just shut up and trust his expertise ?
Hardly .
The truth is that Bernanke is making a mess of the U.S. financial system .
Fortunately there are a few members of Congress that realize this .
One of them is Republican Congressman Ron Paul from Texas .
He has created a firestorm by introducing legislation that would subject the Federal Reserve to a comprehensive audit for the first time since it was created .
Ron Paul understands that creating money out of thin air is only going to create massive problems .
The following is an excerpt from Ron Paul 's remarks to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at a recent Congressional hearing ....
" The Federal Reserve in collaboration with the giant banks has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen .
The foolish notion that unlimited amounts of money and credit created out of thin air can provide sustainable economic growth has delivered this crisis to us .
Instead of economic growth and stable prices , ( The Fed ) has given us a system of government and finance that now threatens the world financial and political institutions .
Pursuing the same policy of excessive spending , debt expansion and monetary inflation can only compound the problems that prevent the required corrections .
Doubling the money supply did n't work , quadrupling it wo n't work either .
Buying up the bad debt of privileged institutions and dumping worthless assets on the American people is morally wrong and economically futile . "
The truth is that the financial system that we have created makes inflation inevitable .
The U.S. dollar has lost more than 95 percent of the value that it had when the Federal Reserve was created .
During this decade the value of the dollar will decline a whole lot more .
That does n't sound like a very good investment .
But that is what happens when you give bankers power to make money up out of thin air .
And things are only going to get worse .
Especially if Bernanke gets his way and reserve requirements are eliminated entirely .
The U.S. economy is a giant mess already , and we have got a guy at the controls who simply does not have a clue .
It 's going to be a rough ride .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif . 
Google is trying once again to capture some of the momentum surrounding social networking companies like Facebook and Twitter by adding new features to Gmail , its popular e-mail service .
Later this week , Google will introduce add - ons to Gmail that let users post and view messages about their day - to - day activities , according to a person at Google briefed on its plans .
This simple tweak to Gmail will allow Google to mimic the status updates that have driven much of the success of Facebook and Twitter , as people return to the services again and again to check out what their friends and co-workers are doing .
To date , Google has allowed users to post only a brief message about their status through its
Chat system , which is linked to Gmail .
The new features would allow a more vibrant back - and - forth among Gmail users .
It is not clear whether Google will link the new Gmail features to rival social - networking services .

THE choice of John Pérez to take over as the new speaker of California 's state assembly later this month has been hailed as something of a breakthrough — but only because Mr Pérez is openly gay .
That he is also Latino is not considered newsworthy .
Kevin de León , who competed with Mr Pérez for the post , is also Latino , as are several of Mr Pérez 's predecessors , including his cousin , Antonio Villaraigosa , who is now the mayor of Los Angeles .
The weight of Latinos in the politics of states like California and Texas ( where the Mexican - American Legislative Caucus claims 44 of the 150 members of the state House of Representatives ) is already understood to be not only large but normal .
This year , after the decennial census that will confirm the huge growth of America 's Hispanic population , this influence will become both evident and normal in even more parts of the country .
Arturo Vargas , the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials ( NALEO ) , reckons that during the last census about 1 m Latinos were left out of the statistics because “ if you live in a garage or on somebody 's couch ” , as many Latinos do , it is easy not to be counted .
This time there is a concerted effort to change that .
And if the Census Bureau 's estimates are corroborated , almost 16 % of America 's population will be shown to be Hispanic ( since the label refers to ethnicity rather than race , anybody who considers himself Hispanic is deemed to be so ) .
That will compare with 13.4 % for blacks , according to the estimate .
Along with the ageing of the baby - boomers , this Latinisation is the most important demographic change in America , at least according to William Frey at the Brookings Institution , a think - tank in Washington , dc .
Hispanics have accounted for half of America 's total population growth since 2000 , he notes .
To see the America of the future , he says , look to its youth and its cities .
White children are already a minority in 31 of America 's 100 largest metropolitan areas .
For America as a whole , whites will become a minority in preschools by 2021 and in the general population by 2042 .
One result is more Latino officials and politicians .
Mr Vargas counts more than 6,000 in the country , mostly , it is true , on the boards of school and utility districts and other branches of local government that are “ the first rung on the political ladder ” .
But there are also two Latino cabinet members , 26 Latino representatives and a Latino senator .
The governor of New Mexico is a Hispanic .
Since Sonia Sotomayor became a justice on the Supreme Court , says Mr Vargas with a wink , “ there is only one office that has eluded us ” , and it is oval .
In the fictional world of “ West Wing ” ( see above ) , Matt Santos has already made that dream true .
And yet , Latinos have so far punched below their weight in American politics , in contrast to blacks , who have punched above theirs , says Paul Taylor , the director of the Pew Hispanic Centre .
Many are undocumented immigrants , many more are too young to vote , and others yet have simply not bothered .
Moreover , Latinos are “ notorious for not getting organised , ” says Mr Frey , since many consider themselves to be Mexican , Guatemalan , Salvadorean or Puerto Rican , say , rather than Hispanic .
As a result Latinos have been less strong as a block than the Irish were after the immigration wave of the 19th century , or than blacks have been recently , he says .
That may partly explain why Texas has never had a Latino governor , and California has had only one , back in the 1830s .
But this is changing .
“ Latinos respond to anger and fear , ” says Mr Vargas .
In California during the 1990s , Latinos read the anti-immigrant rhetoric of Pete Wilson , a Republican governor , as racist and were outraged when voters passed a ballot measure ( later ruled unconstitutional ) to bar undocumented immigrants from non-emergency public health care , welfare and education .
Californian Latinos decided to fight at the ballot box and registered in huge numbers , recalls Monica Lozano , a third - generation Mexican and the publisher of La Opinión , the largest Spanish - language newspaper in America .
A similar , and national , surge has been ongoing since the anti-immigrant media frenzy of 2006 .
The presidential election of 2008 was the first one in which Latinos played a large , and perhaps decisive , role .
They voted for Barack Obama over John McCain by a margin of more than two - to - one — not as large as Mr Obama 's margin among blacks , but of greater importance in states with lots of Latinos , which happen to include swing states .
Latinos helped Mr Obama to carry Florida ( where they had favoured George Bush in 2004 ) , New Jersey , Nevada and New Mexico , in particular .
In future elections , Latinos will be “ the centrepiece of the election , the kingmakers , ” says Samuel Rodriguez , a pastor and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference , an evangelical association .
They will be able to tilt the electoral balance and turn many red — or , conceivably , blue — states purple .
That is because Latinos are the quintessential independents , he says .
Latinos tend to place faith and family at the centre of their lives , and are thus naturally conservative on many social issues , from gay marriage to abortion , says Mr Rodriguez .
But the same values also incline them , in contrast to , say , white evangelicals , to communitarian economic policies usually considered liberal ( by the American definition of that word ) .
In California , say , they tend , as renters rather than homeowners , to be against Proposition 13 , a law that caps property taxes , and instead to favour taxes that pay for better education .
They consider themselves the future , says Ms Lozano , and want to invest in it .

" J'ai vu qu'il y avait des postes d'enseignants - remplaçants d'anglais
Sur le site de l'académie de Créteil .
En temps normal , je suis ouvrier - cordiste , mais dans une période où il n'y avait pas beaucoup de boulot , ma copine m'a inscrit .
Puis , il y a eu de nouveau du travail dans le bâtiment , je suis donc retourné à mon métier d'origine et je n'y pensais plus .
Mais , quinze jours après , je reçois un coup de téléphone m'informant que je suis convoqué pour un entretien à l'académie .
Je m'y rends sans trop y croire au départ .
Arrivé là , 5 ou 6 candidats patientent avec moi pour leur entretien .
Lorsque mon tour vient , une inspectrice me reçoit et me donne un extrait du journal le Washington Post à lire .
Puis à préparer un commentaire oral sur ce que j'ai compris .
Quand je commence à parler anglais ( il faut dire que je suis bilingue ) , elle ne s'attarde pas à m'interroger sur le texte .
Nous engageons une conversation cordiale .
Le courant passe bien .
Et voilà , mes quinze minutes d'entretien sont écoulées .

Une fois que tous les candidats sont reçus , l'inspectrice nous fait un condensé des cours de l'IUFM ( Institut universitaire de formation des maîtres ) en 45 minutes .
" Toujours respecter les délais que vous donnez à vos élèves " ou encore " Une copie doit être rendue le jour où vous aviez promis de le faire " .
Autre conseil : " Ne jamais faire de jeunisme , ne pas s'adapter à leur niveau de langage , ne pas adopter leur vocabulaire . "
Elle nous donne quelques exemples de mesures de discipline , en insistant sur le fait que si certaines paraissent désuètes , elles fonctionnent néanmoins .
" Faire attendre les élèves avant de leur dire de s'asseoir par exemple " .
A la fin de la journée , je rentre chez moi .
Peu après , j'ai une réponse : je suis retenu .
On me donne les clés du lycée , ma carte de cantine , et ...
Je signe mon contrat pour un poste à plein - temps dans un lycée du Val - de - Marne .
Je suis moi-même étonné par ces responsabilités que l'on me donne .
Et si j'étais un psychopathe ?
Comment ont - ils fait pour me faire confiance aussi vite ?
Trois jours passent et j'atterris un lundi matin à 9 heures tapantes dans une classe , devant des élèves de terminale .
Je ne suis pas impressionné .
Plutôt à l'aise , je n'ai pas peur de prendre la parole en public ...
Il faut dire que j'ai déjà enseigné dans ma vie : deux ans dans une école primaire .
L'enseignement m'a toujours branché , et j'ai fait mes études en ce sens .
C'est juste que , plus jeune , le statut de fonctionnaire ne cadrait pas avec mes envies de faire le tour du monde .
Aujourd ' hui , à 40 ans , je pense autrement .

La première semaine , tout se passe très bien .
Mes élèves et moi apprenons à nous connaître , j'évalue leur niveau .
C'est lors de la deuxième que ça se corse .
Il faut préparer des cours , m'organiser un planning , suivre un programme .
C'est le plus difficile , étant donné que je n'avais pas été formé .
Mais je parviens à sauver les meubles !
Je travaille beaucoup à la maison pour préparer mes cours , je m'aide des manuels , DVD , cassettes que je récupère chez les autres profs du lycée .
Actuellement , j'en suis à ma troisième semaine de cours .
Avec les élèves , j'ai joué cartes sur table car je craignais que mon look - je porte des dreadlocks - ne soit préjudiciable .
Pour l'instant , les retours sont plutôt bons .
Ils disent à leurs autres profs qu'ils ont " un prof d'anglais super " .
Je fais de vrais cours , peut - être que certains élèves en ont douté au départ .
Pour le moment , seule une classe - voie de garage - pose problème .
Mais je ne suis pas le seul à l'avoir constaté , d'autres enseignants s'en plaignent aussi ...
Certains de mes collègues enseignants sont surpris en me voyant .
D'autres , quand ils apprennent mon parcours , hallucinent , même s'ils sont plutôt satisfaits de moi dans l'ensemble .

A high - ranking female bishop has reportedly been caught drink driving .
Drink driving limit
In Germany , the drink driving limit is 1.1 parts per thousand .
Driving over the limit is treated as a crime .
The appropriate penalty is a fine or imprisonment for up to one year .
In addition , there is a driving ban for between six months and five years .

Margot Kässmann ( 51 ) , head of the Evangelical Church in Germany and the country 's most senior Protestant minister , was stopped by police in Hanover on Saturday .
She was asked to take an alcohol test which according to BILD 's information produced a result of 1.54 parts per thousand .
A Church spokesman claimed the figure was actually 1.1 .
Kässmann , the Chairwoman of the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany ( EKD ) , allegedly drove her VW Phaeton company car through a red light in the centre of Hanover by the town hall .
When she was stopped , a police officer smelt alcohol from inside the car and asked Kässmann to take an alcohol test .
A blood sample was taken which will be tested in a lab .
If the level of alcohol in the blood is confirmed , the bishop will face preliminary proceedings of a prosecution .
Kaessmann apparently told the police that she had only drunk a glass of wine .
But the bishop has had to hand over her driving licence !
Nutritional expert Sven- David Müller ( 40 ) said : “ A woman who is 1.6 m tall and who weighs around 55 kilos has to drink around 0.7 litres of wine or 1.5 litres of beer within an hour to have 1.3 parts per thousand of alcohol in the blood .
" Many factors play a role , for example , how often one drinks or how much one has eaten beforehand . ”
Margot Kässmann told BILD : “ I am myself shocked that I have made such a serious mistake .
I know how dangerous drink driving is .
I will of course surrender to the legal consequences . "

So it is probably the last program that anyone expected to serve as a catalyst for a continuing fight about the depiction of disabled people on television , and whether they are fair game to participate in and be the subjects of satire .
It is a dispute that has drawn in Sarah Palin , the former Republican governor of Alaska and 2008 vice - presidential candidate , who has a son with Down syndrome , and a “ Family Guy ” voice actress who , like the character she portrayed on the show , also has that disability .
Though the two women would seem to be coming from similar perspectives , they have ended up as far apart as possible .
The argument was started by a “ Family Guy ” episode shown on Sunday night , in which the teenage character Chris woos a classmate named Ellen , who has Down syndrome .
During a dinner date , Chris asks Ellen about her family , and she replies , “ My dad ’s an accountant , and my mom is the former governor of Alaska . ”

As the woman packed up her belonging to move seats , she “ looked at Nookella and saw him holding his erect penis . ”
The woman said that Nookella remarked , “ You caught me . ”
Nookella held a napkin in his left hand , the woman told the FBI .
According to Nishida ’s affidavit , a copy of which you ’ll find below , the woman “ did not look but heard a swishing sound .
She thought Nookella wiped something . ”

Nookella is facing a misdemeanor criminal complaint charging him with indecent exposure and if convicted , he faces a maximum of 90 days in jail and $ 5000 fine .
Further he has been ordered by the court not to fly on any commercial aircraft nor can he contact witnesses involved in the matter .
The only word that comes to my mind is “ disgusting ” !
Last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied an en banc rehearing of the case United States v. Lemus , which dealt with a warrantless police search of a suspect 's home after he was arrested outside of it .
As a result of the 9th Circuit 's denial , the search will stand , which has left Chief Judge Alex Kozinski none too happy .
In dissent , Kozinksi basically accused his colleagues of abandoning the Fourth Amendment :
This is an extraordinary case :
Our court approves , without blinking , a police sweep of a person 's home without a warrant , without probable cause , without reasonable suspicion and without exigency — in other words , with nothing at all to support the entry except the curiosity police always have about what they might find if they go rummaging around a suspect 's home .
Once inside , the police managed to turn up a gun " in plain view " — stuck between two cushions of the living room couch — and we reward them by upholding the search .
Did I mention that this was an entry into somebody 's home , the place where the protections of the Fourth Amendment are supposedly at their zenith ?…
The opinion misapplies Supreme Court precedent , conflicts with our own case law and is contrary to the great weight of authority in the other circuits .
It is also the only case I know of , in any jurisdiction covered by the Fourth Amendment , where invasion of the home has been approved based on no showing whatsoever .
Nada .
Gar nichts .
Rien du tout .
Bupkes .
Whatever may have been left of the Fourth Amendment after [ United States v. Black ] is now gone .
The evisceration of this crucial constitutional protector of the sanctity and privacy of what Americans consider their castles is pretty much complete .

Reason :
Add the exterior and interior maps of vertical gates for all generations ( including Generation VI ) and the Vermilion Port , Kanto Safari Zone / Pal Park , Bellchime Trail , Olivine Port , Amity Square and Fight Area gates as well as of the Pokémon League Reception Gate and ( Johto ) Safari Zone Gate .
Gates ( Japanese : ゲート gate ) are prominent features of routes in the Pokémon world .
They are located at junctions between different routes , or placed between a route and a city .
In the games
Generation I
In Generation I , gates serve to separate two areas and to guard the corresponding route , which is why a gatekeeper usually resides inside .
Upon speaking to the gatekeeper , they may offer words of advice or information about the route or city that the gate guards .
Gates usually share the background music with one of the two or more areas that they connect and this remained a consistent element of gates up to Generation V , where gates finally received their own background music .
Gates are n't locations on their own either , which is another element that was changed in Generation V , where gates are now locations by themselves .
Certain gates contain a second floor that features a spot where binoculars can be used to see faraway landmarks or even certain Pokémon .
In some of these , the player will usually encounter one of Professor Oak 's aides .
He will check the Pokédex and will reward the player if they have caught a given number .
Seven gates block the player from passing them until they meet certain requirements :
Riding the Bicycle inside the gates is not possible in Generation I .

Reason : Specific gates with different designs ..
Pokémon League Reception Gate
Generation II
Much like Generation I , gates serve to separate two areas .
Unlike other buildings , the player can often ride their Bicycle through these buildings to guarantee fast transportation .
None of the gates have second floors , including those in Kanto that had them in Generation I .
At the gate leading to Route 35 , to the north of Goldenrod City , is gatekeeper Randy , a non-player character , who will give a Spearow to the player that holds Mail to be delivered to his friend on Route 31 .
Four gates forbid the player to enter until they meet certain requirements :
National Park
Barrier Station to Bell Tower ( to Bellchime Trail )
Vermilion and Olivine Ports
Pokémon League Reception Gate
Underground Path
Generation III
Gates are sparse in the Hoenn - based Generation III games .
There are only two gates , each connected to the Seaside Cycling Road .
Players must be on their Acro Bike or Mach Bike in order to pass through a gate towards the Seaside Cycling Road .
In FireRed and LeafGreen , which are set in Kanto , gates serve the same purpose as in Generation I .
The only significant change is that since players can now trade items attached to a Pokémon , the Key Item Tea was introduced to prevent the player from advancing through the gates surrounding Saffron City prematurely .
This Key Item serves the same purpose as the drink from the original games .
Gates also exist in the Sevii Islands , giving access from the port to each town ; however , they are not used to connect areas , being instead both the entrance and exit points for the Seagallop Ferries .
The only common gates to both Hoenn and Kanto are the ones at Navel Rock and Birth Island .
Generation IV
Much like in past generations , the gates in Generation IV serve to separate two areas .
In Diamond and Pearl , the player cannot ride their Bicycle through these buildings , but this limitation was lifted in Platinum and HeartGold and SoulSilver .
Female gatekeepers were introduced in this generation .
In the Sinnoh - based games , most gates do n't have gatekeepers to watch over the route , but other travelers can be found inside , as well as a map showing the player 's current location .
Four gates have restrictions , however :
In HeartGold and SoulSilver , set in Johto and in Kanto , the gates are similar to those in Generation II and the gatekeepers in charge of guarding them are reinstated .
Like in Generation II , there are no gates with second floors , taking into account those in Kanto that had them in FireRed and LeafGreen .

Reason : Exteriors of regular gates and interior maps of the gates in Platinum .
Generation V
There are gates on several routes in Unova , each with a gatekeeper .
Gates now have ゲート Gate as background music , and each gate has a specific name ( e.g. : Opelucid Gate ) .
These names appear in - game when saving inside a gate and / or on the summary page of a Pokémon hatched inside a gate .
Due to this , gates are now locations by themselves .
Another new feature of gates in Generation V is the introduction of an electronic bulletin board and a screen on one of the walls .
The electronic bulletin board displays the current date , the weather in a few adjacent routes and towns ( including what location a windstorm or thunderstorm is brewing at ) , information about a nearby town or city , and information about where Pokémon are swarming ( once the player has obtained the National Pokédex ) .
The screen shows images from the connected location .
Also in these gates are a trash can and two chairs for a quick rest .
There are also some gates that only connect bridges and that have unique designs , though these gates do n't have electronic bulletin boards and monitors .
Two gates in Black and White impose certain requirements from the player to allow them to pass :
In Black 2 and White 2 , two other gates instead have restrictions for the player and are the Bridge Gates at Marine Tube .
Six gates initially inaccessible by the player are shared between Black and White and Black 2 and White 2 :

Reason : Exterior and interior images of special gates .
Practical use
The gates also have a practical use within the games ' programming .
As a player moves from a route to a town or city , the map 's textures ( tilesets in the first three generations ) must be loaded for each .
While this is easy when a city connects to relatively few routes , where all can use the same tileset / texture , areas like Saffron City and Hearthome City , which connect to many different areas , would need to load multiple tilesets / textures , which would end up crashing the game due to the system not having enough RAM to hold multiple tilesets / textures .
The programmers broke up the overworld with these gates to assure crash - free gameplay , and to properly display the routes , towns and cities , all while keeping the illusion of the overworld being a single continuous map .
In the Generation IV games , a player can use a " walk through walls " cheat to go from location to location without going through the gates .
By doing this , the map textures may fail to load properly and many of them may appear as blank white tiles .
Some buildings may appear to be invisible as well .
The cheat can also be used in the Generation V games ; however , the texture problem is very limited , if not completely absent .
After the first four generations , the need for using gates to justify unloading and reloading graphics lessened as games from Generation V onwards no longer attempt to present the overworld as a single map , and visible map transitions now occur between routes , towns and cities ( or , in certain cases , several streets of a single city ) .

A gate in Pokémon Adventures
In the Pokémon Adventures manga
In Kalling Kadabra , both Green and Blue tried to get to Saffron City through each of its four gates , but the guards refused to let them in .
In The Winged Legends , while the three Pokédex holders were battling Team Rocket at the Silph Co. , Brock , Misty , Erika , and Erika 's subordinates captured all the members of Team Rocket who were trying to escape the city through its four gates .
In Halting Honchkrow , Pearl , on his way to Veilstone City to save Azelf from the Team Galactic HQ , faced a heavily guarded gate leading from Route 214 to Veilstone City .
Thankfully , with the help of the Unown he and Pearl had befriended earlier at the Solaceon Ruins , Diamond was able to break through the masses of Galactic Grunts blocking the gate and enter the city .
In Sandstorm , Black and White were seen trying to go through the Castelia Gate to Route 4 , but were temporarily forced back by the intense sandstorm on the other side .
The Route 4 Lumiose Gate appeared in PS558 , where X , Y , Trevor , Shauna , and Tierno entered Lumiose City through it .
In Charging After Electrike , the group exited Lumiose City through the Route 5 Lumiose Gate .
The Route 4 Lumiose Gate made a brief reappearance in Xerneas Gives when the group re-entered Lumiose City through it .
Trivia
Due to their design , the gates in the Sevii Islands are the only ones that have their supporting pillars built on water .
They are also the only gates that have a single access point , given that they are the gates of the islands ' ports , with one common entrance and exit for the Seagallop Ferries .
These gates are all headed north as well .

JIDDA , Saudi Arabia  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke to young women at a Saudi women ’s college here on Tuesday , the site of a spirited exchange five years ago with a female official of the Bush administration over the rights of women in Saudi Arabia .
But despite Mrs. Clinton ’s invitation to raise the issue , none of the women in the audience asked her about it .
The discussion , while lively , focused on the same foreign - policy and security themes that have dominated her visit to the Persian Gulf , notably Iran and the Middle East peace process .
Mrs. Clinton said she wanted to hear the views of the students on women ’s rights , noting that “ American media presents a very unidimensional portrayal of Saudi women , ” focusing on the black veils most wear .
She called for women to get better access to education and to play a bigger role in society .
But she avoided criticism of Saudi Arabia , instead praising King Abdullah for his support of coeducational and women ’s - only institutions , like the one that played host to her visit , Dar al - Hekman College .
At least one quarter of meat on sale in the UK comes from farms that do not have to meet national standards for animal welfare , a Guardian investigation has found .
The poor conditions in which the animals can be kept include greater crowding in chicken and turkey sheds , cage - like pens for female pigs and physical castration with no anaesthetic for boars .
The UK has relatively high standards of animal welfare compared with the rest of the world , including the European Union .
However , there are no restrictions on importing meat from countries that do not impose such standards , where costs are often lower .
There are renewed calls from consumer and farming groups for better labelling of products and action to bring standards into line , at least across the EU .
" Sometimes people may be making false assumptions about products , sometimes they may have genuinely lower standards – I do n't think people know what the situation is , " said Sue Davies , chief policy adviser for the consumer lobby group Which ?.
Kevin Pearce , head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union ( NFU ) , said some overseas farmers would be required by retailers to meet higher standards than their national minimums .
However , there is particular concern over the quality of imported food used in restaurants , pubs , canteens and other catering outlets , which now accounts for half of the money spent on food in the UK , said Pearce .
" If consumers know anything about it , they probably think all the standards are the same , " he said .
" It 's not about farmers whingeing , we want to be able to compete fairly .
If the customers say ' that 's the standard we want ' , we want to do our best to produce it .
Where we have a problem is if the price is too high or the supply too short they 'll go elsewhere to get it . "
Public concern about the costs of modern food has been growing after a number of health scares , high - profile books and , last week , the UK premiere of the Oscar - nominated documentary Food Inc , which claims to expose the " highly mechanised underbelly " of the industry .
The NFU has previously complained that the differences in standards are unfair to UK farmers , for example claiming that half of the pork market went overseas when sow pens and tethering were banned .
However the scale of the problem has been revealed by a Guardian analysis of the most recent full - trade figures available , for 2007 .
It found that :
• More than half of bacon sold in the UK comes from the Netherlands , Denmark , Germany and Italy , where farmers can keep sows in smaller pens and for longer periods .
• 43 % of other pork products come from Denmark , Germany the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg , where the same poorer conditions on pig farms are allowed .
• One quarter of poultry sold in the UK comes from seven European countries and Brazil , which allow higher stocking of chickens and do not force farmers to use more comfortable dry bedding .
• 3 % of beef is imported from Brazil , where practices including hot branding , castration and dehorning of cattle can be carried out without anaesthetic .
Products from those major importers accounted for about one quarter of all meat sold , by weight , in the UK that year .
Total imports of pork , poultry , beef and veal made up one third of all meat sales , and it is likely that some of the remaining imports came from smaller trading countries also with lower standards .
Concerns have also been raised about imports of lamb and mutton from Australia , where mulesing – cutting away the woolly skin around the buttocks to prevent pests breeding – is common .
The Soil Association , the trade body for organic farmers , has raised concerns that imported organic pig and poultry meat often comes from countries with lower organic standards than those it sets in the UK .
The NFU said it wanted both better labelling and education about the standards for imported meat on sale , and fairer trade rules to create a level playing field between UK and overseas farmers .
Davies said Which ?
was already part of a lobby pressing the EU to make retailers label food more clearly with the country of origin .
Most food does not have to be labelled , and often labels only show the country where the food was last processed .
" There are three issues : being clear about the relative quality of our standards and whether it 's beneficial to be buying British , or not ; whether we should have a simpler system across the EU , even should they have the same standards ; and there 's a lot of consumer demand to have information about the country of origin , " said Davies .
UK meat key concerns
Poultry : Most UK farmers are limited to a maximum of 38kg per square metre of space – 15 birds at their fattest – compared with one third more than that in the EU .
UK standards for access to drink and feed , and healthy bedding are also higher , said the NFU .
Pigs : Farrowing crates are used in the UK for a few weeks after piglets are born , something which hugely reduces young mortality ; most countries use significantly smaller sow pens and the animals are kept in them most of the year .
Beef :
The chief concern is imported meat from Brazil , where cattle can be castrated up to six months old , dehorned and hot - branded , all without anaesthetic – all of which are banned in the UK .
Organic :
The biggest UK organic body specifies that pigs are fully free range and poultry flocks no bigger than 500 birds to increase access outdoors and reduce bullying .
Many other certifiers allow pigs to be often kept indoors and unlimited chicken flocks .
Last year DISCOVER asked the question , " Did We Mate With Neanderthals , or Did We Murder Them ? "
Now , Zach Zorich at Archaeology magazine is asking another big question about our hominid siblings :
Should we bring them back ?
Thanks to a slew of recent advances , the possibility is getting closer .
80 beats reported a year ago that researchers had published the rough draft of the Neanderthal genome .
However , that 's likely to contain many errors because it's so difficult to reconstruct ancient DNA .
Within hours of death , cells begin to break down in a process called apoptosis .
The dying cells release enzymes that chop up DNA into tiny pieces .
In a human cell , this means that the entire three - billion - base - pair genome is reduced to fragments about 50 base - pairs long [ Archaeology ]
.
Even if scientists succeed in figuring out the entire Neanderthal genome , they'd be faced with another problem before they could even consider the possibility of cloning one of these ancient hominids :
We do n't have any living Neanderthal cells to work with .
Thus , researchers will have to figure out how to put DNA into chromosomes , and how to get those chromosomes into the nucleus of a cell .
What about altering the DNA inside a living human cell , and tweaking our genetic code to match the Neanderthal's ?
This kind of genetic engineering can already be done , but very few changes can be made at one time .
To clone a Neanderthal , thousands or possibly millions of changes would have to be made to a human cell ’s DNA [ Archaeology ]
.
Even if scientists manage to put Neanderthal DNA in a cell nucleus , their problems are n't over .
The next step in creating a baby clone is to move the cell nucleus into the egg of a related species in a technique called nuclear transfer , and then implanting the altered egg in a female who can bear it to term .
But in this process , which has been extensively tested on animals , cells often get sick or die , causing fetuses to die in the womb or clones to die young .
That 's why the vast majority of scientists oppose using this method on people .
Even if nuclear transfer cloning could be perfected in humans or Neanderthals , it would likely require a horrifying period of trial and error [ Archaeology ] .
But Archaeology suggests that many of these obstacles will eventually be overcome , and proposes another cloning option : making Neanderthal stem cells .
Last year researchers managed to turn mouse skin cells back into a pluripotent state , where they can act like stem cells , and used those to create a cloned mouse .
Cloning a Neanderthal is a lot different than cloning a mouse , but if the process worked , a cloned Neanderthal would grow up with their genes expressing they way they were meant to .
That 's the " could we . "
But what about the " should we ? "
More work has been done on this than you might think .
In 1997 ,
Stuart Newman , a biology professor at New York Medical School attempted to patent the genome of a chimpanzee - human as a means of preventing anyone from creating such a creature [ Archaeology ]
.
But he lost his case because the patent office said it would violate the 13th amendment prohibitions against slavery .
And since Neanderthals would be even more human , it stands to reason that they 'd receive at least some human rights protections .
Rightfully so .
But as the bioethicist Bernard Rollin points out in the Archaeology piece , there 's more to worry about than the law .
While Neanderthals are our close relatives on the evolutionary tree , you 'd know one if you saw one .
Tulane anthropologist Trenton Holliday argues that they could talk and act like us , therefore eventually they 'd fit in .
But that seems like wishful thinking .
With no culture , no peers , and an unknown capacity to cope with the modern world mentally or physically , a Neanderthal would be adrift — caught between a zoo animal and a human being .
The main point in cloning one would be for scientists to study it , but as law professor Lori Andrews says , a Neanderthal could be granted enough legal protection to make doing extensive research on it illegal , not just unethical .
That 's not to say there would be no benefits to science .
But some things are best left in the past .

Bioacoustician Bernie Krause has recorded the amazingly rhythmic vascular systems of thirsty trees :
alt : http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/18/guestblog/tree2%20copy.mp3
He discovered that the cells in the xylem and phloem of the tree fill with air to try to maintain the osmotic pressure that 's usually produced by the sucking of water up through the roots .
At a certain point the cells burst .
Krause adds " When they pop , they make a noise : we can't hear it , but insects can .
And when insects hear multiple cells popping , they 're drawn to the tree because certain ones are programmed to expect sap .
And when the insects are drawn to the tree , the birds are drawn to the tree to eat .
it 's all a microhabitat formed by sound :
The sound of popping cells . "
( Incidentally , when the xylem cells pop , they die and form the rings of the tree ) .
Recordings are made at their natural high frequency ( about 47 kHz ! ) with a hydrophone and then slowed down by about a factor of seven .
Bernie 's done some fascinating work in the field of " biophony " , which is based around the idea that every animal in an eco-system has its own acoustic territory , or bandwidth of sound that it vocalizes in .
If something comes in and takes over a certain bandwidth ( like the regular route of a noisy airplane ) entire populations can suffer , or be forced to adapt .

Embedded PyObjC
Virgil Dupras
2010-02-08
When people think of a PyObjC application , they usually think of a Python application that uses Objective - C libraries .
However , it 's also possible to do the opposite : An Objective - C application that embeds Python code through a plugin .
Building an application this way has advantages ( speed , integration and memory usage ) and should be used more often .
This article explains why and how to achieve this .
Why ?
Speed .
In a GUI application , there 's usually many , many calls being made all the time by the different elements of the GUI .
For example , NSTableView 's datasource and delegate methods are called tons of times at each redraw .
Each calls having to pass through the PyObjC bridge is inherently slower than a native call .
While machines are usually fast enough for this not to be noticeable most of the time , there might be situations where it's not the case , scrolling a large list for example .
I have no benchmarks to back this .
All I can tell you is that my first PyObjC application , musicGuru , was initially all Python .
Scrolling was sluggish and I decided to give the Embedded Way a try .
It fixed the problem and I never looked back again .
Integration .
Although XCode and Interface Builder offer Python integration ( and since I never used them , I do n't know if it works well ) , there 's no doubt that Apple 's efforts are much more axed on Objective - C. Auto - completion , help , build process , these are all designed with Objective - C in mind .
Memory usage .
Since PyObjC 2.0 , metadata from Apple 's bridge support files are loaded in memory , leading to pretty high initial memory usage ( as I mentioned in my article about 64 - bit PyObjC applications ) .
When you embed Python in your Objective - C application , it usually means that your Python code use fewer Objective - C classes , thus allowing you to use neat tricks to reduce that memory usage ( more about this below ) .
I 'm talking about saving tens of MB of initial memory usage here , so it 's not negligible .
How ?
Update 2010 - 11 - 23 : I published a project containing a minimal application with embedded PyObjC .
You might want to take a look .
The PyObjC website has an old tutorial about embedding Python [ dead link ] already , but it unfortunately does n't explain much besides the basics .
One thing it does n't explain ( because all instantiations in the example take place in the NIB ) is how to locate a class in a plugin , interface it and instantiate it .
This is what I 'm going to do right away with an example .
Let 's say that we want to build a PyObjC application embedding Python that simply displays a list of strings in a NSTableView .
Let 's first write our Python class :
class Foobar ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
strings = [ ' foo ' , ' bar ' , ' baz ' ] def count ( self ) : return len( self.strings ) def string_at_index ( self , index ) : return self.strings [index ]
This is , of course , stupidly - engineered for the purpose of the example .
The next thing we have to do is to create an interface that converts calls with Objective - C conventions to calls with Python conventions :
import objc from Foundation import NSObject from foobar import Foobar class PyFoobar ( NSObject ) : def init ( self ) : self = super ( PyFoobar , self ) .init ( ) self.py = Foobar ( ) return self @objc.signature ( 'i@ :') def count ( self ) : return self.py.count( ) @objc.signature('@@ :i') def stringAtIndex_ ( self , index ) : return self.py.string_at_index( index )
The signature decorators are required so that PyObjC correctly converts int s. Methods that have nothing but NSObject subclasses as arguments or return values do n't need any signature .
Now that we have this , we 're ready to build a plugin with py2app ( the old tutorial explains how to do it ) .
Use the interface python script as the " main plugin script " in the setup config .
Once you have the plugin , you can now create your Objective - C project .
The first thing you should do is to create a header file describing the interface of your Python classes :
@interface PyFoobar : NSObject {} - ( int ) count ; - ( NSString *) stringAtIndex :( int ) aIndex ; @end
Now comes the " magic " part where you instantiate your python classes in Objective - C .
This is done through NSBundle .
Let 's imagine that we have a NIB - based NSWindowController with a table view that has itself as its datasource and a PyFoobar * py member .
Its implementation would look like that :
- ( void ) awakeFromNib { NSString * pluginPath = [ [ NSBundle mainBundle ] pathForResource : @" your_plugin " of Type :@" plugin " ] ; NSBundle * pluginBundle = [ NSBundle bundleWithPath:pluginPath ] ; Class pyClass = [ pluginBundle classNamed : @" PyFoobar " ] ; py = [ [ pyClass alloc ] init ] ; } - ( void ) dealloc { [ py release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; } - ( NSInteger)numberOfRowsInTableView:( NSTableView *) tableView { return [ py count ] ; } - ( id) tableView : ( NSTableView *) tableView objectValueForTableColumn:( NSTableColumn *) column row :( NSInteger ) row { return [ py string AtRow:row ] ; }
You now have a working Objective - C application that embeds Python code !
I wrote earlier that I 'd talk about a neat trick to reduce memory usage .
In the interface code , our Foundation import will cost about 13 mb ( in 32 - bit ) of memory usage .
We can consider ourselves lucky that we embed Python , or else we 'd need to import NSTableView from AppKit , which would increase memory usage even further .
However , all we use is NSObject and we do n't call anything on it .
Could n't we find a way to avoid that Foundation import altogether ?
The answer is yes .
All you have to do is :
import objc NSObject = objc.lookUpClass(' NSObject ')

And being a homo wrecker is better , Maggie ?
by Jeremy Hooper
About Rielle Hunter and her comments to GQ regarding John and Elizabeth Edwards ' state of affairs , marriage equality 's most indefatigable foe , Maggie Gallagher , offers up the following quip :
" I have never seen a more aggressive display of narcissism : blaming [ Elizabeth Edwards ] for failing to take responsibility for Hunter 's acts of adultery -- acts that destroyed three children 's home and put a fourth child -- her own -- in a fatherless home as well . "
THE RIGHT TO ADULTERY [ Yahoo ]
Which is valid , as far as it goes .
We definitely see some narcissism in Hunter 's comments , and would certainly consider ourselves on Team Elizabeth , if asked to take sides .
But here 's the thing :
The last person in the world who needs to be lecturing us about narcissism when it come to marriage is Margaret Gallagher Srivastav !
This is a person who dedicates 9/10 of her professional life to keeping gay and lesbian couples civilly unmarried , because she , based on her Catholic beliefs , simply does n't think same - sex couples are morally fit to be legal spouses .
She goes on this media outlet and that news program , speaking to anyone who will listen about " the two great halves of humanity , " as if opposite - sex couples are on some unreachable moral pedestal to which gay duo can only dream of one day reaching .
Maggie 's work selfishly robs millions of decent couples of time , resources , rings , cake , open bars , and most of all : peace .
No , Maggie 's not destroying three children 's home -- she 's destroying countless many more than that !
Before casting stones at Hunter , perhaps she should look at the legally - estranging shotgun in her own narcissistic hand .
Your thoughts
Unlike Maggie , I 've never put a child in a fatherless home .

I kind of hope Ol ' Mags takes on adultery .
I know this sounds mean , but I would like to see straight people hurt by her actions .
Let them see that once you give Maggie and her kind permission to enter into the bedrooms and lives of gay people , you 've given her the right to enter the bedrooms and lives of everyone she deems immoral .

AS HISTORY WOULD see it , 1956 would be year one , ground zero in the phenomenon known as Elvis Presley .
So much metamorphosis would occur in both his personal and professional lives that 1956 could be seen as a reference point — the time when Elvis went from regional performer to national sensation , ending his age of innocence .
Barbara Hearn , a dark - haired Memphis beauty he had known casually for years , was one of the young women he dated that year .
Decades later , Barbara still spoke fondly of their time together , despite the heavy competition for Elvis ’ attention .
“ My husband tells everybody that Elvis and I dated steadily for a year .
And I say , ‘ No .
I dated him steadily for a year .
He did n’t date anybody steadily for more than 15 minutes . ’ ”
Barbara never asked him about all the other women in his life , but she suspected that he divided them into “ good girls ” and “ road girls , ” the latter of whom were fair game and did n’t mean anything beyond the moment .
“ He was very , very respectful to women .
If you could see how he treated me , my mother , his own mom , his grandmother — we were people he cared about .
The ones who went backstage were in a different category .
They were fans . ”
ON APRIL 15 , 1956 , Elvis , billed as “ the Nation ’s Only Atomic - Powered Singer , ” played the Municipal Auditorium in San Antonio .
There to meet him was Kay Wheeler , the virginal 17 - year - old president of the first national Elvis Presley fan club .
Kay was in something of a teenage haze .
A year earlier , she had n’t even been able to find a picture of Elvis .
But by early 1956 , working from her Dallas home and aided by two sisters , she had built the club into more than 20,000 members , each of whom received a large autographed photo of Elvis , a “ Presley pink ” membership card , and a four - page monthly newsletter .
Kay was as atomic - powered as the object of her affections , and only Col. Tom Parker , Elvis ’ manager , matched her devotion and energy in promoting Elvis into a major heartthrob .
At the beginning of April , Kay had received a letter from Parker ’s secretary telling her that Elvis would be on tour in Texas , and inviting her to attend the kickoff show in San Antonio .
When the big day came , she chose a clinging sheath dress , dangly pearl earrings , and a pair of spike heels .
Then she boarded a Greyhound bus for a 270 - mile ride that would mark her first trip away from home .
When she arrived at the auditorium , she flashed a telegram from Col.
Parker , and was waved through by a guard .
Backstage , Parker ’s second in command , Tom Diskin , pointed to an unmarked door and said , “ Elvis is in his dressing room .
Just go on in . ”
Elvis was sitting in front of a mirror , smoothing down his dark - blond ducktail , and he turned to look over his shoulder at her .
Kay ’s knees went wobbly .
“ Hi , Elvis , ” she managed .
“ I ’m Kay Wheeler , the president of your fan club . ” “ My fan club president ? ” he asked .
He seemed surprised .
Kay thought he knew she was coming , but there was n’t time to think about that now , because the 21 - year - old singer had on a blue satin shirt that matched his eyes , and there was a mischievous grin on his face .
“ If any man ever stepped out of a dream , ” she thought , “ it was Elvis Presley . ”
Elvis stood and walked toward her , staring .
The room began swirling , but she could see he was still smiling , and she thought he was about to say something .
Instead , he put his hands on her shoulders , and then began following her curves .
He slid his hands up over her hips , then moved his fingers to her waist , and nearly up to her breasts .
Finally , he spoke : “ Is all this really you ? ”
“ He pretty much groped me , ” she recalls .
“ I was overwhelmed .
He came on like Godzilla . ”
Kay stepped back until his hands dropped away , and then they were both embarrassed .
“ Gee , ” she murmured .
Just about then , the door opened , and in came a gaggle of reporters to ask him questions .
Kay stood back and watched .
Then , in the middle of the interview , Elvis motioned for her to come over .
Before she knew what was happening , he grabbed her , turned her around , and pulled her toward him until her back was pressed up against him .
He folded her into his arms and kissed the side of her face as photographers snapped away .
Kay could n’t believe what was happening .
“ He should have been under freaking arrest .
He ’s feeling me up in that picture .
Those are some of the most blatantly sensual poses that I ’ve ever seen him in with a girl . ”
Just before going onstage , he kissed Kay passionately , pushing against her in a way no boy had done before .
Then he launched into the first of two shows before 6,000 deafening fans .
ALREADY , ELVIS ’ REPUTATION as a sex symbol was becoming a burden .
Some years later , in the 1960s , he would tell Larry Geller , a member of his entourage , that in the early days of his fame he had relations with so many women that he was hospitalized for exhaustion .
Whether that was the reason behind a 1955 hospital visit in Jacksonville , Fla. , is n’t known .
But according to Geller , the experience chastened Elvis .
Elvis ’ sex - god label also seemed to hamper him psychologically .
Women assumed , from his image and his movements onstage , that he was a lover of legendary proportions .
But he was insecure about his sexual prowess , fearing that he might not measure up in bed to women ’s expectations .
This was a factor is his gravitation toward 13 - and 14 - year - old girls .
Young teens were likely to be satisfied simply to make out — precisely where Elvis felt most at ease .
Sometime in the fall of 1956 , Elvis ’ father , Vernon , was visiting a Memphis Oldsmobile dealership where the family often had their cars repaired , when the owner , a man named Mowel , asked if his 14 - year - old daughter , Gloria , could meet Elvis .
Vernon Presley said that was ?ne , and for Gloria to come on over anytime .
On Oct. 11 , Gloria showed up at the tidy one - story ranch house on Audubon Drive that Elvis had bought for his family in the spring .
She was shocked to see Elvis answer the door himself .
Gloria was cute , sweet , and personable , and she knew music — she identified “ Ruby , Baby , ” a recent hit by the Drifters , whom Elvis loved , playing on the phonograph in the den .
So after her visit , Elvis invited her back another day .
Soon , she was taking her friends Heidi Heissen and Frances Forbes , who were also 14 , and Elvis began asking them over for evening swims at the house , or just to watch TV .
Frances , a petite , dark - haired beauty , had been hanging out by the gate of the house since she was 13 .
“ He did n’t pay any attention to me then , but when I was 14 , he noticed me .
Fourteen was a magical age with Elvis .
It really was . ”
Fanatical in their devotion , the three girls followed Elvis everywhere he went in Memphis .
Elvis had an easy rapport with the trio and felt as if he could ask them what the other kids were saying about him and his music .
They were his local contacts with the larger fan base , but it went deeper than that .
“ He was fascinated with them , ” said Lamar Fike , an aspiring deejay who was starting to integrate himself into Elvis ’ entourage .
In no time , Elvis was inviting the girls to go to a local roller - skating rink , and by 1957 , they became his constant companions , part of the group that went to the nearby Mid-South Fairgrounds to crash into one another in the dodge - ’em cars and eat endless Pronto Pups .
“ They were just as nutty as fruitcakes , but they were fun , ” Fike remembers .
“ All three of them were pretty cute girls . ”
As Elvis ’ attraction to the girls grew , they started staying for private pajama parties — just 14 - year - old Heidi , Gloria , Frances , and their 22 - year - old host , holed up in his bedroom , a pale - yellow room equipped with a selection of pink stuffed animals .
Elvis did n’t seem to mind that his mother had chosen such a girlish motif .
“ When you were in that room , ” says Gloria , “ you wanted to shut out the whole world for the rest of your life . ”
In an odd suspension of time and gender , Elvis became not only their age but also a teenage girl .
After swims in the Presleys ’ pool , he ’d wash and dry their hair , and they ’d blow his hair dry , too .
He ’d tease them , say to Gloria , “ Frances was jealous tonight because I was throwing you in the pool ! ”
Then they ’d all giggle , and he ’d show them how to put makeup on their eyes the way he liked it , heavy on the shadow and mascara .
Sometimes he ’d apply the eyeliner himself .
Then they ’d lie on the beds and roughhouse and have pillow ? ghts , Elvis tickling and kissing them until they could n’t take it anymore .
The girls insisted that nothing overtly sexual happened inside Elvis ’ pastel lair , though it came close on occasion , as Gloria later remembered .
“ We ’d tickle , ? ght , laugh , mess around , but all you ’d have to say is , ‘ Stop ! ’ , and he ’d roll over and quit .
It would never be mentioned again that night .
But next time , it would be the same thing exactly .
You ’d ? ght with him , kid around , and scuf ?e .
The next thing , he ’d get serious and you ’d just push him away .
I think that if he really pushed , I would have done it . ”
No matter how Elvis rationalized his interest in mentoring young girls , the relationship contained a strong erotic element .
Elvis and the girls would sit on the bed yoga - style , with Elvis in the middle , and he ’d kiss each one .
“ Gloria is jealous ’ cause I kissed Frances , ” he ’d say , and then turn it around : “ Frances is jealous ’ cause I kissed Heidi . ”
Eventually , they ’d tire of it all , and Elvis would turn out the light , lying with an arm around two of them , with the third girl stretched out across his feet .
“ Elvis was always kissing , ” says Frances , “ and it was a good kiss , a real good one .
He might be doing anything — playing pool , anything — he ’d walk up and kiss you , or he might turn his cheek for you to kiss him .
He was especially romantic when it was just you and him .
He might talk to you about things that bothered him , and just like teenagers , you ’d neck a little bit .
Elvis was like a teenager somewhat — the things we did were things that kids do .
They really were all very innocent . ”
Heidi , Gloria , and Frances were always the last fans to leave Audubon Drive .
At 3 or 4 in the morning , Elvis would sit up and kiss each girl and say , “ I love you , and I ’ll see you tomorrow . ”
Fike would drive the girls home , and they ’d catch a few hours of sleep before getting up and going to junior high .
“ The amazing thing is that I never had one problem with any of the parents , ” Fike says .
“ Not ever .
It was something I assumed would not happen , and it did n’t . ”
Elvis did n’t want his mother to know they stayed so late , and before Gladys Presley got up , they were out and gone .
But chances are she was aware that they were there , and she probably did n’t mind .
Gladys knew that Elvis , a boy - man , was looking for a child - woman he could mold into his idea of a perfect mate .
Fourteen - year - olds were just the right age , as they allowed him to play the role of the older man who would teach them about life .
If he could ?nd one who had his mother ’s coloring , who shared her values , and who also somehow felt like his twin soul , she would hold him captive .
His friendship with the trio of Memphis teenagers lasted through the early 1960s , about the time he met 14 - year - old Priscilla Beaulieu , his future wife .

Billions of pounds of public money is spent on stem cell research Stem cell experts say they believe a small group of scientists is effectively vetoing high quality science from publication in journals .
In some cases they say it might be done to deliberately stifle research that is in competition with their own .
It has also emerged that 14 leading stem cell researchers have written an open letter to journal editors in order to highlight their dissatisfaction .
Billions of pounds of public money is spent on funding stem cell research .
The open letter to the major scientific journals claims that " papers that are scientifically flawed or comprise only modest technical increments often attract undue profile .
At the same time publication of truly original findings may be delayed or rejected " .
Two internationally - renowned researchers have spoken to BBC News about their concerns .
They are Robin Lovell - Badge , who is speaking in a personal capacity , and Austin Smith , from the University of Cambridge .
Professor Lovell - Badge said : " It 's turning things into a clique where only papers that satisfy this select group of a few reviewers who think of themselves as very important people in the field is published .
It 's an editor 's responsibility to ensure that delays are minimised , and we stop using any referee where a pattern of delays is apparent
Philip Campbell , Nature " You can get a lot of hype over a paper published on stem cell research that 's actually a minimal advance in knowledge whereas the poor person that is doing beautiful research that is not catching the eye of the editor , you do n't get to hear about that , even though it could be the world changing piece of research . "
The issue is important because billions of pounds of public money are spent on funding stem cell research internationally .
The funding is directed largely towards groups and individuals who have had their research published in the top journals .
So if the journals are getting it wrong then public money is going to waste .
Dr Philip Campbell , the editor of Nature , which is one of the leading journals in the field , said : " Last year we used about 400 reviewers in stem cell and developmental biology , and we constantly recruit new referees .
The idea that there 's some privileged clique is utterly false . "
It is a requirement of publicly funded research to publish in scientific journals .
This process involves sending a report of the research to an editor at a journal .
If the editor deems it sufficiently novel and interesting , they will ask two or three scientists who are experts in the field to review the research and send in comments .
It is at this stage where scientists who may well be rivals of the person who submitted their research say whether the research is good or bad .
They can also suggest to the journal editor that more experiments need to be carried out in order to justify the conclusions of the research .
' Extra experiments '
The journal editor decides to publish the research paper usually when the majority of reviewers are satisfied .
But professors Lovell - Badge and Smith believe that increasingly some reviewers are sending back negative comments or asking for unnecessary experiments to be carried out for spurious reasons .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .

More from Today programme
In some cases they say it is being done simply to delay or stop the publication of the research so that the reviewers or their close colleagues can be the first to have their own research published .
" It 's hard to believe except you know it 's happened to you that papers have been held up for months and months by reviewers asking for experiments that are not fair or relevant , " Professor Smith said .
Dr Campbell denies this as far as his journals are concerned : " It 's an editor 's responsibility to ensure that delays are minimised , and we stop using any referee where a pattern of delays is apparent , whatever the reason might be . "
These kinds of allegations are not new and not confined to stem cell research .
But professors Smith and Lovell - Badge believe that the problem has become particularly acute in their field of research recently for two reasons .
Firstly , research grants and career progression are now determined almost entirely by whether a scientist gets published in a major research journal .
Secondly , in stem cell science , hundreds of millions of pounds are available for research - and so there is a greater temptation for those that want the money to behave unscrupulously .
" The problem has become more common and more serious now , " said Professor Smith .
" The issue here is all about public funding because you have to get these papers published to be able to get your next grant .
It could be worth half a million pounds .
It can be difficult for people in that position to be objective . "
Even if research is not being deliberately stifled , high quality work is being overlooked as an " accidental consequence of journal editors relying too much on the word of a small number of individuals " , according to Professor Lovell - Badge .
" You will have what looks like a very good paper by a very reputable scientist - but the journal takes the word of one particular reviewer too strongly .
They have their favourite reviewers and what this means is that it distorts what gets published because that 's going to be the view of one individual which may not reflect where the field should be going , " he said .
Practical obstacles ?
Dr Campbell says that as far as his journals are concerned the charge is untrue : " Our editors , who frequently attend conferences and visit laboratories in order to keep abreast of the field and the people in it , have always used their own judgement in what we publish .
We have not infrequently overruled two or even three sceptical referees and published a paper . "
We are seeing the publication of a lot of papers in high profile journals with minimal scientific content or advance
Robin Lovell - Badge
But at a recent stem cell scientific meeting , 14 of the world 's leading stem cell researchers said that journal editors had n't seen through what they described as " unreasonable or obstructive " reviews .
In an open letter to the journals , they proposed that if a paper was published , the accompanying reviews should be provided as supplementary material online .
Dr Campbell said that he was sympathetic to the idea although he envisaged practical obstacles .
Professor Lovell - Badge believes that the journal editors could do more to identify bias in the review process .
" Editors should be able to see when reviewers are asking for unnecessary experiments to be carried out and if it's the difference between an opinion of the referee and a factual problem .
But what tends to happen is that the editor takes the opinion of an editor rather than the factual substance , " he said .
One of the main reasons for this , according to Professor Smith , is that journals are in competition .
Editors have become dependent on favoured experts who both review other people 's stem cell research and submit their own papers to the journal .
If the editor offends these experts , they may lose future papers to a rival .
This is leading to the journals publishing mediocre science , according to Professor Lovell - Badge .
" We are seeing the publication of a lot of papers in high profile journals with minimal scientific content or advance , and this is partly because of these high - profile journals needing to keep their so called ' impact factors ' as high as possible .
That 's determined by the number of citations that the papers have and they know that some of this trendy work is going to get cited and they seem not to care about whether its a real scientific advance or not , " he said .
Commenting on the allegations , Monica Bradford , executive editor of Science , another major journal , said : " Our current policy is to preserve the confidentiality of reviewers ' names and comments .
Some journals have tried experiments to test the impact of open review on the quality of the feedback received through peer review .
" We have not been convinced to switch to such a system , but we will continue to monitor such experiments .
We also will discuss the pros/cons of our current process internally and with our senior editorial board .
" We do recognise that human factors such as competition and potential financial gains can bias a reviewer 's assessment of a paper and we expect our editors to consider these factors when evaluating the comments of the reviewers , particularly in cutting - edge areas of research . "

When it comes to string concatenation in Java many people have almost religious views about performance and style .
Sadly , there are some misconceptions and misinformation especially about the performance bits .
Many people think that concatenating many strings using + means expensive string copying each time and is thus slow as hell which is mostly wrong .
Justin Lee has a nice writeup of the most prominent concatenation options .
But imho he misses out some things and his benchmark is a bit oversimplified although it does tell a true story .
I assume that he followed at least the basic rules for performance measurement as his results suggest .
Now I want to try to clarify some points I think he missed and I find important :
Concatenation using + in one statement is actually compiled to the use of StringBuilder ( at least for Sun Java6 compilers , where I checked it in the debugger , try it yourself ! ) .
So it ’s no surprise that there is no difference between these two options in Justin ’s benchmark .
in is actually compiled to the use of ( at least for Sun Java6 compilers , where I checked it in the debugger , try it yourself ! ) .
So it ’s no surprise that there is no difference between these two options in Justin ’s benchmark .
It should be clear that the format variants have some overhead because they actually do more than just concatenate strings .
There is at least some string parsing and copying involved so that these methods should be used for the cases where for example parameter reordering ( think I18N ) is needed or readability suffers using normal concatenation .
You have to pay attention when using + concatenation over the course of multiple statements because it then involves string copying .
Consider the following code :
Here it really does make a difference which option you choose .
The StringBuilder will perform far better for higher loop counts .
We had a real world issue back some time with that when we used the Simple web framework for serving directory listing of several thousand files .
The HTML - code was generated using a concatenatePlus ( ) - style method and took like 40 (! ) seconds .
After changing the code to the StringBuilder variant the page was served in sub-second time .
Whether you use + or StringBuilder is mostly a matter of taste and readability in many cases .
When your string concatenation gets more complex you should really consider using StringBuilder as it is the safe bet .

Rather than continuing to talk about how hardcore developers should have hardcore math fu , I ’d like to shift the focus a little to softer skills ( although , as I said , I will come back to math stuff often ) .
I believe that technical people should place even more of an emphasis on soft / people skills than non-techies ( I mentioned this in one of the comments to my last post ) .
I will expand on my reasons for this in a later post .
In the meantime let ’s just take it as a given and look at the value of these skills in a technical interview situation .
The thing with a programming interview , or any interview for that matter , is the fact that it is more of a conversation rather than a grilling .
The company , and by extension the interviewer , has just as much invested in the process as the interviewee and therefore want to get the most information from the time they spent talking to you as they possibly can .
Of course , in a programming interview the main objective is to assess your skills , but people rarely make decisions regarding other people ( e.g. hiring decisions ) based on hard factual data :
Only 70 % of your friends rate you as a ‘ nice guy ’ and therefore we will be unable to pursue a friendship with you at this time .
Missing a semicolon on the second line of the last question , clearly puts you below the historical 95 - th percentile of all candidates , which unfortunately means we ’re unable to hire you .
It just does n’t happen – people mostly go by how they ‘ feel ’ about another person based on what is important to them .
They may try to get an objective picture of your skills , but no matter how well you think you did , if they do n’t feel like they want to work with you themselves ( i.e. they do n’t really like you ) , you will not get a positive report , at best the interviewer will be ambivalent :
He clearly knew his stuff but was a bit of a cold fish .
I guess he was ok overall .
Not really the best outcome , ambivalence usually means – no hire .
This does not at all mean that you can bluff your way through a technical interview just by creating ‘ good vibes ’ .
Most technical people value technical skills highly and if you do n’t measure up in that regard you wo n’t succeed .
What it does mean , is that you can be in the middle of the pack as far as pure technical skill is concerned , but still come out as the preferred candidate at the end of your programming interview .
Some developers ( i.e. highly technical / analytical people ) may not like it , but that ’s just the way it is , dealing with people is not an exact science .
The Objective Of A Technical Interview
A regular interview is all about psychology – can you leave the interviewer with a good impression , can you ‘ click ’ with the person in the short time that you have .
A technical interview should be all about technical skill , but people are involved , which means regardless of what you might like , it is still as much about psychology as it is about technology .
The objective is to answer the questions to the best of your ability , while at the same time giving the interviewer as much positive clues about yourself as you can , to allow them to form a good overall impression .
The impression is just as important as the answers you give .
To that end here is the process I would use when answering a programming interview question which will allow you to not only give yourself the best chance of answering the question correctly , but should also give the interviewer a decent feel for who you are and how you work .
If you disagree with any of this , or have other tips , do leave a comment .
The Process
The majority of technical interviews onsite , consist of answering a programming question on the whiteboard .
I do n’t like it either , but we work with what we have , so this process is geared towards that .
When you ’re asked a question , do n’t try and jump straight into writing code unless it is truly trivial .
It ’s not a race , sit and think about the question for a little bit .
This shows the interviewer that you ’re not a “ cowboy ” and do n’t go off half - cocked to try and solve a problem you do n’t yet understand .
To help you understand the problem …
Use the whiteboard .
A picture is worth 1000 words so use the whiteboard to draw the problem as you understand it .
At this point you should be talking to the interviewer to make sure you both have the same view of the problem ; the picture will help with this .
This also gives the interviewer a chance to clarify the question if necessary .
From your point of view , you ’re talking and eliciting requirements , the value of this should be self - evident .
Do n’t fill up the whole whiteboard with pictures , you do n’t want to have to wipe your diagram as it may be useful later on for debugging purposes .
Do n’t be afraid to start over and keep talking .
You should be chatting with your interviewer throughout , to keep them engaged and to allow them to understand your thought process .
As you ’re coming up with a solution you may start writing it up , but if you find that you ’ve gone down the wrong path , or come up with a better solution , do n’t be afraid to start again .
Keep talking , tell your interviewer what you ’re going to do – this gives them a chance to point you in the right direction if they think it necessary , or stop you before you waste too much time ( if you ’re completely off base ) .
All of this should not only demonstrate the fact that you have decent coding skills , but show that you ’re a good communicator , can reason logically and can recognise when you ’re wrong ( and take the appropriate steps ) .
All of it helps the interviewer form a positive overall image of you .
If you just stand there silently writing or thinking , you get none of those benefits .
Infact you do the silence thing for long enough and it can get a little awkward , which is the last thing you want .
Take your time , like I said , it ’s not a race .
If you ’re taking too long the interviewer will let you know , otherwise assume you have all the time you need ( this should also help with stress if you ’re prone to panicking during interviews ) .
As you ’re thinking , do n’t forget to do some of it out loud , I ca n’t stress the importance of walking the interviewer through your thought process enough .
When you ’re actually writing the code , take the time to consider things like boundary conditions .
Many technical interviewers are extremely pedantic about stuff like null checks , I personally would n’t be , but it takes little time and better safe than sorry .
Do n’t be afraid to ask questions or even ask for hints if you ’re stuck .
The interviewer will often have some prepared anyway and will be happy to give them to you ( i.e. you wo n’t lose too many ‘ points ’ ) .
If you do n’t remember specific API details , let the interviewer know , they will either tell you or let you know that it is not important .
This demonstrates that you know what you ’re talking about while at the same time do n’t get hung up on the details .
If you ’re stuck ( but think you should know the answer ) , do n’t panic .
Stressing - out is one of the worst things you can do in any interview , it just is n’t the best image to project .
Iterate over steps 2 - 5 again .
It will probably be obvious that you ’re under a bit of pressure but equally obvious that you ’re taking it well – not a bad thing for an interviewer to know about you .
It also shows that you do n’t give up easily :) .
When you ’re finished , you ’re not really finished .
Remember what I said about interviewers being pedantic about null checks and boundary conditions , now is the time to make sure you do n’t get caught out by this .
Walk through your code and find any potential bugs , use the examples you drew in step 2 .
This demonstrates thoroughness and – chances are – you will find a little bug or two ( which even the interviewer may have missed ) which looks good .
If you ’re short on time , at least tell the interviewer that you would have liked to walk through the code .
Demonstrate that you know what you ’re on about and did n’t just stumble on to the solution by accident .
You can do this by telling the interviewer a little more about your code , consider things like , strengths , weaknesses , running time ( big Oh ) .
You may also mentioned other potential ways to solve the problem and any improvements you would make if you had more time .
Chances are the interviewer was going to ask about this stuff anyway , but preempting displays professionalism ( you ’re aware of the issues and what is required ) and the ability to think about the problem at more than just a superficial level .
Some Extra Tips
Do n’t write too small on the whiteboard , that can be really annoying ( too large is usually not an issue , but watch for that too ) .
If you ’re writing is of a decent size and you ’ve run out of whiteboard while still being nowhere near the end of the solution , you ’re probably missing something , go back to step 1 .
If you ’re into TDD it may help to think about the problem in a test first fashion .
What would you test in order to solve – and go from there , it may help get you into your normal flow .
Books like How Would You Move Mount Fuji ?
may be a bit of a cliche , but are worth reading for the insights into the mind of an interviewer ( and it certainly wo n’t hurt to be prepared if someone ever does ask you THOSE questions ) and how to leave them feeling positive towards you .
Another good one is Programming Interviews Exposed for more technically - minded questions / tips .
If you do n’t know the answer and none of the hints help ( in short , if you have no idea ) , do n’t try to bluff it .
Just admit it and move on , you can ask the interviewer to explain it later if you have time .
As far as I am concerned , it is unfortunate that you could n’t answer the question , but you get points for being man enough to admit it , after all , noone can know everything .
It is obviously not as good as solving it , but is better than nothing and a damn sight better than trying to bluff it , the interviewer is not an idiot ( and even if they are , pretend like they ’re not ) they ’ll see through it and that ’s an automatic fail .
This is how I would go about answering a coding interview question these days .
Looking at it from the other side , if I was the interviewer and someone went through this kind of process I would rate them pretty highly ( unless they could n’t actually answer ANY of the questions :) ) .
Doing all this allows you to demonstrate your coding skills , shows that you ’re a good communicator , have decent people skills , work well under pressure are thorough and generally personable .
Compare that with – “ He was ok .
He solved all the questions . ” – big difference .

Going green will not be optional in Cambridge , Mass. , if the Cambridge Climate Congress has its way .
It will be mandatory .
There will be congestion pricing to reduce car travel .
Curbside parking will be eliminated .
There will be a carbon tax " of some kind , " not to mention taxes on plastic and paper bags .
And the Massachusetts city , home of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , will advocate vegetarianism and veganism , complete with " Meatless or Vegan Mondays . "
Those are just some of the proposals put forth by the Congress , which was created in May 2009 to respond to the " climate emergency " plaguing Cambridge .
Once the Congress settles on its recommendations , they will submitted to the City Council .
" This emergency is created by the growth of local greenhouse gas emissions despite the urgent warnings of climate scientists that substantial reductions are needed in order to reduce the risk of disastrous changes to our climate , " the Climate Congress reported in proposals issued on Jan. 23 .
" This proposal is made in the belief that an effective local response is , if anything , made more urgent by so far inadequate global agreements and federal policies for emissions reductions .
It is made in the belief that our City should lead by example . "
Click here to see the Climate Congress recommendations .
While the group 's proposals remain a work in a progress , some experts say the potential measures it advocates are " heavy - handed " and incongruous .
But others say the city just might be onto something , particularly if the taxes associated with the plan are used to make buildings and transportation more efficient .
Dr. Ken Green , a resident scholar on environment and energy at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington - based think tank , said he found an " overall redundancy " in the proposals , specifically regarding a carbon - based tax coupled with congestion pricing , increased parking meter rates and parking tickets .
" That 's just a revenue - raiser for the city , " said Green .
" There 's an overall incoherence of having a carbon tax and three or four indirect taxes . "
To best reduce emissions in the near - term , Green suggested a revenue - neutral carbon tax , meaning that little -- if any -- of the funds raised would be retained by municipal government .
The vast majority under such a plan would be returned to the public .
" It creates an incentive to become more energy efficient to either avoid the tax or keep as much of any rebate as possible , " Green said .
" But if they do the [ carbon ] tax , they should get rid of almost all of the other things .
If the point is to put a price on carbon , pick one price , make it transparent and then get rid of the other regulations , which end up overpricing carbon .
So if you had your carbon tax , you do n't need your congestion pricing because people are already paying the tax in their gasoline . "
Green also said the proposal to ban the production and distribution of plastic bags and bottled water in city limits is as " heavy - handed as government can get " and questioned Cambridge 's proposal to institute disincentives for the purchase of non-regional food .
" Trying to grow something out of season in a greenhouse locally may produce more greenhouse gas emissions than having the same food shipped in from a place where it grows naturally , " he said .
" Studies do not come down uniformly on the side that local is better . "
But Richard Rood , a professor of atmospheric , oceanic , and space sciences at the University of Michigan , praised Cambridge 's proposal to create a " temperate zone " program , in which building are neither heated nor cooled during the fall and spring .
" That is a place where you might make a difference , " said Rood , who writes a blog for Weather Underground .
He also praised the city 's proposal to advocate vegetarianism and veganism .
" From a climate point of view , eating less meat would have a climate impact , " said Rood , citing increased deforestation , methane production , fertilizer use and greenhouse gases associated with maintaining that land .
" Eating less meat is for the environment in many ways .
Regarding the possibility of a carbon tax , Rood , who supports such a move on a national level , said the impact on a city level would be " fairly small . "
The real positive effect , he said , would be if the plan caught on in other cities if successful .
" In general , if you look at how policy develops , it often starts on regional and local scales and then advances forward , " he said .
" Cambridge is full of really smart people , so you know , it has the potential . "
It still remains to be seen , however , how these proposals will be received by Cambridge residents .
Cambridge City Councilor Sam Seidel , who spoke to FoxNews.com after riding his bicycle to his office , said that remains the key unanswered question .
" The challenge in broadest terms is to figure out what makes sense , what doable , but all of that in the context of how much ground we have to cover , " he said .
" We have to be realistic on what we 're going to be able to accomplish . "
Seidel said the Climate Congress will next meet on March 6 , at which point the next steps regarding the 20 - page proposal will be decided .
Any success in slashing greenhouse gas emissions will hinge on individual efforts , he said .
" It 's my own view that while governmental action is going to be an important part of any successes we 're going to have , individual citizens are also going to have to take individual ownership and responsibility for their own actions , " he said .
" It 's only by working together that we 're going to see the necessary reductions that climate scientists have been calling for . "
Asked if the proposal amounted to a series of taxes , Seidel said , " The goal of truly , accurately evaluating the cost of our decisions is an important part of greenhouse gas emissions reductions , it 's really pointing out to people what their choices imply . "
Seeding fake files on BitTorrent is nothing new and the practice has been carried out by anti-piracy groups and malware spreaders for a long time .
While many of them choose to use various open and public BitTorrent trackers , others are setting up their own trackers .
We take a look at an easy way to find out more about them .
Back in 2007 we published a series of articles on various dodgy practices targeted at BitTorrent users .
Many people were downloading torrents only to be told that they needed to install software like DomPlayer and 3WPlayer to get them to work .
Of course , the torrents were fake .
We also reported on BitTorrent clients such as Torrent101 , BitRoll and GetTorrent , which also caused caused a whole load of trouble for those who installed them – even uTorrent and WinZip users were in the sights of malware offloaders .
In an email yesterday to TorrentFreak , a reader pointed us to a problem torrent located here ( removed ) .
The file is clearly labeled as ‘ The Wolfman DVDrip 2010 aXXo ’ but it is a fake , a fact which can be quickly learned by reading the comments underneath the torrent .
Nevertheless , we thought it might be interesting to demonstrate how it ’s possible to look a little deeper .
The file is tracked by a whole range of trackers but one sticks out immediately .
http://tracker.torrentq.com/announce.php currently lists 48,416 seeds and 37,496 seeders for the supposed ‘ The Wolfman ’ movie , a highly attractive proposition for those inexperienced in dealing with fake torrents .
Of course the stats are faked , and are run from a tracker set up especially to deliver fake torrents .
Indeed , it ’s run on a subdomain of TorrentQ , a bad client we featured in an earlier article .
Here ’s a quick step - by - step of the method we used to investigate the tracker .
There are other ways , but this is pretty simple so anyone can try this out .
It ’s possible to find information about the files indexed on many trackers by using ‘ scrape ’ .
In the case of the TorrentQ tracker , the scrape URL is located at http://tracker.torrentq.com/scrape.php.
So first off , go to this URL and you ’ll get the option to download a file , in this case ‘ scrape. php ’ – download it .
In this file will be information about the files being seeded on this tracker .
Next use DeHackEd ’s nice little online tool called DumpTorrentCGI .
Browse to the ‘ scrape ’ file on your hard drive , change output type to ‘/ scrape ’ and click the ‘ decode ’ button .
You should get this report ;
Immediately you can see that all the files are apparently hugely popular , but of course , all of these stats are faked .
To prove that , one can use a site like Torrentz.com , which creates its torrent URLs by using a torrent ’s hash value .
Simply test each torrent by using http://www.torrentz.com/
followed by the hash value , as shown below , and check the comments .
http://www.torrentz.com/0366eb6bdbab88f2ccd9397a0b421b3947c82e06
The torrents TorrentQ tracks are for Wolfman , Legion , My Name is Khan , The Book of Eli , From Paris With Love , Ninja Assassin , Edge of Darkness , Shutter Island and Dear John .
Every single one is flagged as a fake by commenters on Torrentz.com .
The lawyer for an Australian woman arrested in the West Bank says her detention is part of a campaign by the Israeli government to silence pro-Palestinian foreigners .
Israeli soldiers arrested Bridgette Chappell , 22 , in a pre-dawn raid and was held in an immigration jail in Israel .
A court has since agreed to release her on bail provided she does not return to the West Bank .
The Israeli government says Ms Chappell , who was studying Arabic and politics at Birzeit University in the West Bank , was arrested for overstaying her visa .
But she was also active in the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) - a pro-Palestinian organisation committed to resisting Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
Ms Chappell was sharing an ISM apartment with two other activists - a Spanish woman and an American man , Ryan Olander .
Mr Olander says about 12 soldiers broke down the door during the night and burst in with M16 rifles .
" At about three o'clock this morning we were woken by sounds of someone fumbling with the door , " he said .
" It sounded pretty violent and about five minutes after that they had used a crowbar to break the lock .
" There was about 12 Israeli military soldiers armed with M16s , flashlights and a camera . "
Ms Chappell 's Israeli lawyer , Omer Shatz , says he has been denied access to speak to her and fears she may be deported before he can bring her case to court .
" Usually what they try to do is try to deport her within 24 hours , using techniques of intimidation and threatening - saying ' if you wo n't sign a paper that 's saying she is willing to leave now , or within a few hours , you will be staying there for months ' , " he said .
" And they know that they do n't want to be in jail for a long period of time . "
' Illegal ' riots
Israeli authorities say Ms Chappell and her Spanish housemate were known to be involved in illegal riots and to have interfered with Israeli military activity .
But Palestinian authorities say Israel has no jurisdiction over the West Bank city of Ramallah and therefore had no right to raid the apartment .
At the time of her arrest Ms Chappell was not in Israel and Mr Shatz says if she overstayed her visa it is only because Israeli forces captured her and took her to Israel to accuse her of breaching her visa .
" The minister of interior has no authority outside Israel , and if she was brought into Israel - for example by the army - she did n't commit any offence because they put her inside Israel , " he said .
The ISM says the women 's arrests are aimed at stifling protests against Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and that it is common for Palestinian activists to face arrest or detention for their roles in anti-Israel activities .
But Mr Shatz says in recent months Israeli authorities have begun using new tactics against foreigners who become involved .
" Foreigners like Bridgette , they take part sometimes in non-violent demonstrations , and the worst crime is that they also report to their homeland - Australia , Europe , United States , " he said .
Israel has confirmed the two women are in an immigration jail but refuses to say more .
On a January afternoon , the temperature hovers in the upper teens , the sky threatening to blanket the coal - rich hills of West Virginia with snow .
Inside the Trans - Allegheny Lunatic Asylum , in the small town of Weston , it ’s five or 10 degrees colder .
The heating has n’t worked since the Weston State Hospital -- as the mental institution was also known -- closed in 1994 .
The 2 1/2 - foot thick limestone walls provide better insulation than a modern refrigerator .
Planning your trip
Themed tours of the Trans - Allegheny Lunatic Asylum , 71 Asylum Drive , Weston , W.Va . ; ( 304 ) 269-5070 , www.trans-alleghenylunaticasylum.com, are offered throughout the year .
Prices range from $ 10 for a first - floor - only history tour to $ 100 for the “ Overnight at the Asylum ” ghost hunt .
Information about lodging , dining and other area attractions , including the boyhood home of Confederate Gen .
Thomas “ Stonewall ” Jackson , is available from the Lewis County Convention & Visitors Bureau ; ( 800 ) 296-7329 , www.stonewallcountry.com
I ’ve been forewarned to dress warmly for a tour , so I ’m bundled in a heavy coat , gloves and a stocking cap .
But their Thinsulate linings , I discover , will offer no protection from the chill that ’s about to run up my spine .
Dressed in 19th century nurse ’s garb , with a shawl added for warmth , Andrea Lamb leads visitors on a tour through the four - story building crowned with a majestic clock tower .
By day , historical tours are offered .
By evening , visitors can wander through the darkened corridors in search of the ghosts of former patients and even spend the night -- if they dare .
“ There are 16 wards in the building , ” Lamb says as she pulls open the heavy wooden door leading to Ward 1 .
The unit , with pastel - colored paint peeling from the walls , seems to go on forever ; the hospital is just 25 feet shy of a quarter - mile long .
“ This place was built for 250 patients , ” she notes .
“ In the 1950s and ‘ 60s , there were more than 2,400 patients in this building . ”
Lamb , 56 , adds that as a child , she used to peer through its heavy , wrought - iron gates along Weston ’s River Avenue .
“ You would see patients out on the lawn , ” she recalls .
“ They were allowed out on the grounds . ”
It was n’t until she had grown up , however , that Lamb learned of the abuses and excesses that took place inside : children locked in cages , involuntary commitments and -- maybe worst of all -- lobotomies .
It ’s the sort of creepy stuff that films such as “ One Flew Over the Cuckoo ’s Nest ” and the just - released “ Shutter Island , ” starring Leonardo DiCaprio , showcase in frightening scenes .
But several hours south of Pittsburgh , in north - central West Virginia , the true stories are every bit as terrifying as the movies .
“ This is what your room would have looked like , ” our guide says as she opens the door to a surprisingly large , bright and airy room .
The architect thought sunlight and fresh air could cure mental illness .
“ In 1872 . . . if [ a married woman ’s ] husband had a mistress or if she had inherited money . . . he could bring her here , ” Lamb tells her guests .
“ He could sign her in and leave her until he decided to come back and get her -- or until she died , whichever came first . ”
As we move farther down the corridor , past rooms with narrow slits in the doors so staff could observe their charges , we arrive at the oldest part of the facility , a wing built in 1861 .
During the Civil War , Union soldiers seized it , and the name was changed from the Trans - Allegheny Lunatic Asylum to Camp Tyler .
During the war , the camp changed hands several times during clashes between the Confederate and Union armies .
Next we visit an area that squeamish guests may want to skip : the medical center .
" [ This ] was where they did the shock therapy [ and ] the lobotomies , ” Lamb says as she launches into a story told to her by a woman who began her nursing career here in 1939 .
“ She said , ‘ I was 18 years old .
It was my second day of work .
They asked me to take one of the male patients from the regular part of the hospital to the medical center . ’ ”
Dr. Walter Freeman told her to wait ; he just needed a few minutes with the patient .
The young nurse had no idea that the doctor was the famous -- some would say infamous -- lobotomist who traveled around the country using an ice pick or similar tool to damage the brains of thousands of patients .
“ She said she did not know she was going to take that man for a lobotomy , ” Lamb says .
“ That bothered her for the rest of her life .
“ She brought back the perfect patient .
He would feed himself , dress himself [ and ] go to the bathroom by himself , but he would never have any emotions again . ”
Lamb concludes the chilling tale noting that as late as 1980 there were still lobotomized patients on the wards at Weston .
No wonder participants in the nighttime ghost tours repeatedly tell of hearing groans and screams from long - dead patients , including a still - disturbed one named Ruth .
“ She ’s generally on Ward 4 , ” says Michelle Graham , one of the locals who conducts the paranormal walks .
“ She ’s the one who will push people around if they call out her name .
. . . .
They ’ve been pushed from behind and fallen to the floor .
. . .
Doors will open up and hit them in the face . ”
And then there ’s Lily , who apparently was a patient here as a little girl .
“ People say she ’ll hold their hands , ” Graham tells me .
“ She ’ll turn flashlights off and on in response to questions .
She ’ll play with a ball and roll it back and forth between people . ”
Whether they come for the history or the haunting , visitors often leave shivering -- not only in January , as I did -- but on muggy afternoons in August too .

Operation New Dawn !
How disarming it would be were this a sign that a bit of dry wit had penetrated the mental fastness that is the American defense establishment .
Alas , the truth is that the Pentagon ’s public relations machine is still grinding away .
This administration ’s dedication to continuing the tradition of dishonest public communication bequeathed it by the Bush bunch is of cardinal importance .
For its implications for how we conduct the nation ’s affairs are deeper and more enduring than this ridiculous try at casting the mantle of success over our gory , corrupt and inept escapade in Iraq .
First a few thoughts on the dimensions of our failure there .
The primary features of what Iraq is becoming are marked out by recent developments .
Three stand out .
The Maliki government used the military police to force the demission of elected officials in Ninevah province who were political opponents of the current regime .
That is one .
The shadowy Accountability and Justice Commission that vets candidates for the upcoming elections has succeeded in removing from the lists leading Sunni figures along with a potpouri of secularists and dissident Shi’a .
That is two .
The mastermind of this operation has been Ahmed Chalabi , erstwhile paladin of the neo-conservative schemers who instigated the entire tragic affair .
That is three .
Chalabi has had intimate ties with Iranian leaders , especially in the powerful security services , from the outset .
He always was Tehran ’s man insofar as he placed his largest bets for gaining personal power on his Iranian co-conspirators .
His key role in passing to them information that compromised American secret codes back in 2005 led to his being blacklisted by American officers in Baghdad – for awhile .
Nonetheless , he has remained a powerful behind the scenes figure .
Now , General Odierno pronounces himself shocked by the discovery that Chalabi and his protégé , Mr. Lami , are the sharp edge of mounting Iranian influence in Iraqi politics .
The good general acts as one who had just made the stunning discovery that people in Las Vegas play roulette .
Or , perhaps , it ’s the losing part that leaves him shocked .
The unpalatable truths for the promoters of the ‘ New Dawn ’ over the Tigris are that Iranian influence has eclipsed that of the United States , a fact of life regardless of whether we have 130,000 troops on the ground or 13 ; that Iraq is slipping perceptibly into an autocracy in the mode of other states in the region ; that simmering sectarian rivalries will bedevil Iraqi politics for the foreseeable future .
We have dared the impossible in Iraq and we have failed abjectly – that is the long and short of it .
Moreover , we have been obtuse in ignoring the writing on the wall even though it has been there in bright neon for years .
After all , when Maliki is repeatedly pictured walking hand - in - hand with Mr. Ahmedinejad in Baghdad as well as Tehran they are doing more than observing courtesies .
Yet , too many have too much at stake to let the truth speak for itself , much less to learn its lessons .
The authors of our Mesopotamian misadventure have their reputations and current influence at stake .
David Petraeus and his cohort have their personal stake in the myth of a modern day Lawrence on a white Arabian steed with a counter - insurgency manual in one hand and a sword in the other .
The Obama people have their own interests in downplaying the Iraq debacle , for the White House has embarked on its own quixotic adventure in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The ambitions there are as grand , the obstacles as formidable , success as improbable , and the justification only somewhat less fanciful .
The key assumptions are the same .
Hence , the refusal to highlight the outcome in Iraq that contradicts them .
They are : the United States can produce the transformation of an entire culture out of the barrel of a gun ; the natives eventually will put their trust in well - intentioned Americans no matter what ; it is imperative to dominate militarily the region forevermore ; the nation ’s essential well - being is directly affected by what is going on in these alien places ; and , finally , that the audacious goal of reducing to zero the terrorist and pseudo - terrorist threats is realistic .
To face honestly the Iraq fiasco is to undermine support for the escalated commitment in AfPak , since the earlier experience largely invalidates those assumptions .
Therefore , their disproval was ignored or studiously misrepresented .
That made it easier for the basic questions of ‘ why ’ and ‘ how ’ in Afpak to be sloughed over .
If not put on the table , there is no need to give answers .
Accordingly , General Eikenberry , the skeptical nay - sayer who did raise them , was kept on the sidelines of the endless , meandering discussions whose outcome was predetermined .
This is not the way for a great nation to engage matters of high consequence .
Bandying around slogans like “ Operation New Dawn ” is symptomatic of a process that is dishonest and irresponsible at its core .
There are limits to how much dishonestly even a resilient country like ours can take , a limit to the costs that it can bear .
Instead , our political class should be leading us in a soul - searching as to what we as a people want and what is achievable .
The lives of Americans and the integrity of their public institutions are factors in the equation whether our masters admit it or not .
In the present depressed economic circumstances , ones likely to remain with us indefinitely , the trade - offs are momentous .
Inescapably , we risk the well - being and health of our citizens by strutting on a field of twisted dreams in Islamic Asia fixated on the chimera of eliminating the last would - be terrorist from the face of the earth .
What we have to look forward to is a Cold Dawn – if not a cold twilight .

しつこく Hello world !
を作ります。
http://shinh.skr.jp/ttyplay/gdb_hello.html
えーと上記はデモです。内容は、
main ;
だけのコードで gdb を起動して、対話環境チックに動作内容を確認しつつ main の中身を作って、うまくできたらそれを保存して実行ファイルにする、というような内容です。
デモの説明とかは今度気が向いた時に書きます。あと
Hello world !
の改行が出てなかったのはそもそも改行を忘れてたからでした…
すぐに気が向きました。解説入ります。
一番近いのはあれです 。BASIC 。 ウソ
ウソと言ってますが後述しているように、割と似てます。同じ行番号のコードを書いたら上書きできるとか、
LIST コマンドぽいのがあるとか。
ここで冒頭の main ; だけのファイルを作ります。ここで重要なことは .data セクションに置くだけです。こうしておかないと書き換えがスムーズにできないからです。
さてとりあえず対話環境を作ります。 たった5バイトです！！！
これは irb がなんかやたら小さ いRubyスクリプトであるとかウサギ本あたりに書いてあったので対抗意識というか。
まぁ普通に実行すると落ちてしまいます。
main=195 ; なら落ちないのは勉強ずみですよね！
GDB で書き込みに使ったコマンドをはっておきます。
set *(( char * ) &main+40 ) =' H ' set *( ( char * ) & main +41 ) ='e ' set *( ( char * ) & main +42 ) ='l ' set *( ( char * ) & main+43 ) ='l ' set *( ( char * ) & main +44 ) ='o ' set *(( char * ) & main +45 ) = ' ' set *( ( char * ) &main +46 ) ='w ' set *( ( char * ) & main +47 ) ='o ' set *( ( char * ) & main +48 ) ='r ' set *(( char * ) &main+49 ) ='l ' set *(( char * ) &main+50 ) ='d ' set *(( char * ) &main+51 ) ='!' set *(( char * ) &main+52) =0
ここで
p ( char * ) &main+40
をして Hello world を置いたメモリ位置を確認しています。このメモリアドレスは直後で使用するわけです。
set *( ( char * ) &main ) = 0xb9 set *(( char * ) &main +1 ) = 0x46 set *(( char * ) &main +2 ) = 0x95 set *(( char * ) &main+3 ) = 0x04 set *(( char * ) &main +4 ) = 0x08 set *(( char * ) &main +5 ) = 0xcc
こんな感じで mov を作りました。ここはデモとは違うアドレスになってると思います。ここだけ手入力してたのはデモを調整してるうちに変わってたからです。ケツに
0xcc を置いておいて、 cont で実行させて、 i r でレジスタを確認しました。なんてインタラクティブ性の高い環境でしょう。戻る時には
( gdb ) p &main $ 4 = ( < data variable , no debug info > *) 0x8049528 ( gdb ) set $ eip=$
4
などとしてました。いったん &main を表示させてたのは、 set $ eip=&main とかできないなーという感じだったので適当な workaround です 。
さて続くの は
set *( ( char * ) &main +5 ) = 0xbb set *( ( char * ) &main +6 ) = 0x01 set *( ( char * ) &main +7 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +8 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +9 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +10 ) = 0 x ba set *(( char * ) &main +11 ) = 13 set *(( char * ) &main + 12 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +13 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main + 14 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +15 ) = 0xb8 set *(( char * ) &main +16 ) = 0x04 set *(( char * ) &main +17 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +18 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +19 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +20 ) = 0xcd set *(( char * ) &main +21 ) = 0x80 set *(( char * ) &main + 22 ) = 0x bb set *(( char * ) &main +23 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main + 24 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +25 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +26 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +27 ) = 0xb8 set *(( char * ) &main +28 ) = 0x01 set *(( char * ) &main +29 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main+30 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main+31 ) = 0x00 set *(( char * ) &main +32 ) = 0xcd set *(( char * ) &main+33 ) = 0x80
というような要するに write して exit するだけのコード。保存は gcore コマンドで行いました。そんで実行してみた後、 gdb を去りました 。
gcore で吐いた core の中身 を
od -t x1z core .
15392
で確認して、 Hello world で検索してプログラムがどこから始まってるか調べました。そんで dd で適当に切り出しです。以下のような感じで 。
dd skip=7016 bs=1 count=60 if=core.15392 of=hello.bin
あとはこれをリンカで無理矢理 . text セクションに置いて実行ファイルを作りました。使ったのはこんなリンカスクリプト。
OUTPUT_FORMAT ( " elf32-i386 " ) OUTPUT_ARCH ( i386 ) SECTIONS { . = 0x8049528 ; .text : { *( .data ) } }
実際に使ったものは余計な記述が入ってたのでそれは削除してあります。 . = 0x8049528 ; でもとの main の位置を記してあるわけですが、これは非常に重要なことです。なぜなら、作成したプログラムは
Hello world !
の位置を決め打ちにしていたので、別の位置に再配置されてしまうと、正しくないものを表示してしまうことになるからです。
あとは、
ld - b binary hello.bin - T hello.ld
などとすれば、単なる生データであるところの hello.bin をリンクしてやることができます。
あ、 gdb とか詳しくないのでまどろっこしいことやってる可能性大です。この程度の知識は身に着くはずなので高林さんが紹介されていた
Binary Hacks は買うといいと思います。少なくとも私が書いてないところはお役立ちなはずです。
