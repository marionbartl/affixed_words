Mr Preclik 's wife said the US had promised to " eliminate " his past record A man wanted in the Czech Republic for drug and fraud crimes has been arrested while working in the US - at a maximum security prison .
Michal Preclik , 32 , had recently been promoted to the post of corporal , the Associated Press news agency reports .
An Interpol wanted poster showing his photograph was published on the internet a year ago .
Officials said they carried out a full background check on Mr Preclik and the fact he was employed was " a concern " .
Patrick Barker , who had worked with Mr Preclik at the Tecumseh State Correctional Facility , said he was " shocked " to find out his colleague was a wanted man .
" Here we have a guy facing drug and fraud charges and we 're dealing with contraband issues at the prison , " he told AP .
' Protected ' But Mr Preclik 's wife , Kari , told reporters her husband had been granted legal residency in the US after testifying in another case and that she could not understand why he had been arrested now .
They told him that his status was protected here , that whatever he had done in his past was eliminated
Kari Preclik
Wife
She said the couple did not know there was an arrest warrant for Mr Preclik until he was detained .
" They told him that his status was protected here , that whatever he had done in his past was eliminated and that he would be given status here in the United States , " Mrs Preclik told Nebraska 's Action 3 News .
" He is not a bad man , " she said .
Mr Preclik is currently being held in another prison , where he is fighting possible deportation to the Czech Republic .
The exact reason for his arrest has not been made public .
State officials said a full background check had been carried out on Mr Preclik before he was employed and one after he had started work , but that no problems were found .
" Obviously it 's a concern whenever we have anyone working at the facility who has any type of outstanding warrants , " said spokeswoman Dawn Renee Smith .
Officials said the state would be reviewing its employment policy and procedures .

Every decade has its landmark TV shows , and there will or should never be complete agreement on which 10 series belong at the top of the list .
For purposes of this list , a TV show is eligible only if it premiered in or after 1999 .
In addition , TV shows were judged on their artistic merit and overall contribution to the medium , not on their ratings or profit margins .
That said , here 's my list of the Top 10 Shows of the Decade ...

Well that is fancy .
The Belfast Zoo welcomed a new baby Malayan tapir on June 22nd .
Tapirs may look like pigs with mini elephant trunks but they are actually most closely related to horses and rhinoceroses .
The zoo is currently having a naming contest for the little girl .
May we suggest Schnozzy or Schnozzella ?
Name that Tapir ?
A Malayan tapir is born in Belfast Zoo and you have the opportunity to name and meet the long nosed and endangered species .
If your suggested name is chosen by a panel of zoo keepers and curators you will meet the latest arrival to the zoo .
Malayan tapirs are very rare , with fewer than 50 in European zoos , and a global zoo population of about 150 animals .
While scientists believe there are less than 3000 left in the wild , European zoos are establishing a sustainable captive population .
They are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List 2009 and listed on CITES , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .
Habitat destruction is the predominant threat , as a result of land in South East Asia being cleared for human settlement and agriculture , and rivers being dammed and land flooded for hydroelectric development .
Andrew Hope , Curator , said , “ We are delighted about the birth .
Our latest addition to the zoo is a huge achievement for the breeding programme .
They are such an endangered animal and every birth is vital to sustaining a captive population .
The competition is a great chance for someone to name our tapir .
The chosen name will stay with the animal for life and is registered on the International Species Information System , the world standard for zoological data collection that we use to record all information about our animals ” .
And has prettier charts , too , thanks to a patch from Tim Docker .
If you already have criterion installed :
$ cabal update $ cabal install -- reinstall criterion
If you want to use criterion on a Mac :
$ cabal update $ cabal install criterion -f - chart
Alas , on OS X , you ’ll lack the ability to directly generate pretty chart images , but criterion will still output CSV files for you .
You can import these into gnuplot or your favourite spreadsheet with ease , and chart away from there .
When the US government cut funding for hydrogen - fueled cars last May , Energy Secretary Steven Chu said such vehicles will not be practical for another decade or two .
Lim Tae - won thinks he can prove Secretary Chu wrong .
Dr. Lim runs the team at Hyundai - Kia Motors that is developing hydrogen fuel cell technology .
And they are on course , he says , to mass produce hydrogen cars in six years .
If they fail , Lim says , the company 's future is bleak .
" In order to survive we have to be a front runner in the field of eco- friendly vehicles " he says .
" It 's a question of our sustainability . "
It 's a bit of a gamble .
Kia is banking on the South Korean government fronting the money to build hydrogen re-fueling stations around the country .
And at the moment researchers are getting their hydrogen supplies from oil refineries – the antithesis of green .
But the government here is big enough on fuel cell technology to seem willing to help and Kia engineers say hydrogen could come from zero - carbon nuclear power stations , or natural renewable energy sources , in the future .
Certainly Kia 's latest Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle , the Borrego SUV , feels pretty futuristic to drive .
Idling , the whir of the fan sucking in air to mix with the hydrogen to make electricity is almost too faint to detect .
Only the occasional pneumatic " phhht , " as the system purges itself of water , tells you that anything is working at all .
Driving the car is a little disconcerting .
When all you can hear is the sound of the tires on the tarmac , with no engine noise to judge by , it is hard at first to gauge how fast you are going .
Any driving experience less like the 20 year old , Chinese - built Jeep Cherokee that I use at home in Beijing would be difficult to imagine .
At the end of the test - drive ( the Borrego has a top speed of 100 mph , a tank range of 471 miles and goes from 0 to 60 in 12.7 seconds ) , switching off the ignition provokes an apologetic gurgling burp from the car 's mid-section , and a dribble of water onto the pavement .
Is this the future ?
Skeptics may doubt the feasibility of transporting large quantities of hydrogen , or the likelihood that fuel cells will ever be cheap enough to tempt consumers .
But it sure beats the internal combustion engine .
・インデックスは検索性能には効果があるが、更新性能は落ちてしまう

I /O は遅い処理 ）

著者：松信 嘉範販売元：翔泳社発売日：2009-09-17おすすめ度：最近、この本を読んでいます。非常に面白いし、参考になります〜。中でもインデックスについての記事が特に興味深かったので簡単にまとめてみます。まずは
MyISAM と InnoDB でのインデックスの違いを簡単に。インデックスを検索していくと、最終的にはリーフにたどり着きます。リーフにはインデックスと、そのインデックスに対応したデータが保存されているファイルの場所が保存されており、この値を使って実際のデータにアクセスすることが出来ます。例えば [ fuga_id ] にインデックスを張り、SELECT * FROM hoge WHERE fuga_id = 2 と検索したときにはこのような動きになります 。InnoDB には主キーインデックス（クラスタインデックス）とそれ以外のインデックス（セカンダリインデックス）という2種類のインデックスがあります。ルート、ブランチ、リーフと階層構造になっているのは同じですが、リーフの中身が少し違います。クラスタインデックスの場合には、主キーとそれ以外の列値がそのまま保存されています。そのため、インデックスの値を読めば即、その他の列値も取得できます。一方、セカンダリインデックスではインデックスを検索することで主キーの値がわかり、その主キーの値を使って、その他の列値の値を知ることが出来ます。で、重要なことですが、高速に処理されるのはリーフの検索までです。ルートとブランチは基本的にキャッシュされ、リーフの検索もデータがソートされているお陰で隣接したインデックスは同一ブロックに格納されており、少ない
I/O で検索することが出来るためです（ I/ O はブロック単位で行われます）。そのため InnoDB のクラスタインデックスの場合は非常に高速です。しかし、MyISAM
の場合にはリーフで検索した後に、実際のデータに対してランダムアクセスが必要です。InnoDB
のセカンダリインデックスの場合にもリーフで主キーを取得した後、その主キーを使ってクラスタインデックスを検索する必要があります。このような
I/ O の度にシークや回転待ちといった処理が発生しますが、これが非常に時間が掛かります。。。高速化のためには、です。ちょっと話がそれますが、ソートするときにもインデックスは有効です。というのも、インデックスはソートされた状態で作成されるため、インデックスを使った検索を行えば、ソート処理が発生しません（既にソートされた状態です）。インデックスを作成すれば処理が早くなりそうですが、実際に試してみるとインデックスが利用されない（無理やりインデックスを利用するとむしろ遅くなってしまう）ことがあります。この理由がイマイチわかってなかったんですが、この本を読んで納得しました。MyISAM や InnoDB のセカンダリインデックスを用いた検索を行う場合、リーフで実データの場所や、主キーの値がわかります。その後、キャッシュされていない限りその値を用いてランダムアクセスが発生するんですが、このランダムアクセスが大量に行われると非常に遅くなります。リーフでの検索はデータが特定のブロックにまとまっているため、少ない数の
I/ O しか発生しませんが、ランダムアクセスでは、データはバラバラのブロックに存在しているため、都度
I/ O が発生してしまうためです。そのため、ある程度ランダムアクセスが多くなってくると、フルテーブルスキャン（インデックスを利用せずに、テーブル全体を読み込む方法）の方がデータをまとまって読み込める分、高速になっていくようです。さて、やっと本題です（長かった...
( ノд｀)）。ここまで読んでいただけたらわかるかと思いますが、要はいかに
I/O を減らすかが重要になってくるというわけです。例えばこのような
SQL を考えてみます。普通に考えると [ foo ] にインデックスを張って、リーフで得られた値から他の列値
( hoge , fuga ) を取得する、とやりたくなるところです。ただ、ここで [ foo , hoge , fuga ] という複合インデックスを張ることで、リーフだけで必要なデータが全て得られ、その後のランダムアクセスが無くなるため高速になります。このようなインデックスだけで完結するインデックスを
Covering Index と言うそうです。そこで hoge , fuga , foo それぞれに 1 〜 999 の値を持つ適当なデータを MyISAM で 50 万件用意して実際に試してみました。毎回 SELECT する前に Tricorn Labs » Linuxのページキャッシュをきれいさっぱり消すには？ で紹介されている方法でページキャッシュを消してから行っています。[ foo ] だけにインデックスを貼った場合には 2.52 sec も掛かっていたものが、 [ foo , hoge , fuga ] にインデックスを張った場合 0.01 sec と改善されていることが確認できました。ランダムアクセスが無くなるとこんなにも早くなるんですね。爆速です。GROUP
BY 句にインデックスを張る場合に、集約関数で利用しているカラムにもインデックスを張ったほうが良いというのもこれが理由だと思います。非常に役に立つテクニックじゃないかと。
Here is some sound advice for anyone having an illicit love affair : if you do not want to be found out , do not arrange to sleep together on the night of March 27 - 28 , 2011 .
That is the night when the government is going to count the British population , creating a precise , comprehensive record of who was sleeping where , how old they were , what ethnic background they come from , and what kind of central heating kept them warm that night .
The 2011 census is already being called a “ snoopers ' charter ” .
It is certainly going to give everyone an incentive not to lay their head to rest in the wrong house , at least for that one night .
The Conservatives complained yesterday that the 32 - page questionnaire is too long , too expensive , and likely to undermine public support for the exercise .
Anyone who does not fill it in risks a £ 1,000 fine .
The forms will sent out by post , but it will be possible to fill them in online .
Householders will be required for the first time to give the sex and date of birth of any visitor staying that night .
This will also be the first census with a question about same - sex civil partnerships .
The question about a person 's marital status has expanded from four possibilities — married , separated , divorced , or widowed — to eight .
Householders will also be asked to state how many bedrooms there are in the house , information that could affect the size of council tax bills , and what type of central heating the property has .
Another new question is about second homes .
Anyone who stays at a different address for more than 30 days a year will be required to specify the address .
For MPs , that information is now public knowledge .
Others might wonder why the state needs to know .
The Tory shadow Cabinet minister Nick Hurd said yesterday : “ Just because the government has the legal powers to ask these questions does not give the state the licence to ask anything they want .
These bedroom snoopers are yet another sign of how the Labour government has no respect for the privacy of law - abiding citizens . ”

A new report on climate change 's impact on agriculture predicts 25 million more malnourished children around the world by 2050 , compared to a scenario with no global warming .
Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable .
The report from the International Food Policy Research Institute projects that the the number of malnourished children will decrease by 10 million in the next 40 years .
However , without global warming the report projects a decrease of 35 million .
Forty percent of undernourished children will live in Africa .
The report compares economic and biological factors affecting child nutrition in two future scenarios — a world with and a world without climate change .
Gerard Nelson is lead researcher for the report at the International Food Policy Research Institute .
He said that climate change will have a particularly strong impact on agricultural yields in sub-Saharan Africa .
" The food price crisis of last year really was a wake - up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50 % more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050 .
Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge — even without climate change , " Nelson said .
" On top of that , sub -Saharan Africa in particular is home to a large number of poor people .
And one of the key messages to take home from our analysis is that with higher incomes people are more resilient to a variety of changes and that will be especially true for climate change . "
The report says that in 2050 average wheat yields in sub-Saharan Africa will decline by up to 22 percent as a result of climate change .
Irrigation water supply is also expected to decrease and less food availability will mean on average 500 calories less per person .
Without climate change , the report projected a rise in calorie availability in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2050 .
Nelson says African governments need to prioritise investment in the agriculture sector , particularly in rural roads , research and new technologies .
With the December 2009 climate change talks in Copenhagen , Denmark , Nelson says African governments should focus on helping their farmers adapt to climate change .
" As the governments of sub -Saharan Africa prepare to go to the Copenhagen negotiations they should ensure that agriculture is included both in the adaptation funding mechanisms that will come out of Copenhagen as well as allow for the possibility that mitigation funds can be used in Africa , " Nelson said .
The report says an additional investment in global agriculture of US $ 7 billion per year could increase production and counteract the adverse effects of climate change .
The report says 40 percent of this investment should go to sub-Saharan Africa .

LAS GAVIOTAS , Colombia 
In the 1960s , an aristocratic Colombian development specialist named Paolo Lugari took a road trip across these nearly uninhabited eastern plains , a region so remote and poor in soil quality that not even Colombia ’s historic upheavals of violence had taken root here at the time .
Stopping to rest in this vast expanse , written off by agronomists as the equivalent of a tropical desert , Mr. Lugari decided it was the perfect place to experiment with the future of civilization .
He founded a village unlike any other in this war - weary country .
“ The only deserts that exist in this world are deserts of the imagination , ” said Mr. Lugari , 64 , on a visit this month to the community he named after the river gulls , or gaviotas , he saw flying overhead on that trip more than 40 years ago .
These days , visitors travel by propeller plane over the bleak savanna to get here , or by bus past the occasional guerrilla or paramilitary checkpoint .
The visitors rarely come .
But when they do , they get a glimpse into a four - decade experiment to alter civilization ’s dependence on finite fossil fuels and industrial agriculture .

Free caravan site fees
Written by CaravanGuy on 2009-02-19

Ok lets face it , everyone is a little bit strapped for cash these days and it is getting a little bit harder to justify spending on a luxury item such as a caravan right now .
However do n't get all upset about it as there are people out there in a position to help you out here .
You may remember the post I did on making money from your caravan , well this is still very relevant today as more and more people are having a ' staycation ' , vacation in this country .
The other thing to help with your purchase of a caravan is the fact that you are n't the only one that is feeling the pinch and the caravan parks and holiday parks are really pushing for business .
Lots of places are offering to waive you 're first year of site fees to get you on the site and possibly spending money in their pubs and shops .
If you play you 're cards right and find a good priced static caravan , or a tourer with a seasonal pitch , you can save anywhere upto £ 3000 on the site fee 's and start making money as soon as the season starts .
Looking around you could find a decent quality Atlas Mirage , or similar , for around £ 10,000 and have it sited and ready to go before the season starts .
If you are wondering what to expect on a return for your investment well how does £ 400 a week for the 10 weeks of high season and then leveling off to more like £ 150 - £ 200 a week low season .
If you take into account that this is a relatively cheaper caravan that you will be hiring out and you will be able to get upwards of 7 - 8 years of service out of this can really be a good money spinner .
Take advantage of these caravan parks generosity / desparation and snag a bargain for some cheap holidaying / money making .

Astronomers have found the very best place on Earth to observe the heavens .
Now all they have to do is get there .
Ridge A , as the spot is known , is located in Antarctica , six hundred miles from the South Pole and 13,297 feet above sea level .
All things considered , it 's probably the very worst place on the surface of the planet for humans .
As far as anyone knows , no person has ever even set foot there .
But thanks to satellite data , scientists now know that Ridge A surpasses all other sites based on eight factors that impact the sharpness of observations , like cloud cover and atmospheric turbulence .
" The astronomical images taken at Ridge A should be at least three times sharper than at the best sites currently used by astronomers , " said Will Saunders , an astronomer at the Anglo - Australian Observatory and visiting professor to UNSW , in a press release .
" Because the sky there is so much darker and drier , it means that a modestly - sized telescope there would be as powerful as the largest telescopes anywhere else on earth . "
The new work was published today in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific .
The Antarctic site , said co-author Patrick Minnis , an atmospheric scientist at NASA Langley , was about as " close to space as you can get , " and that 's exactly what makes it so great .
It 's cold , dry , and nearly lacking weather or even clouds .
A similar site , Dome A — about 90 miles from Ridge A — became the home of the first robotic Antarctic viewing station , The PLATeau Observatory ( PLATO ) .
It was deployed in January of 2008 and collected data all last winter without humans attending to it .
The Chinese - led , Australian - built project could be a model for future robotic observatories near the South Pole .
The simple observatory is , in the words of University of Arizona astronomer Craig Kulesa , a steel shipping container that scientists " cut in half and insulated the crap out of . "
" It 's kind of Rube Goldberged together but they did a really good job designing it , " Kulesa said .
Each of the last two winters , it operated without a human within 600 miles for more than 200 days .
" It 's been working without any human intervention and just taking some fantastic data , " he said .
" It 's just an unbelievable success . "
Getting experiments to the Antarctic plateau is n't easy .
Ridge A is far from everywhere on Antarctica , which is , of course , one of the most isolated places on Earth .
PLATO was shipped to a Chinese coastal base and then sledded up to Dome A .
It took two weeks .
Even given the difficulty that humans have in the Antarctic environment , building telescopes in Antarctica could turn out to be a bargain .
" It 's not convenient compared to going to the Palomar Observatory but if you put it in the context of a space mission , it 's incredibly cheap , " Kulesa said .
Getting a kilogram of anything into orbit costs thousands of dollars .
The cost of getting a kilogram to Ridge A is about $ 10 .
The problem is that unlike space telescope missions , an Antarctic observatory can't bank on NASA - level cash .
The space agency is n't too interested in hearing that some its work could be accomplished on the ground .
The National Science Foundation has a third of NASA 's budget and the American efforts in Antarctica have focused on the base at the South Pole .
" We 've put so much effort into the South Pole station that this is a bit of a distraction , " Kulesa said .
The NSF was a minor partner in the PLATO experiments , though , and Kulesa is confident that as the virtues of Ridge A become clear , momentum will build in the scientific community .
" I think there will be more and more people realizing that the Plateau is significantly better than the South Pole for a lot of kinds of astronomy , " he concluded .

We will still offer The Stoner ’s Cookbook through the store , but for at least the next year , while the ban is in place , we will be
I 've been speaking ill of the PSPgo ( or more specifically , Sony 's handling of the PSPgo ) for a few weeks now , but let it not be said that I wo n't put my money where my mouth is .
Quite a lot of money , in fact , as I visited GameStop yesterday and acquired the latest PlayStation Portable .
As I 've said many times , I am a PSP fan and I wanted to love the new system , and I decided the only way to judge this machine was to have this machine .
I now have one .
When I got home , I tried to get all my data and information from my old PSP - 1000 to the PSPgo .
However , Sony has not considered the idea of anybody wanting to do this , and decided to not only make it needlessly difficult , but to provide no instructions on how to do it .
I 've never really messed around with data transfer on the PSP before , so I was stumbling in the dark .
I now present to you a detailed log of my first three hours with the PSPgo , and the eventual slip into insanity that it wrought .
The diary may differ ever so slightly from reality for comedic effect , but the miserable , embarrassing experience is based on a true story and pretty much everything detailed in the diary happened .
Please read on and share my suffering in this diary of a PSPgo upgrader .
6:00 pm : Have purchased a PSPgo using obscene amounts of store credit .
Technically did n't cost me any money , and I have some work - related reasons for owning one .
Despite convincing myself that I had a legitimate reason to purchase a PSPgo , I still felt very ashamed when buying it , similar to the sense of guilt and remorse that comes with buying a pornographic magazine from a seedy newsagent .
You can feel the judging eyes of the store clerk , knowing that there 's something wrong with you .
At least with porn , they give you a discreet brown paper bag to hide your terrible wares inside .
No such luck with the PSPgo .
Everybody saw me buying it , and knew of the dirty thing I had done .
7:10 pm : Returned home after a brief dinner stop .
Time to get this thing going .
Switched on the PSPgo ; it took a while to come to life , but no matter .
Already weirded out by the fact that many of the buttons are situated behind the screen .
Only a minor issue , though ; nothing to worry about .
The first thing to do is to get all my old information from the PSP - 1000 to the PSpgo .
I 've gotten very comfortable on my old PSP , with a wallpaper I like , all my PlayStation Network information and , most importantly , the games .
Should be easy enough to take out my Memory Stick Duo and put it in the PSPgo .
7:16 pm : What 's a Memory Stick Micro ?
7:18 pm : Oh .
Oh , I see .
The PSPgo does n't accept the previously standard Memory Stick Duo , because that would be a sane and sensible thing to do .
Things have gotten difficult .
How on Earth am I going to get all the data from one PSP to another if I can't put the Memory Stick in ?
Please do n't tell me I 'm going to have to connect my PSP - 1000 to my computer , rip all the files from the PSP to the computer , then connect my PSPgo to my computer and copy all the files from the computer to the PSPgo .
7:20 pm : Connecting my PSP - 1000 to my computer so I can rip all the files from the PSP to the computer before connecting my PSPgo to my computer and copying all the files from the computer to the PSPgo .
7:30 pm : There are several gigs of this stuff , by the way .
7:40 pm : Okay , it 's time to play some videogames !
I 'm going to give Final Fantasy VII a quick spin to see what it looks like on the smaller screen ... oh .
I do n't have the correct copyright stuff .
Of course , that 's all on the old PSP , is n't it ?
Should be easy to find instructions on how to do that , right ?
7:41 pm : Nope .
7:42 pm : At the moment I can't connect my PSPgo to the Internet because my wife is out of the house and she knows the WEP key .
I am bad at technology .
I had hoped to copy the Internet information from my PSP - 1000 , but we 've already determined that it'd be easier to pull my fingernails out with a bar of soap .
For the record , there is not a single shred of information in the PSPgo manual telling upgraders how to successfully upgrade .
The Sony apologists were n't kidding when they said the PSPgo was n't designed for upgrading customers .
Also , did they seriously have to change the USB port on the PSPgo ?
Why was that even necessary ?
Is Sony doing difficult shit just for the fun of doing difficult shit ?
Wait , do n't even answer that .
7:45 pm : Have decided upon a new course of action , or at least something to do to pass the time and feel like I 'm accomplishing a single thing today .
I 've put the Media Go CD into my computer in the hopes that it will make data transfer much easier and allow me to put all my PSN information onto the PSPgo without any fuss .
Should be a quick and easy bullshit - free installation , right ?
7:50 pm : Why the fuck is it installing QuickTime on my fucking computer ?
7:55 pm : Seriously , why the fuck is it doing this ?
8:00 pm : With some Adobe update and QuickTime now randomly installed , the Media Go CD finally decided to install Media Go .
Who'd have thought an installation CD would install the thing it 's supposed to install ?
I now have this awesome media management tool on my computer .
My plan is to connect to the PlayStation Store and then get all my PSN account information nice and snug on my PSPgo .
Hopefully that will be the quickest way to make my PSPgo feel like home and then I can finally settle down to play some rockin ' videogames !
8:00 pm : " A new update is available for Media Go. Please install this new update before proceeding . "
8:01 pm : ...
8:02 pm : ...
8:10 pm : WHAT THE FUCK ?!
WHAT IN THE NAME OF FUCKING CHRIST ALMIGHTY FUCKING PISSING FUCKING FUCK SHIT IN THE FUCKING WIND UP A FUCKING BELLTOWER OF FUCKING FUCKED SHIT !?
This CD was released to the public TODAY !
Why do I need to update it already !?
I JUST CUNTING INSTALLED IT !
I have been in my house for an hour ... an hour ... and I have done nothing but download , rip , copy , install , update , install , rip , copy , install , install and install .
I just want to play some videogames !
Sony , why wo n't you let me play some videogames ?
I promise I 'll try to be a good person from now on .
Do you want me to go to church ?!
I 'll go to church if that 's what it takes , I 'll believe in God if I have to , I 'll fucking kill and eat a baby if that 's what you command JUST LET ME PLAY SOME VIDEOGAMES -- PLEASE !
8:20 pm : Oh , thank fuck , the wife 's come home .
Have aborted the whole Media Go idea and decided instead to get the WEP key , connect to the PSN , get all my account info and do things the old - fashioned way .
Oh , now we 're making headway !
Now we 're cooking with gas !
Now we 're going to get rolling , son !
I 've got a good feeling this time .
Everything 's gonna be alright from now on .
8:25 pm : Oh , for fuck 's sake .
... You guessed it .
I have to update the motherfucking firmware .
8:26 pm : Downloading firmware v6.10 or whatever the latest bullshit number it is .
It 's hilarious that Sony has seen fit to change everything about the PSP with this brand new model , but if one thing must stay the same , it 's the fact that customers will be downloading firmware more than they 'll actually be downloading games .
It 's great that Sony saw fit to take the good things away and leave all the horseshit behind .
Ah , firmware download screen , my old friend .
I have n't seen you since ... well , a few hours ago when I had to download you on my PSP - 1000 .
And when did I see you before then ?
Oh right , it was just a couple weeks ago .
And before that ?
A couple more weeks ago .
I love you , firmware ; I love you so much .
In fact , I love everything Sony has ever decided to do .
I love how unfriendly and needlessly difficult everything is .
I love how Sony has its fucking head up its arse .
This is so much better than the days of the Game Boy , when I could switch a games machine on and it would suddenly be able to play games right out of the box .
Those days fucking sucked .
8:30 pm :
The battery level is low .
Connect the AC adaptor and then wait for the battery to charge .
The update will start automatically when the charge level is high enough to perform the update .
9:00 pm : Still charging .
Nothing has happened .
This must be how Captain Oates felt on that doomed expedition to the South Pole .
Isolated .
Lonely .
Totally without hope and in desperate search for a salvation that will not come .
Frostbitten and faced with the knowledge that his continued existence brings pain and misery to all about him .
I am just going outside and may be some time .
9:07 pm : Switched my DSi on .
9:10 pm : Oh Flipnote Studio Frog , you make everything better .
9:15 pm : Singing Christina Aguilera's " Beautiful " and pretending that I 'm singing it to Samit .
9:20 pm : Finally started installing .
5 % ... 10 % ...
In a way , I kind of do n't want it to reach 100 % .
I 'm hoping perhaps a crazed rapist with a fetish for fat Englishmen breaks in through the window before installation can finish and buggers me violently , slits my throat and shits into my mouth so that the shit comes out the hole in my neck , which he then fucks .
I would prefer that to dealing with whatever fresh
Hell awaits me in the next phase of this awful , awful saga called " trying to have fun with a PSPgo . "
9:27 pm : Firmware installed , got onto the PlayStation Store .
Not sure what to do now .
That has n't made my PSPgo realize that I 'm the same person who bought the games now lodged within its internal memory .
Where 's that rapist ?
9:38 pm : Just decided to throw files onto the PSPgo and see what happens .
Oh , look , there 's a LICENSES folder .
That must be all I need to get this shit working .
Oh wait , no it does n't ; it 's just changed the error message rather than fixed the problem .
Instead of being told I have invalid copyright information , it 's telling me I must " activate the system " in order to play them .
I have never been told to do this before .
I am not being told how to do it .
I am guessing this means putting the PlayStation 3 on and connecting the PSPgo to it .
It 's at this point I realize that if I had done this in the first place , then this whole sorry mess might have been over sooner .
Or at the very least , I would have not had to deal with Media Go until tomorrow , when I would have the strength to face such utter crap .
For those keeping score , I have so far had to use a PSP - 1000 , a computer , and now a PS3 just to try and get my PSPgo operating on the same level I had my old PSP operating at .
I love simplicity .
9:51 pm : All done !
In a way , I was kind of making things harder than they had to be , but considering that NONE of the instruction material for the PSPgo provides ANY details on how to transfer data efficiently , I was kind of stumbling in the dark .
Still , the games are here , the licenses are in place , and now I can finally start playing videogames .
9:52 pm : Ooh , Rock Band Unplugged Lite .
That should be a cool game to try out .
Let 's download it .
9:55 pm : This download is fifty minutes long .
10:00 pm : I 'm going to bed .
UPDATE :
The house was so crowded during the reunion that no young couple , wed or unwed , had its own room .
The younger people bunked dormitory style , one room assigned to boys , another to girls .

I locked my bicycle to a fence outside my building a few times over two weeks .
One morning , it was gone .
My landlady had the police remove it , claiming she tried to alert the owner by letting the air out of the tires .
She left no note .
At the precinct , an officer said she told them the bike had been there for three months .
Fortunately , I reclaimed it undamaged .
Unfortunately , the police cut the locks : replacement costs are $ 150 .
Should my landlady cover that ?
NAME WITHHELD , NEW YORK
I do n’t understand how flattening the tires says , “ Please move your bicycle , ” but then I have trouble with nonverbal languages like the raised eyebrow , the crisp uppercut and the hula .
You are not entitled to store your bike on your landlady ’s private property .
She has the legal right to ask the police to haul it off to bike jail .
But ethics take a less sanguine view of her conduct .
Your landlady made no meaningful effort to contact you and , if your account is accurate — hers might differ — she filed what amounts to a false police report .
She should do more than contribute to your bill ; she should replace the locks , apologize and maybe sew some new curtains for your apartment , to expiate her misconduct .
Or do some sort of dance that would communicate remorse ( to erudite Hawaiians , if not to me ) .
There is no citywide policy covering situations like yours , according to the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives , but Manhattan ’s Ninth Precinct has adopted a prudent approach .
Transportation Alternatives wrote in a recent issue of its magazine that , upon receiving a complaint , the police put a note on the bike “ alerting the owner that the bike will be removed after 10 days . ”
The assumption is that if the bike belongs to someone , its owner will see the notice and remove the bike ; if it ’s abandoned , the police will then remove it .
In your case , the police should have acted similarly .
Conflicts like this could be reduced if the city provided sufficient spots for cyclists to lock their bikes .
Happily , the Department of Transportation is installing many more bike racks around town .
Noooooooooo Mommy !

French riot police have evacuated at least 150 Afghan boys and men from the " jungle " , a makeshift migrant camp on the Channel coast .
Riot police took up positions at dawn outside the tent city on a patch of sandy scrubland in Calais as the remaining migrants gathered behind banners with slogans pleading with the French authorities for shelter and protection .
As the first dozen officers entered the camp a small group of rights activists formed a human chain trying to bar access to the migrants , shouting " no border , no nation , stop deportation " .
Police led out the migrants one by one who followed without resistance amid the angry shouts of the protesters and with dozens of journalists looking on .
Thousands of mainly male migrants , from Afghanistan , Iraq and other troubled nations , have headed to Calais in the past decade to try to jump on a ferry or a train crossing the Channel tunnel to Britain .
But government officials say the Calais " jungle " has become a haven for people - smuggling gangs and a no - go zone for locals , with appalling sanitary conditions blamed for an outbreak of scabies in the past few months .
From a peak of 700 mostly Afghan Pashtuns based in the " jungle " in June , aid groups say two thirds have fled since the government indicated it would close the camp in April .
Aid groups also say the crackdown will simply push migrants further underground , making them more vulnerable to traffickers and criminal gangs .

Damn Cool Algorithms : Spatial indexing with Quadtrees and Hilbert Curves
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under tech , coding , damn - cool - algorithms
Last Thursday night at Oredev , after the sessions , was " Birds of a Feather " - a sort of mini-unconference .
Anyone could write up a topic on the whiteboard ; interested individuals added their names , and each group got allocated a room to chat about the topic .
I joined the " Spatial Indexing " group , and we spent a fascinating hour and a half talking about spatial indexing methods , reminding me of several interesting algorithms and techniques .
Spatial indexing is increasingly important as more and more data and applications are geospatially - enabled .
Efficiently querying geospatial data , however , is a considerable challenge : because the data is two - dimensional ( or sometimes , more ) , you can't use standard indexing techniques to query on position .
Spatial indexes solve this through a variety of techniques .
In this post , we 'll cover several - quadtrees , geohashes ( not to be confused with geohashing ) , and space - filling curves - and reveal how they 're all interrelated .
Quadtrees
Quadtrees are a very straightforward spatial indexing technique .
In a Quadtree , each node represents a bounding box covering some part of the space being indexed , with the root node covering the entire area .
Each node is either a leaf node - in which case it contains one or more indexed points , and no children , or it is an internal node , in which case it has exactly four children , one for each quadrant obtained by dividing the area covered in half along both axes - hence the name .
A representation of how a quadtree divides an indexed area .
Source : Wikipedia
Inserting data into a quadtree is simple : Starting at the root , determine which quadrant your point occupies .
Recurse to that node and repeat , until you find a leaf node .
Then , add your point to that node 's list of points .
If the list exceeds some pre-determined maximum number of elements , split the node , and move the points into the correct subnodes .
A representation of how a quadtree is structured internally .
To query a quadtree , starting at the root , examine each child node , and check if it intersects the area being queried for .
If it does , recurse into that child node .
Whenever you encounter a leaf node , examine each entry to see if it intersects with the query area , and return it if it does .
Note that a quadtree is very regular - it is , in fact , a trie , since the values of the tree nodes do not depend on the data being inserted .
A consequence of this is that we can uniquely number our nodes in a straightforward manner :
Simply number each quadrant in binary ( 00 for the top left , 10 for the top right , and so forth ) , and the number for a node is the concatenation of the quadrant numbers for each of its ancestors , starting at the root .
Using this system , the bottom right node in the sample image would be numbered 11 01 .
If we define a maximum depth for our tree , then , we can calculate a point 's node number without reference to the tree - simply normalize the node 's coordinates to an appropriate integer range ( for example , 32 bits each ) , and then interleave the bits from the x and y coordinates - each pair of bits specifies a quadrant in the hypothetical quadtree .
Geohashes
This system might seem familiar : it 's a geohash !
At this point , you can actually throw out the quadtree itself - the node number , or geohash , contains all the information we need about its location in the tree .
Each leaf node in a full - height tree is a complete geohash , and each internal node is represented by the range from its smallest leaf node to its largest one .
Thus , you can efficiently locate all the points under any internal node by indexing on the geohash by performing a query for everything within the numeric range covered by the desired node .
Querying once we 've thrown away the tree itself becomes a little more complex .
Instead of refining our search set recursively , we need to construct a search set ahead of time .
First , find the smallest prefix ( or quadtree node ) that completely covers the query area .
In the worst case , this may be substantially larger than the actual query area - for example , a small shape in the center of the indexed area that intersects all four quadrants would require selecting the root node for this step .
The aim , now , is to construct a set of prefixes that completely covers the query region , while including as little area outside the region as possible .
If we had no other constraints , we could simply select the set of leaf nodes that intersect the query area - but that would result in a lot of queries .
Another constraint , then , is that we want to minimise the number of distinct ranges we have to query for .
One approach to doing this is to start by setting a maximum number of ranges we 're willing to have .
Construct a set of ranges , initially populated with the prefix we identified earlier .
Pick the node in the set that can be subdivided without exceeding the maximum range count and will remove the most unwanted area from the query region .
Repeat this until there are no ranges in the set that can be further subdivided .
Finally , examine the resulting set , and join any adjacent ranges , if possible .
The diagram below demonstrates how this works for a query on a circular area with a limit of 5 query ranges .
How a query for a region is broken into a series of geohash prefixes / ranges .
This approach works well , and it allows us to avoid the need to do recursive lookups - the set of range lookups we do execute can all be done in parallel .
Since each lookup can be expected to require a disk seek , parallelizing our queries allows us to substantially cut down the time required to return the results .
Still , we can do better .
You may notice that all the areas we need to query in the above diagram are adjacent , yet we can only merge two of them ( the two in the bottom right of the selected area ) into a single range query , requiring us to do 4 separate queries .
This is due in part to the order that our geohashing approach ' visits ' subregions , working left to right , then top to bottom in each quad .
The discontinuity as we go from top right to bottom left quad results in us having to split up some ranges that we could otherwise make contiguous .
If we were to visit regions in a different order , perhaps we could minimise or eliminate these discontinuities , resulting in more areas that can be treated as adjacent and fetched with a single query .
With an improvement in efficiency like that , we could do fewer queries for the same area covered , or conversely , the same number of queries , but including less extraneous area .
Illustrates the order in which the geohashing approach ' visits ' each quad .
Hilbert Curves
Suppose instead , we visit regions in a ' U ' shape .
Within each quad , of course , we also visit subquads in the same ' U ' shape , but aligned so as to match up with neighbouring quads .
If we organise the orientation of these 'U 's correctly , we can completely eliminate any discontinuities , and visit the entire area at whatever resolution we choose continuously , fully exploring each region before moving on to the next .
Not only does this eliminate discontinuities , but it also improves the overall locality .
The pattern we get if we do this may look familiar - it 's a Hilbert Curve .
Hilbert Curves are part of a class of one - dimensional fractals known as space - filling curves , so named because they are one dimensional lines that nevertheless fill all available space in a fixed area .
They 're fairly well known , in part thanks to XKCD 's use of them for a map of the internet .
As you can see , they 're also of use for spatial indexing , since they exhibit exactly the locality and continuity required .
For example , if we take another look at the example we used for finding the set of queries required to encompass a circle above , we find that we can reduce the number of queries by one : the small region in the lower left is now contiguous with the region to its right , and whilst the two regions at the bottom are no longer contiguous with each other , the rightmost one is now contiguous with the large area in the upper right .
Illustrates the order in which a hilbert curve ' visits ' each quad .
One thing that our elegant new system is lacking , so far , is a way of converting between a pair of ( x , y ) coordinates and the corresponding position in the hilbert curve .
With geohashing it was easy and obvious - just interleave the x and y coordinates - but there 's no obvious way to modify that for a hilbert curve .
Searching the internet , you 're likely to come across many descriptions of how hilbert curves are drawn , but few if any descriptions of how to find the position of an arbitrary point .
To figure this out , we need to take a closer look at how the hilbert cure can be recursively constructed .
The first thing to observe is that although most references to hilbert curves focus on how to draw the curve , this is a distraction from the essential property of the curve , and its importance to us :
It 's an ordering for points on a plane .
If we express a hilbert curve in terms of this ordering , drawing the curve itself becomes trivial - simply a matter of connecting the dots .
Forget about how to connect adjacent sub-curves , and instead focus on how we can recursively enumerate the points .
Hilbert curves are all about ordering a set of points on a 2d plane
At the root level , enumerating the points is simple :
Pick a direction and a start point , and proceed around the four quadrants , numbering them 0 to 3 .
The difficulty is introduced when we want to determine the order we visit the sub-quadrants in while maintaining the overall adjacency property .
Examination reveals that each of the sub- quadrants ' curves is a simple transformation of the original curve : there are only four possible transformations .
Naturally , this applies recursively to sub-sub quadrants , and so forth .
The curve we use for a given quadrant is determined by the curve we used for the square it 's in , and the quadrant 's position .
With a little work , we can construct a table that encapsulates this :
Suppose we want to use this table to determine the position of a point on a third - level hilbert curve .
For the sake of this example , assume our point has coordinates ( 5,2 ) Starting with the first square on the diagram , find the quadrant your point is in - in this case , it 's the upper right quadrant .
The first part of our hilbert curve position , then , is 3 ( 11 in binary ) .
Next , we consult the square shown in the inset of square 3 - in this case , it 's the second square .
Repeat the process : which sub -quadrant does our point fall into ?
Here , it 's the lower left one , meaning the next part of our position is 1 , and the square we should consult next is the second one again .
Repeating the process one final time , we find our point falls in the upper right sub - sub - quadrant , our final coordinate is 3 ( 11 in binary ) .
Stringing them together , we now know the position of our point on the curve is 110111 binary , or 55 .
Let 's be a little more methodical , and write methods to convert between x ,y coordinates and hilbert curve positions .
First , we need to express our diagram above in terms a computer can understand :
hilbert_map = { ' a ' : { ( 0 , 0 ) : ( 0 , ' d ' ) , ( 0 , 1 ) : ( 1 , 'a ' ) , ( 1 , 0 ) : ( 3 , ' b ' ) , ( 1 , 1 ) : ( 2 , 'a ' ) } , ' b ' : { ( 0 , 0 ) : ( 2 , 'b ' ) , ( 0 , 1 ) : ( 1 , 'b ' ) , ( 1 , 0 ) : ( 3 , 'a ' ) , ( 1 , 1 ) : ( 0 , ' c ' ) } , ' c ' : { ( 0 , 0 ) : ( 2 , 'c ' ) , ( 0 , 1 ) : ( 3 , ' d ' ) , ( 1 , 0 ) : ( 1 , 'c ' ) , ( 1 , 1 ) : ( 0 , ' b ' ) } , 'd ' : { ( 0 , 0 ) : ( 0 , 'a ' ) , ( 0 , 1 ) : ( 3 , 'c ' ) , ( 1 , 0 ) : ( 1 , 'd ' ) , ( 1 , 1 ) : ( 2 , 'd ' ) } , }
In the snippet above , each element of ' hilbert_map ' corresponds to one of the four squares in the diagram above .
To make things easier to follow , I 've identified each one with a letter - ' a ' is the first square , ' b ' the second , and so forth .
The value for each square is a dict , mapping x and y coordinates for the ( sub - ) quadrant to the position along the line ( the first part of the value tuple ) and the square to use next ( the second part of the value tuple ) .
Here 's how we can use this to translate x and y coordinates into a hilbert curve position :
def point_to_hilbert( x , y , order =16 ) : current_square = ' a ' position = 0 for i in range ( order - 1 , - 1 , - 1 ) : position < <= 2 quad_x = 1 if x & ( 1 << i ) else 0 quad_y = 1 if y & ( 1 << i ) else 0 quad_position , current_square = hilbert_map[ current_square ] [ ( quad_x , quad_y ) ] position |= quad_position return position
The input to this function is the integer x and y coordinates , and the order of the curve .
An order 1 curve fills a 2x2 grid , an order 2 curve fills a 4x4 grid , and so forth .
Our x and y coordinates , then , should be normalized to a range of 0 to 2order - 1 .
The function works by stepping over each bit of the x and y coordinates , starting with the most significant .
For each , it determines which ( sub - ) quadrant the coordinate lies in , by testing the corresponding bit , then fetches the position along the line and the next square to use from the table we defined earlier .
The curve position is set as the least significant 2 bits on the position variable , and at the beginning of the next loop , it 's left - shifted to make room for the next set of coordinates .
Let 's check that we 've written the function correctly by running our example from above through it :
>>> point_to_hilbert ( 5,2,3 ) 55
Presto !
For a further test , we can use the function to generate a complete list of ordered points for a hilbert curve , then use a spreadsheet to graph them and see if we get a hilbert curve .
Enter the following expression into an interactive Python interpreter :
>>> points = [ ( x , y ) for x in range ( 8 ) for y in range ( 8 ) ] >>> sorted_points = sorted ( points , key=lambda k : point_to_hilbert ( k[ 0 ] , k[ 1 ] , 3 ) ) >>> print '
'. join ( ' %s , %s ' % x for x in sorted_points )
Take the resulting text , paste it into a file called ' hilbert.csv ' , open it in your favorite spreadsheet , and instruct it to generate a scatter plot .
The result is , of course , a nicely plotted hilbert curve !
The inverse of point_to_hilbert is a straightforward reversal of the hilbert_map ; implementing it is left as an exercise for the reader .
Conclusion
There you have it - spatial indexing , from quadtrees to geohashes to hilbert curves .
One final observation :
If you express the ordered sequence of x , y coordinates required to draw a hilbert curve in binary , do you notice anything interesting about the ordering ?
Does it remind you of anything ?
Just to wrap up , a caveat :
All of the indexing methods I 've described today are only well - suited to indexing points .
If you want to index lines , polylines , or polygons , you 're probably out of luck with these methods - and so far as I 'm aware , the only known algorithm for effectively indexing shapes is the R - tree , an entirely different and more complex beast .

Late - night TV host David Letterman has apologised to his wife on his Late Show , saying she had been " horribly hurt by my behaviour . "
Letterman vowed to repair his relationship with his wife , Regina Lasko .

" Let me tell you folks , I got my work cut out for me , " said Letterman , according to an early transcript of the programme released by CBS .
Monday 's show was the first Letterman taped since Thursday , when he disclosed that he had had sexual relationships with women who worked for him , and that he had been the victim of an alleged US $ 2 m blackmail threat .
Letterman also apologised to his staff for the situation .
" Inadvertently , I just was n't thinking ahead , " Letterman said .
" My thanks to the staff for , once again , putting up with something stupid I 've gotten myself involved in . "
Audience members who attended the taping on Monday ( local time ) at the Ed Sullivan Theater said Letterman spoke frequently throughout the programme about the events .
He also joked about the situation with guests Steve Martin and Martin Short .
" He 's not running away from it , " said Brian Lakari , from Green Bay , Wisconsin , who attended the taping with his wife , Kelly .
" He brought it into the show several times . "
Lakari said Letterman started his monologue with the subject , and even worked in an apology to " the previous governor of Alaska . "
He was referring to Sarah Palin , with whom Letterman had a flap earlier in the year over a joke about her daughters .
It is unclear how many women Letterman had sex with , and he has offered no specifics .

Oct. 5 , 2009 -- New research provides further evidence that links antidepressant use among pregnant mothers to problems for their newborns at birth .
The study showed that exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) is associated with babies born an average of five days earlier and with twice the rate of premature births as infants whose mothers had no history of psychiatric illness .
Premature birth -- also known as preterm birth -- is commonly defined as happening before the baby has reached 37 weeks and happens in about 12 % of all pregnancies .
Cognitive problems , breathing problems , cerebral palsy , and digestive problems are all associated with preemie births .
Newborns whose mothers took SSRIs while expecting were also more than twice as likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) and to have a lower 5 - minute Apgar score than babies whose mothers did not take the drugs during pregnancy , according to the study .
The Apgar score is a shorthand method of rating a newborn ’s health status immediately after birth .
“ Based on these results , we can say that there is an effect of SSRIs taken during pregnancy , ” says lead researcher Najaaraq Lund , MD .
“ But whether or not this should be a reason for avoiding SSRIs ?
We still do n’t have a final answer , ” says Lund , who was a medical student researcher at the University of Aarhus in Denmark at the time the study was conducted .
SSRIs are the most common class of antidepressants taken by pregnant women in the U.S. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) estimates that between 14 % - 23 % of all pregnant women experience some form of depression during pregnancy .
In the study , Lund ’s team used health records of more than 56,000 women who received prenatal care from the University of Aarhus Hospital between 1989 and 2006 .
The vast majority of these women had no psychiatric illness , but about 300 of them had received SSRIs during their pregnancy and nearly 5,000 of the study participants had a history of psychiatric problems but did not take any SSRIs while being treated for their pregnancy .

I watched the pilot for ABC ’s “ V ” last night and overall I was impressed .
I LOVED seeing Alan Tudyk and Morena Baccarin back on TV , and Juliette from “ Lost ” ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) definitely held her own and my interest .
The pilot cover a lot more of the “ V ” mythos than I thought it would or could in 1 hour .
I would have expected at least a 2 hr installment before we got the “ big reveal . ”

If you saw the pilot you know the V’s are trying to convince the people of Earth that they ’ve never encountered other intelligent life before .
If that ’s the case , then why do all of their city - sized ships have 40 mile while LCD screen public address systems covering their entire undersides ?
Seems that that would only be useful for addressing entire planets or select pay per view events .

Serious Question :
You know what is an awesome thing to buy for yourself or others or pets ?
Answer : MY BOOK !
UK government gets a final warning on claims that its laws do n't protect Britons from ad targeting companies such as Phorm
Given the amount of CCTV there is everywhere , we know the UK tolerates spying on its citizens more than other EU countries .
But now Britain might be taken to court by the EU for failing to provide the UK citizens with enough privacy and personal data protection .
The EU just launched the second step of legal action to force Britain to bring its data protection framework into line with its rules , which guarantee the confidentiality of electronic communication such as emails and internet surfing .
Before being internationally embarrassed , the UK has two month to comply with the detailed opinion , which was sent to the UK by the European Commission yesterday and marks the second stage of infringement procedure .
The EU Commission has basically identified three failings .
First , there is no independent authority supervising the interception of communications and hearing related complaints .
Second , there is an excessively wide interpretation of the principle of consent given in Britain 's Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act .
Third , its sanctions against the interception of personal data are too limited .
The case came up last year when the technology company Phorm planned a targeted web advertising system .
This included the tracking of their customers ' internet traffic without telling them .
British MEPs protested and campaigners complained to the information commissioner , the interception commissioner , government departments , Ofcom and the police .
All refused to act .
Government investigation concluded that Phorm did n't breach European laws on data protection and The City of London police announced as well , that they had found no evidence of illegal activity .
So in 2008 the campaigners wrote to Viviane Reding , the EU telecoms commissioner .
And she responded .
" People 's privacy and the integrity of their personal data ... is a fundamental right , protected by European law .
That is why the Commission is vigilant in ensuring that EU rules and rights are put in place , " she said in a statement yesterday .
" I therefore call on the UK authorities to change their national laws to ensure that British citizens fully benefit from the safeguards set out in EU law concerning confidentiality of electronic communications . "
A consolation might be that the EU Commission has also sent letters of formal notice , the first stage of the infringement procedure , to Romania , Poland and Germany .

Researchers present new eyewitness testimony which they say proves the government 's story to be a " monstrous lie "
End
-- A three year independent investigation into the September 11 , 2001 attack on the Pentagon has yielded new eyewitness evidence which , according to the Southern California - based researchers who conducted the investigation , " conclusively ( and unfortunately ) establishes as a historical fact that the violence which took place in Arlington that day was not the result of a surprise attack by suicide hijackers , but rather a military black operation involving a carefully planned and skillfully executed deception .
" They have compiled the most pertinent testimony into an 81 minute video presentation entitled National Security Alert , which has earned the respect and praise of a growing number of distinguished academics , journalists , writers , entertainers , pilots , and military personnel .
The investigation involved multiple trips to the scene of the crime in Arlington , Virginia , close scrutiny of all official and unofficial data related to the event , and , most importantly , first - person interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses , many of which were conducted and filmed in the exact locations from which they witnessed the plane that allegedly struck the building that day .
It was primarily conducted by two men named Craig Ranke and Aldo Marquis , also known as Citizen Investigation Team , or CIT .
" There were a growing number of people in the United States and around the world who were suspicious of the government 's story about what had happened at the Pentagon that day , " Ranke explains .
" The doubts were initially fueled by the dubious damage to the building , which seemed incompatible with a 757 crash , the deliberate lack of transparency by the authorities , and many other issues , but they really intensified after a team of professional pilots ( Pilots for 9/11 Truth ) analyzed the data obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) via a Freedom of Information
Act request in 2006 , which was supposedly from the black box of American Airlines Flight 77 , and found that the last reported altitude of the plane was far too high to have struck the light poles or the building .
This meant that either the plane did not cause the observed physical damage , that the government had released fraudulent data , or both . "
" We were tired of the cover - up , but we were also frustrated with the dead - end theorizing that was taking place " , says Marquis of the project 's genesis .
" We knew that the only way we were ever going to know what had really happened was if we actually went to the area , knocked on doors , and interviewed everyday people about what they saw .
" When these eyewitness accounts are aggregated , they paint a very disturbing picture , say the researchers .
" To put it as concisely as possible , the plane had to have flown on a very specific flight path in the final seconds before it reached the Pentagon in order to have caused the observed damage , starting with the light poles that were photographed on the ground and ending with the directional damage to the building itself which was outlined in detail by the American Society of Civil Engineers , " explains Ranke .
" The government claims the plane flew on this flight path and hit the building .
The eyewitnesses in all of the most critical vantage points , on the other hand , independently , unanimously , and unequivocally report a drastically different flight path , proving that the plane absolutely could not have hit the light poles or the building .
It is a non-controversial scientific fact that a strike from this trajectory would have caused a very different damage path .
" It was n't just witnesses who watched the plane approach the building that the team spoke with , however .
" We've also published our interview with a Pentagon police officer who saw the plane flying away from the Pentagon immediately after the explosion " , says Marquis .
" We already knew that the plane could not have hit based on the testimony of the witnesses on the other side of the building who watched it approach , but it was still vindicating to get this kind of confirmation . " A 2006 Scripps Howard / Ohio University poll found that " More than a third of the American public suspects that federal officials assisted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks or took no action to stop them so the United States could go to war in the Middle East . "
Nevertheless , Ranke and Marquis acknowledge it is still quite controversial to claim , as they do , that " criminal elements within the U.S. government " were complicit in the attacks .
"
If you are skeptical of ( or even incensed by ) this statement we do not blame you , " reads a note on the front page of their website , CitizenInvestigationTeam.com .
" We are not asking you to take our word for it , nor do we want you to do that .
We want you to view the evidence and see with your own eyes that this is the case .
We want you to hear it directly from the eyewitnesses who were there , just as we did .
" Many people seem to be taking them up on this offer .
Their video has already received almost 70,000 views online since it was first posted to their website a few weeks ago with only a grass roots promotional effort behind it .
Perhaps more notable than the size of the audience , however , is the caliber of some of the people in it .
A newly - published compendium of endorsements on the CitizenInvestigationTeam.com website includes praise from a wide array of distinguished and well - respected Americans .
Emmy - award winning actor and former president of The Screen actors Guild , Ed Asner , calls the film a " reasoned , and methodical look at witness testimony the day the Pentagon was attacked on Sept. 11th " .
Prolific non-ficition author Dr. Peter Dale Scott , Professor Emeritus of the University of California , Berkeley affirms that the film " successfully rebuts the official account of Flight 77's flight path on 9/11 as it approached the Pentagon " .
" If you accept the placement of the plane as independently and unanimously reported by the witnesses presented in CIT 's video National Security Alert , science proves that it did not cause the physical damage at the Pentagon on 9/11/2001 " , says FAA certified pilot Robert Balsamo .
Dr. David Ray Griffin , author of The New Pearl Harbor Revisited : 9/11 , the Cover - Up , and the Exposé and many other titles , says he is " pleased to be able to recommend this important film with enthusiasm " , while scholar , author , and radio host Dr. Kevin Barrett says that the film proves " that the official version of the attack on the Pentagon is false , and that the attack must have been a deceptive military operation , not the kamakaze crash of a hijacked commercial jet .
" Scott McKinsey , an award - winning network television director , says " The DVD offers no theorizing or speculation ; only corroborated eyewitness evidence contradicting the official flight data to support an overwhelming argument that a plane did not slam into the Pentagon on 9/11 " .
Architect Richard Gage , AIA , founder of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ( AE911 Truth.org ) , a coalition of over 700 professional architects and engineers calling for a new independent investigation of the destruction of the three skyscrapers in New York on 9/11 ( the third was World Trade Center 7 ) , calls the film " long overdue , but worth waiting for " and says that it " deserves serious attention " .
Retired Navy Commander and aviator James R. Compton calls National Security Alert " the best reporting I 've seen in a long , long time " and " a must see for every citizen in our country " .
" Government and media figures who dare ignore evidence this conclusive do so at their own peril " , warns Lt. Col.
Shelton Lankford , a retired Marine pilot who has flown 303 combat missions .

This Latin word was revived 16 c. by German scholars , whose custom was to keep an album amicorum of colleagues ' signatures ; its meaning then expanded to " book with blank leaves meant to collect signatures and other souvenirs . "
Johnson [ 1755 ] still defined it as " a book in which foreigners have long been accustomed to insert autographs of celebrated people . "
Latin album is literally " white color , whiteness ; " it is a noun use of the neuter of the adjective albus " white " ( see alb ) .

A Rented Rally
Rough week , eh ?
Anyone would think the markets had developed an acute sense of multiple personality disorder the way they are behaving .
One moment it ’s Pollyanna , whispering sweet nothings … then the eyes glaze over and the voice drops a few octaves … something more sinister has crept in .
Even the intra-day activity was difficult to pin down .
After a huge spike following their earnings announcement on Wednesday morning , Wells Fargo slipped 7 % for the day , “ a classic ‘ outside day ’ reversal , ” as Eric Fry pointed out in Thursday ’s issue .
Indeed , the Dow Jones Industrial Average itself collapsed 165 points , top to bottom , on Wednesday , with a triple digit haircut in the last couple of hours alone .
That ’s not the kind of “ confidence ” you want to see confirming a “ recovery . ”
But markets do n’t move in straight lines , dear reader … neither up nor down .
After all , a sucker ’s rally is nothing without the suckers .
Ergo , Mr. Market must lure in as many victims as he can with promises of better sunsets and fatter cigars for all .
For his part , the sucker is ready and willing to believe anything that confirms his delusion .
He was ready to buy a house he could n’t afford … ready to believe stocks would always go up …ready to believe he could always get something for nothing .
And if he ’ll believe all that , he ’ll surely believe a jobless recovery with contracting earnings and ballooning deficits is all but a sure thing .
But he ’s living on borrowed time , as Dan Amoss explains .
“ A rational , disciplined investor would be fearful about buying today , after prices have been jacked up by an unprecedented seven - month rally , ” warns Dan , the mind behind the Strategic Short Report .
“ Nearly every economic and corporate development over the past few months has been translated into a reason to buy stocks .
But underneath the elation over Dow 10,000 lies the palpable feeling that this rally is to be ‘ rented , ’ not ‘ owned . ’ ”
Every day the rally persists , in other words , the probability that it will perform a “ black swan dive ” off the cliff increases .
Stocks are rapidly approaching – and in some cases have eclipsed – valuations that presuppose a robust , multi - year recovery is well underway .
The S&P 500 index sells for over 19x FALLING earnings … earnings that are unlikely to improve in any meaningful , sustainable way .
Companies , meanwhile , are slashing employees like a bad horror flick .
Initial jobless applications rose by 11,000 to 531,000 in the week ended October 17 , according to the Labor Department .
Economists fret that people working fewer hours and earning less money might tighten their belts a bit going into the Christmas season .
They worry about what might happen to their consumer economy when the consumers economize .
We could take a guess … but we would n’t want to spoil the ending .
Besides , thoughtful , reasonable individuals have already read the book .
They have a pretty good idea how it all shakes out … and they ’re running for the hills .
“ Something is wrong … something is dead wrong . ”
You can read more and see the video here : Something ’s wrong in the world of chess .
Oh , what a delight , an interview fertile for comment — by me .
Is chess dead , or are we just making it irrelevant by the way we handle modern competition ?
Where do I begin ?
I could revert to the irritation my high school physics instructor expressed when someone would want to know what the answer to a problem was .
“ It does n’t matter , ” he would blurt .
“ Did you understand the concept ? ”
Most current players are obsessed with right answers– which is why they run to Fritz every time their brain hurts .
Then again , I could turn the topic to faster time controls , which have turned competitive chess from something almost sexy to sheer intellectual masturbation .
Or should I quote a certain American Grandmaster , who not long ago explained that the likes of Emanuel Lasker could teach him nothing ?
Which .. reminds me ..
Kasparov also said this : “ Something is dead wrong , if nobody cares about everything else and everybody pays attention to a match of , okay , two old guys . ”
The fact is , it ’s not only more interesting to watch Kasparov and Karpov play now– because at least it reminds us of a day when a world title actually meant something – but it is more interesting still to study the games of ..
Emanuel Lasker– you know , the really , really old guys … than the ever - increasing heap that has become the modern Grandmaster pool .

All Purpose Dyes
All - purpose dye is a hot water dye .
It contains a mixture of dyes which will work on many different kinds of fabric and yarn , but not particularly well on any of them .
It is often used in situations when another kind of dye would perform better , largely because many people are unaware that there are higher quality dyes that they could use .
What is All Purpose Dye ?
" All purpose " dye is a mixture of Acid dye , of the leveling acid type , for dyeing wool and other animal ( protein ) fibers , as well as nylon , and Direct dye , for dyeing cellulose fibers such as cotton , rayon , linen , etc .
In some cases it may contain an acid dye that also happens to work pretty well as a direct dye .
All - purpose dye cannot be used to dye polyester or acrylic , and it can not be used in cold water .
Note that company that produces
Rit dye changed the formulas for their all - purpose dyes in 2010 .
This page has not yet been updated to reflect those changes .
The new formulas will not work on acetate , although the old formulas did .
Great for Dyeing Fiber Blends
Wasteful for Single Fibers
In addition , the formulas for all - purpose dye generally contain a lot of salt .
Salt is cheap , but it makes the package appear to contain more dye than it really does .
Salt is useful in dyeing solid colors , but causes problems for specialized dyeing techniques in which the dye is painted on the material .
Popular Brands
Use the Correct Recipe !
I have received many , many sad e-mails from people who tie - dyed shirts with Rit® brand all - purpose dye , only to see the dye rinse out the first time they washed it .
The reason for their failures is that they used the wrong recipe !
If you apply all - purpose dye cold , with squirt bottles , you will not be dyeing your fabric , merely staining it .
This is not the fault of the dye , but of the use of the wrong technique .
To dye cotton with all - purpose dye , you must use heat , and plenty of time .
Submerging the garment to be dyed in Rit® brand dye and simmering hot water will produce pastels after five minutes , or deeper , more intense shades after half an hour .
The ideal temperature is far hotter than tap water can reach , at least 190 °F ( or 87 °C ) .
( See How can I tie - dye with all - purpose dye ?. )
Note that vinegar is neither necessary nor helpful for dyeing cotton with all - purpose dye , but should be used when dyeing nylon or dyeing animal fibers such as wool .
The manufacturers of Tintex® High Temp all - purpose dye recommend the use of 100 ml ( 2/5 cup ) of white vinegar per 4 liters of water when dyeing wool , silk , or nylon .
Do NOT bother to add soda ash when dyeing with all - purpose dye .
Soda ash is used only when dyeing with fiber reactive dye .
It will not act as a dye fixative for all - purpose dye .
Use enough Dye
Each packet of all - purpose dye contains only enough dye for 4 to 8 ounces of material ( 100 to 200 grams ) .
Black requires two to four times as much dye as other colors .
Weigh the garment you are dyeing , and be sure to use enough packets of dye !
Smaller amounts of dye will result in paler colors .
Trying to dye black with only one packet of dye usually results in gray , not black .
Beware of Bad Advice
Dissolving all - purpose dye in boiling water does nothing to make it stick to the fiber , if you let the dye cool before applying it .
As an alternative , you may apply a concentrated mixture of water with Rit dye at room temperature , wrap up your fabric , yarn , or fiber in plastic wrap while it is still very wet with dye , and then steam it for at least half an hour , in much the same way that you would steam vegetables .
The heat of an extended period of steaming will help the dye to attach to the fiber .
Dry heat will not work ; moisture must be present .
Experiment to see how well this works on your materials .
Use an After - Treatment to Prevent Bleeding
Advantages of the Direct Dye in All - Purpose Dye
Disadvantages of the Direct Dye in All - Purpose Dye
Some people imagine that all purpose dye is safer than fiber reactive dye , simply because it is so readily available .
There is no basis for this belief , however .
Deborah Dryden , in her book Fabric Painting and Dyeing for the Theatre , revealed that all - purpose dyes have , in the past , contained a specific direct dye that was known to be carcinogenic ; since the makers of all - purpose dye do not disclose their ingredients , however , there is no way to tell whether or not this is still true .
In fact , into the 1970s , all - purpose dyes for home use are known to have contained some quite dangerous direct dyes .
The most hazardous dyes include derivatives of the chemicals benzidine or o-dianisidine , including direct black 1 , direct red 28 , direct black 38 , direct blue 6 , direct green 6 , direct brown 95 , direct brown 2 , direct blue 2 , and direct black 4 .
( See the government document " Benzidine and Dyes Metabolized to Benzidine " [ PDF ] . )
Some employees of dye manufacturers in the past suffered from bladder cancer that was caused by exposure to benzidine and benzidine - based dyes .
( Employees of dye companies are exposed to much higher levels of dyes and their chemical precursors than anyone else . )
Claims that any art material is non-toxic are poorly regulated , and simply mean that it will not cause acute poisoning if accidentally consumed ; they do not imply total safety .
It is always important to avoid breathing powdered dye , of any sort .
Always wear gloves when using dyes .
Wear safety glasses when pouring dye liquids .
Some acid dyes are much safer than others .
We do not know which are contained in all - purpose dyes , as this is a trade secret .
I believe that all - purpose dyes are safer than some of the most dangerous acid dyes , and much safer than basic dyes or napthol dyes , but not safer than fiber reactive dyes .
Since no all - purpose dye has been tested for safety when consumed by humans or animals , you should not expect to reuse your dyeing pot for cooking food .
Use a non-aluminum pot that you will not be using for cooking .
If you want to be able to use an inexpensive plastic bucket , rather than a cooking pot , use a cool water fiber reactive dye , such as Procion MX dye .

Uncompromising advocate of free culture that I am , I have to move with the times .
Since pdf's of bothandhave shown up at numerous torrent sites , there 's not much point in continuing to advertise the pdf's for sale .
I have , accordingly , made them available as free downloads at Mutualist .
Org :
Of course , those who want to make donations with their downloads can still do so by clicking on the same PayPal buttons as before ( or by clicking the PayPal button on the sidebar of this blog ) .
I 've said , and I believe , that such free ebooks increase sales of the print version .
I do n't know about you , but I really hate to have to read hunched over a computer screen .
I can't even concentrate on on - screen material because of the ingrained habit of quickly scanning online text , rather than carefully digesting it the way I do with printed texts I can hold in my hand while sitting in a comfortable position .
Just trying to concentrate on an extended on - screen text makes me restless and inattentive in a fairly short time .
I generally look at a free ebook online just long enough to get an idea of the contents and whether they 're something I want to read , and then look for a cheap used print copy to read it in depth .
Other than that , the main benefit of an online text is the comparative ease of cutting and pasting blockquotes I originally found in the written text , compared to propping the book open and typing an entire passage .
I 'm sure a lot of other people are the same way ; the easier it is to sample the text , the more people will be interested in buying the book .
So download the pdf's if you 're interested ; if you find the subject matter engrossing but get tired of staring at a keyboard , you can order a print version to read in comfort .
BERT and BERT - RPC 1.0 Specification
Purpose
BERT and BERT - RPC are an attempt to specify a flexible binary serialization and RPC protocol that are compatible with the philosophies of dynamic languages such as Ruby , Python , PERL , JavaScript , Erlang , Lua , etc. BERT aims to be as simple as possible while maintaining support for the advanced data types we have come to know and love .
BERT - RPC is designed to work seamlessly within a dynamic / agile development workflow .
The BERT - RPC philosophy is to eliminate extraneous type checking , IDL specification , and code generation .
This frees the developer to actually get things done .
This document represents the 1.0 specification for both BERT and BERT - RPC .
The primary author of this document is Tom Preston - Werner , cofounder of GitHub .
These technologies are currently in production use within the infrastructure of GitHub and play a part in serving nearly every page of the site .
All discussion should be made via the Mailing List .
BERT
BERT ( Binary ERlang Term ) is a flexible binary data interchange format based on ( and compatible with ) Erlang 's binary serialization format ( as used by erlang : term_to_binary / 1 ) .
BERT supports the following simple data types ( shown here using Erlang syntax ) :
integer 4 float 8.1516 atom foo tuple {coord , 23 , 42} bytelist [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] list [ a , [ 1 , 2 ] ] binary <>
Any of the above data types may be referred to as a " term . "
Tuples and lists may contain heterogenous terms as their elements .
For example , the tuple {coord , 23 , 42} contains one atom and two integers , and the list [ a , [ 1 , 2 ] ] contains one atom and one list .
In addition to these simple types , BERT defines standard formats for a variety of complex data types .
Complex types are built with the simple primitives and are dependent upon specific BERT implementations for conversion to native data types .
Not all languages will have appropriate mappings for all complex types .
All complex types are expressed as tuples where the first element is the atom bert .
This allows for simple decoding logic and for the safe addition of future complex types while preventing ambiguous tuple definitions .
As such , bert should be considered a reserved word when used as the first element of a tuple .
Libraries should take steps to prevent users from inadvertently using bert in that position .
nil {bert , nil}
Erlang equates nil with the empty array [ ] while other languages do not .
Even though NIL appears as a primitive in the serialization specification , BERT only uses it to represent the empty array .
In order to be language agnostic , nil is encoded as a separate complex type to allow for disambiguation .
boolean {bert , true} or {bert , false}
Erlang equates the true and false atoms with booleans while other languages do not have this behavior .
To disambiguate these cases , booleans are expressed as their own complex type .
dictionary {bert , dict , KeysAndValues}
Dictionaries ( hash tables ) are expressed via an array of 2 - tuples representing the key / value pairs .
The KeysAndValues array is mandatory , such that an empty dict is expressed as {bert , dict , [ ] } .
Keys and values may be any term .
For example , {bert , dict , [ {name , < < " Tom " >>} , {age , 30} ] } .
time {bert , time , Megaseconds , Seconds , Microseconds}
The given time is the number of Megaseconds +
Seconds +
Microseconds elapsed since 00:00 GMT , January 1 , 1970 ( zero hour ) .
For example , 2009 - 10 - 11 at 14:12:01 and 446,228 microseconds would be expressed as {bert , time , 1255 , 295581 , 446228} .
In english , this is 1255 megaseconds ( millions of seconds ) + 295,581 seconds + 446,228 microseconds ( millionths of a second ) since zero hour .
regex {bert , regex , Source , Options}
Regular expressions are expressed by their source binary and PCRE options .
Options is a list of atoms representing the PCRE options .
For example , {bert , regex , < < " ^c ( a * ) t $ " >> , [ caseless ] } would represent a case insensitive regular epxression that would match " cat " .
See re:compile / 2 for valid options .
Encoding
The BERT encoding is identical to Erlang 's external term format except that it is restricted to the following data type identifiers : 97-100 , 104-111 .
The encoding is a simple length - prefixed serialization .
As a quick example , the following term :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
would be encoded as :
<< 131,107,0,3,1,2,3 >>
where << 131 >> is the " magic number " specifying the protocol version , << 107 > > is the type identifier for a bytelist , < < 0,3 >> is the length of the list , and << 1,2,3 >> is the bytelist contents .
BERP
Binary ERlang Packets , or BERPs , are used for transmitting BERTs over the wire .
A BERP is simply a BERT prepended with a four byte length header , where the highest order bit is first in network order .
For example , a 20 byte BERT , when represented as a BERP would have the binary header :
00000000 00000000 00000000 00010100
The header would be followed by 20 bytes of BERT data , making the BERP 24 bytes overall .
Reading streams of BERPs involves reading the four byte header , reading that many bytes ( the BERT itself ) , and then starting over again .
The maximum BERT size that may be transferred as a BERP is 232 bytes = 4 GiB .
This document uses a special notation to denote BERPs and their source in a client / server relationship .
A BERP that is sent from a client to a server starts with -> and is followed by the BERT in Erlang syntax form :
-> {request , foo}
A BERP that is sent from a server to a client starts with <- and is followed by the BERT in Erlang syntax form :
<- {response , bar}
The easy way to remember this is to pretend that your screen is the server and that the space outside your screen to the left is the internet .
Client requests come from the internet ( outside and to the left of your screen ) and travel in towards your screen : -> .
Server responses come from the server ( your screen ) and travel out towards the internet : <- .
When discussing BERP forms , variable data may be denoted by using capitalized words ( Erlang variable syntax ) .
For example :
-- {call , Mod , Fun , Args}
In the above , the form starts with the call atom , and is followed by arbitrary terms in the Mod , Fun , and Args position .
The nature of these terms will be specified in the associated descriptions .
BERT-RPC
BERT - RPC is a transport - layer agnostic protocol for performing remote procedure calls using BERPs as the serialization mechanism .
BERT - RPC supports caching directives , asynchronous operations , and both call and response streaming .
For the following examples , consider a photo hosting service called Photox .
This use case should require enough richness to show off all the features of BERT - RPC .
Synchronous Request
Let 's start with the simplest transaction : synchronous request and response .
Synchronous requests take the form :
-- {call , Module , Function , Arguments}
Where Module and Function are atoms , and Arguments is a list of zero or more terms .
So , to get the image size for image 99 , we use the request :
-> {call , photox , img_size , [ 99 ] }
If successful , the response takes for the form :
-- {reply , Result}
where Result is an arbitrary term .
For example :
<- {reply , {xy , 600 , 800}}
If there is a problem with the request , an error response is returned that takes the form :
-- {error , { Type , Code , Class , Detail , Backtrace}}
where Type is an atom , Code is an integer , Class and Detail are a binaries , and Backtrace is a List of Binaries .
For example , if the function is not found on the module :
<- {error , {server , 2 , <<" BERTError " >> , <<" function ' img_size ' not found on module ' photox ' " >> , [ <<" file:line : context " >>
]}}
Valid error types are protocol , server , user , and proxy .
Codes 0-99 are reserved as predefined error messages .
Codes 100 + are for custom use .
Protocol Error Codes
0 = Undesignated 1 = Unable to read header 2 = Unable to read data
Server Error Codes
0 = Undesignated 1 = No such module 2 = No such function
Asynchronous Request
Some operations are best served by making asynchronous requests that do not require any response value .
For that , you can use cast .
It takes the form :
-- {cast , Module , Function , Arguments}
It operates the same way as call except that if it is successfully received by the server , it immediately returns :
-- {noreply}
and then proceeds to execute the RPC asynchronously .
If there is a protocol or server level error , the response will be a standard error tuple .
Since user level errors will happen after the response is sent back to the client , they are ignored .
Informational BERPs
The advanced protocol features of BERT - RPC rely on info packets that carry metadata about the transactions .
These packets are only ever sent as modifiers of the immediately following BERP .
They take the form :
-- {info , Command , Options}
Where command is an atom and Options is an array of tuples that differ depending on the Command directive .
Info packets may be sent by either the client or server and do not warrant a response of their own .
If there is a problem with the info packet , an error response will be issued after the following normal request BERP is sent .
Asynchronous Request with Callback
To get a return value from an asynchronous request , you can specify a callback service , module , and function that will be cast to upon completion of the asynchronous request .
The info packet takes the form :
-- {info , callback , [ {service , Service} , {mfa , Mod , Fun , Args} ] }
Where service is the binary of the service - specific callback address , Mod and Fun are the obvious , and Args is an array of arguments that will be prepended to the arguments that are eventually sent to the callback .
For example , on a TCP transport layer :
-> {info , callback , [ {service , <<" cron.photox.biz:4815 " >>} , {mfa , cron , updated_stats , [ 42 ] } ] } -> {cast , photox , update_stats , [ 42 ] }
which immediately returns :
<- {noreply}
and when the request is completed , makes a BERT - RPC cast to cron:updated_stats at cron.photox.biz:4815 .
If the the photox : update_stats call would have normally returned 86193 , then the BERT - RPC cast will be :
<- {cast , cron , updated_stats , [ 42 , 86193 ] }
Note that the 42 specified in the callback info packet has been prepended to the arguments .
The response or error from the callback cast is ignored by the server .
Caching Directives
BERT -RPC defines a rich set of caching directives .
In all cases , the key upon which cache storage is based is always of the form :
-- { Mod , Fun , Args}
We call this the " MFA Term " or " MFAT " .
Expiration Caching
If the server decides that a response can be cached for a specific amount of time ( or forever ) , then an info packet of the following form may be sent :
-- {info , cache , [ {access , Access} , { expiration , Time} ] }
Access is one of public or private .
Public access means that a cache at any level may cache the response .
Private access means that only a local cache on the client may cache the response .
Time is an integer number of seconds .
If Time is 0 , then the cache is valid forever .
For example , given a request :
-> {call , photox , image_size , [ 99 ] }
The response with caching directive may be :
<- {info , cache , [ {access , public} , {expiration , 60} ] } <- {reply , {xy , 600 , 800}}
Validation Caching
For any request , the server may respond with an info packet containing a validation token :
-- {info , cache , [ {access , Access} , {validation , Token} ] }
Access is the same as in expiration caching .
Token is an arbitrary binary token that is intended to be quickly generated from server side data that indicates the freshness of the data .
For example , given a request :
-> {call , photox , comments , [ 99 ] }
The response with caching directive may be :
<- {info , cache , [ {access , public} , {validation , <<" a61bbf569169 fc2f8 fce " >> } ] } <- {reply , [ {bert , dict , {author , < < " mojombo " >>} , {body , < < " Nice photo ! " >>
}} ]}
Subsequent requests for the same MFAT may send an info packet with the token that was previously sent with the response :
-> {info , cache , [ {validation , <<" a61bbf569169 fc2f8 fce " >>} ] } -> {call , photox , comment_count , [ 99 ] }
Upon receiving this request , the server recalculates the token and compares it to the token that was sent in the info packet .
If the token is different ( meaning that the server side source data has changed ) then a full response is produced and sent back ( along with , presumably , an updated cache directive containing the new token ) .
If the token is the same , the server will respond with an info packet specifying that the cached data is still valid , and a noreply :
<- {info , valid , [ ] } <- {noreply}
The cached result will then be used as the actual response to the original request .
Streaming Binary Request
Since Photox is an image hosting site , some of the service calls will need to send large amounts of binary data .
BERT - RPC makes it possible to stream arbitrarily large binary requests via a chunked transfer encoding that follows the normal BERT - RPC request .
For example :
-> {info , stream , [ ] } -> {call , photox , send_image_data , [ 99 ] } < n - header > < n - bytes > ... < 0 - header >
The info BERP declares that the request will be a binary stream .
The second BERP contains the normal request .
Immediately following that will be a four byte length header , then that many bytes of binary data .
This header and data pair can occur any number of times .
Once a zero length header ( four null bytes ) is encountered , the stream is finished and the server will issue a response :
<- {reply , 238452}
In this example , it just returns the number of bytes that were transferred in the binary stream .
Streaming Binary Response
Streaming responses follow a similar pattern to streaming requests .
The difference is that the info BERP and stream happen in the response phase .
For example :
-> {call , photox , get_image_data , [ 99 ] }
would return :
<- {info , stream , [ ] } <- {reply , [ ] } < n - header > < n - bytes > ... < 0 - header >
The info BERP declares that the response will be a binary stream .
The second BERP contains the normal reply .
Immediately following that will be a four byte length header , then that many bytes of binary data .
This header and data pair can occur any number of times .
Once a zero length header ( four null bytes ) is encountered , the stream is finished and the connection may be closed .

It 's been a decade since Turkey threatened to invade Syria because Damascus was harboring Abdullah Ocalan , the leader of the Kurdish PKK terrorist group .
" We will say ' shalom ' to the Israelis on the Golan Heights " is how one Turkish newspaper then described the country 's mood , capturing its attitude toward Syrians and Israelis alike .

Earlier this month , Turkey cancelled an annual multinational air force exercise because Israel was scheduled to participate in it , despite historically close ...
I created new funny brush call grid brush .
It was inspired by this flash game and I added idea that needed to be implemented long time ago – sample colors from under your brush .
Paul Haeberli talks about it in Paint By Numbers article .
What can you do with it ?
1 . Make art from your photos .
Easy .
Just check in color dialog that you want to sample input color .
Select some various divisions in brush option and ride with your cursor on image .
2. Somehow create the mentioned game pictures .
Just play with grid size , color options and division level in options .
3. Pixel - art .
Various options allows you to generate funny things .
I hope some Krita users will make something more representative in the gallery .
Grid brush has also some tablet support , e.g. for mixing the background color with input or foreground color and the division level can be changed by pressure .
This brush is still work - in - progress , but you can already play with it as the trunk for KOffice is open again .
Except this in Krita 2.2 😉 I have fun with gridbrush .
I hope you will have too

The vaccine works similar to vaccines for microorganisms , training your body to view cocaine as a bad invader .
The shots , which include a cocainelike substance ( succinylnorcocaine ) , encourage the body to pump out antibodies against cocaine .
The antibodies bind to the coke , which prevents it from getting into the brain , and theoretically prevents people from getting high .
Right now , only about 38 percent of the subjects who got the vaccine produced high levels of antibodies , so there 's room for improvement .
I ’ve just uploaded to Hackage a small library , boxes , for 2D text layout / pretty - printing .
This is something I ’ve wanted a couple times and have heard others ask for — Text .
PrettyPrint .
HughesPJ , as nice as it is , is intended for pretty - printing only linear output ( such as source code ) , and is ill - suited for layout of a two - dimensional nature , such as columns of text , proof trees , and the like .
I wrote this library almost a year ago and have been sitting on it ever since , and finally decided that I really ought to just release what I have so others can make use of it .
It ’s quite usable as it is , and has ( I hope ) solid documentation .
There ’s nothing in the way of examples or tutorials or QuickCheck properties , and there are many more features one could imagine adding to it , but it ’s simply not a priority for me right now , so it is what it is .
However , if anyone is interested in taking over as maintainer and extending it , be my guest !
Just fork off a new darcs repo and hack away .

The Obama Adminstration has fired a top US diplomat at the UN for the heinous crime of insisting that the manifest and widespread fraud in the recent Afghan elections be vigorously investigated .
Peter Galbraith -- the deputy UN special envoy for electoral matters -- was technically fired by the United Nations , specifically by UN Secretary General Bai ki-Moon .
But as the Guardian points out , " the recall of Galbraith would have required the agreement of the Obama administration . "
Galbraith clashed with UN and US officials over his insistence that the fraudulent election of putative Afghan President Hamid Karzai be subjected to " a full and robust investigation , " the Guardian notes .
Galbraith had been particularly critical of a decision by the so - called Afghan Independent Election Commission to reverse an earlier decision to throw out multitudes of obviously fraudulent votes .
The reversal came after heavy political pressure from Afghanistan 's true masters in Washington .
As the paper notes , the sacking of Galbraith comes hard on the heels of reports that Obama and NATO have decided to keep Karzai in office -- even if the vote probe showed that he won less than 50 percent of the vote , which legally would require a run-off with his opponent , Abdullah Abdullah .
In other words , the White House has decided to bite the bullet and keep the corrupt and ineffectual oil man that George W. Bush installed in office over the conquered land -- no matter what the Afghan voters might want .
And Galbraith 's continued insistence on actually investigating the vote fraud -- which mirrors almost exactly the manipulations in Iran over which Obama and his war partners shed so many salt tears scant weeks ago -- is now highly inconvenient .
And so he is out .
But deep in the Guardian story comes the real money shot :
The exit of Galbraith would appear to further reduce Obama 's scope for manoeuvre in Afghanistan at a time when he is facing calls from his military commander , General Stanley McChrystal , for up to 40,000 more soldiers .
THE global financial crisis is prompting huge government interventions to stimulate the economies of the United States and many other nations .
The burning question is this : Can public - sector initiatives in the private sector be successful , or are they inevitably doomed to failure ?
Josh Lerner tries to answer that question , as it pertains to early - stage businesses , in “ Boulevard of Broken Dreams : Why Public Efforts to Boost Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Have Failed  and What to Do About It ” ( Princeton University Press , $ 27.95 ) .
“ To be sure , government has a role in stimulating a vibrant entrepreneurial sector , ” Mr. Lerner declares .
“ But at the same time , it is easy for the government to overstep its bounds and squander its investments .
Only by designing a program that reflects an understanding of , and willingness to learn from , the entrepreneurial process can governments be effective . ”
Mr. Lerner brings impressive academic credentials and practical experience to his examination of public - private issues .
He is the Jacob H. Schiff professor of investment banking at Harvard Business School and has done consulting work for governments around the globe .
When the God of War Collection was first hinted at back in April and officially announced just a few months ago , the PlayStation 2 classic collection quickly rose to the top of the charts for pre-orders .
However , fans of the series were disappointed to hear about a rumored delay to the PS3 rendition .
Fortunately , this is not the case .
The rumor originated from the Gamestop listing for the God of War Collection for March 6 , 2010 .
However , Professor PlayStation ( a.k.a. Jeff Rubenstein ) confirmed to PS3 Center .net that Kratos will be making it before Christmas and that “ the release date remains Fall 2009 ” .
According to listings from Amazon and GameCrazy , the release date still stands at November 10 , 2009 .
But in the event of a delay or similar tragedy , PlayStation LifeStyle will keep you updated .

Gun Safety Legislation
Gun Safety Legislation is anti gun speak for Gun Control .
Manasquan , NJ –-( AmmoLand.com ) - Gun Safety Legislation what is it ?
Does it really make us safer ?
Maybe Gun Safety Legislation is some new bunch of gun bills , state or federal , that we never heard of that will forever put to rest the debate about the second amendment ?
WRONG !!
Gun Safety Legislation is a sneaky new tactic by the gun banning politicians and Brady loving gun banners to take the buzz word “ Gun Control ” and replace it with the seemingly wholesome word play “ Gun Safety Legislation ”
Gun Safety Legislation is often seen paired up with other gun control politician 's safe words like , “ illegal guns “ , “ curbing gun violence “ , “ sensible measures ” or even “ common sense “ .
Who would not be in favor of Common Sense Gun Safety Legislation .
We gun owners must be irresponsible assholes or worse yet , gun toting psychopaths , if we can not be for Gun Safety Legislation .
Instead gun owners are smarter than that and are willing to take on those who think that they can fool the pro gun majority of the US population , that know that they have the right to keep and bear arms , by changing a few words .
Cemetery 's Gun Blob said , “ I ’ve noticed the term * gun control * being morphed into * gun safety legislation * on NJ Governor Jon Corzine ’s website , referring to his press release regarding NJ ’s One Gun a Month bill that is the beginning of his latest gun control * gun safety * package .
* CORZINE AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS CALL FOR ADDITIONAL GUN SAFETY LAWS .*
Is it just me ?
Has this type of flim - flam switch - a - roo been going on for sometime ?
Apparently it has .
Congresswomen Carolyn McCarthy ( D – NY ) can't get enough of the word .
Her page on “ Gun Safety Accomplishments – 111th Congress ” uses the words Gun Safety Legislation over and over again in all kinds of variations .
It should be noted that Mrs McCarthy is a constitutional hating gun banner from NY , the home state of MAIG , and in no uncertain words states that she is in support of all the following Gun Safety Legislation .
Gun Safety Legislation :
Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act
Gun Store Employee Background Checks
The NICS Improvement Amendments Act
Closing the Gun Show Loophole
HR 2401 , the “ No Fly , No Buy ” Act
The Foreign Felon Gun Prohibition Act .
Legislation permitting access to certain information in the Firearms Trace System database .
We have seen this tactic before .
Take the case of Safebackyards.com another attempt by anti hunting group , NJARA , to take a pending NJ bill , Assembly Bill A 595 , that would reduced the current bow safety buffer zone surrounding homes and other occupied dwellings to a safe 150 feet , and spin it into an issue of death , destruction and human safety to rally support for their cause from unsuspecting NJ home owners .
Again , were talking about safe backyards how could they be wrong ?
Well they are !
So this is a heads up to the stupid word smiths that think they can fool smart law abiding gun owners with a few nice words to disguise the true intent of all their speak which is banning all guns , gun rights and all rights to self defense .
Gun Safety Legislation = Gun Control .
Pass it on lets own this phrase before they do .
Facebook just introduced a two - class stock option today , which will inevitably lead to the company going public .
Facebook ’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the two - class structure of the stock option will be to help the current shareholders maintain control over the decisions made within the company .
All current shareholders will be moved to class B status , meaning that their votes are worth 10 points in voting matters , while class A will be given one point respectively .
What does this mean ?
It seems that whoever buys shares from Facebook will be doing nothing more than getting a chunk of the money , as there is no way Zuckerberg is going to give up any of the control to outside investors .
If the outside investors have ways of eliminating all the applications from Facebook , I ’d be all for them taking control of the company .

The Fleshlight Motion is like an ottoman with a fake vagina on the side .
You have sex with it .
I did the deed with an inanimate object so you do n't have to , and these are my results .
I feel dirty .
I 'm actually reviewing two different products from Fleshlight : the Fleshlight Motion ( $ 90 - $ 150 ) and the Sex in a Can ( $ 40 ) .
But they 're both just different versions of the same rubber vagina .
The Sex in a Can puts that fake vagina in a big fake beer can , while the aforementioned Fleshlight Motion gives you a leather - encased box to hold on to while you do your thing .
Advertisement
In theory , there 's nothing wrong with using an object to help out your solo stimulation .
After all , ladies have all sorts of fun toys that they use , and it 's pretty acceptable .
But the male sex toy has never really caught on .
Now that I 've used one , I can see why .
What You 're Getting Yourself Into , Literally
When it gets down to it , these things just do n't feel right .
They 're made of a rubbery material that feels absolutely nothing like anything resembling a human body part .
They try to make up for that by instructing you to soak them in warm water first and then using a shitload of lube , but really , you 're still fucking a piece of rubber , and there 's nothing you can do to trick your body into thinking otherwise .
Advertisement
And do you seriously want to go through the process of soaking a fake vagina in water , lubing it up and then going to town on it ?
And have you thought about what happens when you 're done ?
This is no kleenex cleanup , my friends .
You need to go to a sink and rinse out your rubber vagina and its plastic case .
Imagine doing that , and imagine how you 'd feel about yourself at that moment .
Got that picture in mind ?
It 's worse than that .
Trust me .
Surviving the Shame
If you were really interested in these things , however , I can see how the Sex in a Can could be justified .
It 's pretty discreet , and it's one of those things that could easily be hidden in the back of a sock drawer .
And far be it from me to tell you what feels good and what does n't .
But the Fleshlight Motion , well , that 's just too much .
Advertisement
Seriously , where are you supposed to put this thing ?
The best you could do to hide it would be to put it in a closet , and even then it would take up a ton of room .
A gigantic leather sex toy is the ultimate dealbreaker if a potential mate comes over .
I mean , how can you really justify a huge box with a vagina ?
At least if you have a creepy sex room with all sorts of wedges and swings it shows that you 're into having sex with another person .
This just shows an extreme dedication to a party where only you and your penis are invited .
And if you 're able to stay aroused when you look down and see this thing beneath you , you 're a better man than I .
Seriously , there 's nothing that kills a boner faster than the self - awareness that comes from being balls deep in a piece of furniture .

At the end of the day , these Fleshlights just made me appreciate the classic standby of jerking off with your hand .
I mean , it 's so perfect .
It fits well , you can adjust the tightness , it 's always at human - body temperature , it 's free and there 's no need to hide it .
You just can't improve on that .

Really gross to clean up
The day before its release , videogame analyst and professional blacksmith Michael Pachter accused 2 K Games and Gearbox Software of sending Borderlands " out to die . "
He claimed that releasing it in 2009 was wrong , and that Modern Warfare 2 and Dragon Age : Origins , despite not releasing until next month , were going to " kick its butt . "
Looks like Pachter may have been wrong on this one .
Gearbox 's Randy Pitchford could n't be happier with Borderlands ' launch , which apparently is doing very healthily indeed .
According the studio boss , Borderlands is already becoming hard to find , and he 's urged gamers to pick one up quickly if they want to play it .
" Getting reports from everywhere that Borderlands is selling out , " tweeted the Gearbox chief .
" If you want a copy , grab one fast .
Supply and demand . "
Okay , sure , so Pitchford is probably hyping his game and trying to instigate panic buys , but it sounds like he 's proud of the launch in any case , which is obviously a good thing .
I still do n't get how the success of Dragon Age and Modern Warfare 2 was ever meant to take away from any potential success of Borderlands .
Sure , they 'll sell better , but that does n't mean Borderlands has to sell badly .
It 's not like there are only a finite number of sales to go around and they can only be taken by a select few games .
In any case , it seems like Borderlands is not dying at all , and with a good few weeks before the truly massive games arrive , I 'd say it 's got time to do quite well .
American taxpayers paid a lot of cash for those clunkers : $ 24,000 for each new car sold , according to a study released Wednesday .
That 's a lot of money , especially when the so - called " cash for clunker " stimulus program offered only a maximum $ 4,500 in cash for each person who traded in an old gas - guzzler and bought a new car .
The government could have done almost as well by just giving away cars for free , instead of creating an elaborate incentive program , according to an analysis by the automotive information firm Edmunds.com in Santa Monica , Calif .
What happened ?
Well , it 's in how Edmunds crunched the numbers .
A valid way to evaluate the program economically , it says , is to look at how many people purchased cars that otherwise would n't have been bought .
The firm says that number is about 125,000 cars .
By that measure , the government spent $ 24,000 to generate each sale of a new car .
For comparison , the average price for a new vehicle in August 2009 was $ 26,915 , minus an average cash rebate of $ 1,667 .
In all , the government spent $ 3 billion on a program that provided cash toward 690,000 car purchases – about $ 4,348 per car .
That makes 565,000 people who got as much as $ 4,500 to buy a car they would have bought anyway , according to the Edmunds analysis .
A ' weak ' impact
The analysis may dampen views about the effectiveness of a one of the most visible pieces of President Obama 's $ 787 economic stimulus package , designed to save jobs across the US .
Hordes of Americans scurried this summer to do paperwork to trade in certifiable clunkers – old cars that got fewer than 18 miles per gallon – and try to trade them in .
" The economic claims have been rendered quite weak , " David Tompkins , one of the researchers , said in Edmunds ' AutoObserver.com , an online publication .
Still , the clunker program did help stimulate some car sales at a very weak moment for automakers .
The program also may have some environmental benefits .
" Our research indicates that without the Cash for Clunkers program , many customers would not have traded in an old vehicle when making a new purchase , ” Mr. Tompkins said .
The law required those old vehicles to go to the junk yard , so they are no longer on the road .
The analysis hinges on how to calculate the number of people who were ready to buy a car even without the subsidy .
Edmunds ' used a team of statisticians , who examined sales trends for luxury vehicles and others not included in the clunker program .
They used those trends to gauge where sales would have been for the industry , absent any stimulus program .
These " informed estimates " were independently verified , Edmunds says , by examining transaction data .
Let 's do it again ?
The study comes as Congress is considering whether to extend a similar stimulus program in the housing market – an $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time home buyers .
The move appears to have gained traction this week , thanks to efforts by Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) of Nevada , one of the states hardest hit by the housing downturn .
The housing tax credit is designed to spur buying activity , and thus help stabilize the housing market .
Congress is considering a measure that would not only extend the program into next year , but also expand it to include purchasers who already own homes .
Economists are divided over the merits of this and other stimulus programs .
Critics of government stimulus programs say they often simply move money from one pocket to another , or perhaps shift the timing of consumer spending , without having a large impact on gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Backers say the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is indeed helping to boost GDP and has stopped what had been a downward spiral in the economy .
Jeremy Anwyl , chief executive of Edmunds , says the firm 's study points to one promising conclusion about the economy :
Auto sales were already rising from their recession trough even without the clunker program , though they remain well below their pre-recession levels .

Scientific American :
In sum , the authors suggest that , because love activates a long - term perspective that elicits global processing , it should also promote creativity and impede analytic thinking .
In contrast , inasmuch as sex activates a short - term perspective that elicits local processing , it should also promote analytic thinking and impede creative thinking .
I know this is tangential to this broader argument , but if fucking has made me more analytic , it seems to me to be defeating one of its core purposes .
I have had sex out of love and it's an amazing , wonderful , transformative thing .
At its height , it is the most overwhelming thing I have ever experienced .
I have also had sex in my life largely as a way to escape this fucking brain in my head , that wo n't stop constantly analyzing and thinking .
I have had sex for these reasons as well - so I can gain a few blissful moments when I do not think at all .
The relief of this is indescribable and , for me at least , an element of mental and psychological health .
I recall one marathon twelve - hour session of passion many years ago now .
It was only afterwards that I realized I had barely had a single trace of an analytic thought for the longest period I could then remember .
I was never happier .
As I finally collapsed into my lover 's arms with the final orgasm that drained every last drop of desire or need from my body and soul , I understood for the first time why the French call coming " le petit mort " .
It can be the emptying of self entirely .
Which is why sex is so close at times to the presence of the divine , and reflects and incarnates God in ways few other things can so easily .
We are more animal and more divine in sex than in any other activity .
The ordeal of consciousness is at times oppressive .
To leave that consciousness and yet stay so vividly alive is one of sex 's great wonders .
Love is deeper than that ; friendship is deeper still .
But I know nothing that God has given us - save psilocybin - that gives us this divine , if fleeting , parole from a vale of tears .

excl : ensuring - compiled - body : a new macro
Introduction
The new macro ensuring - compiled - body works like progn in that it executes its body forms sequentially , returning the result of the final form .
But it first ensures the forms are compiled .
Making sure that the forms are compiled in the correct environment is not a trivial problem .
We describe how it is done in this note .
All Common Lisp implementations are required to have compiled execution -- Common Lisp was defined as an idiomatically compiled language .
But there are reasons that interpreted execution might still be useful , even though interpreted execution can run an order of magnitude or more slower .
So many Common Lisp implementations feature both compiled and interpreted code execution in a single Lisp execution .
The ANS permits this , provided both kinds of executions implement and obey the semantics specified in the ANS .
It is well known that in a compiled - only implementation , EVAL would be implemented something like this :
( defun my - eval ( form ) ( funcall ( compile nil `( lambda ( ) nil , form ) ) ) )
( The reason for the nil in the lambda body is to guarantee a declare form will be treated as an illegal form , rather than being taken as a declaration at the start of a null body . )
Now , even in an implementation like ACL with both compiled and interpreted execution , we could define a simple macro that ensures that its code body is executed compiled .
( defmacro ensure - compilation ( &body body ) `( funcall ( compile nil ( lambda ( ) nil , @body ) ) ) ) ( define - compiler - macro ensure - compilation ( &body body ) `( progn , @body ) )
Assuming the implementation uses compiler macros , this wrapper does nothing in compiled code , but compiles the body when executed in interpreted code .
In Allegro CL the compiler is sufficiently fast , and compiled code sufficiently faster than interpreted , that in certain vary rare and obscure circumstances this can be a winning strategy .
Usually , for instance in the read - eval - print loop , one would just cause each entire top - level form to be compiled .
( In Allegro CL this can be done by setting tpl : * eval * to ' my - eval defined above . )
But interpreted code is sometimes better for debugging , or ( in very very obscure circumstance ) where it is desired to insert dynamically generated forms inside a lexical environment .
It is n't the purpose of this article to discuss these obscure circumstances .
( Some arise in conjunction with using Prolog as an embedded language . )
The problem of compiling code within an existing interpreted environment is itself an interesting study in the semantics of Common Lisp and the ( semi ) portable environment facility in Allegro , Environments support in Allegro Common Lisp .
The problem with the above ensure - compilation definition , of course , is that eval evaluates a form and compile creates a function in the null lexical environment .
We 'd like to be able to compile a code body so that it can refer to the surrounding interpreted lexical environment .
The new ensuring - compiled - body macro does just this .
How does it work ?
How can a body of interpreted code , defined in an interpreted lexical environment , be changed to compiled code defined within that same interpreted environment ?
The dynamic environment is not at issue -- it is equally available to both compiled and interpreted code .
But everything in the lexical environment that is accessible to code must be known when the code -- a tree of conses -- is closed and becomes a function .
Indeed , the work " closure " implies that the function is in some way sealed .
The lexical environment consists of five components , four of which function as separate namespaces .
These four are
variable names ( lexical variables and symbol macros ) operator names ( functions and macros ) block names go tags
The fifth contains information about any surrounding declarations that do not concern names in the four namespaces above .
An environment is represented by a first - class environment object , and the namespaces can be queried with the functions sys:variable - information , sys: function - information , sys : block - information , sys: tag - information , and sys: declaration - information .
In addition , there are functions sys : : map - over - environment - variables , sys : map - over - environment - functions , sys : : map - over - environment - blocks , and sys : map - over - environment - tags which map over all lexically visible ( unshadowed ) definitions in the particular namespace .
What remains is to decide how to wrap a code body in forms that will make available bindings in these four namespaces to the compiled code .
Each kind of surrounding lexical binding can be handled straightforwardly , although some might be slightly inefficient .
Here follows examples for each of the environment components .
None of these examples are in any way practical examples -- they have been composed simply to illustrate the rewriting .
Lexical variables
These are the simplest .
Lexical variables in interpreted execution are stored in the car of a cons which serving as a locative .
sys:variable - information returns that cons .
The compiled code body captures that cons as a constant and a symbol - macrolet transparently rewrites references to that variable inside the compiled body .
Thus , this form
( symbol - macrolet ( ( limit (+ 5 ( random 4 ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( numbers ( loop for i from 1 to 10 collect i ) ) ) ( ensuring - compiled - body ( setf numbers ( remove - if ( lambda ( x ) (> x limit ) ) numbers ) ) ) numbers ) )
which has both a symbol macro and a lexical variable in the environment would be rewritten to capture both as symbol macros :
( symbol - macrolet ( ( limit (+ 5 ( random 4 ) ) ) ) ( let ( ( numbers ( loop for i from 1 to 10 collect i ) ) ) ( funcall ( compile nil '( lambda nil ( symbol - macrolet ( ( numbers ( car '( ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ) ) ) ) ( limit (+ 5 ( random 4 ) ) ) ) ( progn ( setf numbers ( remove - if ( lambda ( x ) (> x limit ) ) numbers ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The symbol macro for limit is simply replicated around the body of the lambda expression to be compiled .
The lexical variable numbers is replaced by a symbol macro that accesses the locative for the outer variable .
The quoted cons that is the argument to car is the locative .
The car of that cons is the current value of the outer numbers variable .
Note that this symbol macro relies on the fact that car does not do compile - time constant folding in Allegro CL .
If it did , the compiled code body might capture the initial value of the outer numbers variable instead of capturing the locative for the variable .
Lexical operators ( flet , labels , and macrolets )
These can be made available by wrapping the code body in a flet or macrolet .
For example , code like the following
( flet ( (f ( x ) (+ 2 x ) ) ) ( macrolet ( ( m ( x ) ` ( 1- , x ) ) ) ( ensuring - compiled - body ( let ( (y ( m ( f pi ) ) ) ) ( print y ) ) ) ) )
would be rewritten approximately this way
( flet ( (f ( x ) (+ 2 x ) ) ) ( macrolet ( ( m ( x ) ` ( 1- , x ) ) ) ( funcall ( compile nil '( lambda nil ( flet ( (f ( &rest rest ) ( declare ( dynamic - extent rest ) ) ( apply #< Interpreted Function ( flet ( ) f ) @ # x208ab322 > rest ) ) ) ( macrolet ( ( m ( &whole whole &environment env &body body ) ( declare ( ignore body ) ) ( funcall #< Interpreted Closure m @ # x208ab8e2 > rest ) ) ) whole #< Augmentable interpreter env 1 1 > rest ) ) ) ) ) ) ( progn ( let ( (y ( m ( f pi ) ) ) ) ( print y ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
The two opaque functions captured in the rewritten code are the two surrounding flet function and macrolet expander function .
These remain interpreted functions if and when they are called inside the inner compiled code body .
Both outer flet and labels functions are accessed by inner flet functions -- that an outer labels function can call itself is a property of that outer lexical function and there is no distinction for these inner functions that simply funcall the outer functions .
Block names
block and return - from are lexical constructs , but when transfer must cross a lambda boundary even in compiled code they must be rewritten in terms of catch and throw , which are dynamic constructs .
Interpreted execution always does this transformation , so the following interpreted code
( block compute ( ensuring - compiled - body ( return - from compute (* 2 pi ) ) ) )
would be rewritten as
( catch '( compute ) ( funcall ( compile nil ( lambda nil ( block #:g18 ( throw ' ( compute ) ( block compute ( return - from #:g18 ( progn ( return - from compute (* 2 pi ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
where the two paired ' ( compute ) catch tags and the two #:g18 gensyms are eq .
Unfortunately , establishing a catch has a small runtime cost , but this cannot be avoided unless the code body to be compiled were walked to determine whether it contains a return from that block .
Doing so would be possible but would add complexity .
Tagbody tags
tagbody and go tags are also lexical constructs , similar to block names .
They need similarly to be rewritten in terms of catch and throw .
Interpreted execution already rewrites tagbody tags and go using catch and throw , so we need only [ sic ] wrap the whole lambda body in a tagbody , and add each of the visible tagbody tags into that tagbody with a throw that throws out to the proper catcher .
This form
( let ( ( ret nil ) ) ( dotimes ( i 10 ( nreverse ret ) ) ( ensuring - compiled - body ( when ( evenp i ) ( go skip ) ) ( push (* i i ) ret ) ) skip ) )
is rewritten as the following .
It is a little complex , but see the added comments .
( let ( ( ret nil ) ) ( dotimes ( i 10 ( nreverse ret ) ) ( funcall ( compile nil ( lambda nil ( symbol - macrolet ( ( ret ( car ' ( nil ) ) ) ( i ( car ' ( 0 ) ) ) ) ( block #:g689 ( tagbody ( return - from #:g689 ;
This executes if none of the go ; to outer tags are executed and ; the block completes normally .
( block #:g688 ( throw '( nil ) ;
This is just noise provided by ; the implicit block nil ; established by the dotimes , to be ; used if anything in the dotimes ; body did a return .
It is not the ; same catch tag as the one a few ; lines below .
( block nil ( return - from #:g688 ( progn ( when ( evenp i ) ( go skip ) ) ( push (* i i ) ret ) ) ) ) ) ) ) skip ( throw '( skip ) ;
The catch tag ' ( skip ) is the tag ; used internally by interpreted ; execution to implement go tags .
;
Its target is the " skip " in the ; interpreted dotimes tagbody ; below . ' nil ) ( go skip ) ;
This just silences any unused tag ; warnings from the compiler . ) ) ) ) ) ) skip ) )
Caching
Although the Allegro CL compiler is fast , compiling is only advantageous if compilation takes less time than the time gained by compiled execution .
( This would never be the case for the trivial examples above . )
In addition , compilation is invoked each time an ensuring - compiled - body form is executed .
This would be extremely expensive inside a loop , so there is a primitive caching facility for the compiled functions created the macro .
If the environment and the code body are both is the same , the previously - compiled function is reused .
An environment is the same if no binding contours have been entered or exited for any of the four lexical environment components .
Thus , the following form would call compile three times , not fifteen times .
( let ( r ) ( dotimes ( i 3 ( nreverse r ) ) ( dotimes ( j 5 ) ( ensuring - compiled - body ( push (* ( 1+ i ) ( 1+ j ) ) r ) ) ) ) )
Each time the inner dotimes is first entered , there is a new binding of j , but on each iteration there is no new binding .
Conclusion
This is a new experimental facility that is not intended to have wide applicability .
But its workings are an interesting study in Common Lisp semantics and how code - rewriting macros can do powerful ( if not entirely portable ) things .

But if we look more closely at the greatest contrivance of snails , the protective shell , we can see that it is not only coiled , but also asymmetric .
If we hold a shell with the opening facing us and the pointed tip facing up , the opening is usually on the right .
These shells are referred to as dextral or right - handed .
In rare individual snails from right - handed species , however , the shells will have the opening on the left and are referred to as sinistral , or left - handed .
Some entire species are sinistral .
Biologists have known for almost a century that a simple genetic basis is behind shell handedness , at least in some species , such that the mutation of a single gene can cause right - left reversal .
The mystery then is why , if both forms can occur and reversal is genetically easy , are most species either entirely right - or left - handed ?
An answer may be found in one of the logistical challenges that living with most of the body inside a shell imposes on snails  mating .
Here is where handedness matters a lot .
The genital opening is behind the right tentacle in right - handed snails .
When land snails mate , they face each other , which brings their genital openings side by side .
Snails with opposite handedness are misaligned , making it physically difficult for them to mate .
Any rare reversed individual snail would obviously have difficulty mating .
As Darwin knew so well , if one cannot mate , it is the end of the line .
Once of a given handedness , a species and its descendants would tend to stay that way .
But what if there were some other reversed individuals around ?
They could mate with one another and might form a new , reversed population .
If members of that population continued to fail to mate successfully with snails of opposite handedness , that population might eventually evolve into a new species .
And that seems to be exactly what has happened several times in a group of Japanese snails  and perhaps very many times in land snails in general .

The genus Euhadra is unusual in that it contains multiple left - handed species , as well as right - handed species .
By tracing species pedigrees through DNA , the biologists Rei Ueshima from the University of Tokyo and Takahiro Asami from Shinshu University found that several right - handed species of Euhadra snails appeared to have evolved from a left - handed ancestor and that closely related left - and right - handed species could not successfully mate .

America -
At the Point of No Return !
" Because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no man regarded ;
But ye have set at naught all my counel , and would none of my reproof ; I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ;
When your fear cometh as desolation , and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you .
Then shall they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they shall seek me early , but they shall not find me :
For that they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of the Lord :
They would none of my counsel : they despised all my reproof .
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way , and be filled with their own devices . "
Proverbs 1:24-31
" While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light .
These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
That the saying of E - sa ' - ias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord who hath believed our report ?
And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
Therefore they could not believe , because that E - sa'ias said again , He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them . "
John 12:36 - 40
" Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
For I say unto you ,
Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . "
Matthew 23:38-30
In this issue of the Last Trumpet Newsletter , we will consider a very sobering subject of the utmost urgency .
We have watched for years how our government , educational systems , churches , financial institutions , and nearly every other endeavor of man has increasingly entertained the agenda of Satan in its many faceted forms and guises .
The conspiratorial forces of antichrist have been working for so long now that the original purposes of these institutions are hardly recognizable , and their causes are long ago forgotten .
What will happen next ?
We know that the time line that we are moving through is measured by Bible prophecy .
There really are no surprises as we have been warned by the Bible of the dangers of sin and its consequences .
Everything foretold in prophecy is now coming to pass and right on schedule .
The question that is so often asked is where are we right now ?
It is a fact that we live in a time that is unique in all of history .
It is an electronic world connected by the internet , satellites , microchips , and spy devices .
Along with all of this is the rising of a one - world Marxist - socialist government , disguised as democracy .
It is a sad fact that the vast majority of people are in the depth of ignorance , and others are pickled in the brine of apathy .
It is sad to watch the " common herd " of humanity being driven , corralled , and branded by the beast system .
It is hard to live among a society that is so demonized that they accept homosexuality , immorality , and filth of every kind .
When people are in this condition , they are easily managed because they have no character .
Are we at the point of no return ?
There is such a point , and if we are not at it , we are most assuredly not far from it .
A book was once written by the late Ayn Rand , a mistress to the erstwhile Illuminati hierarch , Phillipe Rothschild .
The book is titled Atlas Shrugged , and it is a comprehensive plan and blueprint for world takeover in the last days .
Rand wrote of this takeover in somewhat cryptic form for her master , Rothschild , at his behest .
On page 413 she wrote the following words : " When you see that trading is done , not by consent , but by compulsion - when you see that in order to produce , you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - when you see money flowing to those who deal , not in goods , but in favors - when you see that men get richer by graft and pull than by work , and your laws do n't protect you against them , but protect them against you - when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming self - sacrifice - you may know that your society is doomed . "
Yes , there is a point of no return , and the Bible teaches us that only Divine intervention stops the evil that has been unleashed in the world .
The return of the Lord Jesus Christ is just ahead , and Judgment Day will bring all things to light .
Eternity will follow and we will all spend it somewhere .
If you have not yet surrendered your heart , soul , and mind to the Lord Jesus , you must do so now , before you reach the point of no return .
There is still time , but not much of it .
The Saviour will accept you if you answer his call !
Dark Shadows in the White House !
On October 9th , 2009 , in his ninth month in office , President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
( 1 ) In occult numerology , three 9's indicates finality .
Three 9's are also an inverted 666 .
The world was in shock that a man who has really done nothing was given such an honor and high award .
The question heard around the world that day was , " What did he do to deserve this award ? "
Why did he receive it ?
The answer is a spiritual one .
This man who is literally worshipped by many of his subjects is now known as the " man of peace . "
The Scripture tells us that a man of " peace " would rise up in the last days and destroy many .
In Daniel 8:25 we read as follows : " And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magnify himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand . "
In Jeremiah 6:14 , we also read the following : " They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying Peace , peace ; when there is no peace . "
We must also take note of I Thessalonians 5:3 as follows : " For when they shall say , Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape . "
Here let it be noted that the Almighty gave us a definite sign to watch for regarding the coming of the man of false peace .
He described the coming of this man with his destructive peace as a woman in travail and giving birth .
The human gestation period is nine months , and Obama received the " peace prize " during his ninth month in office .
It was also stated that Obama received the prize not for what he has done , but for what he is going to do .
Obama is now being referred to by the news media as the " Seed of peace . "
( 2 ) Obama has also been called by the news media , " the one who supplanted the bluster and obstinacy on the world stage . "
We know that the name Jacob means supplanter , and the final days of tribulation are known as Jacob 's trouble .
Jeremiah 30:6 - 7 ties this all together as follows : " Ask ye now , and see whether a man doth travail with child ?
Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail , and all faces are turned into paleness ?
Alas !
For that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it . "
One more point that must be made regarding this is that Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize exactly thirteen weeks after his self - proclaimed " day of rest " on July 11th , 2009 .
In a previous issue of this newsletter , I referred to this regarding Obama 's second one hundred days in office , which he said he would complete early -- by July 10th .
Of the 11th day of July , he said , " I will rest . "
This Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Obama was planned well in advance .
We also know that according to the worldwide news service , AFP , that three members of the committee of five in Norway were definitely opposed to giving the prize to Obama , but somehow , the decision emerged as unanimous . ( 3 )
What strange and shadowy force is driving Obama and his adoring subjects ?
Why are children in public schools being taught to worship him as a god ?
Burlington Township , New Jersey , is one of many places where schools are teaching Obama praise songs to the children and have drawn protestors because of it .
( 4 ) In some schools , the religious hymn " Jesus Loves the Little Children " has been changed to the following words : " Obama loves the little children ; all the children of the world .
Red and yellow , black and white , all are equal in his sight Barack Obama loves the children of the world "
If that song were sung the original way using the name Jesus , it would be a Federal crime !
These are the days of antichrist !
Why is Barack Obama finding such a favored status to the extent that the U.S. House of Representatives has laid down the following rules , according to House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter :
No member of Congress may call the President a liar or a hypocrite .
They may not refer to his veto of a bill as cowardly .
It is also illegal to refer to Obama as being intellectually dishonest , as giving aid and comfort to the enemy , or to allege sexual misconduct on the President 's part . ( 5 ) I must say that it would be difficult to be accurate regarding Obama if we were forbidden to use these words .
Obama and his team , however , are not very careful about how they speak .
In a recent article that appeared in Politico by Kenneth P. Vogel , it was reported that an unusual amount of profanity has been emanating from the White House .
( 6 ) Terrible language is being used by Obama , Biden , and even Christina Romer , the economic advisor , that has shocked the members of the press and media .
The notorious and repulsive " F " word is often heard , and reporters have wondered why there is such a profuse amount of profanity .
The answer is simple .
Wherever there is a concentration of demons and demonic activity , you will find profanity .
In Psalm 139:20 we read of this as follows : " For they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain . "
Some people are beginning to wake up , and I believe more will rise up as conditions continue to worsen .
Near Blue Springs , Missouri , there is a large billboard on Interstate 70 which says , " How do you like your change now ?
Obama Nation .
They are coming for you !
The Taxpayer , First and Second Amendments are in jeopardy .
Live free or die . "
There is also a hammer and sickle on the billboard .
( 7 ) Another example of protest is coming from a small American clothing manufacturer that markets its clothing products in France .
I am looking at the collar tag on the inside of the shirt , which contains laundering instructions and a brief message in the French language .
The English translation of the collar tags reads as follows : " Wash with warm water , use mild soap , dry flat , do not bleach , do not dry in the dryer , do not iron .
We are sorry that our President is an idiot .
We did not vote for him . " ( 8 )
There are many questions that need to be answered regarding Obama and his administration .
Why does First Lady Michelle Obama have twenty - six personal staff members and attendants ?
She is a figurehead only and has no assigned duties ; however , she has twenty - six attendants being paid a total of $ 1,256,770.00 per year .
This includes her Chief of Staff , Susan Sher , whose salary is $ 172,200.00 .
She also has a makeup artist , Ingrid Miles , and a hairstylist , Johnny Wright .
All of this was reported recently in the Canadian Free Press .
( 9 ) Apparently , the multimillionaire Obamas , who are supposed to be for the poor and downtrodden , sure know how to live high and waste money !
Federal Management of the Human Body !
At this very moment , we are at a point of no return regarding health care in the United States .
The Obama health care scheme does not have health care in mind at all .
It is a clever system of control and micro-management of every human body in America .
Here let it be noted that Mat Staver , Dean of the Liberty University School of Law , recently compiled a comprehensive list that explains what the new Obama health care system will really do to oppress the American people .
There are over one thousand pages in this health care bill so I can only print some of the provisions in this newsletter .
Consider the following : Page 22 -
All self - insured employers will have their books audited .
Page 29 - Your health care will be rationed .
Page 30 - A Government committee decides what treatment and benefits you will receive .
Page 50 - Health care will be provided to all non-U.S. citizens , illegal or otherwise .
Page 58 - A National ID Health Care Card will be issued , and the Government will have access to individual 's finances .
Page 126 - Employers must pay for health care for part - time employees and their families .
Page 427 - The Government mandates a program for orders for end of life ; the Government has a say in how your life ends .
Page 429 - " Advanced care consultation " may include an order for end of life plans , an order from the Government .
Page 429 - The Government will specify which doctors can write an end of life order .
( 10 ) There are so many other oppressive mandates that would make the United States worse than Soviet Russia and Red China ever were .
Only God can help us ; we are at the point of no return !
Another outrageous fact about the new health care bill , is that it would require everyone to buy into it or be fined up to $ 3800 .
( 11 ) Conspiracy and treason is manifesting everywhere in Washington , D.C. , and the reports of nefarious activity are constant .
On September 23rd , 2009 , Republicans tried to bring forth an amendment that would force the Senate Finance Committee to wait seventy - two hours before voting on the Health Care Reform Bill .
The three days were needed to read and review the proposal , but this request for seventy - two hours was blocked by Obama 's Democrat stooges .
( 12 ) On October 1st , 2009 , the Republicans tried to introduce restrictions on abortion in Obama 's Health Care Bill , which allows for full payment for abortions with no restrictions .
The Republican effort was quickly defeated , and in response to this effort , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put the Senate on notice that they " must move quickly to pass this bill . "
( 13 ) On September 30th , 2009 , Republican Senator Chuck Grassley stated the following : " The current law and the Health Care Bill under consideration are too lax and leave the door open to illegal immigrants defrauding the government using false or stolen identities to obtain benefits . "
The effort to block illegal immigrants from health care was also defeated , and the new law eliminates any requirement for ID if you are illegally residing in the United States . ( 14 )
These are strange times when everything seems backwards and upside down .
I must also mention at this point that the homosexual and other immoral lifestyles in America have done more to drive up the cost of health care than anything else .
Immorality , pornography , homosexuality , lesbianism , and so much other unmentionable filth has infected the United States of America to epidemic proportions .
In early October , nearly 200,000 sodomites marched on Washington , D.C. , demanding equal rights and recognition .
What a sad day in our history when these militant perverts , of the very type that God rained fire upon , would gather in such large numbers at the nation 's Capital .
The sodomite leaders clearly stated that they were no longer willing to wait for acceptance . ( 15 )
Immorality and the sexual revolution are a conspiracy in and of themselves .
The internet , Hollywood , television , and other media are all flaunting immoral activity as a primary project .
Satan and his antichrist forces have been working for a long time to bring forth a one - world government .
To accomplish this , he must bring all humanity under his infernal control .
It is not enough to have a one - world money system , a one - world church , and a one - world government .
Satan would also need to weld all of humanity together spiritually until they are one flesh .
This is accomplished through forbidden sexual unions .
In I Corinthians 6:16 we read the following shocking words : " What ?
Know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ?
For two , saith he , shall be one flesh . "
Thus , Satan knows that when a person fornicates with another , they become one flesh .
But they also become one flesh with every other person their partner was with .
If a man has been with a harlot and she had been with ten other men and those men had been with ten other harlots and so on , it is possible that nearly all humanity could be networked and combined as one flesh .
Here let it be noted that a recent study conducted by Lloyd 's Pharmacy chain in Britain revealed some amazing results .
The pharmacy used an online calculator to determine the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and found that the average British man has had nine sexual partners and the average British woman has had six .
Computers were used to calculate all of the interactions submitted by volunteer participants and found that the average person had 2.8 million sex partners by extension .
( 16 ) This is not a misprint !
The story was featured by the international news service AFP on September 23rd , 2009 .
Satan has found many willing participants to make his system work .
If you are a true Christian , your past is removed , and you are washed by the saving grace of Jesus Christ .
In conjunction with the new Obama Health Care Plan , as if timed perfectly , is the H1N1 flu virus , sometimes called swine flu .
I have covered this subject before , and there is more than enough evidence that this flu virus was intentionally manufactured in laboratories for the purpose of population control through fear .
The flu vaccine is now out in both nasal mist live virus form or by injection .
The Government claims that the vaccine is perfectly safe , but many people are not accepting that .
In the state of New York , where it is mandatory for health workers to receive the immunization , there has been a massive revolt by the health workers .
They are flatly refusing to accept the vaccine !
Mass rallies and protests by the health care workers broke out in Albany .
( 17 )
Do they know something a lot of people do n't know ?
On September 25th , 2009 , the Los Angeles Times reported that a recent study revealed that most parents in the United States are refusing to have their children immunized for H1N1 because they are concerned about the risks .
Only forty percent said they would allow their children to be vaccinated .
( 18 )
Here let it be noted that an increasing number of people are becoming aware of the dangerous substances , such as mercury and rancid protein , that are found in vaccines .
In two recent studies by the Government , it was found that autism among children has increased from 1 in 160 to 1 in every 100 children .
( 19 )
There is strong evidence that the many vaccines being given to children are causing this !
On September 21st , 2009 , a press release revealed that the Verichip Corporation and its affiliates have been awarded two new patents .
Patent numbers 7,504,364 and 7,469,076 are for a microchip system that can detect viruses by type in the human body , including the H1N1 virus .
( 20 ) The question that should be asked is how can a chip be programmed to detect viruses by name and type unless the plan for the virus already exists ?
In the future , people may well be getting calls from their health providers telling them that the detection and ID chip that was implanted in them has detected a virus , and they should report for treatment .
It is later than you think !
Mismanagement and the Root of all Evil !
The Scripture tells us in I Timothy 6:10 , " For the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows . "
At a glance , we can see that the economy of the United States is a complete wreck , and the rise in stock market averages does nothing for the countless unemployed people .
Everything is global and international now .
The national debt continues to rise to astronomical levels , and the U.S. Senate is now being forced to raise the national debt ceiling above twelve trillion dollars ( $ 12,000,000,000,000 ) .
( 21 )
We know that light travels at approximately 186,000 miles per second , and at that fantastic rate of speed , light would travel a linear distance of six trillion miles , the measure of a light year .
Our national debt is twice that number in dollars .
Our economy has reached a point of no return , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Shalom Bernanke knows this is true .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , which is already strapped because of the many bank failures , is reporting that additional bank failures could cost 100 billion dollars .
( 22 ) Remember , these dollars do not evaporate ; someone gets them , and it is always those at the top of corporate conspiracy that come out ahead .
The middle class is rapidly disappearing in America , and Obama is getting ready to finish it off .
The current situation was caused by bank failures and crashes over the housing market .
Next will come a major crash regarding commercial properties and businesses ; then will come the big crash of banks over unpaid credit card debt .
There are three great fiscal woes , and two are yet to come .
On October 3rd , 2009 , Federal regulators closed down several more banks in Michigan , Colorado , and Minnesota ; bringing the number so far this year to ninety - eight .
( 23 )
The signs of financial ruin are everywhere , and the people who are walking the desolate streets of America are near to the point of open revolt .
When the G - 20 Summit convened in Pittsburgh in late September 2009 , they found massive numbers of angry people and mobs of revolutionaries worked up into a fever pitch .
They were trying to make their voice known to the convention of crooks that are running the governments of twenty nations , including the United States . ( 24 ) Then , something happened that had never happened before on American soil .
American forces used aggressive acoustic weapons on American people .
These weapons had previously been used only in Iraq and other foreign war zones .
These weapons delivered an ear - piercing sound exceeding 150 decibels , which is louder than a jet engine .
It is accompanied by stern voice commands that penetrate the mind .
( 25 ) Very soon , what I have been saying for years will be proven true ; that is , the greatest enemy of any people is its own government !
History has verified this repeatedly !
On October 8th , 2009 , the Associated Press featured a story about police officers randomly stopping and frisking people on the streets of our American cities .
They call the program " stop and frisk " and have stopped more than one million people in various cities for absolutely no reason !
( 26 ) It could happen to you anytime the police get a notion to frisk you !
On October 6th , 2009 , various OPEC nations announced that they were going to ditch the U.S. dollar .
Immediately , the price of gold jumped to $ 1,038.65 per ounce , which was a record high .
( 27 ) On October 12th , 2009 , Bloomberg News Service published a story stating that the U.S. dollar had reached a breaking point because central banks were snubbing the dollar and replacing it with euros and yen .
( 28 ) What is happening in the erstwhile great nation of America ?
Why has so much wealth flowed from America and into Red China ?
Economically , the Red Chinese have already taken over our country .
Is it any wonder that the Red Chinese flag was raised over Washington , D.C. , in September 2009 ?
This was done in our nation 's Capital to commemorate the anniversary of the communist takeover of China by Chairman Mao sixty years ago .
What gives Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the right to offer the Red Chinese your property and mine as collateral against the debt owed by America to China ?
Here let it also be noted that on September 30th , 2009 , the massive Empire State Building in New York City was lighted for three nights in the colors of red and yellow in honor of the communist Chinese revolution !
( 29 ) Do these Chinese Reds deserve any honor at all ?
In an article printed over a year ago in the St Petersburg Times , the nation of Red China is facing an unusual dilemma .
For many years they murdered so many baby girls in favor of a stronger male population that now the ratio is 30 men for every one woman .
The article goes on to say that the Red Chinese male work force is full of lustful men because of the shortage .
( 30 ) Now their eyes are on America !
Will the U.S. dollar collapse ?
On October 6th , 2009 , the United Nations called for a new reserve currency to replace the dollar .
( 31 ) The Obama Administration has printed so much more money that the existing supply is worth continually less .
It is a weak , thinned out , and watered down economy .
Furthermore , existing goods and services will quickly absorb the excess money supply and inflation will rise to record levels .
It is quite obvious that all of this is being done intentionally to bring forth new one - world electronic money .
This will be the Beast system as mentioned in Revelation , chapter 13 .
According to the London Daily Telegraph on October 2nd , 2009 , the World Bank will run out of money within twelve months .
( 32 ) We are that close to the end .
The signs of the times are everywhere .
Many people have noticed that stores of every kind have been greatly cutting back on inventory because they just do n't have the money to buy much .
A prime example of the severity of the problem is the large fleet of empty cargo ships anchored just east of Singapore .
It is called the Ghost Fleet , as reported with a full series of photgraphs by the London Daily Mail on September 28th , 2009 .
" It is the biggest and most secretive gathering of ships in maritime history .
It is larger than the British and U.S. navies combined but have no crew , no cargo , and no destination . " ( 33 ) I have no doubt that our U.S. money is cursed in many ways .
It is interesting to note that a recent test conducted by a group of scientists involving U.S. currency from thirty American cities found that ninety percent of all bills contain traces of cocaine . ( 34 )
Final Signs and Warnings !
At the very end of September through the beginning of October , just after the G - 20 Economic Summit , disasters began to happen all over the world .
In Sydney , Australia , a severe dust storm filled the sky and blanketed the city with an ominous red dust , described as deadly red by the London Daily Mail . ( 35 ) In California , massive wildfires broke out and turned the sky bright orange and red .
The San Gabriel Mountains were on fire , charring 3,500 acres . ( 36 ) Then the earthquakes began to shake the earth .
According to the U.S. Geological Survey , there have been 454 significant earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above within the past 30 days as of October 14th , 2009 .
Many of these were strong quakes . ( 37 ) I have been watching the earthquake maps and statistics for twenty - eight years , and I have never seen this many before in such a short time .
On October 1st , 2009 , Indonesia was hit with a magnitude 7.6 quake , which caused widespread devastation and left thousands of people dead or missing .
( 38 ) At that same time , two more powerful quakes of magnitudes 7.6 and 6.6 struck near Samoa , sending a tsunami across the region , which left widespread destruction and thousands dead or missing .
( 39 ) The very creation is crying out against sinful man .
In early October , a strange , unique , and unexplainable halo appeared over Moscow , Russia .
It glimmered with bright light and was captured on video .
Nothing like it had ever been seen before .
It was massive and appeared to be some sort of doorway or portal filled with brilliant brightness .
( 40 ) We must remember that the Lord Jesus told us to watch for the many signs that would appear just before His return to bring Judgment Day upon this wicked world .
We must all watch and pray , for the time is at hand !
In closing , I want to thank all of you who pray for and support this end time prophetic ministry .
We are always delighted to pray for you , and your requests always receive individual attention by our intercessors .
Grace and peace be unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - A team of scientists studying rock samples in Africa has shown a strong link between falling carbon dioxide levels and the formation of Antarctic ice sheets 34 million years ago .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The results are the first to make the link , underpinning computer climate models that predict both the creation of ice sheets when CO2 levels fall and the melting of ice caps when CO2 levels rise .
The team , from Cardiff , Bristol and Texas A&M Universities , spent weeks in the African bush in Tanzania with an armed guard to protect them from lions to extract samples of tiny fossils that could reveal CO2 levels in the atmosphere 34 million years ago .
Levels of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , mysteriously fell during this time in an event called the Eocene - Oligocene climate transition .
“ This was the biggest climate switch since the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , ” said co-author Bridget Wade from Texas A&M University .
The study reconstructed CO2 levels around this period , showing a dip around the time ice sheets in Antarctica started to form .
CO2 levels were around 750 parts per million , about double current levels .
“ There are no samples of air from that age that we can measure , so you need to find something you can measure that would have responded to the atmospheric CO2 , ” Paul Pearson of Cardiff University told Reuters .
Pearson , Wade and Gavin Foster from the University of Bristol gathered sediment samples in the Tanzanian village of Stakishari where there are deposits of a particular type of well - preserved microfossils that can reveal past CO2 levels .
“ Our study is the first that uses some sort of proxy reconstruction of CO2 to point to the declining CO2 that most of us expected we ought to be able to find , ” Pearson said on Monday from Cardiff .
He said that CO2 , being an acidic gas , causes changes in acidity in the ocean , which absorbs large amounts of the gas .
“ We can pick that up through chemistry of microscopic plankton shells that were living in the surface ocean at the time , ” he explained .
Evidence from around Antarctica was much harder to find .
“ The ice caps covered everything in Antarctica .
The erosion of sediments around Antarctica since the formation of the ice caps has obliterated a lot of the pre-existing evidence that might have been there . ”
“ Our results are really in line with the most sophisticated climate models that have been applied to this interval , ” Pearson added .
The results were published online in the journal Nature .
“ Those models could be used to predict the melting of the ice .
The suggested melting starts around 900 ppm ( parts per million ) , ” he said , a level he believes could be reached by the end of this century , unless serious emissions cuts were made .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Beer drinkers beware :
The cost of a cold one is going up .
Brewers across the globe are hiking prices to compensate for lower sales volumes and higher commodity costs .
Anheuser - Busch InBev , the world 's largest brewer and maker of Budweiser , announced plans to raise prices Tuesday .
" We plan on taking price increases on a majority of volume and in a majority of markets this fall , " Anheuser - Busch InBev said in a statement .
" The increase helps cover some input costs . "
The U.S. - Belgian brewer said prices will go up " across different price tiers , " including its high and low - end brands .
MillerCoors - the maker of popular beers Miller Lite , Coors Lite and Blue Moon -- is also raising prices in some markets .
But these hikes are part of the company 's regular fall increases and are " more in line with catching up with costs and commodity prices rather than the economic environment , " said Julian Green , director of media relations for MillerCoors .
The price increases by the biggest brewers is not unexpected , according to Benj Steinman , the editor of " Beer Marketer 's INSIGHTS , " an independent industry trade publication .
" What is going to be a little bit out of the ordinary is that they are going to be able to go up less than in a normal year because economic conditions are tighter , " said Steinman .
Heineken , best known for its Heineken and Amstel brands , said Tuesday that its global price increases have helped it turn profits despite sagging volumes .
Going forward , however , Steinman said that Heineken will be hard pressed to continue raising prices .
The major competition for the imported brand is Corona , and Corona has said it will not be increasing prices in the tough economy .
Heineken and Corona are struggling more than Anheuser - Busch and MillerCoors -- which have 80 % of the U.S. market by volume -- because beer drinkers are picking out the cheapest drink from the cooler .
" For the first time in a while , it is the lower price brands that are gaining share , and that is definitely because of the economy , " said Steinman .
Anheuser - Busch InBev ( ABI ) was formed in November 2008 when InBev , which brews Beck 's and Stella Artois , bought St. Louis - based Anheuser - Busch for $ 52 billion .
The looming price hike comes as sales volumes in the brewing industry have declined .
Anheuser - Busch InBev said earlier this month that total beer volumes were down 1.5 % in the second quarter versus the same period last year .
Heineken , based in Amsterdam , said Tuesday that price increases helped the company offset the pull back in consumption .
Heineken makes and brews 170 international beers and ciders , but is best known for its brands Heineken and Amstel .
" The economic and trading conditions remain difficult , and there will be continued pressure on volumes in the second half of 2009 , " CEO Jean - Fran�ois van Boxmeer said in a statement .
( CNN ) --
The pilots of the commercial jetliner that last week overshot its destination by about 150 miles have said they were using their laptops and lost track of time and location , federal safety officials said Monday .
The Airbus A320 was flying at 37,000 feet over the Denver , Colorado , area at 5:56 p.m.
Wednesday when it last made radio contact , the safety board said .
Northwest Flight 188 had departed San Diego en route to Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport carrying 144 passengers , two pilots and three flight attendants .
Northwest recently merged with Delta Air Lines .
" Using laptops or engaging in activity unrelated to the pilots ' command of the aircraft during flight is strictly against the airline 's flight deck policies and violations of that policy will result in termination , " Delta said Monday in a statement .
Pilot Timothy B. Cheney , 53 , was hired in 1985 and has more than 20,000 hours flight time ; First Officer Richard I. Cole , 54 , was hired in 1997 and has about 11,000 hours of flight time , the report said .
Neither pilot reported having had an accident , incident or violation , neither had any ongoing medical conditions and neither said he was tired , it said .
They each had a 19 - hour layover in San Diego ; neither said he had slept or argued during the flight , but both said " there was a distraction " in the cockpit , according to the report .
The pilots said there was " a concentrated period of discussion where they did not monitor the airplane or calls " from air traffic control , though both said they heard conversation on the radio , the report said .
Neither pilot said he noticed messages sent by company dispatchers , it added .
It said the men were talking about the new monthly crew flight scheduling system put into place in the wake of Northwest 's merger with Delta Air Lines .
" Each pilot accessed and used his personal laptop computer while they discussed the airline crew flight scheduling procedure , " the report said .
" The first officer , who was more familiar with the procedure , was providing instruction to the captain .
" Neither pilot said he was aware of where the plane was until a flight attendant called the cockpit about five minutes before the plane was to have landed and asked their estimated time of arrival , the report said .
" The captain said , at that point , he looked at his primary flight display for an ETA and realized that they had passed " the airport , it added .
After 78 minutes of radio silence , the pilots re-established radio contact with air traffic controllers , it said .
After landing at Minneapolis - St. Paul , both voluntarily underwent alcohol breath tests , which proved negative , the report said .
The safety board said its investigators interviewed the pilots separately Sunday in Minnesota for more than five hours combined .
The investigation will include scrutiny of the flight and voice data recorders , it said .
An airline spokesman said Monday the company has sent the passengers on the plane $ 500 travel vouchers to compensate them for their inconvenience , and that the pilots have been suspended until the conclusion of the investigations .
The NTSB on Monday interviewed the three flight attendants who were on the plane , a spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants said .
The lead flight attendant told officers she was unaware there had been an incident aboard , according to the report .
Police who met the wayward jet said the pilots were " cooperative , apologetic and appreciative . "
The NTSB is hoping the plane 's cockpit voice recorder either will confirm the pilot 's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation , including whether the captain and first officer fell asleep .
Watch the co-pilot speak
The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio , federal accident investigators said .
The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored , meaning that if the recorder was working properly , anything the pilots would have said during the time they were n't answering radio calls would have been recorded over .
But a former accident investigator said the voice recorder may still provide valuable information , because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis after overshooting the airport .
The flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers , the ex-investigator said .
Meanwhile , the North American Aerospace Defense Command , which scrambled fighter jets for the wayward plane but did not launch them , said it was reviewing procedures for launching the fighters to track potentially hijacked or suspicious aircraft .
At issue is the Federal Aviation Administration 's apparent delay in notifying NORAD the Northwest jet was not in contact with controllers , according to a senior U.S. official directly familiar with the timeline of the incident .
Watch how the military is looking at a possible FAA delay
The official , who declined to be identified because the military and the FAA are reviewing the incident , said the FAA 's request for military involvement came after the plane passed the Minneapolis - St.
Paul airport .
NORAD scrambled fighter jets at two locations .
But as they approached the runway for takeoff , the FAA reported being back in contact with the Northwest flight , and the fighters stayed on the ground .
" My real question is why we did not know of the ' radio out ' situation from the FAA sooner , " the official said .
" The FAA is also looking into that . "
Since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , NORAD has regularly launched fighter jets to track aircraft in unusual situations such as when they deviate from flight plans , lose radio contact or enter restricted airspace .
According to a second U.S. official , NORAD is in constant contact with the FAA so it can respond when situations arise .

( CNN ) -- Hannah Powell - Auslam of La Mirada , California , had surgery this month to check her lymph nodes , just in case the breast cancer had spread .
Taylor Thompson of Little Rock , Arkansas , also had an aggressive form of breast cancer , one that has a 98 percent chance of returning .
It required surgery in June .
They 're two young women fighting breast cancer .
Or rather , two girls : Hannah is 11 .
Taylor is 13 .
While Taylor and Hannah 's cases are rare , they 're extreme examples of a troubling trend emerging with breast cancer , medical experts say .
Younger women are getting a disease that usually strikes around menopause -- and no one knows why .
" The breast is a very sensitive , vulnerable organ , " said Dr. Marisa Weiss , founder of Breastcancer.org , a breast health Web site .
" The breast is the only organ in men and women that is formed after you 're born . "
Most of the breast forms during adolescence , she said .
" It 's while organs are formed that they are most vulnerable to changes and insults . "
Breast cancer could theoretically occur at any age and for either gender .
" You have breast tissue , so at any point , if you have that tissue in your body , it can become cancer , " said Dr. Jennifer Litton , an assistant professor in the department of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .
Litton found that in women with the gene mutation BRCA1 and BRCA2 , which is linked to breast cancer , the disease is diagnosed six years earlier than the previous generation .
The cause remains unclear .
" Maybe women who have a family history , they were getting screened earlier , or having more breast self - awareness , " she said .
" It could be something hormonal or environmental that 's causing women to have breast cancer earlier ... that certainly is a big area of interest . "
But cases of breast cancer occurring in the 20s , teens and tweens are outliers , said Litton , who works with young patients .
Only about 7 percent of breast cancer cases occur in patients under the age of 40 .
Taylor 's diagnosis startled her family .
They have no history of breast cancer .
" I was actually confused because I never heard of no one that young going through something like this , " said Stephanie Anderson , Taylor 's mother .
" And for it to be my daughter at the age of 13 , it was like too much at one time .
I was concerned about her and how she 'd react because she 's so young . "
Taylor had an aggressive type of cancer called a phyllodes tumor , which appears in less than 1 percent of breast cancer cases .
" I did n't know how to explain to my 13 - year - old daughter that she had breast cancer , when she did n't know what it was , " Anderson said .
Taylor 's still in the age where she loves hot pink ( especially when paired with stars ) and embraces glitter lip gloss .
When she heard the news , she asked her mother : " Am I going to die ?
Is this going to kill me ?
Is my hair going to fall out ?
What 's going to happen ? "
In July , Taylor had surgery to remove the cancer .
Phyllodes tumor is not very responsive to chemotherapy or radiation treatment .
After her surgery in the summer , the eighth - grader returned to middle school .
Her mom said Taylor was worried about how her peers might perceive her because of the cancer .
" The other people found out and I told them myself that I had breast cancer , " said Taylor .
" And they were crying . "
The community rallied around Taylor , holding volleyball games , wearing pink ribbons in her honor , organizing dinners and making her a grand marshal in a recent parade , her mother said .
Taylor checks in every six months at the hospital to make sure the cancer has not returned .
Weiss , a breast cancer oncologist , suggested that everyday pollutants such as chemicals including bisphenol A and dioxins could bombard hormone receptors , causing abnormalities in the breast .
Another risk factor for breast cancer is obesity .
" When it comes to breast cancer risks , the extra fat in obesity leads to extra estrogen production , which can lead to extra breast cell growth , including abnormal breast cell growths , " she said .
Additionally , being obese means a girl is more likely to get her first period earlier .
The longer a woman has her menstrual cycle , the greater the risk of getting breast cancer , medical experts said .
With more children becoming obese , this could contribute to earlier breast cancer .
But these possible factors do not explain why someone as young as Taylor , who is not overweight and did not hit puberty early got breast cancer in her teens .
Likewise , Hannah 's case is also perplexing .
" I was just like ... how could this happen ? "
Hannah said in June .
" I 'm 10 .
So , I was really shocked . "
Her family has no history of breast cancer .
The girl who played third base in her softball team and loved reruns of Hannah Montana learned she had a rare breast cancer that appears in less than 1 percent of total cases called secretory carcinoma .
After a mastectomy in May and chemotherapy this summer , the sixth - grader went back to school .
This month , she underwent lymph node surgery , because doctors want to make sure that the cancer has not spread , said her father , Jeremy Auslam .
" We explain everything to her .
She does n't want to go through everything , but she does what she needs to do .
She is involved , " he said , about Hannah 's role in medical decisions .
The family maintains a blog chronicling Hannah 's treatment .
Despite cases like Hannah 's and Taylor 's , the probability of a young girl getting breast cancer is slim , doctors said .
Oncologists Weiss and Litton discourage routine mammograms for younger women , because their breast tissues are dense , making it harder to detect abnormalities and resulting in unnecessary biopsies .
Mammograms are recommended for women in their 40s , unless there is a family history .
Weiss , who wrote a book , " Taking Care of Your Girls , " about breast health , said teens and young women should be aware , but not panic - stricken .
" It 's important to start conversations about breast health early , " Weiss said .
The ages between 8 - 18 are critical because " that 's when they 're constructing their breast tissue .
That 's when what they eat , drink , medicines they take and personal products they use , how they use their body becomes the building blocks in the construction project as they lay down the foundation of their future breast health . "

I want to keep the health insurance I have — which is no health insurance .
I was dropped when I had a heart attack .
My insurance company called it a preexisting condition , and they were right .
Heart attacks have been around a very long time .
The important thing is that I treasure my insurance company ’s free market right to maximize profits at all moral and ethical costs .
I would willingly die defending that right .
And now , finally , I may get that chance .
I try not to worry about my needless impending death .
I do n’t lose sleep over the pointless suffering between now and then , and I refuse to get down about leaving my wife and children behind without any health care of their own .
What I do worry about is the prospect of private insurance juggernauts experiencing a ten to fifteen percent decline in annual gross revenue due to the availability of a public option .
Now that ’s scary .
I do n’t have a doctor .
But if I did , I would n’t want some bureaucrat coming between me and him .
Like Sarah Palin , I am against Obama ’s death panels .
I prefer Liberty Mutual ’s death panels , because at least they ’re American .
I am not impressed with claims of socialized medicine working in countries like Britain , France , and Canada .
It ’s far better to die of septic shock in a free country than to receive antibiotics in a single - payer one .
Single - payer systems , as we know , just are n’t fair .
Why should one person have to pay for everyone else ?
What if that person runs out of money ?
I ’ve always relished getting the insurance statement envelope in the mail following a surgical procedure .
It makes me fee a little like a nominated actor on Oscar night .
I never know if I ’m going to be reimbursed 80 percent , 50 percent , or not at all .
I firmly believe the suspense has kept me going all these years .
But under a single - payer or a public option , let ’s face it — the thrill will be gone .
Bleeding heart liberal commie pinko anti-American leftist homosexual traitors contend there are 47 million uninsured people in this country .
But the truth is , 46,999,996 of them are illegal immigrants and the other four are my family .
Let ’s get something straight , though — we do n’t want a handout .
We have a little thing called pride .
I can proudly say I ’ve been turned away by some of the biggest names in healthcare , from Aetna to AIG to CIGNA to United Health — a virtual Who ’s Who of the insurance business .
I am not in the least offended that members of Congress receive superior healthcare provided entirely by the federal government .
I recently spoke to my congressman regarding this issue , and he personally assured me that were I ever elected to the House or the Senate , the exact same health plan would be made available to me .
One day , should I miraculously live that long , I ’ll be eligible for Medicare , and the government better keep their grubby hands off it .
Back when our country was founded by a few brave men , many of them gave their lives for Medicare .
If these same patriots were alive today , they would do what any patriot would do in the face of a government takeover of Medicare — show up at Obama rallies with loaded assault weapons .
Because of government interference in the natural order of things , bloodletting has become a lost art .
Castor oil and cod liver oil for treatment of everything from a common cold to multiple bone fractures has become a thing of the past .
Amputations are way down , and that ’s a problem because , as everyone knows , a severed limb cannot be reinfected .
I am not troubled by life expectancy in the U.S. ranking 35th , a bit behind Bosnia and a hair ahead of Albania .
Life expectancy is vastly overrated .
Post - mortem relapses are increasingly rare .
I am dead set against government sponsored preventive care .
Preventive care not only weakens our natural defenses against disease but also casts our government in the role of parent .
My own parents had a different approach to medical concerns .
When my right foot hurt , Dad would stomp on my left foot , and vice - versa .
Mom said he picked this up while watching old episodes of The Three Stooges , proving once again that we can certainly learn a lot from our forefathers .
The fact is , the misguided outcry for a public option — or any sort of healthcare for that matter — represents a serious threat to intelligent design .
Intelligent design is a constitutionally guaranteed right granted by our nation ’s founders .
Under intelligent design , we evolve into a superior civilization as the strong survive , the weak perish , and the really weak run Blackwater .
Government programs are doomed to failure .
Aside from the GI Bill , Social Security , the FDA , the Hoover Dam , the Federal Reserve System , the FAA , the SEC , the Army , the Navy , the Air Force , the Marines , the National Guard , and NASA , name one government program that works .
I believe the Earth was created in six days by an all - powerful benevolent God and that on the seventh day
He created our current healthcare system in His own image .
Tampering with the Lord ’s healthcare system is heresy and will surely bring the wrath of nations down on this once great land .
When that day comes , we owe it to ourselves to bleed to death and resist the evil temptation to show up at a free clinic .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Despite theories to the contrary , adults who eat a lot of meat may not have a heightened risk of the most common type of malignant brain tumor , a new study finds .
The study , reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , looked at the potential link between brain tumors called gliomas and people ’s intake of meat and compounds called nitrosamines .
Nitrosamines , which are potentially cancer - promoting , are present in certain foods , or are formed in the body other chemicals we eat called sodium nitrites and nitrates .
These compounds are used in preserving and flavoring processed and cured meats -- like hot dogs , bacon , sausage and ham -- which makes those foods major sources of dietary nitrosamines .
For several decades , researchers have thought that nitrosamines -- which can cross from the blood to the brain -- may contribute to the risk of gliomas , a group of brain tumors that makes up about 80 percent of malignant brain cancers in adults .
But studies so far have come to inconsistent conclusions .
For the new study , researchers used data from three large ongoing health studies of U.S. doctors and nurses whose diets and lifestyle habits have been periodically surveyed for up to three decades .
They found that among the nearly 238,000 men and women in the studies , just 335 were diagnosed with gliomas at some point .
There were no links between the risk of developing the disease and participants ’ intake of meat , processed meat , nitrites , nitrates or nitrosamines .
What ’s more , there was no elevated risk among meat lovers who also had low intakes of antioxidants like vitamins C and E -- which slow down the formation of nitrosamines in the stomach .
“ As always with results from one single study , we need to be cautious with interpretation , ” lead researcher Dr. Dominique S. Michaud , of Imperial College London in the UK , told Reuters Health in an email .
However , she said , “ this study suggests that at least in adulthood , meat intake probably does not increase the risk of glioma . ”
Whether diet during childhood and adolescence has any later impact is unknown , Michaud noted .
Even if there is no connection to glioma risk , though , there are still plenty of other health reasons to limit red and processed meats in the diet , Michaud pointed out .
Studies have linked high intakes to a number of diseases , including heart disease and colon , stomach and breast cancers .

The Integral Fast Reactor
Guest Post by Steve Kirsch stk@propel.com
“ In the decade from 1984 to 1994 , scientists at Argonne National Laboratory developed an advanced technology that promised safe nuclear power unlimited by fuel supplies , with a waste product sharply reduced both in radioactive lifetime and amount .
The program , called the IFR , was cancelled suddenly in 1994 , before the technology could be perfected in every detail .
Its story is not widely known , nor are its implications widely appreciated .
It is a story well worth telling , and this series of articles does precisely that . ”
— excerpt from Plentiful Energy and the IFR story by Charles Till , former Associate Director , Argonne National Laboratory
Executive summary
Congress should add a provision to the climate bills to authorize $ 3B to have DOE work with industry to build a demonstration Integral Fast Reactor ( IFR ) plant in order to jump - start this critical clean energy technology .
A successful IFR demonstration can lead to the following important benefits :
The only technology we have with a realistic potential to save the planet .
The IFR is the first viable solution to how to eliminate CO 2 emissions from coal plants because it can do that without increasing costs .
Eliminating emissions from coal plants is required to prevent a climate catastrophe .
But using carbon capture adds cost and may not be practical or viable .
The IFR , on the other hand , can replace the burner in an existing coal plant while reducing operating costs .
This is why the IFR is one of Jim Hansen ’s top five priorities for saving the planet .
Solves the nuclear waste problem and opens the door for the expansion of nuclear power in the US .
The IFR uses today ’s nuclear waste as fuel .
The waste product from the IFR is minimal and short - lived .
Solving the waste problem is required if we are to expand nuclear power in the US .
The IFR does this .
Opportunity to become the world leader in clean energy .
The IFR is the state - of - the - art nuclear technology that everyone wants .
It is better in every dimension than any of today ’s nuclear reactors .
If we make a strategic bet on this technology and heavily invest in it , the US has the opportunity to become the undisputed world leader in clean electric power generation .
Nuclear is the elephant of clean power technologies and the IFR was determined to be the best nuclear power technology by an extensive comparative study DOE .
It is arguably the most powerful clean power technology on the planet .
Creates enormous economic value .
It turns our existing nuclear waste into an asset worth over $ 30 trillion dollars .
That is a fantastic return on investment for a one - time $ 3B investment to jump - start the technology .
Nothing else comes close .
Unlimited clean power .
The IFR allows us to power the entire US electricity needs for the next 1,500 years without doing any additional mining of uranium ; just using the “ waste ” we have on - hand that nobody wants .
The power is carbon free .
If we mine , we can power the power needs of the entire planet forever .
Background
The IFR is an advanced fourth generation sodium - cooled fast nuclear reactor ( SFR ) combined with a reprocessing facility using pyroprocessing , typically in the same power plant .
The combination of a fast reactor plus waste processing is known as the Integral Fast Reactor .
Unlike today ’s nuclear power plants ( all of which are second generation designs built 30 years ago ) , the IFR uses fast neutrons ( instead of slow neutrons ) and thus is known as a “ fast reactor . ”
Fast neutrons have the advantage of “ burning ” the nuclear material completely so that the only waste products are fission products ( elements near the middle of the periodic table ) .
This waste is only dangerous for a few hundred years which is much less than the 100,000 - year sequestration time that many think is needed for conventional nuclear waste .
Sodium - cooled fast nuclear reactor technology was developed beginning in 1964 by a team of scientists at Argonne National Laboratories .
Their test - bed reactor , known as the EBR - II , ran flawlessly for 30 years until being permanently shut down by Congress in 1994 .
Today , while other countries such as Russia , India , China , France and Japan are successfully and aggressively pursuing fast reactors , [ 1 ] the US has n’t had an operating fast reactor since the EBR - II was shut down 15 years ago .
The need
To prevent a climate disaster , we must eliminate virtually all coal plant emissions worldwide in 25 years .
The best way and , for all practical purposes , the only way to get all countries off of coal is not with coercion ; it is to make them want to replace their coal burners by giving them a plug - compatible technology that is less expensive .
The IFR can do this .
It is plug - compatible with the burners in a coal plant ( see Nuclear Power : Going Fast ) .
No other technology can upgrade a coal plant so it is greenhouse gas free while reducing operating costs at the same time .
In fact , no other technology can achieve either of these goals .
The IFR can achieve both .
The bottom line is that without the IFR ( or a yet - to - be - invented technology with similar ability to replace the coal burner with a cheaper alternative ) , it is unlikely that we ’ll be able to keep CO2 under 450 ppm .
Today , the IFR is the only technology with the potential to displace the coal burner .
That is why restarting the IFR is so critical and why Jim Hansen has listed it as one of the top five things we must do to avert a climate disaster . [ 2 ]
Without eliminating virtually all coal emissions by 2030 , the sum total of all of our other climate mitigation efforts will be inconsequential .
Hansen often refers to the near complete phase - out of coal emissions worldwide by 2030 as the sine qua non for climate stabilization ( see for example , the top of page 6 in his August 4 , 2008 trip report ) .
To stay under 450 ppm , we would have to install about 13,000 GWe of new carbon - free power over the next 25 years .
That number was calculated by Nathan Lewis of Caltech for the Atlantic , but others such as Saul Griffith have independently derived a very similar number and White House Science Advisor John Holdren used 5,600 GWe to 7,200 GWe in his presentation to the Energy Bar Association Annual Meeting on April 23 , 2009 .
That means that if we want to save the planet , we must install more than 1 GWe per day of clean power every single day for the next 25 years .
That is a very , very tough goal .
It is equivalent to building one large nuclear reactor per day , or 1,500 huge wind turbines per day , or 80,000 37 foot diameter solar dishes covering 100 square miles every day , or some linear combination of these or other carbon free power generation technologies .
Note that the required rate is actually higher than this because Hansen and Rajendra Pachauri , the chair of the IPCC , now both agree that 350 ppm is a more realistic “ not to exceed ” number ( and we ’ve already exceeded it ) .
Today , we are nowhere close to that installation rate with renewables alone .
For example , in 2008 , the average power delivered by solar worldwide was only 2 GWe ( which is to be distinguished from the peak solar capacity of 13.4GWe ) .
That is why every renewable expert at the 2009 Aspen Institute Environment Forum agreed that nuclear must be part of the solution .
Al Gore also acknowledges that nuclear must play an important role .
Nuclear has always been the world ’s largest source of carbon free power .
In the US , for example , even though we have n’t built a new nuclear plant in the US for 30 years , nuclear still supplies 70 % of our clean power !
Nuclear can be installed very rapidly ; much more rapidly than renewables .
For example , about two thirds of the currently operating 440 reactors around the world came online during a 10 year period between 1980 and 1990 .
So our best chance of meeting the required installation of new power goal and saving the planet is with an aggressive nuclear program .
Unlike renewables , nuclear generates base load power , reliably , regardless of weather .
Nuclear also uses very little land area .
It does not require the installation of new power lines since it can be installed where the power is needed .
However , even with a very aggressive plan involving nuclear , it will still be extremely difficult to install clean power fast enough .
Unfortunately , even in the US , we have no plan to install the clean power we need fast enough to save the planet .
Even if every country were to agree tomorrow to completely eliminate their coal plant emissions by 2030 , how do we think they are actually going to achieve that ?
There is no White House plan that explains this .
There is no DOE plan .
There is no plan or strategy .
The deadlines will come and go and most countries will profusely apologize for not meeting their goals , just like we have with most of the signers of the Kyoto Protocol today .
Apologies are nice , but they will not restore the environment .
We need a strategy that is believable , practical , and affordable for countries to adopt .
The IFR offers our best hope of being a centerpiece in such a strategy because it the only technology we know of that can provide an economically compelling reason to change .
Nuclear is our best clean power technology and the IFR is our best nuclear technology .
DOE did a study in 2001 - 2002 of 19 different reactor designs on 27 different criteria .
The IFR ranked # 1 .
Over 242 experts from around the world participated in the study .
It was the most comprehensive evaluation of competitive nuclear designs ever done .
Top DOE nuclear management ignored the study because it did n’t endorse the design the Bush administration wanted .
The IFR has been sitting on the shelf for 15 years and the DOE currently has no plans to change that .
How does the US expect to be a leader in clean energy by ignoring our best nuclear technology ?
Nobody I ’ve talked to has been able to answer that question .
IFRs are better than conventional nuclear in every dimension .
Here are a few :
Efficiency : IFRs are over 100 times more efficient than conventional nuclear .
It extracts nearly 100 % of the energy from nuclear material .
Today ’s nuclear reactors extract less than 1 % .
So you need only 1 ton of actinides each year to feed an IFR ( we can use existing nuclear waste for this ) , whereas you need 100 tons of freshly mined uranium each year to extract enough material to feed a conventional nuclear plant .
Unlimited power forever : IFRs can use virtually any actinide for fuel .
Fast reactors with reprocessing are so efficient that even if we restrict ourselves to just our existing uranium resources , we can power the entire planet forever ( the Sun will consume the Earth before we run out of material to fuel fast reactors ) .
If we limited ourselves to using just our DU “ waste ” currently in storage , then using the IFR we can power the US for over 1,500 years without doing any new mining of uranium . [ 3 ]
Exploits our largest energy resource :
In the US , there is 10 times as much energy in the depleted uranium ( DU ) that is just sitting there as there is coal in the ground .
This DU waste is our largest natural energy resource … but only if we have fast reactors .
Otherwise , it is just waste .
With fast reactors , virtually all our nuclear waste ( from nuclear power plants , leftover from enrichment , and from decommissioned nuclear weapons ) [ 4 ] becomes an energy asset worth about $ 30 trillion dollars … that ’s not a typo … $ 30 trillion , not billion .
[ 5 ]
An 11 year old child was able to determine this from publicly available information in 2004 .
Safety :
The IFR is safer than conventional nuclear because the reactors safely shut down based on the laws of physics if something goes wrong .
Today ’s third generation nuclear designs are very safe : 1 accident predicted every 29 million reactor years .
The IFR should be even safer due to the passive safety inherent in the design .
Also , IFRs are much safer than the coal plants they replace .
Coal power plants are estimated to kill 24,000 Americans per year , due to lung disease as well as causing 40,000 heart attacks per year .
Outside of the Soviet Union , [ 6 ] commercial nuclear has never killed even a single member of the public in its entire 50 year operating history .
Proliferation resistant :
The IFR is proliferation resistant on two counts .
First , the pyroprocess used to recycle the fuel does not and cannot produce plutonium with the chemical purity needed for nuclear weapon .
One of the world ’s top nuclear proliferation experts is strongly in favor of the IFR for this reason .
Second , if all reactors were IFRs , there would never again be need for enriched uranium .
Because possession of a pyroprocessing facility could give a nation a leg up in a quest for a nuclear weapons capability , facilities for both reprocessing and uranium enrichment should be operated under strict international supervision .
The need for international control is arguably the most compelling reason for the U.S. to proceed rapidly with the IFR .
Consumes existing nuclear waste from nuclear reactors and weapons :
Fast reactors consume our existing nuclear waste ( from reactors and decommissioned weapons ) and transforms it into elements that are safe after 300 years .
Minimal waste : A 1 GWe IFR plant generates 1 ton of fission products each year that needs to be sequestered for 300 years until it is safe .
A conventional nuclear plant of the same capacity creates about 100 tons of “ waste ” each year , containing isotopes that need to be sequestered for 1 million years according to the current US depository requirements .
If you powered your entire life from IFRs , the amount of waste you ’d generate would be smaller than 1 soda can and it would need to be stored for only 300 years .
Nuclear material security :
The nuclear material in the reactor or reprocessing facility would be too hot for a terrorist to handle .
The nuclear material that leaves the site are the fission products which are completely useless for making a nuclear bomb .
The IFR creates a huge economic opportunity for the US to be the leading clean energy supplier to the world .
Nuclear is the lowest cost scalable energy technology we have and the IFR is our best nuclear technology .
If we focus on the IFR and invest in ramping up the volumes and reducing the cost , the IFR will be cheapest power source that every country will want everywhere instead of coal .
Our economy will benefit and our planet will too .
A brief history of the IFR
Developed in the last decades of the 20th century by a team of scientists at Argonne National Laboratory led by Charles Till .
It used as a test bed a small fast reactor that first produced power in 1965 and ran for 30 years without incident .
In the 1970 ’s , the fast reactor was the top energy priority of the President , Congress , and the Atomic Energy Commission .
In 1971 Nixon said , “ Our best hope today for meeting the Nation ’s growing demand for economical clean energy lies with the fast breeder reactor . ”
In his 1994 State of the Union address , President Clinton declared that the IFR was unnecessary and later that year Congress terminated the project .
The scientists were ordered to dismantle the test reactor so it could never be restarted , and they came to understand that it would not be wise to criticize official policy so they stopped talking about it .
The IFR demonstrated that fast reactors can be operated for decades without incident or mishap and that the on - site reprocessing technique for removing the fission products and putting the material back into the reactor works .

Opposition
We do not know of any members of Congress who oppose restarting the IFR .
Most have never heard of it .
Environmental groups , in general , do not like nuclear power .
For example , environmental groups in Germany got Germany to ban nuclear power .
The result is that Germany is forced to build more new coal plants … the worst possible outcome for the environment and exactly the opposite of what the green groups wanted .
The green case against nuclear is based largely on dogma and myth .
See Mark Lynas : the green heretic persecuted for his nuclear conversion which is an eye - opening account of a noted environmentalist who took an objective look at the facts .
One of the top people at NRDC ( speaking on his own behalf ) , says his only objection to the IFR is the cost competiveness of nuclear .
GE says IFRs can be built in volume for $ 1,500 per kW which is cheaper than coal ( and slightly less than the $ 2,000 per kW that the Chinese paid to construct Qinshan Phase 3 which was completed 52 days ahead of schedule and under budget in 2003 ) .
The NRDC spokesperson is skeptical of GE ’s cost numbers for the IFR ( $ 1,500 per kW ) .
The Sierra Club is in the process of determining their position on the IFR .
You wo n’t have any trouble finding people who will throw darts at the IFR .
They will argue it ’s too expensive , unreliable , unproven , increases the proliferation risk , etc .
These arguments lack credibility ; they all fail in the face of the facts , e.g. , the EBR - II and the Russian BN - 600 experiences .
These two reactors are are the “ inconvenient truths ” for the fast reactor skeptics .
Even if you believe all the arguments of the opposition and completely discount the arguments of the Argonne scientists who best know the technology , it does n’t matter because we do not have an option : we have to make this work now .
Renewables alone can’t kill coal in the time allotted .
The point is : 1 ) virtually every credible renewable expert agrees we cannot reduce our carbon emissions enough without nuclear , 2 ) the IFR is our best nuclear , 3 ) the IFR is the only technology we have with a realistic chance of replacing coal burners in a coal plant with a lower - cost carbon - free alternative .
So objections noted , but our planet is at stake and we have got to make this work .
We should be joining together and doing things that our most credible scientists tell us we have to do to save our planet , rather than arguing amongst ourselves and debating what the optimum solution is .
The time for debate is over .
We are so late on deploying clean energy technologies that any new technology that has a realistic potential to make a significant positive impact should be welcomed with open arms by every human being .
Urgency
“ Within the next four decades , human civilisation must eliminate its use of fossil fuels and replace them with 10,000 gigawatts of reliable , sustainable power .
The only realistic way that this extraordinary challenge can be met is with the rapid and large - scale deployment of nuclear power , on a worldwide basis , led by countries like the US , Russia , the EU , China and India .
Generation III nuclear plants will be critical to this expansion over the short term , and Generation IV technology is the astoundingly attractive long - term prospect , with the IFR being the flagship Gen IV design .
The urgency in getting the IFR commercialised and deploymed on an industrial scale cannot be overstated ” .
— Professor Barry Brook , Sir Hubert Wilkins Chair of Climate Change , The University of Adelaide
The climate crisis wo n’t wait .
The sooner the IFR is perfected and deployed to eliminate emissions from coal plants , the better .
You ca n’t expand nuclear in the US without a solution to the waste problem .
For example , in California , you ca n’t build a new nuclear power plant until there is a federal waste repository .
We need to do the technology transfer while the people who know how to do it are still alive .
This technology is not trivial .
No other country has been able to successfully replicate the IFR .
If we wait 10 years , the people who built the IFR will all be dead .
This could set the project back another decade or two .
Ensures energy independence for the future .
If the world ramps up conventional nuclear , we will run out of cheap nuclear fuel faster than many people think .
For example , the Russians published a paper showing that in Russia , if they doubled their nuclear capacity in 20 years , they would run out of cheap nuclear fuel in as little as 25 years .
( see the first paragraph of BN - 800 as a New Stage in the Development of Fast Sodium - Cooled Reactors ) .
With fast reactors in place , we never run out of fuel .
Solves the waste problem now .
President Obama has said nuclear power will not be expanded in the US until we have a solution to the waste problem .
The IFR provides that solution since today ’s “ waste ” now becomes valuable “ fuel ” for our future fast reactors .
The only real waste , the fission products , are small and only need be stored for about 200 years .
This is a trivial challenge compared to the problem we face today .
Regarding storage today , the US government could make this offer any state willing to store nuclear waste : “ if you store it , you can sell it . ”
So if one state stores all the nuclear waste , that state would own an asset with an eventual market value of $ 30 trillion dollars .
What state can resist that offer ?
Instead of rejecting nuclear waste , every state would be clamoring to get its piece of this national asset .
If all the states are foolish enough to reject that offer , a number of American Indian tribes have said they are more than happy to store the nuclear waste on their land so long as they can sell that “ waste ” to power fast reactors , whether in the US or other parts of the world .
Senator Bingaman ’s bill in fact contemplates such compensation to a State and / or Indian tribe which hosts a repository . [ 12 ]
The DOE would have to supervise the storage .
The genie is out of the bottle : refusing to play will not make fast reactors go away and will ultimately make us less safe .
If we do n’t re-start our fast reactor technology , then other countries will take the lead .
France , Russia , India , Japan , and China all have fast reactor programs and all are either operating fast reactors now , or soon will be .
The US shut down our last remaining fast reactor 15 years ago .
Leadership is important for two reasons : 1 ) if we fail to lead , we will have missed taking advantage of our superior technology and missed a major economic opportunity as the premiere supplier of clean power technology and 2 ) the nuclear industry is in far safer hands if the US leads the way than if we abdicate .
For example , if Chernobyl had been a US reactor design , that accident could never have happened .
No advantage to waiting .
Fast reactors are the future of nuclear power .
These reactors are better in every dimension than today ’s nuclear designs .
The sooner we transition to them and standardize them , and focus on getting the volumes up and the costs down , the lower our energy costs , the greater our impact on climate change , and the greater our chances of capturing the economic opportunity .
There is no advantage to waiting to deploy these reactors .
But we cannot deploy them until we build one first .
We are way behind other countries .
Russia has found that their fast reactors are their best performing reactors .
China recently ordered two of the Russian BN - 800 fast reactors .
So while the Russians are the first country to be exporting commercial fast reactors and had no trouble getting $ 3.5B from the Russian government for their fast reactor program , the US has n’t spent a dime exploiting the world ’s best fast technology that we shelved in 1994 ( which the Russians would love to get from us ) .
That is not a winning strategy .
It is a dumb strategy .
We should either fish or cut bait on fast reactors .
If we are n’t going to pursue them , then we should sell the technology to the Russians so we get at least some economic benefit from our research instead of zero .
If we are going to pursue fast reactors , we need to get off our butts and build one now like our top Argonne scientists have been telling us for the last 15 years .
If our objective is for Russia to lead the world on commercial advanced nuclear reactors , then we should keep doing what we are doing now , i.e. , nothing .
Building high dollar value nuclear reactors will help re-start our economy .
Unlike with convention nuclear plants , the IFR reactors are built in a factory then shipped to the site on rail .
We can re-tool idle factories , create jobs , and help reverse our trade deficit .
Today , thanks to US government inaction , the Russians are the first to export commercial fast nuclear reactors .
This is technology we invented and perfected .
Why Congress must order the DOE to build an IFR demo
Congresswoman Eshoo inquired about the IFR with the DOE and was told the following :
Although the IFR program per se is no longer active , research and development in sodium fast reactor and pyroprocessing technologies have continued .
In its FY 2010 budget , the Office of Nuclear Energy is requesting $ 153.8 million for Fuel Cycle Research and Development , a portion of which will continue research in IFR related technologies like metal fuel development and pyroprocessing .
Some additional funding is also requested in the Generation IV R&D activity to support sodium fast reactor work .
The precise distribution in FY 2010 for these activities will depend on the final appropriation .
Further research is needed to establish the scalability and economics of liquid metal and pyroprocessing technologies as well as their fuel cycle and proliferation - resistant benefits before they are ready for commercial consideration .
So DOE , if left alone , will just do more research .
While the Russians are building commerical fast reactors for export , DOE wants to study it more .
Think back 44 years ago .
The EBR - II sodium cooled fast reactor was designed and constructed in just a few years .
That ’s without the aid of computers .
After over 30 years of operating experience , the original scientists who worked on the IFR say we are ready to build a full - scale demo plant now .
That is their expert opinion .
Today , the DOE wants to do more research and they have n’t even committed to building a small test reactor .
So we were further along 44 years ago than we are today .
At least back then , we actually had an operating fast reactor .
Forty four years ago , we had a “ can do ” attitude .
Today , we ’ve lost it .
We have a “ do more research ” attitude .
Today we have no operating fast reactor of any kind and DOE has no plans to change that .
How is it that we need more research today , yet 44 years ago , we had sufficient research to design , build and operate a sodium cooled fast reactor ?
Did we lose all that knowledge ?
Did we not learn anything of value over the 30 years of operation ?
Compare what is not happening in the US to what is happening in Russia today .
They have been operating their BN - 600 sodium - cooled fast breeder reactor without incident for the past 30 years .
This is a commercial reactor , not a test reactor .
And now they are building commercial fast reactors for the Chinese .
So we are currently 30 years behind the Russians because DOE would rather to fund research rather than being forced to actually build something .
We are out of time .
If the government orders DOE to have a 300 MWe IFR plant built and operating in < 8 years and they make it a priority , then DOE will get it done .
Short of that , nothing will happen .
It ’s like JFK and putting a man on the moon .
Without setting high expectations , nothing gets done .
It ’s clear that Congress has got to request it and set high goals ( just like the Chinese do ) because left alone , DOE will simply research fast reactors until the cows come home and nothing will get built .
If Congress requests nothing , then that ’s what we will get : nothing .
Next steps
“ On the waste issue , GE has technology called PRISM reactors that we can employ … we can deal with nuclear waste through those reactors , but again , the decision to deploy that technology is really in the hands of the government .
What China has done right though is they ’ve set long - term policy with very very tall objectives .
And the US has been very on and off , very short term . ”
– John Krenicki , president and CEO of GE Energy during interview on CNBC ( Note : PRISM is GE ’s commercial implementation of the IFR )
The House bill already allocates $ 10B for Carbon Capture and Sequestration ( CCS ) and $ 0 for fast nuclear .
Bingaman ’s bill allocates $ 6.6 billion for 10 “ early mover ” large - scale CCS projects and $ 0 for fast nuclear .
The Boxer - Kerry Climate bill should be modified to provide DOE at least $ 3B to construct a demonstration IFR plant .
This would be a better use of public funds than CCS , because 1 ) there is a greater likelihood of a successful outcome with the IFR than with CCS , and 2 ) the IFR solution is a superior solution to CCS because the IFR reduces the cost of operating a power plant , whereas CCS will dramatically increase it .
So even if CCS worked as designed , everyone will find a reason not to adopt it .
Every country would be much more likely to adopt an IFR solution ( that lowers costs ) than a CCS solution ( that increases costs ) .
So why are we allocating billions to CCS and zero to the IFR ?
It makes no sense .
You ’d only do that if you were 100 % confident CCS would work and would negligibly increases costs and were 100 % confident the IFR would fail .
But it is much more likely that the IFR will work and CCS will fail .
There is over $ 20 billion dollars in the Nuclear Waste Fund .
Senator Lindsay Graham introduced legislation in April to have all of it rebated to consumers .
That ’s a dumb idea ; it would not move us closer to solving the waste problem .
But taking some of that $ 20 billion dollars and investing it in building an IFR would be a brilliant move .

Senator Kempthorne wrote into the Congressional Record on the retirement of Charles Till :
But [ Charles Till ’s ] greatest contribution , to both his discipline and to the world , lies in the development of the Integral Fast Reactor , the IFR .
This inspired source of electrical power has the capability to achieve incredible efficiency in fuel use , while significantly lessening problems associated with reactor safety and nuclear waste .
In 1986 , the IFR showed that it can protect itself from overheating and meltdown .
It does so through the natural physical properties of the materials used rather than by relying on operator intervention or an engineered safety system .
The IFR was also designed to burn most of its own waste , as well as that of other reactors and the material from dismantled weapons .
Unfortunately , this program was canceled just 2 short years before the proof of concept .
I assure my colleagues someday our Nation will regret and reverse this shortsighted decision .
But complete or not , the concept and the work done to prove it remain genius and a great contribution to the world .

[ 3] The U.S. stockpile of DU amounts to about 700,000 tonnes , which is 7E5 reactor - years of power , or 7E5 x 8760 hours / yr x 1E6 kW / reactor = 6.1E15 kWhr of energy .
The annual U.S electricity consumption these days is ~ 4E12 kWh .
This works out to be 1,525 years of fuel .

More than 99 % of the current nuclear waste from nuclear power plants , uranium enrichment , and decommissioned nuclear weapons can be re-used to fuel fast reactors .
The fission products , which comprise less than 1 % by weight of our current nuclear waste , cannot be used for electric power generation , but everything else can .
The DU comprises about 90 % of the nuclear waste in the US today .

Gilda Ghanipour has spent the last nine years on the run .
Abandoned by her Muslim family for converting to Christianity , she has shuttled from one address to the next , terrified of being deported to her native Iran , where apostasy can be punished by death .
Last year , Ghanipour stumbled upon a retired immigration judge and his Pepperdine University Law School students , who championed her quest for asylum .
Ghanipour won the case .
But she does n’t know it .
Advertisement
The devoutly religious woman vanished shortly before the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services delivered on her dream at the end of August .
Her Pepperdine legal advocates are desperately searching for her -- calling churches she frequented , scouring prison databases , knocking on doors where she once lived .
Somewhere in Los Angeles , they believe , Ghanipour is wandering alone , as she has for most of the last decade , probably clutching her beloved Bible , possibly sleeping in a homeless shelter or in someone ’s spare bedroom .
Police have n’t been able to find her .
The coroner has no record of her .
Efforts by The Times to locate her through relatives , churches and homeless advocates also were unsuccessful .

The disappearance of the 49 - year - old Ghanipour , who speaks three languages and once attended medical school , is especially difficult for those at Pepperdine Law School ’s Asylum Clinic .
Gilda , as they ’ve known her , was their first client .
She offered the lawyers - in - training an early taste of victory .
They have only a grainy black - and - white photo to remind them of her thick black hair , her proud smile , her opinionated ways .
And they are worried , knowing that Ghanipour has been in ill health .
“ Part of me does n’t want to celebrate until we find her , ” said Kristin Heinrich , a third - year law student .
Ghanipour recounted her life story in declarations accompanying her asylum application .
According to the written statements , she spent her childhood in the city of Arak and her adolescence in Tehran , about 200 miles to the north .
She married in 1979 shortly after graduating from high school and moved with her husband to Germany to escape the strict fundamentalist rule of the Islamic Revolution .

While in Germany , she studied medicine .
She periodically visited relatives in California and returned briefly to Iran on several occasions to help her father sort out her mother ’s will .
While touring historical sites on one of those trips , according to her declarations , she was arrested by the Iranian secret service and interrogated about suspicions that she was a German spy .
The experience left her shaken .
Divorced from her husband in Germany , she accepted an invitation to join her relatives in California , arriving in June 2000 on a six - month visitors visa , she wrote in the asylum papers .
While staying with a cousin in Diamond Bar , she had an encounter that would change her life .
An evangelical Christian family knocked at the door .
Their message about God ’s love through Christ resonated with Ghanipour , who had never been especially religious but had experienced what she described as an encounter with God after her mother ’s death years before in Iran .
“ I immediately knew in my heart that this is what I was looking for , ” she wrote in her asylum declaration .
“ And on the 30th of November 2000 , while on a legal visit in the U.S. , I received Jesus Christ as my savior and became a Christian believer . ”

The decision alienated her family .
“ One by one my relatives turned away from me , ” she wrote .
With no family , no job and an expired visa , Ghanipour wandered from place to place , relying on the kindness of friends , many from churches she attended .
Her asylum paperwork listed 25 addresses in the last five years alone , including locations in Woodland Hills , Glendale , North Hollywood , Sherman Oaks , Inglewood , Hawthorne and Ontario .
“ She was afraid she would be arrested and removed ” from the United States , said Bruce Einhorn , a retired federal immigration judge who runs Pepperdine ’s Asylum Clinic .
“ She lived on the run . ”
Ghanipour tried repeatedly to resolve her immigration problems .
She filed for an extension of her visa , only to see it rejected because the wrong fee had been submitted , she wrote in her asylum paperwork .
That happened , she wrote , because a Sherman Oaks notary who had posed as an immigration attorney provided an outdated form , defrauding her of money in the process ( she did not say how much ) .
Advertisement
She met with other attorneys , one of whom advised her to hold off on her legalization efforts because of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Another suggested that she “ pray and ask Jesus Christ to reveal the truth ” about the notary who allegedly scammed her .
Ghanipour prayed often and fervently .
Faith was the one constant in her life .
“ She seemed to be a very committed Christian , ” recalled Roger Bosch , the associate pastor of outreach at Lake Avenue Church in Pasadena , where Ghanipour was baptized in 2004 and attended services and Bible study .
“ She was always concerned that her life would reflect her faith , ” he said .
Advertisement
Ghanipour disappeared from the church about four or five years ago , Bosch said .
She drifted to homes and churches across the region , landing in June 2008 at the Union Rescue Mission on L.A. 's skid row .
A case manager there referred her to the Pepperdine Legal Aid Clinic , which is housed in the mission .
The clinic ’s attorneys typically do not handle immigration matters , so they turned to Einhorn .
At the time , Einhorn was preparing to open a new legal clinic at Pepperdine to represent indigent asylum clients , particularly those who faced religious persecution .
Ghanipour filled the bill .
But by applying for asylum , Ghanipour would be doing precisely what she had tried to avoid all these years : bringing herself to the attention of immigration authorities .
Einhorn informed her of another risk .
The majority of asylum seekers , he explained , are rejected and wind up being referred for removal proceedings in Immigration Court .
But Ghanipour insisted on pressing ahead .
Advertisement
In May , she appeared with Einhorn and another clinic attorney before an asylum officer with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .
The interview lasted 6 1/2 hours .
Einhorn and Ghanipour returned two weeks later , hoping for a decision , but were told that it would be mailed .
Then , in late July , Ghanipour disappeared .
Her cellphone went dead .
She no longer returned e-mails .
Her legal advocates were surprised by her silence because she had been so persistent and vocal about her case .
On Aug. 28 , the government granted her asylum .

Pentadyne Power Corporation has introduced the next generation of its flywheel technology for uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) systems .
The new flywheel , branded GTX , delivers 25 % more energy storage than the company ’s previous models .
The 25 % increase in energy storage allows UPS customers to reduce the number of flywheels and the cost needed to bridge the gap between utility or renewable energy system power losses and transition to a back - up generator system .
“ The Pentadyne GTX flywheel technology is unique in that our flywheel operates with no bearings and no vacuum pump , making the GTX flywheel highly reliable and virtually maintenance free .
GTX is at least 10X more reliable than lead - acid batteries in delivering the energy needed to support mission - critical loads while engaging the back - up generator system , ” said Claude Kalev , Pentadyne ’s CTO .
Technologies like the GTX are ideally suited for supporting hospital , data center and casino mission critical load applications .
The flywheel uses about one quarter of the valuable space that batteries require and can operate in a wide temperature range , making them a possible solution for storing / backing up solar and wind power as well .
Users should wait for Microsoft to work out the bugs in Windows 7 before jumping on the new operating system , a Syracuse , N.Y. - based computer support company said today .
" From the calls we 're getting , as well as our own experience in the past with all Microsoft 's operating systems , we 're recommending that people stick with their time - tested OS and wait for the dust to settle , " said Josh Kaplan , president of Rescuecom .
Citing a litany of reasons , ranging from the risk of losing data during an upgrade to tough economic times , Kaplan urged Windows users to put off upgrading to Windows 7 or buying a new PC with the operating system pre-installed .
" There are some compelling reasons for both businesses and home users to move to Windows 7 , " Kaplan said , " so we 're saying ' just wait for a bit . ' "
Upgrading an existing machine -- whether it's running the eight - year - old Windows XP or the much newer Vista -- is particularly risky , he added , especially if users have n't taken time to make a full backup before they migrate their machines .
" Transferring all their data , their digital life essentially , is one of the most common , and most troubling , issues that users have , " said Kaplan , noting that the chore is among the top problems Rescuecom 's support technicians field .
" Even if you 're doing an in - place [ upgrade ] , if you do n't have a proper backup , you 're still at risk .
Without the proper preparation , moving to a new OS is risky for anybody . "
Some users have found that out first hand .
Among the top subjects on Microsoft 's support forum is one that has put some PCs into an endless reboot loop when their owners tried to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 .
Microsoft has not yet come up with a solution that works for all the users who have reported the problem , sparking frustration .
" I have had enough .
I have now given up and have gone back to XP , which still works fine but is getting a little old , " said " daeld " on the support thread dedicated to the endless reboot problem .
" Wait until your current hardware dies , buy a new PC with Windows 7 then transfer your data from backup to the new one , " said Kaplan .
" If you wait , there will be even more computers designed for Windows 7 , and the driver situation will be better .
While Windows 7 is made to be compatible with the same hardware and software as Vista , there are always exceptions .
It 's safer to wait for the patches and new drivers to be released . "
Another consideration , noted Kaplan , is the price of Windows 7 .
The least - expensive single - license upgrade to the new OS costs $ 119.99 , while the three - license Family Pack runs $ 149.99 .
" Given the economy , is that really a necessary expense right now ? " he wondered .
Last May , Rescuecom posted five steps users can take to extend the life of their aging PC .
" Making sure it 's protected from malware , viruses , all the evil things on the Internet , that goes a long way , " Kaplan said today .
" Cleaning up your hard drive , the normal day - to - day computer maintenance , that 's another . "
Computerworld 's
How to make Windows XP last for the next seven years , although more than two years old , also includes tips that still apply .
" Any upgrade is a challenge , " Kaplan concluded .
" At the least , wait for the first service pack , " he said , referring to the major updates and bug fix collections that Microsoft rolls out at infrequent intervals .

When you see a boat do you ever think ; that ’s it ?
Ca n’t you do anything else ?
In some circles ( let ’s call them anti-boat - ites ) the comparison is often made to the snorkeler .
Relegated to the surface , they are 2 - dimensional players in a 3 - D game .
Enter the Scubacraft .
A relatively affordable ‘ recreational submersible ’ capable of taking your friends tubing and then diving with ease to depths of 30 meters ( 98.5 feet ) or more .
Yes this toy can be yours ; starting at the low introductory price of $ 165,000 USD .
HOW DOES IT WORK ?
– Scubacraft uses patented technology that allows it to transform its buoyancy from a floating craft into a streamlined submersible
– The craft is powered on the surface by a combustion engine and underwater by electric thrusters and batteries
– In normal operation , Scubacraft is designed to have slight positive buoyancy at all times .
If at any time the craft loses power it will slowly float back to the surface in a controlled manner
– If so required , Scubacraft will be able to lose its positive buoyancy in a special ‘ park ’ mode , thus allowing occupants to depart from the craft and perhaps swim off to explore inside a shipwreck
KEY FEATURES :
– Advanced safety features include an automatic depth control ( ADC ) system that assists the operator in maintaining depth , controlling ascent and descent
– VHF radio , underwater communications , lights and GPS are accessories that further enhance safety and performance in operation
– Scubacraft also features an integrated SMB ( Surface Marker Buoy ) system that indicates its presence underwater to all surface craft and incorporates an EPIRB ( Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ) transmitter
– The modular configuration allows for the electric system to be removed and replaced as necessary , adding extra batteries for extended operations or more thrusters for more power .
A wide range of accessories including lights and cameras can be added to extend its underwater capability and enhance the user ’s experience .
– With no exposed propeller and the ability to operate in very shallow water , the technology has advantages over conventional surface craft even before it submerges underwater .
– A wet submersible , the entire structure is free flooding and components are individually sealed to pressure

Obesity in adolescence appeared to be key Being obese as a teenager may be linked with an increased risk of multiple sclerosis as an adult , researchers say .
A 40 - year study of 238,000 women found those who were obese at 18 had twice the risk of developing MS compared to women who were slimmer at that age .
Yet body size during childhood or adulthood was not found to be associated with MS risk , the US researchers report in Neurology .
But an MS charity warned more research was needed to confirm the findings .
Our results suggest that weight during adolescence , rather than childhood or adulthood , is critical in determining the risk of MS
Dr Kassandra Munger
Harvard School of Public Health Researchers from Harvard School of Public Health used data from nurses taking part in a large study on diet , lifestyle factors and health .
Over the course of the study , 593 women were diagnosed with MS , a condition caused by the loss of nerve fibres and their protective myelin sheath in the brain and spinal cord , which causes neurological damage .
The researchers compared the risk of the disease with body mass index ( BMI ) - a ratio of weight to height - at age 18 .
Participants were also asked to describe their body size using a series of diagrams at the age of five , 10 and 20 .
The study showed that those with an " obese " BMI of 30 or larger at age 18 had more than twice the risk of developing MS .
There was also a smaller increased risk in those who were classed as overweight .
The results were the same after accounting for smoking status and physical activity level .
Body shape
When comparing the risk of MS with self - reported body shape , the researchers found no association between childhood obesity and the future chances of developing the disease .
They also found no risk associated with adult obesity .
But women who had a larger body size at 20 years of age also had almost twice the risk of MS compared to women who reported a thinner body size .
Previous research has linked high levels of vitamin D with a reduced risk of MS and the researchers point out that obesity is associated with low vitamin D levels in the body .
The researchers suggest fatty tissue produces substances that affect the immune system , which may also provide a link with the chances of developing MS .
Further research should look at confirming the findings in men and individuals from different ethnic groups as well as comparing with vitamin D levels , they said .
" Our results suggest that weight during adolescence , rather than childhood or adulthood , is critical in determining the risk of MS , " said study author Kassandra Munger , ScD , of Harvard School of Public Health in Boston .
" There 's a lot of research supporting the idea that adolescence may be an important time for development of disease , so what we have found is consistent with that . "
She added : " Teaching and practicing obesity prevention from the start - but especially during teenage years - may be an important step in reducing the risk of MS later in life for women . "
Susan Kohlhaas , research communications officer for the MS Society , said : " This study does not account for several other factors that may play a role in causing MS .
Based on that , more work is needed .
" As such , it is difficult to determine whether teenage obesity could be a possible factor in causing MS in women . "

Think Again : Twitter
" Authoritarian regimes should fear Twitter "
Not at all .
You ca n’t fear what does n’t exist — and Twitter barely exists , if it exists at all , in most authoritarian countries .
Generally , either they have their own microblogging services or Internet access is too slow and expensive for Twitter to be broadly useful .
Furthermore , anyone who does use Twitter probably speaks English , has international contacts , and travels more than the rest of the population — in other words , they are already lost causes , as far as the regime is concerned .
Combined with other tools – e-mail , social networking , and blogs —
Twitter can certainly be helpful in spreading news about upcoming flashmobs and protests .
The demonstrations following Moldova ’s disputed election earlier this year were a perfect example , where a dozen local Twitter maniacs used the service to spread news about their flashmob .
Eventually , their campaign ( which went beyond Twitter and included Facebook and LiveJournal as well ) attracted thousands of people and spilled into loud protests .
While the Moldovan " Twitterati " had very little impact on the events on the ground , they did a great job using Twitter ’s global , viral reach to keep the protests in the international news .
However , Twitter use in authoritarian countries comes with major drawbacks .
Twitter creates an extensive online paper trail that can be easily used against dissidents .
In fact , as Twitter use becomes more common , authoritarian governments are likely to exploit Twitter to gather open - source intelligence on the opposition — not a difficult task for anyone with an Internet hook - up .
So Twitter could help authorities identify dissent at very early stages , tracking not just individual activists , but entire activist networks .
An online friend list could enable a serious crack - down .
" Twitter was the best source of news about the post- election protests in Iran . "
It depends .
Twitter was a great resource during the protests — for people who knew how to use it .
If you had spent the previous six months carefully studying the Iranian Twitterverse , you would already know who to trust and who to ignore .
Unfortunately , 99.9 percent of the readers around the world who turned to Twitter during the uprising had absolutely no idea what they were looking at .
Most of them relied on particular " keywords " ( like # iranelection ) to read everything that was being posted about the events in Tehran .
After a few days , the #iranelection and #moussavi channels contained so much noise that they became attractive destinations for spammers and marketers .
( Many of these spammers are clearly run on some sort of auto - pilot , because #iranelection is still one of the most popular trending topics on Twitter , though very few users seem to still be talking about the election . )
To make things worse , supporters of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began spreading misinformation .
Some of them were quickly ferreted out on sites like Twitspam.org , but the damage was done .
Of course , not everyone was going into the Iranian Twitterworld blind .
The best way to read the Iranian tweeters was probably second - hand on the sites of established bloggers like The Atlantic ‘s Andrew Sullivan and The Huffington Post ‘s Nico Pitney , both of whom did admirable work curating the valuable posts and vetting out the junk .
Still , the Iranian protests pointed out some of the dangers of relying on Twitter for breaking news from abroad .
" Twitter is a great organizing tool . "
Perhaps .
If your objective is to get 500 people to do the Thriller dance in Grand Central Station , Twitter , with its penchant for all things viral , is your best friend .
The NYPD ( which also Twitters , by the way ) might even decide to let you get away with it .
But if you ’re trying to overthrow a tyrannical government somewhere in the Middle East , you may want to think twice .
Members of the local Mukhabarat ( secret police ) may trail behind the NYPD in their tech - enthusiasm , but chances are they are also reading your feed .
You ’d be much better off organizing your revolution with more secure tools — like encrypted e-mail or even instant messaging — and turning to Twitter only to publicize the protests that are already underway .
The events in Moldova fell somewhere in between : a flashmob that , rather unexpectedly , grew into a mini-revolution .
The events in Iran were part of an organized campaign by the Moussavi camp and , as such , were probably carefully planned offline by a handful of Moussavi ’s top aides who spread the word using tools they learned as young revolutionaries in 1979 .
Leaflets , posters , and even fax machines can still be very effective organizing tools , precisely because they are not dependent on the Internet — which , as Iranians found out during the protests , can suffer from unbearable slowness or equally unbearable censorship .
Twitter was instrumental as a publicity tool , but played little role in instigating or coordinating the protests .
" Twitter is replacing blogging . "
Not quite .
Twitter is surely taking over many of the niches previously reserved for blogging : simple link - sharing , for one .
It also seems much better positioned to allow discussions of breaking news — checking multiple blogs takes an eternity compared with Twitter ’s instant flow of information .
But blogs still have a good chance of survival .
One - hundred - forty characters is not very much ; blogs could become a space for longer , more analytical writing , an ironic fate for a medium once mocked for its own brevity and shallowness .
The mainstream news media also continues to be suspicious of Twitter .
It took about five years to convince most newspapers and magazines that blogging was an acceptable medium for reporting news , and many are still catching up .
Twitter may take less time to sink in , but do n’t expect it to happen overnight .
The situation in the developing world is different , particularly in countries where blogging has n’t yet fully taken off or where zany platforms predominate that define what " blogging " is and how it ’s done .
Russians love LiveJournal , Brazilians love Orkut , and the Chinese love QQ ; for them , these sites offer a platform not only for blogging , but also for social networking , instant messaging , and other online distractions .
Thus , even if they do find Twitter very appealing , their primary digital life happens on other platforms .
On the other hand , the proliferation of the mobile Internet in Africa might cause millions of new Web users to skip the blogging stage altogether and jump straight to Twitter :
After all , it ’s hard to write an 800 - word essay on a cellphone keypad .
" Twitter does n’t have a business model and might go under soon . "
Do n’t worry .
First ,
Twitter is very addictive — and people are usually eager to pay to keep their addictions going .
Second , it ’s a great intelligence - gathering tool for news organizations , marketers , and even the CIA .
As with very good network , its value will rise as more members join .
There ’s still a need for better tools to make sense of all the data generated on Twitter — but this is not an insurmountable task .
Someone will eventually figure out how to unlock Twitter ’s data reservoirs for the wider public ( that is , the wider paying public ) .
Third , it still makes a very appealing acquisition target for Google , Yahoo , or Microsoft .
The problem is that none of them know how to keep its entrepreneurial spirit alive .
( Google already has a dismal record of killing similar companies by buying them .
Just look at Twitter ’s early , ill - fated competitor , Jaiku — or , actually , do n’t look . )
But this problem is n’t impossible to solve either .
Finally , the more we talk about " Twitter revolutions , " the more American diplomats and policymakers fall in love with the tool .
" Twitter diplomacy " might soon replace the expensive efforts of the struggling Broadcasting Board of Governors ( BBG ) .
So what that they would only get 140 characters to express the American position on a given subject ?
Stripping these messages of the legalese would only add to their appeal , while helping to tap into the otherwise ADD - ed minds of the " digital natives " who might never have heard the radio broadcast of BBG ’s Voice of America because they do n’t know what radio is .
And given how much U.S. government money has spent to bolster the BBG , even buying Twitter outright would look like a rounding mistake .
" Twitter is brimming with spammers , impostors , and just plain crazy people . "
Sure .
But that ’s also true of the Internet as a whole , and it does n’t stop us from using it .
Compared to e-mail , Twitter spam does n’t really look that menacing , and its administrators are beginning to crack down on those who abuse the system to push sex , drugs , and rock ‘ n ’ roll on unsuspecting tweeters .
Impostors are indeed in vast supply .
For instance , I suspect that the funny " Slavoj Zizek " that I am following on Twitter is not really the radical Slovenian philosopher .
But this endless guesswork only makes it more fun .
Twitter is a very curious universe in which even impostors add value , as long as they share cool and interesting links .
( Would the real Zizek have turned me on to the marvelous site " White People Who Study Hegel ? " )
The proliferation of impostors might even present Twitter with an actual business model , something it lacks at the moment : charging celebrities for authenticating their accounts and displaying a proud " I ’ve been authenticated " badge .
Successful companies have been built on less .
" Twitter conversations are shallow and serious people should avoid it . "
Who cares ?
Obviously , Twitter is not the letters section of the New York Review of Books .
Those looking for deep , long , insightful conversations should n’t bother .
But what attracts so many smart people to Twitter is a chance to follow what other smart people are reading and browsing — and to do so in real time .
What " Twitter virgins " do not understand is that Twitter actually facilitates the discovery of all those long and uber - insightful conversations that are happening elsewhere .
As a discovery tool that works for everyone , it beats everything else out there , from syndication services like Delicious and RSS to aggregator blogs like Kottke and BoingBoing .
In the Twitter universe , you are what you follow — so if you find Twitter boring , you ’re probably following the wrong people .
Figuring out how to sift through all the noise and actually get hold of signal can be a challenging task , of course , requiring time and a fair amount of tinkering .
But ultimately it pays off .
A carefully maintained Twitter feed can deliver you information that is far more diverse and interesting than it was in the pre-Twitter days .
One - hundred - forty characters are more than enough to describe a link or express one idea .
So far , Twitter ’s influence on global politics is still very marginal ; while it helps to draw public attention to otherwise overlooked problems and places , this will stop as soon as the media discovers yet another digital darling .
But despite what you may hear from the overly conservative naysayers , Twitter ’s cultural impact is far greater .
We may currently be at the very dawn of the era of Twitter Renaissance .
Avoid it at your own peril .

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith has apologised in the House of Commons for breaching expenses rules .
She designated her sister 's house in London , which she shares , as her " main home " and then claimed second home allowances on her Redditch family home .
A standards inquiry found that she " wrongly " designated her home but had followed officials ' advice at the time .
Ms Smith said she accepted the findings and apologised to the Commons and to her constituents .
She will not have to repay any money as the standards committee ruled that " no further action " be taken .
The report was published on the same day hundreds of MPs have been receiving letters from Sir Thomas Legg , a former civil servant who has been carrying out an audit of all second homes expense claims made since 2004 .
' Shared home '
The six - month inquiry into Ms Smith by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards , John Lyon , was responding to two complaints - one that she had wrongly designated the London house belonging to her sister , at which she paid rent , as her main home .
The second related to the revelation that Ms Smith had claimed for pay - per - view films on her second homes allowance .
In the report Mr Lyon upheld both complaints and recommended Ms Smith apologise to the House of Commons for the home designation .
It said under previous rules she had been required to designate her London residence as her main home when she became a minister in July 1999 .
Those rules changed in 2004 but Ms Smith left the London house - where she paid rent for sole use of a room and " shared use of the rest of the house " - as her designated " main home " .
She should have exercised the discretion given in the rules to identify the residence she shared with her family in her constituency as her main home
Standards report
She argued that as a busy minister she spent more time in London .
In June 2007 she sought confirmation from Commons officials that that was reasonable , given that her family was in Redditch but she spent most of her time in Westminster - and was told they agreed with her .
But the commissioner said that advice was " flawed " and Ms Smith could " have taken a broader view of her situation than she did " and taken into account the number of nights she spent at both properties .
That may have led her to conclude " that her main home , in the sense that most people understand the term , was the house that she shared with her family " .
' Gravitational pull '
The definition of the main home of an MP is normally determined by where they spend the most nights .
Police evidence suggested that between 28 June 2007 and 31 March 2008 Ms Smith spent 26 more nights in Redditch than in London - her account had suggested it was only two .
Mr Lyon found she " should have identified her constituency home as her main home throughout the period covered by the complaint " .
While he found her London home was " more than some sort of temporary room in a stranger 's house " he concluded : " The gravitational pull in terms of family and property is , on the basis of all the evidence I have seen , Redditch and not London . "
I am disappointed that this process has not led to a fairer set of conclusions

The Commons standards and privileges committee , which published the report , said the fact Ms Smith had sought and acted in accordance with advice from the House of Commons authorities was " a significant mitigating circumstance " .
It also said it could not be established whether the taxpayer " is any worse or any better off " as a result of the way Ms Smith claimed her second homes expenses and recommended " no further action " be taken .
Ms Smith 's husband 's claim for an adult film was much reported at the time and was described by Ms Smith as " intensely embarrassing " .
But Mr Lyon said MPs must be careful that they only claim for the " minimum package " of TV services required for their Parliamentary duties .
' Subjective judgements '
It found she had made five claims over eight months for films and sporting events " over the basic subscription " and had not checked the documentation submitted in support of her claims .
Mr Lyon said " she clearly did not treat her claims with the care expected of all those who look for reimbursement from the public purse " .
But it was accepted that she had paid back " a sum in excess " of the amount wrongly claimed and had apologised so they recommended no further action be taken .
In a written response to the inquiry Ms Smith said she was " disappointed that this process has not led to a fairer set of conclusions , based on objective and consistent application of the rules as they were at the time " .
She said the report " appears to be heavily influenced by subjective judgements about my personal circumstances " and said commissioner 's judgement differed from that of the Commons resources office " which advises members on how to comply with the rules " .
In her statement to the Commons later she said Ms Smith told MPs she apologised " unreservedly " for claiming for pay - per - view films - money she has already paid and said was a mistake .
On the issue of her second home designation she said she was pleased it was recognised that her London home " was indeed a home " and said she had spent more nights in London than Redditch " for three of the four years in question " .
" I have never flipped my designation and I only own one home .
The committee recognised that there 's no evidence that the taxpayer would be any worse or any better off as a result of me having made a different decision . "
But she said : " I accept the committee 's conclusion and I therefore apologise to the House . "

Hace unos días , una lectora me contactó vía correo electrónico .
Ella está pensando en contratar un seguro de gastos médicos mayores e incluso contactó de manera directa a cuatro aseguradoras , aunque sólo recibió respuesta de una .
Ella encuentra la prima demasiado onerosa con respecto a su salario y me pregunta si no le convendría mejor una afiliación voluntaria al seguro de salud del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , que conlleva una prima más económica .
Ella tiene conflicto porque ha leído que la atención no siempre es de la mejor calidad y me pide mi opinión .
Pues bien , la verdad es que depende mucho de las cosas .
Hay personas que están muy contentas con la atención que reciben por el IMSS .
Esa institución cuenta con médicos y personal de mucha calidad , pero es cierto , a veces hay que hacer colas o incluso esperar turno para cierto tipo de intervenciones , o bien , para ser referido con un especialista .
Pero también es cierto que otras personas , si pueden , prefieren tener acceso a medicina privada , pero dentro de ésta hay distintas calidades , no sólo de instituciones de salud sino también los médicos a los que uno puede acudir .
Entonces hay que saber elegir , porque los costos varían mucho entre médicos e instituciones .
Por eso , uno encuentra en el mercado una amplia variedad de oferta de seguros de gastos médicos , cuyos costos dependen de la red de hospitales a las que uno quiere tener acceso así como de los honorarios que cobran los médicos a los que uno suele acudir ( hay compañías que tienen hasta nueve tabuladores médicos distintos ) .
La prima que uno paga depende en gran medida de estas variables ( así como el deducible que uno quiere asumir ) .
Es muy importante elegir bien , porque si el médico al que uno acude no está en la red de la aseguradora , la misma indemnizará según el tabulador elegido .
Si el médico cobra más , el asegurado se tendría que hacer cargo de la diferencia .
Peor aún , si uno se atiende fuera de la red de prestadores que tienen convenio con la aseguradora , la misma no puede hacer un pago directo .
En otras palabras , uno tendría que pagar de su bolsa y luego reclamar para obtener la indemnización a la que tiene derecho , según la póliza de seguros que uno contrató .
Como podemos ver , no es nada fácil .
Por eso mismo , contratar un seguro de gastos médicos no es tan fácil como ir a una página de internet o pedir informes a una aseguradora .
Se requiere , en la mayoría de los casos , asesoría personalizada de un buen agente de seguros que se enfoque en conocer nuestras necesidades y luego recomendarnos el producto que más se adecue a ellas .
Enfatizo : un buen agente es aquel que entiende que su principal labor es asesorar , no vender .
Cuando asesora bien al cliente , la venta viene por consecuencia .
Si un agente te habla más de productos que de tus propias necesidades , si no se enfoca en entenderlas bien , no es un buen asesor y debes buscar otro .
También es importante tomar en cuenta conceptos que confunden mucho a la gente .
Las compañías de seguros , en general , no cubren preexistencias ( enfermedades por las cuales uno ya fue diagnosticado o por las cuales uno ya presentaba síntomas ) .
Si uno las declara , la compañía puede analizar la posibilidad de cubrirlas de manera especial ( usualmente con una prima adicional y limitando el alcance de la cobertura ) .
Esto significa que uno no se puede cambiar de aseguradora si ya tiene — o tuvo — una enfermedad importante .
La gente piensa que sí , porque existe otro concepto que se llama “ reconocimiento de antigüedad ” .
Eso no implica que se cubran las enfermedades que uno declaró a la aseguradora anterior .
Se refiere simplemente a la eliminación de ciertos periodos de espera que tiene la póliza de seguros ( no todos , por eso hay que leer y entender bien ) .
Otro tema importante que se debe considerar es el deducible .
A mayor deducible , la prima puede bajar de forma considerable .
Hay que pedir las cotizaciones con diferentes niveles de deducible , para buscar hacer una contratación de manera óptima .
Es más importante tener una cobertura más amplia que un deducible menor , porque la idea es que el seguro opere precisamente cuando más lo necesitamos .
Finalmente , hay que tomar en cuenta que la prima de los seguros de gastos médicos mayores se incrementa con la edad , de manera significativa .
Es otro factor que debemos tomar en cuenta y por eso mismo es importante no contratar un seguro que represente un gran sacrificio en nuestras finanzas personales y que más adelante no podamos conservar .

Inquiring minds are noting that Foreclosures Grow in Housing Market 's Top Tiers .
About 30 % of foreclosures in June involved homes in the top third of local housing values , up from 16 % when the foreclosure crisis began three years ago , according to new data from real - estate Web site Zillow.com .
The bottom one - third of housing markets , by home value , now account for 35 % of foreclosures , down from 55 % in 2006 .
The Zillow research compared homes against the median values for their local market and broke each market into three tiers by value .
Zillow then looked at the share of monthly foreclosures in each tier over the past decade .
Default rates are particularly high and expected to rise on option adjustable - rate mortgages , which allow borrowers to make minimum payments that may not cover the interest due .
Monthly payments can increase to sharply higher levels after five years or when the outstanding balance reaches a certain level .
A study by Fitch Ratings found that 46 % of option ARMs were 30 days past due last month , even though just 12 % of such loans have reset to higher monthly payments .
Zillow estimated that nearly one in four homes with mortgages was worth less than the value of the property at the end of June .
Mr. Humphries said he did n't expect to see foreclosure volumes level off until later in 2010 .
Mad Scramble To Avoid Foreclosure Begins
Bank of America employees are reminded every day of how far they still have to go .
Just outside the elevators of their vast third - floor command center , attached to the wall , is a cardboard thermometer that shows them inching toward their goal of signing up 125,000 struggling borrowers for a federal program to modify their mortgages .
The company faces many of the same challenges as other major lenders addressing the foreclosure crisis .
But with weeks remaining to meet the November deadline set by the Obama administration , Bank of America is trailing well behind the other large banks , according to Treasury Department data .
The company 's effort has been hamstrung by a staff shortage and by adapting its computer systems and even fax machines to the scale of the program , which began in March .
The company was also slow out of the box because it initially took a more conservative approach than some other banks , requiring that borrowers document their income and complete other paperwork before granting preliminary approval for a modification .
In August , Bank of America softened the requirement and began authorizing some modifications without getting all the documents first .
Adding to borrowers ' difficulties was a letter sent this summer by Bank of America that mistakenly informed some of them that they did not qualify for the administration 's foreclosure - prevention program because their loans were not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac , the government - controlled mortgage giants .
" Bank of America is not actively participating in this program , " the bank wrote to some borrowers , according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Washington Post .
Under the Making Home Affordable program , lenders are paid with taxpayer funds to reduce borrowers ' mortgage payments by lowering their interest rates , for example , or by extending the terms of their loans
A progress report released last week by the Treasury Department showed that only 11 percent ( about 95,000 ) of Bank of America 's delinquent borrowers who were potentially eligible for the program had been given a loan modification .
That compares with 27 percent , or 117,000 , for J.P. Morgan Chase , and 33 percent , or 68,000 , at Citigroup , the Treasury reported .
The figure for Saxon Mortgage Services , which is owned by Morgan Stanley , is 41 percent , or 32,000 .
Many of the 62 other mortgage lenders participating in the government program have also ramped up , industry officials said .
Wells Fargo reported that call volume tripled after the program was announced in February , prompting the company to hire an additional 5,800 employees to address loan modifications this year .
Citigroup increased its loss -mitigation department from 450 employees in early 2008 to more than 4,000 .
J.P. Morgan
Chase switched from a paper fax system to an electronic one to handle the volume of documents being submitted by borrowers .
Even after top
Treasury officials called in industry leaders for a series of meetings on the program in July , chastising them for their poor progress , the foreclosure crisis continues to worsen .
Borrowers are becoming delinquent on their mortgages at record rates , and rising unemployment rates are exacerbating the problem , economists say .
Already , 4.4 million borrowers have lost their home since the mortgage crisis began in 2007 , and another 2 million will this year , according to Moody 's Economy.com .
Bank of America and other lenders have a lot riding on the foreclosure prevention program .
The company stands to collect about $ 6 billion -- some of which will be passed on to investors -- of the $ 75 billion the administration has set aside for the Making Home Affordable program .
At the same time , the banking industry faces a threat from senior Democrats in Congress who may revive legislation allowing bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages if more is not done to help borrowers .
Last week , Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) introduced a bill allowing a borrower to fight a foreclosure in court by arguing that the lender did not offer a loan modification .
Hopeless Mess
Two Key Problems
Without jobs , many of the modification participants cannot afford to make any payment .
Of those who can afford payments are a class of people whose best interest is to walk away regardless .

In the last decade , the proportion of original screenplays produced within the UK film industry has declined significantly compared with adaptations , sequels and remakes - a trend reflected in the US studio system .
Is this inevitable ?
Are UK screenwriters incapable of creating successful original films ?
The UK film industry over the last decadehas shunned original ideas , and new screenwriters , in favour of ‘ safer ’ bets
Major UK films of the 1990s such as Four Weddings And A Funeral , The Full Monty , Shallow Grave and Shakespeare In Love were all original works , and all but the last one were from first - time feature film screenwriters .
So , why has there been such a decrease in backing for new screenwriters with original ideas ?
The answer lies in the development culture that has grown within the UK film industry over the last decade - a culture in which original ideas , and new screenwriters , are shunned in favour of ‘ safer ’ bets : true stories , adaptations and new writer - directors .
In the early - 1990s the UK film industry was described as a cottage industry but in truth it was closer to a bunch of , often inexperienced , individuals desperate to make a film , any film .
This all changed at the end of the 1990s with the government and the City backing UK talent into production .
The result has beena production explosion , with an average of more than 100 films a year since 2000 achieving theatrical distribution .
Alongside this , more than $ 165 m ( £ 100 m ) was spent on development anda new generation of untrained , inexperienced development executives , readers and new producers suddenly found themselves making UK films .
However , the box - office share of UK independent productions in the same period did not increase substantially .
When the majority of the larger UK - based film companies were asked why this was the case , their answer was , “ Development does not work . ”
This was based on the simple fact that the massive increase in development spending had not produced more successful films .
The rapid growth of production had not been matched with a supply of good , if not great , screenplays .
This failure of development was put down to spending too much on new talent .
However , no - one seemed to question whether the money had been spent on , or by , people who actually knew howto develop feature films , and it should be noted that the vast majority of new talents were not new writers , but new writer - directors .
Some may put this situation down to writers not being ableto match the demands of filmbut ultimately the answer lies elsewhere - with the new generation of producers and development personnel .
Their inexperience and the wealth of opportunities , in contrast to what was availablein the 1990s , created a culturein which people realised theydid not need a good screenplayto make a film .
This generation has created a culture based on simplistic notions of screenwriting and development theory learnt on script - guru weekends and driven by producers , and directors who know that cast and / or budget , sometimes just a saleable idea , are the key to getting a film funded , not the quality of the screenplay .
Writers were frozen out , writer - directors ( more than 300 ) were ultimately treated as expendable talent , and too many poor films were , and are , made .
If this culture continues , the UK film industry will remain dependent on adaptations , true stories or remakes .
The lack of originality could force up - and - coming screenwriters to work in TV or migrate to other countries instead of working in the UK .
The Screenwriters Festival is one place where this culture is being challenged .
It is where a new generation of original screenwriters meet with producers and financiers who see the commercial potentialof backing new original screenwriting .
This annual meeting will take place in October and could be where the next Four Weddings or Full Monty are born - and the 2010s see a rebirth of original UK screen hits .
The Screenwriters Festival runs in Cheltenham , UK , from October 26 - 29 .
Commentary , Norman Podhoretz ’s work home for almost 60 years , describes its former editor ( he held the position from 1960 to 1995 ) as a “ venerable lion of disputation . ”
The disputatious lion is famous for , among other things , his political migration from left to right in the late 1960s , and his subsequent championing of the neoconservative cause , along with his wife , Midge Decter , son John , son - in - law Elliott Abrams , fellow travelers such as Jeane Kirkpatrick , and organizations like the Committee for the Present Danger and Project for a New American Century , in addition , of course , to the pages of Commentary .
Podhoretz has just published a new book , Why Are Jews Liberals ? , in which he asks , in essence , why have n’t more Jews made the same exodus from the Democrats to the Republicans , like I did ?
According to Commentary , Podhoretz wrote the book to try to address “ the question he says he is asked more frequently than any other by his fellow conservatives . ”
In a dispassionate effort to answer the question honestly , Podhoretz traverses the history of the Jewish people , from the Romans through the evolving views of the Catholic Church and Christianity in general , the Enlightenment , the rise of 19th - century nationalism , and the totalitarian calamities of the 20th century .
He demonstrates that throughout the past two millennia , the scattered Diaspora found its only succor and support from universalist ideas that , because of their universalism , were placed on the port side of the ideological divide .
It is for this reason , he argues , that American Jews have been the only definable well - to - do cohort over the past 40 years that has not moved to the Right , even though the evolution of the American Right has been in a frankly philo - Semitic direction — and among whose ranks come the most ardent non-Jewish supporters of the state of Israel in the world .
That description is from the magazine ’s September issue , in which it asked “ six notable American Jewish thinkers ” to write about the question Podhoretz ’s book poses .
“ Why do Jews remain liberals ? , ” asks William Kristol , one of the respondents .
“ God only knows . ”
Why has He chosen to allow Jews to stay mindlessly attached to a liberalism that is no longer beneficial or sympathetic to them ?
Why has He chosen to harden Jewish hearts against a conservatism increasingly welcoming to Jews and supportive of the Jewish state ?
Perhaps there are some questions that simply can’t be answered by unassisted human reason .
Norman Podhoretz has made a valiant attempt to answer these questions .
But at the end of the day , and at the end of his fascinating and illuminating book , one is left still shaking one ’s head .
Indeed , Norman is left shaking his head , first at the fact that “ liberalism has become the religion of American Jews ” and then at the further fact that “ they can remain loyal to it even though it conflicts in substance with the Torah of Judaism at so many points , and even though it is also at variance with the most basic of all Jewish interests — the survival of the Jewish people . ”
Another respondent , Jonathan Sarna , writes :
[ Podhoretz ] shows . . . how he personally shifted his politics in the face of new political realities , and he wonders why the majority of his fellow Jews failed to follow his lead .
Blacks , after all , now vote overwhelmingly Democratic , having long since abandoned the politics of their ( Republican ) past .
Jews , meanwhile , still largely vote the way their grandparents did .
The answer , for Podhoretz , lies in religion .
Liberalism , he argues , “ is not , as has often been said , merely a necessary component of Jewishness : it is the very essence of being a Jew .
Nor is it a ‘ substitute for religion , ’ it is a religion in its own right , complete with its own catechism and its own dogmas and . . . obdurately resistant to facts that undermine its claims and promises . ”
Jewish liberalism endures , Podhoretz concludes , because turning conservative , in liberal eyes , is nothing short of heresy — or worse , apostasy .
Michael Medved says that “ for most American Jews , the core of their Jewish identity is n’t solidarity with Israel ; it ’s rejection of Christianity . ”
This observation may help to explain the otherwise puzzling political preferences of the Jewish community explored in Norman Podhoretz ’s book .
Jewish voters do n’t embrace candidates based on their support for the state of Israel as much as they passionately oppose candidates based on their identification with Christianity — especially the fervent evangelicalism of the dreaded “ Christian Right . ” . . .
Those who seek to liberate the bulk of American Jews from their reflexive and self - defeating liberalism must do more than show the logic of conservative thinking .
They should recognize that Jews , like all Americans , vote not so much in favor of politicians they admire as they vote against causes and factions they loathe and fear .
Jews fear the GOP as the “ Christian party , ” and as the sole basis of Jewish identity involves rejection of Christianity , Jews will continue to reject - Republicans and conservatism .
Podhoretz poignantly describes the way many Jewish Americans have adopted liberalism as a substitute religion .
A more positive , engaged attitude with our real religious tradition would lessen the resentment toward religious Christians and , in an era when even Albania , Moldova , and Iraq have built functioning multiparty democracies , introduce for the first time in nearly a century a true two - party system to the Jewish community .
Ron Rosenbaum , writing at his own site , offers his own answer to “ why this Jew is liberal ( but no longer left ) , ” though first , as is his wont , he digresses :
First of all , I should disqualify myself to some extent .
I ’m not an observant Jew , I do n’t regard the Bible as the word of God , I ’m an agnostic about the existence of God .
So some may say I do n’t have a place in this conversation .
But Isaac Bashevis Singer was an agnostic , you gonna say he ’s not a Jew ?
I ’m a Jew like he ’s a Jew , forever arguing about what it means to be a Jew , forever arguing with a God you ’re not sure exists .
I feel Jewish , I certainly am identifiably Jewish , and I have expressed myself on the subject of Jews changing their names .
I feel an unshakeable identity with Jews and Jewish culture , have explored the source of the Holocaust in one book ( Explaining Hitler ) and have edited an anthology about the current threat of anti-Semitism ( Those Who Forget the Past ) .
Having worked through all that , Rosenbaum goes on to identify the source of his liberalism :
I consider myself both a Jew and a liberal and if I had to name one factor that would make it so , it was the Civil Rights movement of the ’60s .
. . .
For we were slaves in Egypt once , right ?
How could we not be at the forefront of protests against racist former slave - state sponsored segregation in the South and racism in the North ?
I saw conservatives and Republicans staunchly opposed to anti-segregation legislation and anti-racist movements .
I still see conservatives and Republicans still unashamedly profiting electorally from the racism - lite “ Southern strategy . ” I was glad to read of William F. Buckley Jr. expressing regret for the anti-civil rights stance of the early National Review , but I do n’t hear of many other conservatives expressing regret that their movement stood in solidarity with racists and continues to profit from Southern strategy racism .
. . .
I wo n’t say that it is n’t difficult , that there are n’t contradictions with being Jewish and liberal , but I ’d rather associate my political orientation with those who supported the Civil Rights movement than with those who have yet to repudiate the racism behind the Southern strategy .
Some have .
Talk to me about conservatism when more do .
At his site , Robert Stacy McCain says of all the six participants in Commentary ’s forum , Michael Medved “ nailed it . ”
The demonization of the “ Religious Right ” was a project developed by Norman Lear and others during the Reagan era , after Jerry Falwell ’s Moral Majority played such a key role in the 1980 election , and this theme has defined the politics of the Democratic Party ever since .
As a political tactic , it is both amazingly effective and fundamentally false .
The Republican Party is chiefly devoted to political policies having nothing specifically to do with evangelical Christianity .
Yet there is an entire industry of liberal propagandists who specialize in seeking out various outre pronouncements of “ Religious Right ” leaders and presenting these views as if they would become firm policy in the next Republican administration .
. . .
Depicting the “ Christian Right ” as an especially benighted and menacing component of the Republican Party has , as Medved notes , a particular value in discouraging Jewish Democrats from reconsidering their political loyalties .
To any liberal , the conservative is always the Other .
But by depicting the GOP as dominated by the “ Christian Right , ” the Otherness of conservatism is effectively doubled — if not , indeed , magnified exponentially .
McCain goes on to discuss what he sees as a relevant factor — the “ town - and - country divide in American politics . ”
Although the trend to suburbanization has somewhat ameliorated this generalization , most American Jews are fundamentally urban in their orientation , while most American conservatives are fundamentally rural .
Think of Reagan , riding horses and clearing brush at his ranch — it is an image that appeals to the “ country ” side of the town - and - country divide , embodying as it does the antique ideal of the American frontier homesteader .
This “ rugged individual ” ideal , the self - sufficient property owner zealously guarding his freedom , is intrinsic to what American conservatism is all about , and it is an ideal quite alien to the urban lifestyle .
The city - dweller is inherently dependent on public services .
He does n’t draw his water from a well , does n’t go out with a chain - saw to supply firewood for the winter , does n’t augment the grocery budget by hunting deer or growing his vegetables .
Which brings McCain to a suggestion :
If Messrs .
Podhorhetz , et al. , wish to promote conservatism among American Jews , let them find some way to encourage Jewish families to move to small towns in the Heartland , where their kids can grow up hunting , fishing and hot - rodding the backroads .
A guy with a gun rack in the back window of his four - wheel drive truck may occasionally vote Democrat , but he ’s extremely unlikely to be an out - and - out liberal .
“ Maybe I ’m too touchy about this , ” responds blogger DougJ at Balloon Juice , “ but I ’m profoundly disturbed by the idea of relocating intellectuals , especially Jewish intellectuals , so they can learn about real values .
Is n’t that exactly what Stalin and Mao did ?
Is there any Maoist / Stalinist / Leninist idea that the American right has n’t embraced ? ”
Writing at Vanity Fair , James Wolcott is not so taken with McCain ’s idea either : “ This loose - hinged proposal does carry a dank odor of Nazi / Stalinist / Red Chinese population removal / reducation programs ( with the unpleasant suggestion that real values are rooted in the soil , the higher forms of intellect prone to decadence ) . ”
Buses with ultracapacitors stop at recharging stations , which double as bus stops , to recharge in less than a minute .
Image credit : Sinautec .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A fleet of 17 buses near Shanghai has been running on ultracapacitors for the past three years , and today that technology is coming to the Washington , DC , for a one - day demonstration .
Chinese company Shanghai Aowei Technology Development Company , along with its US partner Sinautec Automobile Technologies , predict that this approach will provide an inexpensive and energy efficient way to power city buses in the near future .
The biggest advantage of ultracapacitors is that they can fully recharge in less than a minute , unlike lithium - ion batteries which can take several hours .
The downside of ultracapacitors is that they currently have a very short range , providing a distance of only a few miles , due to the fact that ultracapacitors can store only about 5 % of the energy that lithium - ion batteries can hold .
Although their short range makes ultracapacitors impractical for cars , city buses have to stop frequently anyway .
By quickly recharging at bus stops , buses could take advantage of ultracapacitors ' other benefits : a bus with ultracapacitors uses 40 % less electricity compared to an electric bus with lithium - ion batteries , and requires just one - tenth the energy cost of a typical diesel - fueled bus , which would save about $ 200,000 during the life of the vehicle .
Plus , the buses are environmentally friendly : " Even if you use the dirtiest coal plant on the planet , it generates a third of the carbon dioxide of diesel when used to charge an ultracapacitor , " said Dan Ye of Sinautec .
Today 's demonstration will take place at American University in Washington , DC , where an 11 - seat minibus powered by ultracapacitors will be shuttling people around campus .
At designated charging stations , which double as bus stops , the bus recharges by raising a collector on top of the bus a few feet to touch an overhead electric charging line , which recharges ultracapacitor banks stored under the bus seats .
The two companies hope that this is just the beginning for ultracapacitor buses .
The company that makes the Shanghai buses , Foton America Bus Co , based in Tennessee , plans to deliver another 60 buses to the Chinese city in early 2010 .
The new buses will have ultracapacitors manufactured by Shanghai Aowei that supply 10 - watt hours per kilogram , compared with the current ultracapacitors that have an energy density of six watt - hours per kilogram .
Other US cities , including New York City , Chicago , and some towns in Florida , have also expressed interest in trialing the buses .
The companies expect that the ultracapacitors will continue to achieve higher energy densities in the future , which would allow them to hold a charge for longer .
This improvement could increase the driving range from a few miles to 20 miles or more , helping to decrease the number of charging stations required on a route and make the technology practical for many more cities and bus routes .

If you 're like me , the lack of computing power in your T - shirt causes constant problems .
Well , thanks to the guys over at Xerox , you 'll never have to worry about a jacket that can't run Windows 7 ever again .
The company has just announced a new process for creating an ink that doubles as a circuit , paving the way for ubiquitous computing through printable electronics .
Amazon has boosted the battery life of its Kindle e-reader and added native support for PDF documents , and you do n't even have to buy new hardware to get the benefits .
The retailer says it made the battery improvements through a firmware upgrade that took six months to develop .
As a result , Amazon claims that Kindles will get an 85 percent boost in battery life , lasting seven days with wireless turned on compared to four days previously .
With wireless turned off , the Kindle will last up to two weeks on a charge , same as before .
Native PDF support will allow users to transfer files via USB or e-mail them to their " @kindle.com " e-mail addresses .
PDFs can also be converted to the Kindle format by including " Convert " in the subject line of the e-mail .
Amazon says the improvements will be delivered through an automatic firmware update for all users of the latest - generation Kindle .
Owners of " some earlier versions of Kindle " ( the first - generation model , presumably ) will get PDF support , but not the boosted battery life .
It 's easy to see the firmware update as a counter - attack against Sony 's Readers and Barnes & Noble 's Nook .
The nook lasts for 10 days with Wi -Fi turned off , but if you turn it on , you 'll need to charge the reader after two days of use .
Sony 's Reader Pocket and Touch editions last two weeks on a charge , but there 's no battery - draining Wi -Fi .
The flagship Sony Reader Daily Edition reigns with a week of life on Wi-Fi and two and a half weeks without , but it also costs significantly more than the competition , at $ 399 compared to $ 259 for both the Nook and the Kindle .
Amazon 's gaining an advantage in the battery wars , giving the company a selling point for the Kindle 's existing hardware .
It 's not known whether a new Kindle is in the works , but with the touch screens found in the Nook and Reader Daily , an upgrade seems inevitable .
For now , the competition may be a wash anyway , as Barnes & Noble is sold out of the Nook through the new year , and Sony says it can't guarantee shipments of the Reader Daily Edition by Christmas , but the Kindle 's improvements will at least help convince buyers that they 're getting or giving the superior product .

Centuries ago in another land far away , a war was fought between two rulers of a tiger - like race .
Their names are long forgotten , but their memory lives on in this game of strategy and cunning !
Tora ( TM ) is a classical style board game done in the same vein as chess , chinese chess or checkers , whose purpose is to raise money for ecological concerns .
TORA is a classical strategy board game and was created by Kevin Conner .
There are two major variations of playing fields :
The Long Board ( 17×17 grid or checker )
The Short Board ( 9×9 grid or checker )
With minor variations depending on terrain .
It is the goal of Ninja Nezumi Productions , L.L.C. , to make Tora known world wide .
Already , Tora is prepped and ready in 7 different languages :
English
Japanese
Spanish
German
Russian
French
Chinese
It is named TORA after the word for Tiger , and it is meant to raise awareness of the vanishing great cats .
A portion of the TORA Board Game sales , will be directed toward either saving this great species , or to supporting other ecological concerns of various areas .

FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers HASLETT , Mich .
( AP )  Divine intervention ?
Or just plain luck ?
No matter what the circumstances , a Michigan church is $ 70,000 richer courtesy of the Michigan Lottery .
FAITH & REASON : Can you bank on belief -- literally ?
The Covenant Life Worship Center and its 25 members in Haslett , Mich . had one of the second - prize tickets in the Lucky 7s raffle held May 4 .
The $ 10 ticket was purchased at a convenience store in Haslett , five miles northeast of downtown Lansing .
The lottery website says the odds of a single ticket winning $ 70,000 in Lucky 7s are one in 55,556 .
Michigan Lottery officials say the church will receive the full amount of the prize because it is a tax - exempt group .
Pastor Marilyn Parmelee tells the Lansing State Journal that the prize money will go toward the church building fund , setting up a missionary fund and supporting local community service projects .

The leader of the fifth - largest oil exporter in the world is warning his country ’s military and citizenry to prepare for war with Colombia and the United States , according to published reports .
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez issued his warning during a weekly radio address .
“ Let ’s not waste a day on our main aim : to prepare for war and to help the people prepare for war , because it is everyone ’s responsibility , ” he reportedly said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Chavez has repeatedly voiced deep fears of US encroachment in the region .
“ Students , revolutionaries , workers , women : all are ready to defend this sacred homeland called Venezuela , ” he continued , adding that the best way to “ avoid war is to prepare for it ” .
Relations between the neighbours were frozen in July after Colombia announced an agreement to lease the use of military bases to the United States .
“ Venezuela and Colombia share a 1,375 - mile ( 2,200 - km ) border and a volatile history , ” Reuters noted .
“ After both were freed from the Spanish by Venezuelan liberator Simon Bolivar in the 19th century , the two countries were the center of a short - lived nation known as Gran Colombia that also included Ecuador and Panama . ”
The wire service continued : “ Colombia ’s four - decade - old guerrilla conflict has for years spilled over the Venezuelan border , where kidnappings , contraband and drug trafficking are common .
Chavez ’s ideological closeness to Colombian FARC Marxist rebels has led Washington and Bogota to accuse him of supporting the guerrillas .
Chavez denies providing arms or logistical support to the rebels . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Chavez has in turn accused the Colombian military of making illegal , provocative incursions into Venezuela .
“ Colombian paramilitaries operating illegally in Venezuela ’s oil - rich border regions , together with the right - wing opposition in Venezuela , are the advance guard of imperialist plans to defeat the Bolivarian revolution , ” socialist publication Green Left opined .
The concern is not unfounded .
A recent Al Jazeera report which centered on a Colombian hitman in Venezuelan custody alleged that Chavez ’s main political opponent in the country , Manuel Rosales , had offered a $ 25 million bounty to anyone who could kill the socialist leader .
ADVERTISEMENT
Additionally , some American troops will soon find themselves stationed at military bases scattered across Colombia with a mission to use advanced Predator drone technology to aid in fighting the drug trade and to combat terrorism .
When the arrangement was announced in August , Chavez bristled then too , telling reporters that “ the winds of war [ are ] beginning to blow . ”
Bloomberg News added : “ The U.S. agreement with Colombia is part of an effort to ‘ strengthen and increase ties with countries in the region , ’ Robin Holzhauer , spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Caracas , said by telephone .
‘ We ’ve done that with governments who want to have partnerships with us . ’
Colombia has said the agreement would help combat drug trafficking . ”

During the summer of 2009 , Venezuela bought billions of dollars ’ worth of sophisticated fighter jets and tanks from its military ally Russia .
Venezuela ’s closest allies , Ecuador and Bolivia , back that stance .
“ As long as there are uniformed foreigners in a South American country , it ’s difficult for us to think there can be peace , ” Bolivian President Evo Morales reportedly said in August .

The launch of the Pirate Party in Australia adds yet another voice to the fast - growing global network of buccaneer politics : a pirate internationale appears to be taking shape .
In Australia , as elsewhere , the newly - formed Pirate Party will be campaigning on a platform of anti-internet censorship and the decriminalisation of non-commercial file - sharing .
It already has plans to elect a formal leadership next week , with nominations invited ( by 5 October ) for president , general secretary and treasurer along with deputies for each of these positions .
Party spokesman Brendan Molloy was quick to rebut allegations that the Pirate Party is a single - issue party , and inspired by those with a self - interest in file - sharing , claiming that far more important was the aim of the Pirate Party to " bolster our nation 's Democratic conventions " .
He went on : " We 're here to actively change the landscape of Australian politics forever , by advocating freer copyright and protection of our civil liberties , especially against [ Communications Minister Stephen ]
Conroy 's censorship regime , which is not welcome in Australia . "
In this sense , Pirate Parties in Australia and elsewhere in the world may be on to something .
El Reg reported earlier today on the Power 2010 initiative in the UK , which is a direct result of an investigation into the state of UK democracy , published in February 2006 .
This identified a growing gulf between governed and governing classes , with a sense that those in power do not listen , that the existing party political structures produce parties that are too similar , and the present political process excludes the voice of many ordinary voters .
A Westminster Hall debate by MPs who make up the Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee in the UK Parliament provides strong support for this point of view : what astounded then was not merely the degree of ignorance displayed by parliamentarians who were supposed to be specialists in topics relating to IT and new technology , but the sheer arrogance with which they displayed it .
In Australia , this divide has been given form by ham - fisted government attempts , led by Communications Minister Stephen Conroy , to implement blocking across the whole of the internet .
It is not merely the attempt to impose a single moral agenda on the whole of the Australian population that has caused uproar : it is also the sense among ordinary internet users that those in power really do not " get " the internet .
They do not understand how it works technologically or , more importantly , culturally .
The Australian Pirate Party has already signed up 550 members , which is sufficient to allow it to apply to register as a party with the Australian Electoral Commission .
However , this is just the first hurdle it needs to jump , and registration is not a foregone conclusion : in the case of the Australian Sex Party , objections on moral grounds held up the registration process for nearly a year .
The danger , within the Australian system , is that there are now three very distinct parties with overlapping agendas , all likely to be competing for the same core anti-establishment vote : the Green Party , the Sex Party and the Pirate Party .
Established politicians are likely to dismiss the last two as gimmicks – but they do so at their peril .
In the European elections this year , the Pirate Party gained seven per cent of the vote in Sweden – and Pirate Parties have now been formed in a number of other countries , including the UK .
If the Power 2010 analysis is right , then Pirate Parties are just the first wave of a growing grassroots revolt against established politics .
In the end , the Pirates may not win – but their role in smashing up an over - complacent political establishment will not be insignificant . ®

Can the White House now grasp this ?
In fact read this diary from Daily Kos and the utter frustration many have had from the messaging from this White House , which has been atrocious .
The disconnect is strictly from the D.C. Congress and the American Public .
If D.C. Democrats , at this time just FORGET THE REPUBLICANS , can not grasp this and do not pass a public option , then D.C. Democrats and the Obama White House are in trouble for 2010 going forward .
The American public did not vote Democrats and Obama into office for all of THIS .
Utter confusion , no message , no bill , side stepping the issue , we did not vote for this .
Democrats and President Obama , GET IT TOGETHER .
More than three out of every four Americans feel it is important to have a " choice " between a government - run health care insurance option and private coverage , according to a public opinion poll released on Thursday .
A new study by SurveyUSA puts support for a public option at a robust 77 percent , one percentage point higher than where it stood in June .
But the numbers tell another story , as well .
Earlier in the week , after pollsters for NBC dropped the word " choice " from their question on a public option , they found that only 43 percent of the public were in favor of " creating a public health care plan administered by the federal government that would compete directly with private health insurance companies . "
Opponents of the president 's agenda jumped on the findings as evidence that backing for the public option was dropping .
Proponents responded by arguing that NBC 's tinkering with the language of the question ( which it had also done in its July survey ) had contributed to the drop in favorability for a public plan .
SurveyUSA 's poll , which was commissioned by the progressive group MoveOn.org , a proponent of the public plan , gives credence to those critiques .
While arguments about what type of language best describe the public option persist - -" choice " is considered a trigger word that everyone naturally supports -- it seems clear that the framing of the provision goes a long way toward determining its popularity .
In asking its question SurveyUSA used the same exact words that NBC / Wall Street Journal had used when conducting its June 2009 survey .
That one that found 76 percent approval for the public option : " In any health care proposal , how important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance -- extremely important , quite important , not that important , or not at all important ? " read more here ...
So , what is all this mumbo- jumbo about from the Democrats ?
No one should be shocked that they will have to go this alone , without the Republican support .
Again , many hands are wringing , many are waiting and watching for this White House and Democrats to do the right thing .
Scientists said Thursday that a new AIDS vaccine , the first ever declared to protect a significant minority of humans against the disease , would be studied to answer two fundamental questions : why it worked in some people but not in others , and why those infected despite vaccination got no benefit at all .
The vaccine  known as RV 144 , a combination of two genetically engineered vaccines , neither of which had worked before in humans  was declared a qualified success after a six - year clinical trial on more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand .
Those who were vaccinated became infected at a rate nearly one - third lower than the others , the sponsors said Thursday morning .
“ I do n’t want to use a word like ‘ breakthrough , ’ but I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that this is a very important result , ” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which is one of the trial ’s backers .
“ For more than 20 years now , vaccine trials have essentially been failures , ” Dr. Fauci said .
“ Now it ’s like we were groping down an unlit path , and a door has been opened .
We can start asking some very important questions . ”
The pace of American combat deaths in Afghanistan has quickened anew as roadside bombs killed five U.S. troops in 24 hours in the same western province , the American military said Thursday .
The deaths bring to 11 the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan so far in August , on the heels of what was the worst month for Western and U.S. troop fatalities since the conflict began in 2001 .
Forty - three American military personnel died in July .
Violence has been surging in advance of Afghanistan ’s presidential and provincial assembly elections , which are two weeks away .
In addition to the troop fatalities , a total of 26 Afghans , most of them members of a wedding party , were reported killed in roadside bombings Thursday .
The U.S. deaths occurred in Farah province , bordering Iran , where a force consisting mainly of U.S. Marines staffs a string of small forward operating bases set deep in the desert .
They are connected by a route American forces have been struggling for months to keep free of roadside bombs , which have made travel extremely dangerous for villagers and military convoys alike .

One of the fatalities occurred Wednesday , and the other four , in a single incident , came Thursday , the U.S. military said .
Such “ clusters ” of fatalities are becoming less uncommon ; three American soldiers were killed over the weekend in a roadside bombing in the south .
Some American field commanders have said that more insurgents may be moving into Farah in response to a major U.S. - led offensive in Helmand province , to the east , which began in early July .
But insurgents had been tightening their grip on Farah even before the Helmand offensive .
Faced with a far stronger force of 4,000 Marines who have seized the lower Helmand River valley , insurgents have avoided a full - on battlefield confrontation , melting away into the countryside while redoubling their efforts to seed the roads with explosives .
The roadside bombings in Helmand on Thursday killed 21 members of a wedding party and five police officers , Afghan officials said .
The wedding - party blast also injured at least five other people , said Helmand ’s police chief , Asadullah Sherzad .

The roadside bomb that hit the wedding party was almost certainly aimed at coalition troops .
A tractor carrying the party , which included women and children , set off the buried bomb on a road in Garmser district , which Western troops have repeatedly tried to clear of insurgents .
Marines occupied the district for much of last year and returned last month with the current offensive .
Elsewhere in Helmand , a vehicle carrying Afghan police officers struck a roadside bomb in Nad Ali district , another insurgent stronghold .
Five officers were killed and three others injured , the Interior Ministry said in a statement .
Meanwhile , controversy erupted over allegations that a Western airstrike late Wednesday resulted in civilian deaths in Kandahar province , which borders Helmand .
Advertisement
The police chief in Zhari district said five farmers were killed as they loaded produce into a truck , preparing to take it to Kandahar city .
The U.S. military , however , said it was believed the five were loading the truck with munitions .
Navy Lt. Cmdr. Christine Sidenstricker , a U.S. military spokeswoman , said the incident would be investigated , including a review of cockpit video from the Apache attack helicopter that carried out the strike .
Civilian casualties are a point of major tension between Western forces and Afghan officials .
A United Nations report said noncombatant deaths rose nearly 25 % in the first half of 2009 , with about 60 % of them blamed on insurgents and most of the remainder on coalition forces .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ’s new secretary - general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , on a visit to Afghanistan , said at a news conference Wednesday in Kabul , the capital , that the alliance would do everything in its power to avoid causing civilian casualties .

The new commander of American and Western forces , U.S. Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , has also ordered field commanders to make safeguarding civilian lives their top priority .

Not a real diary but I wanted to let everyone know we will be watching and liveblogging this town hall tonight .
It starts at 7 pm est .
I know that seems like it should be the easiest thing in the world to do .
And you'd be perfectly entitled to wonder why " plus - size " models are so uncommon in magazines and other parts of the media to begin with .
I 'll try to answer a few of the questions you 've asked most :
What 's up with women like Lizzie Miller being called " plus - size , " anyway ?
As Genevieve Field writes in our November issue , most " plus - size " models actually are n't plus - size humans .
It 's one of the perversities of the modeling industry that women are moved into " plus " divisions once they 're anything larger than a six .
( They actually have to wear cutlets and padding to model plus - size clothing . )
Strange but true .
__
And why do n't you see more " plus " models in fashion stories ?__
Well , lots of reasons , but partly because the clothes are so flippin ' small .
The " samples " we borrow for shoots are generally cut to fit a size zero - to - four frame .
( If we just went out and bought bigger sizes from the store , those styles would be off the racks and unbuyable by the time you saw them in Glamour . )
Why do designers cut so tiny ?
Beats me , but Glamour plans to cheer on those who work with us in glamorizing women of all sizes from now on .
It 's not always easy for them :
When designer Mark Fast recently put three size 10 - ish models on his London runway last week ( all looking highly hot ) , two of his top creative people reportedly quit in protest .
Whatever !
Mark 's apparently going on to do a line for Topshop .
Happy ending .
Is showing larger - size women ... unhealthy ?
It 's a serious question : Amid the cheering for Lizzie Miller on glamour.com was a distinct strain of criticism from readers who worried the photo promoted obesity .
First things first : Lizzie 's not obese .
( At 180 and 5 ' 11 , she 's maybe a couple of pounds overweight . )
But more than that , I do n't buy that showing women in a variety of sizes will discourage heavier ones from maintaining a healthy weight .
Glamour assistant editor Margarita Bertsos -- who wrote about her own 75 - pound weight loss for Glamour - - said it best : " This photo in no way sends a message to me that I should quit taking care of my body ...
It has the complete opposite effect on me , reminding me to love myself , treat myself well ( and that INCLUDES a healthy diet and exercise ) , and showing me that I can and should smile in my nakedness and belly rolls , because I 'm worthy of that kind of that unabashed self - love right this second .
We all are ! "
Amen .
To be clear , I 'm not on the " real women have curves " bandwagon here , arguing that only bodies like Lizzie 's are " real " -- and that slender women are all unreal waifs who should just eat a cheeseburger and get over themselves .
Turning the tables so we can bash one type instead of another is n't the answer .
Celebrating the fact that we 're all born different is .
Think about it :
In real life , women of all shapes and sizes have crazy sex appeal and killer confidence .
Why should our own pages look any different ?
We 'll do our best to live up to this standard in the future : shooting models who diverge in every way from the cookie - cutter norm .
Is it a retreat from fantasy ?
Of course not :
If we wanted unadulterated reality , we could just print everyone 's driver 's - license picture .
But I happen to think that a fantasy every reader can have a piece of is the most powerful fantasy of all .
Thank you for encouraging us to try to provide it , and for pointing the way forward here .
Your words inspire me daily .
Now tell me , what did you think when you first saw the group photo above ?
And how much reality , and how much fantasy , do you want in a magazine , and from the media ?
PS : FYI , to those of you who took the time to contribute to my editor 's letter , a while back , thank you !
You 'll see some of your ( awesome ! ) comments in the November issue on newsstands next week .

The following excerpts are taken from Proudhon ‘s 1848 pamphlet , The Solution of the Social Problem .
Written shortly after the February 1848 French Revolution , before Proudhon ’s election to the National Assembly in June , these excerpts set forth Proudhon ’s critique of representative or parliamentary democracy .
Proudhon argued that the people cannot be represented , but must act for themselves .
He defined the “ ideal republic ” as “ an organization that leaves all opinions and all activities free .
In this republic , every citizen , by doing what he wishes and only what he wishes , participates directly in legislation and government , as he participates in the production and the circulation of wealth .
Here , every citizen is king ; for he has plenitude of power , he reigns and governs .
The ideal republic is a positive anarchy .
It is neither liberty subordinated to order , as in a constitutional monarchy , nor liberty imprisoned in order .
It is liberty free from all its shackles , superstitions , prejudices , sophistries , usury , authority ; it is reciprocal liberty and not limited liberty ; liberty not the daughter but the mother of order . ”
What Proudhon meant by this is made clear in subsequent works , such as The General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century ( 1851 ) , where he argued that government functions would be dissolved into industrial organization , a position similar to that later adopted by anarcho - syndicalists .
Heaven , listen ; Earth , lend an ear : the Lord has spoken !
Thus cried the prophets when , their eyes gleaming and mouths foaming , they proclaimed punishment to liars and apostates for their sins .
Thus spoke the Church in the middle ages , and mankind , prostrate with fear , crossed itself at the voice of the pontiff and the injunctions of his bishops .
Thus it was by turns with Moses , Elijah , John the Baptist , Mohammed , Luther , all the founders and reformers of religions , each new modification of dogma claiming to emanate from divine authority .
And always the masses of humanity were seen prostrating themselves at the name of the Most High , and receiving submissively the discipline of the bearers of revelation .
But finally a philosopher said to himself , if God has spoken , why have I heard nothing ?
This word of doubt sufficed to shake the Church , nullify the Scriptures , dissipate the faith , and hasten the reign of the Antichrist !
Like Hume , I do not want at all to prejudge either the reality or the possibility of a revelation : how can one reason a priori about a supernatural event , a manifestation of the Supreme Being ?
For me the issue is entirely one of the empirical knowledge of it that we can attain , and I reduce the religious controversy to this single point , the authenticity of the divine word .
Prove this authenticity , and I am a Christian .
Who then would dare dispute with God , if he were sure that it is God who speaks to him ?
It is the same with the People as with the Divinity : Vox populi , vox Dei .
Since the beginning of the world , since human tribes began to organize themselves into monarchies and republics , oscillating between the one idea and the other like wandering planets , mixing , combining in order to organize the most diverse elements into societies , overturning tribunes and thrones as a child upsets a house of cards , we have seen , at each political upheaval , the leaders of the movement invoke in more or less explicit terms the sovereignty of the People …
The most prominent spokesman of the Bourbon monarchists would tell us still , if it dared , that law results from the consent of the People and the enunciation of the prince :
Lex fit consensu populi et constitutione regis .
The sovereignty of the nation is the first principle of monarchists as of democrats .
Listen to the echo which reaches us from the North : on the one hand , there is a despotic king who invokes national traditions - that is , the will of the People expressed and confirmed over the centuries .
On the other , there are subjects in revolt who maintain that the People no longer think what they did formerly , and who ask that the People be consulted .
Who then shows here a better understanding of the People - the monarch who would have it that they are unchangeable in their thinking , or the citizens who suppose them changeable ?
And when you say the contradiction is resolved by progress , meaning that the People go through different phases before arriving at the same old idea , you only increase the difficulty : who will judge what is progress and what is retrogression ?
I ask then , like Rousseau :
If the People has spoken , why have I heard nothing ?
You point out to me this astonishing revolution in which I too have taken part - whose legitimacy I myself have proven , whose idea I have brought to the fore .
And you say to me :
There is the People !
But in the first place , I have seen only a tumultuous crowd without awareness of the ideas that made it act , without any comprehension of the revolution brought about by its hands .
Then what I have called the logic of the People could well be nothing but recognition of past events , all the more so since once it is all over and everyone agrees on their significance , opinions are divided anew as to the consequences .
The revolution over , the People says nothing !
What then !
Does the sovereignty of the People exist only for things in the past , which no longer interest us , and not at all for those of the future , which alone can be the objects of the People ’s decrees ?
Oh all you enemies of despotism and its corruption , as of anarchy and its piracy , who never cease invoking the People - you who speak frankly of its sovereign reason , its irresistible strength , its formidable voice , I bid you tell me :
Where and when have you heard the People ?
With what mouths , in what language do they express themselves ?
How is this astonishing revelation accomplished ?
What authentic , conclusive examples do you cite ?
What guarantee have you of the validity of these laws you say issue from the People ?
What is the sanction ?
By what claims , by what signs , shall I distinguish the elect delegated by the People from the apostates who take advantage of its trust and usurp its authority ?
When you come right down to it , how do you establish the legitimacy of the popular Word ?
I believe in the existence of the People as I do in the existence of God .
I bow before its holy will ; I submit to all orders coming hence ; the People ’s word is my law , my strength , and my hope .
But , following the precept of Saint Paul , to be worthy my obedience must be rational , and what a misfortune for me , what ignominy , if , while believing myself to be submitting only to the People ’s authority , I were to be the plaything of a vile charlatan !
How then , I beg of you , among so many rival apostles , contradictory opinions , and obstinate partisans , am I to recognize the voice , the true voice of the People ?
The problem of the sovereignty of the People is the fundamental problem of liberty , equality , and fraternity , the first principle of social organization .
Governments and peoples have had no other goal , through all the storms of revolutions and diversions of politics , than to constitute this sovereignty .
Each time that they have been diverted from this goal they have fallen into slavery and shame .
With this in mind the Provisional Government has convened a National Assembly named by all citizens , without distinction as to wealth and capacity : universal suffrage seems to them to be the closest approach to expressing the People ’s sovereignty .
Thus it is supposed first that the People can be consulted ; second , that it can respond ; third , that its will can be authentically ascertained : and finally that government founded upon the manifest will of the People is the only legitimate government .
In particular , such is the pretension of DEMOCRACY , which presents itself as the form of government which best translates the sovereignty of the People .
But , if I prove that democracy , just like monarchy , only symbolizes that sovereignty , that it does not respond to any of the questions raised by this idea , that it cannot , for example , either establish the authenticity of the actions attributed to the People or state what is the final goal of society : if I prove that democracy , far from being the most perfect of governments , is the negation of the sovereignty of the People and the origin of its ruin - it will be demonstrated , in fact and in right , that democracy is nothing more than a constitutional despotism , succeeding a different constitutional despotism , that it does not possess any scientific value , and that it must be seen solely as a preparation for the REPUBLIC , one and indivisible .
It is important to clarify opinion on this point immediately , and to eliminate all illusion .
The People , the collective being - I almost said rational being - does not speak at all in the true sense of the word .
The People , no more than God , has no eyes to see , no ears to hear , no mouth to speak .
How do I know if it is endowed with some sort of soul , a divinity immanent in the masses , as certain philosophers hypothesize a world soul , and which at certain moments moves and urges it on ; or whether the reason of the People is none other than pure idea , the most abstract , the most comprehensive , the freest of all individual form , as other philosophers claim that God is simply the order in the universe , an abstraction ?
I am not getting involved in the investigations of esoteric psychology : as a practical man I ask in what manner this soul , reason , will , or what have you is set outside itself , so to speak , and makes itself known ?
Who can serve as its spokesman ?
Who has the right to say to others , “ It is through me that the People speaks ” ?
How shall I believe that he who harangues five hundred applauding individuals from atop a soapbox is the People ’s spokesman ?
How does the election by citizens , nay even their unanimous vote , have the faculty of conferring this sort of privilege , to serve as the People ’s interpreter ?
And when you show me , like a coterie , nine hundred personages thus chosen by their fellow citizens , why ought I believe that these nine hundred delegates , who do not all agree among each other , are prompted by a mysterious inspiration from the People ?
And , when all is said , how will the law they are going to make obligate me ?
Here is a president or a directory , the personification , symbol , or fabrication of national sovereignty : the first power of the State .
Here are a chamber , two chambers - one the spokesman of conservative interests , the other of the instinct for development : the second power of the State .
Here is a press , eloquent , disciplined , untiring , which each morning pours out in torrents millions of ideas which swarm in the millions of brains of the citizenry : the third power of the State .
The executive power is action , the chambers - deliberation , the press-opinion .
Which of these powers represents the people ?
Or else , if you say that it is the whole thing which represents the people , how is it that they do not all agree ?
Put royalty in place of the presidency , and it is the same thing : my criticisms apply equally to monarchy and democracy …
And what do we hear from the platform ?
And what does the Government know ?
Not so long ago it was escaping its responsibilities by denying its own authority to make decisions .
It did not exist , it claimed , in order to organize work and give bread to the People .
For a month it has received the demands of the proletariat ; for a month it has been at work - and for a month it has had the official gazette publish every day this great news : that it knows nothing , that it discovers nothing !
The Government divides the People ; it arouses hatred between the classes that compose it .
But to organize the People , to create that sovereignty which is simultaneously liberty and accord , this exceeds the Government ability , as formerly it exceeded its jurisdiction .
In a Government which calls itself instituted by the People ’s will such remarkable ignorance is a contradiction : it is apparent that already the People is sovereign no longer .
Does the People , which is sometimes said to have risen like a single man , also think like one man ?
Reflect ?
Reason ?
Make conclusions ?
Does it have a memory , imagination , ideas ?
If in reality the People is sovereign , it thinks ; if it thinks , doubtless it has its own way of thinking and formulating its thought .
How then does the People think ?
What are the forms of popular reasoning ?
Does it proceed by means of categories ?
Does it employ syllogism , induction , analysis , antinomy , or analogy ?
Is it Aristotelian or Hegelian ?
You must explain all that ; otherwise , your respect for the sovereignty of the People is only absurd fetishism .
One might as well worship a stone .
Does the People call upon experience in its meditations ?
Does it bear in mind its memories , or else is its course to produce new ideas endlessly ?
How does it reconcile respect for its traditions with its needs for development ?
How does it finish with one worn - out hypothesis and go on to try another ?
What is the law of its transitions and its movement from one idea to the next ?
What stimulates it , what defines the course of its progress ?
Why this moving about , this instability ?
I need to know all this - otherwise the law you impose on me in the name of the People ceases to be authentic : it is no longer law , but violence .
Does the People always think ?
And if it does not , how do you account for the intermittent character of its thought ?
If we suppose that the People can be represented , what will its representatives do during these interruptions ?
Does the People sleep sometimes , like Jupiter in the arms of Juno ?
When does it dream ?
When does it stay awake ?
You must teach me about all these things ; otherwise , the power you exercise by delegation from the People being only interim , and the length of the interim being unknown , this power is usurped : you are inclined toward tyranny .
If the People thinks , reflects , reasons , sometimes a priori , according to the rules of pure reason , sometimes a posteriori upon the data of experience , it runs the risk of deceiving itself .
Then it no longer suffices , for me to accept the People ’s thought as law , that its authenticity be proven to me ; it is necessary that the thought itself be legitimate .
Who will choose among the ideas and fantasies of the People ?
To whom shall we appeal its will , which may be erroneous , and consequently despotic ?
Here I present this dilemma :
If the People can err , then there are two alternatives .
On the one hand , the error may seem as respectable as if it were true , and can claim complete obedience despite the error .
In this case the People is a supremely immoral being , since it can simultaneously think , will , and do evil .
On the other hand , ought we find fault with the People in its errors ?
There would then be , in certain cases , a duty for a government to resist the People !
Who will tell it :
You deceive yourself !
Who will be able to set it to rights , to restrain it ?
But what am I saying ?
If the People is liable to err , what becomes of its sovereignty ?
Is it not evident that the People ’s will should be taken into consideration all the less as it is more formidable in its consequences , and that the true principle of all politics , the guarantee of the security of nations , is to consult the People only in order to distrust it ?
Cannot all inspiration from it hide immense peril as much as immense success , and its will be only a suicidal thought ?
Doubtless , you will say , the People has only a mystical existence .
It manifests itself only at rare intervals , in predestined epochs !
But for all that the People is no phantom , and when it rises , no one can fail to recognize it …
Now if the People has , in all historical epochs , thought , expressed , willed , and done a multitude of contradictory things ; if , even today , among so many opinions which divide it , it is impossible for it to choose one without repudiating another and consequently without being self - contradictory - what do you want me to think of the reason , the morality , the justice , of its acts ?
What can I expect of its representatives ?
And what proof of authenticity will you give me in favour of an opinion , such that I cannot immediately make a claim for the contrary one ?
What astonishes me in the midst of the confusion of ideas , is that faith in the sovereignty of the People , far from dwindling , seems by this very confusion to reach its own climax .
In this obstinant belief of the multitude in the intelligence which exists within it I see a sort of manifestation of the People which affirms itself , like Jehovah , and says , “ I AM . ” I cannot then deny , on the contrary , I am forced to confess the sovereignty of the People .
But beyond this initial affirmation , and when it is a question of going from the subject of the thought to its object , when in other words it is a question of applying the criterion to acts of Government , let someone tell me , where is the People ?
In principle then , I admit that the People exists , that it is sovereign , that it is predicated in the consciousness of the masses .
But nothing yet has proven to me that it can perform an overt act of sovereignty , that an explicit revelation of the People is possible .
For , in view of the dominance of prejudices , of the contradiction of ideas and interests , of the variability of opinion , and of the impulsiveness of the multitude , I shall always ask what establishes the authenticity and legitimacy of such a revelation - and this is what democracy cannot answer .
But , the democrats observe - not without reason - the People has never been suitably called to action .
Never has it been able to demonstrate its will except for momentary flashes : the role it has played in history up to now has been completely subordinate .
For the People to be able to speak its mind , it must be democratically consulted - that is , all citizens without distinction must participate , directly or indirectly , in the formation of the law .
Now , this mode of democratic consultation has never been exercised in a coherent manner : the eternal conspiracy of the privileged has not permitted it .
Princes , nobles and priests , military men , magistrates , teachers , scholars , artists , industrialists , merchants , financiers , proprietors , have always succeeded in breaking up the democratic Union , in changing the voice of the People into a voice of monopoly .
Now that we possess the only true way of having the People speak , we shall likewise know what constitutes the authenticity and legitimacy of its word , and all your preceding objections vanish .
The sincerity of the democratic regime will guarantee the solution to us …
According to the theory of universal suffrage , experience should have proven that the middle class , which alone has exercised political rights of late , does not represent the People - far from it , with the monarchy it has been in constant reaction against the People .
One concludes that it is up to the entire nation to name its representatives .
But wo n’t it be only an artificial representation , just the product of the arbitrary will of the electoral mob , if the representatives come from one class of men who provide the free , upward flight of society , the spontaneous development of sciences , arts , industry , and commerce , the necessity of institutions , the tacit consent or the well - known incapacity of the lower classes , one class finally whose talent and wealth designates them as the natural elite of the People ?
Wo n’t it be thus with representatives chosen by electoral meetings of varying completeness , enlightenment , and freedom , and which act under the influence of local passions , prejudices , and hatred for persons and principles ?
We shall have an aristocracy of our own choice - I have no objection - in place of a natural aristocracy ; but aristocracy for aristocracy I prefer , with Mr. Guizot , that of fatality to that of arbitrary will : fatality puts me under no obligation .
Or , rather , we will only restore , by another route , the same aristocrats ; for whom do you want named to represent them , these working stiffs , these day labourers , these toilers , if not their bourgeoisie ?
Unless you only want that they kill them !
One way or another , preponderant strength in government belongs to the men who have the preponderance of talent and fortune .
From the first it has been evident that social reform will never come out of political reform , that on the contrary political reform must come out of social reform .
The illusion of democracy springs from that of constitutional monarchy ’s example - claiming to organize Government by representative means .
Neither the Revolution of July [ 1830 ] nor that of February [ 1848 ] has sufficed to illuminate this .
What they always want is inequality of fortunes , delegation of sovereignty , and government by influential people .
Instead of saying , as did Mr. Thiers ,
The king reigns and does not govern , democracy says , The People reigns and does not govern , which is to deny the Revolution …
Since , according to the ideology of the democrats , the People cannot govern itself and is forced to give itself to representatives who govern by delegation , while it retains the right of review , it is supposed that the People is quite capable at least of having itself represented , that it can be represented faithfully .
Well !
This hypothesis is utterly false ; there is not and never can be legitimate representation of the People .
All electoral systems are mechanisms for deceit : to know one is sufficient to pronounce the condemnation of all .
Take the example of the Provisional Government [ just established ] .
Its system pretends to be universal , but whatever it does , in the entire electoral system there will always be exclusions , absences , and votes which are invalidated , erroneous , or unfree .
The hardiest innovators have not yet dared to demand suffrage for women , children , domestic servants , or men with criminal records .
About four - fifths of the People are not represented , and are cut off from the communion of the People .
Why ?
You fix electoral capacity at twenty - one years ’ age ; why not twenty ?
Why not at nineteen , eighteen , seventeen ?
What !
One year , one day makes the elector rational !
A Barra or Viala is incapable of voting discerningly while the Fouchés and Héberts vote for them !
You eliminate women .
You have thus resolved the grand problem of the inferiority of the sex .
What !
No exception for Lucretia , Cornelia , Joan of Arc or Charlotte Corday !
A Roland , a Staël , a George Sand will find no favor before your manhood !
The Jacobins welcomed the revolutionary women who sat knitting at their meetings ; no one has ever said that the presence of these citizenesses weakened the courage of the citizens !
You set aside the domestic servant .
You are saying that this sign of servitude does not cover a generous soul , that in the heart of a valet beats no idea which will save the Republic !
Is the race of Figaro lost ?
It is the fault of this man , you will say : why , with so many abilities , is he a servant ?
And why are there servants ?
I want to see , I want to hear the People in its variety and multitude , all ages , all sexes , all conditions , all virtues , all miseries : for all that , this is the People .
You claim that there would be grievous trouble for good discipline , for the peace of the State and tranquillity of families , if women , children , and domestic servants obtained the same rights as husbands , fathers , and masters , that in addition the former are adequately represented by the latter through their solidarity of interests and the familial bond .
I acknowledge that the objection is a serious one , and I do not attempt to refute it .
But take care : you must , by the same reasoning , exclude the proletarians and all workers .
Seven - tenths of this category receive the aid of public charity : they will then go on to vote themselves government jobs , salary increases , labour reductions , and they will not fail in this , I assure you , if their delegates represent them ever so little .
In the National Assembly the proletariat will be like the officials in Mr. Guizot ’s Chamber , judging its own cause , having power over the budget and putting nothing there , creating dictatorship by their appointments , until , with capital exhausted by taxation and property producing nothing any longer , general bankruptcy breaks apart this parliamentary beggary .
And all these citizens who , because of work , sickness , travel , or lack of money to go to the elections , are forced to abstain from voting , how do you count them ?
Will it be according to the proverb , “ Who says nothing , consents ” ?
But , consents to what ?
To the opinion of the majority , or indeed to that of the minority ?
And those who vote only on impulse , through good - nature or interest , through faith in their republican committee or parish priest : what do you make of them ?
It is an old maxim that in all deliberations it is necessary not only to count the votes , but to weigh them .
In your committees , on the contrary , the vote of an Arago or Lamartine counts no more than that of a beggar .
Will you say that the consideration due men for their merit is secured by the influence they exercise on the electors ?
Then the voting is not free .
It is the voices of ability that we hear , not that of the People .
One might as well preserve electoral suffrage based on qualification by ownership of property …
I pass over in silence the material and moral impossibilities which abound in the mode of election adopted by the Provisional Government .
It is completely devoted to the opinion that in doubling the national representation and making people vote for inseparable lists of candidates , the Provisional Government wanted the citizens to choose not men but principle , precisely in the manner of the former Government , which also made people vote on the system , not on the men .
How is one to discuss the choice of ten , twenty , twenty - five deputies ?
How , if each citizen votes freely and in knowledge of his cause , are the votes of such elections - by - list to be counted ?
How are such elections brought to a conclusion , if they are serious ?
Evidently it is impossible .
I do not discuss , I repeat , the purely material side of the question : I keep to issues of right .
What formerly was obtained through venality , today they extort from impotence .
They say to the elector :
Here are our friends , the friends of the Republic ; and there are our adversaries , who also are the adversaries of the Republic - choose .
And the elector who cannot appraise the abilities of the candidates votes out of confidence !
Instead of naming deputies for each district , as under the fallen regime , they will have them elected by province .
They wanted , by this measure , to destroy the spirit of localism .
How wonderful it is that the democrats are so sure of their principles !
If the deputies , they say , are named by districts , it is not France which is represented , but the districts .
The national Assembly would no longer be representative of the country ; it would be a congress of 459 separate delegations .
Why then , I reply , do n’t you have each elector name the deputies for all France ?
It would be desirable , you answer , but it is impossible .
I observe first that any system which can be true only in conditions themselves impossible seems to me a poor system .
But to me the democrats here appear singularly inconsistent and perplexed by mere trifles .
If the representatives ought to represent not the provinces , nor the districts , nor the towns , nor the countryside , nor industry , nor commerce , nor agriculture , nor special interests , but only FRANCE !- then why have they decided that there should be one deputy per 40,000 inhabitants ?
Why not one per 100,000 or 200,000 !
Ninety instead of nine hundred - would n’t that suffice ?
Could n’t you in Paris , cut short your list of candidates , while the conservatives and the various royalists cut short theirs ?
Was it more difficult to vote on a list of ninety names than on one of fifteen ?
But who does not see that deputies thus elected apart from all special interests and groups , all considerations of places and persons , by dint of representing France , represent nothing ; that they no longer are mandated representatives , but legislators set apart from the People ; and that in place of a representative democracy we have an elective oligarchy , the middle term between democracy and royalty .
There , citizen reader , is where I want to bring you .
From whatever aspect you consider democracy , you will always see it placed between two extremes each as contrary as the other to its own principle , condemned to oscillate between the absurd and the impossible , without ever being able to establish itself .
Among a million equally arbitrary terms , the Provisional Government has acted like Mr. Guizot : it has preferred that which appeared to it to agree best with its democratic prejudices .
Of representative truth , as of government of the People by the People , the Provisional Government has taken no account …
In order that the deputy represent his constituents , it is necessary that he represent all the ideas which have united to elect him .
But , with the electoral system , the deputy , the would - be legislator sent by the citizens to reconcile all ideas and all interests in the name of the People , always represents just one idea , one interest .
The rest is excluded without pity .
For who makes law in the elections ?
Who decides the choice of deputies ?
The majority , half plus one of the votes .
From this it follows that half less one of the electors is not represented or is so in spite of itself , that of all the opinions that divide the citizens , one only , insofar as the deputy has an opinion , arrives at the legislature , and finally that the law , which should be the expression of the will of the People , is only the expression of half of the People .
The result is that in the theory of the democrats the problem consists of eliminating , by the mechanism of sham universal suffrage , all ideas save one which stir opinion , and to declare sovereign that which has the majority .
But , perhaps it will be said , the idea that fails in such an electoral body will triumph in another and , by this means , all ideas can be represented in the National Assembly .
When that is the case , you would have only put off the difficulty , for the question is to know how all these ideas , divergent and antagonistic , will concur on the law and be reconciled thereon .
Thus the Revolution , according to some , is only an accident , which should change nothing in the general order of society .
According to others , the Revolution is social still more than political .
How can such obviously incompatible claims be satisfied ?
How at the same time can there be given security for the bourgeoisie and guarantees for the proletariat ?
How will these contrary wishes and opposed inclinations come to be mixed together in a resulting community , in one universal law ?
Democracy is so far from being able to resolve this difficulty that all its art , all its science is used to remove the obstacle .
It makes appeals to the ballot box ; the ballot box is simultaneously the level , the balance , the criterion of democracy .
With the electoral ballot democracy eliminates men ; with the legislative ballot , it eliminates ideas …
What !
It is one vote that makes the representative , one vote that makes the law !
With a question on which hangs the honour and health of the Republic , the citizens are divided into two equal factions .
On the two sides they bring to bear the most serious reasoning , the weightiest authorities , the most positive facts .
The nation is in doubt , the Assembly is in suspension .
One representative , without discernible motive , passes from right to left and turns the balance ; it is he who makes the law .
And this law , the expression of some bizarre will , is supposed to be the will of the People !
It will be necessary for me to submit to it , defend it , even kill for it !
By a parliamentary caprice I lose the most precious of my rights , I lose liberty !
And the most sacred of my duties , the duty to resist tyranny by force , falls before the sovereign noggin of an imbecile !
Democracy is nothing but the tyranny of majorities , the most execrable tyranny of all , for it is not based on the authority of a religion , nor on a nobility of blood , nor on the prerogatives of fortune : it has number as its base , and for a mask the name of the People …
If universal suffrage , the most complete manifestation of democracy , has won so many partisans , especially among the working classes , it is because it has always been presented on the basis of an appeal to men of talent , as well as to the good sense and morality of the masses .
How often have they not brought out the offensive contrast of the speculator who becomes politically influential through plunder and the man of genius whom poverty has kept far away from the stage !…
In the end , we are all electors ; we can choose the most worthy .
We can do more ; we can follow them step by step in their legislative acts and their votes ; we shall make them transmit our arguments and our documents ; we shall indicate our will to them , and when we are discontented , we shall recall and dismiss them .
The choice of abilities , imperative mandate , permanent revocability - these are the most immediate and incontestable consequences of the electoral principle .
It is the inevitable program of all democracy .
Now democracy , no more than constitutional monarchy , does not sustain such a deduction from its principle .
What democracy demands , like monarchy , is silent deputies who do not discuss , but vote ; who , receiving the order from the Government , crush the opposition with their heavy and heavy witted battalions .
These are passive creatures , I almost say satellites , whom the danger of a revolution does not intimidate , whose reason is not too rebellious , whose conscience does not recoil before anything arbitrary , before any proscription …
In every kind of government the deputy belongs to the powerful , not to the country …
[ It is required ] that he be master of his vote , that is , to traffic in its sale , that the mandate have a specified term , of at least a year , during which the Government , in agreement with the deputies , does what it pleases and gives strength to the law through action by its own arbitrary will …
If monarchy is the hammer which crushes the People , democracy is the axe which divides it : the one and the other equally conclude in the death of liberty …
[ Because theorists ] have taught that all power has its source in national sovereignty , it has valiantly been concluded best to make all citizens vote in one way or another , and that the majority of votes thus expressed adequately constitute the will of the People .
They have brought us back to the practices of barbarians who , lacking rationality , proceeded by acclamation and election .
They have taken a material symbol for the true formula of sovereignty .
And they have said to the proletarians :
When you vote , you shall be free , you shall be rich ; you shall enact capital , product and wages ; you shall , as another Moses did , make thrushes and manna fall from heaven ; you shall become like gods , for you shall not work , or shall work so little that if you do work it shall be as nothing .
Whatever they do and whatever they say , universal suffrage , the testimony of discord , can only produce discord .
And it is with this miserable idea , I am ashamed for my native land , that for seventeen years they have agitated the poor People !
It is for this that bourgeoisie and workers have sung the “ Marseillaise ” in chorus at seventy political banquets and , after a revolution as glorious as it was legitimate , have abandoned themselves to a sect of doctrinaires !
For six months the opposition deputies , like comedians on tour , travelled through the provinces , and for the fruit of their benefit performance what have they brought back to us , what ?
A scheme for land redistribution !
It is under this schismatic flag that we have claimed to preserve the initiative of progress , to march at the forefront of nations in the conquest of liberty , to inaugurate harmony around the world !
Yesterday , we regarded with pity the peoples who did not know as we have how to raise themselves to constitutional sublimity .
Today , fallen a hundred times lower , we still are sorry for them , we shall go with a hundred thousand bayonets to make them partake with us of the benefits of democratic absolutism .
And we are the great nation !
Oh !
Be quiet , and if you do not know how to do great things , or express great ideas , at least preserve common sense for us …
In monarchy , the acts of the Government are an unfolding of authority ; in democracy they constitute authority .
The authority which in monarchy is the principle of governmental action is the goal of government in democracy .
The result is that democracy is fatally retrograde , and that it implies contradiction .
Let us place ourselves at the point of departure for democracy , at the moment of universal suffrage .
All citizens are equal , independent .
Their egalitarian combination is the point of departure for power : it is power itself , in its highest form , in its plenitude .
By virtue of democratic principle , all citizens must participate in the formation of the law , in the government of the State , in the exercise of public functions , in the discussion of the budget , in the appointment of officials .
All must be consulted and give their opinions on peace and war , treaties of commerce and alliance , colonial enterprises , works of public utility , the award of compensation , the infliction of penalties .
Finally , all must pay their debt to their native land , as taxpayers , jurors , judges , and soldiers .
If things could happen in this way , the ideal of democracy would be attained .
It would have a normal existence , developing directly in the sense of its principle , as do all things which have life and grow .
It is thus that the acorn becomes an oak , and the embryo an animal ; it is thus that geometry , astronomy , chemistry are the development to infinity of a small number of elements .
It is completely otherwise in democracy , which according to the authors exists fully only at the moment of elections and for the formation of legislative power .
This moment once past , democracy retreats ; it withdraws into itself again , and begins its anti-democratic work .
It becomes AUTHORITY .
Authority was the idol of Mr. Guizot ; it is also that of the democrats .
In fact it is not true , in any democracy , that all citizens participate in the formation of the law : that prerogative is reserved for the representatives .
It is not true that they deliberate on all public affairs , domestic and foreign : this is the perquisite , not even of the representatives , but of the ministers .
Citizens discuss affairs , ministers alone deliberate them .
It is not true that each citizen fulfills a public function : those functions which do not produce marketable goods must be reduced as much as possible .
By their nature public functions exclude the vast majority of citizens …
It is not true that citizens participate in the nomination of officials ; moreover this participation is as impossible as the preceding one , since it would result in creating anarchy in the bad sense of the word .
It is power which names its subordinates , sometimes according to its own arbitrary will , sometimes according to certain conditions for appointment or promotion , the order and discipline of officials and centralization requiring that it be thus …
Finally , it is not true that all citizens participate in justice and in war : as judges and officers , most are eliminated ; as jurors and simple soldiers all abstain as much as they can .
In a word , hierarchy in government being the primary condition of government , democracy is a chimera .
The reason that authors give for this merits our study .
They say the People is outside the state because it does not know how to govern itself , and when it does know , it can not do it .
EVERYBODY CANNOT COMMAND AND GOVERN AT THE SAME TIME ; it is necessary that the authority belong solely to some who exercise it in the name of and through the delegation of all .
Ignorance or impotence , according to democratic theory the People is incapable of governing itself : democracy , like monarchy , after having posed as its principle the sovereignty of the People , ends with a declaration of the incapacity of the People !
This is what is meant by the democrats , who once in the government dream only of consolidating and strengthening the authority in their hands .
Thus it was understood by the multitude , who threw themselves upon the doors of the City Hall , demanding government jobs , money , work , credit , bread !
And there indeed is our nation , monarchist to its very marrow , idolizing power , deprived of individual energy and republican initiative , accustomed to expect everything from authority , to do nothing except through authority !
When monarchy does not come to us from on high , as it did formerly , or on the field of battle , as in 1800 , or in the folds of a charter , as in 1814 or 1830 , we proclaim it in the public square , between two barricades , in electoral assembly , or at a patriotic banquet .
Drink to the health of the People and the multitude will crown you !
Oeuvres completes de P - J. Proudhon ( Paris : A. Lacroix , Verboeckhoven et Cie. , 1867-70 ) .
VI , 1 - 87 .
Translation , pp. 35-40 , 42-44 , 46-58 , 60 , 62-67 .
At six billion plus today , the earth ’s human population will reach more than nine billion by 2050 , according to estimates .
If this many people consume energy at the current rate in the developed world , the planet will need more than double the amount of power it consumes today .
But energy is just one issue that humankind will have to tackle to create a sustainable future .
The root cause of the looming energy problem — and the key to easing environmental , economic and religious tensions while improving public health — is to address the unending , and unequal , growth of the human population .
And the one proven way to reduce fertility rates is to empower young women by educating them .
High fertility rates in areas of the developing world that can least cope put tremendous pressure on freshwater and sanitation needs and fuel economic and religious tensions .
In response , these countries ramp up their energy production via the only means available to them based on their resources — means that tend to either pollute the environment or contribute to global warming .
For instance , India , Somalia and Sudan have large positive birth rates .
The latter two countries struggle to provide adequate food and water resources , and India increased its energy consumption by almost 50 percent between 1992 and 2001 .
( In contrast , Japan , France and Russia have negative birth rates , and the U.S. is slightly positive . )
Indeed , a United Nations study published in August reported that Asia currently does not have the means to feed the extra 1.5 billion expected to live on that continent by 2050 .
Empirical work indicating that providing schooling for women and girls will address these problems includes study after study showing that educated women have fewer children , are wealthier and are less likely to accept fundamentalist extremism .
If we want a safer world , we should consider the utility of spending dollars on educating young people as an alternative to troops and weapons .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan today the Taliban have created thousands of madrassas , where children from poor families with no access to education can receive food and what passes for learning ( but what is in fact quite the opposite ) .
At the same time , they restrict access to education for women .
In Gaza vulnerable young people are recruited early on to religious extremist training camps .
I am not naive enough to believe that building schools and providing access to safe and secure environments for learning will alone solve our problems — we will need to create economic opportunities as well .
Moreover , in paternalistic societies where women have few rights , effecting change will be an uphill battle .
For example , the government we are now supporting with troops and infrastructure in Afghanistan has recently passed legislation that food can be withheld from women who do not have sex with their husband and that women cannot go out of the house without their husband ’s permission .
In countries of this sort that now receive significant support from us , we need to make the empowerment of women a higher priority .
As difficult and slow as the process might be , the education of women in such countries is a necessary first step to giving them the opportunity and motivation to begin to control their own destiny .
The long - term goal of reducing poverty , religious fundamentalism and overpopulation will be impossible to reach until we free women around the world from the enslavement of ignorance .
More fundamental is the fact that education is a basic human right that has been systematically denied too many women for too long .
David Smith holds the tiny train he created , which has a scale of 1:35,200 .
Image Credit : David Smith .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- David Smith , who has been building model railroads since 1965 , has always had a preference for the smaller scale train models .
His most recent project is a five - car train that runs through a scene of mountains , a tunnel , trees , buildings , and a cloud - studded sky - the whole thing measuring just 0.125 x 0.2 inches ( 0.3 x 0.5 cm ) .
The train 's modeling scale is 1:35,200 .
Smith , who is a business web developer from New Jersey , has been working on the train model since 2007 , spending about $ 11 on the project .
As Smith explains , the train is a model within a model , as it appears in the window of one of the stores in his Z scale model railroad town ( 1:220 scale ) , the fictitious James River Branch on the Reading Railroad .
The tiny train is a Z scale model of a 2 x 4 - foot N scale ( 1:160 ) layout .
At first , Smith ran into friction problems on the small scale when trying to miniaturize the geared mechanism he used for larger models .
After trial and error , he discovered that he could make an oval tube attached to the rotating shaft of a miniature geared motor .
To make the train cars , he simply cut " teeth " into the edge of the tube that would poke just above the surface of the layout .
Then he colored the train cars with a Sharpie .
He made the layout itself completely out of extremely thin styrene , and covered the mountain with a thin lumpy layer of Squadron putty to make a forest .
He made the buildings out of bits of 0.01 x 0.02 - inch strips of styrene , and colored everything with Sharpies .
At first , Smith thought about illuminating some of the buildings , but found that even the tiniest LED or fiber optics would be much too bulky .
He still plans to make a single spotlight to hang overhead , to make it easier to see everything .
Because the train is so small , even making the video was a major challenge to shoot .
Although Smith used a macro lens , the camera would not focus close enough to get a good view ; he had to blow it up 400 % in post - production to make a decent - sized ( yet grainy ) image .
Smith is making no promises that the tiny train layout is made precisely to scale .
" This new layout was entirely eyeballed as well , with no real intent to precisely represent an N scale layout in Z scale ; it 's only N scale by virtue of its overall dimensions , " he explained .
" So if anyone measures the passenger cars running on it and finds they 're exactly the right size , I 'll most certainly faint dead away . "

The number of people diagnosed with diabetes continues to grow More than 600,000 Scots could have a " ticking timebomb " condition which puts them at far greater risk of developing diabetes , a charity has warned .
Diabetes UK estimated that 620,000 people - about one in 10 of the population - could have pre-diabetes .
The condition makes them up to 15 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes .
The charity said that people with pre-diabetes have blood glucose levels higher than normal and are also mostly obese or overweight , the charity said .
Diabetes is caused by too much glucose or sugar in the blood .
It 's time for all of us to get serious about our health if we want to have any chance of defusing the ticking time bomb of Type 2 diabetes
Jane - Claire Judson
Diabetes UK Scotland
The Diabetes UK report was released to coincide with the launch of the charity 's Get Serious campaign , which aims to get as many people as possible to pledge to make healthy lifestyle changes , raise funds , campaign or volunteer for the charity .
Jane - Claire Judson , the national director of Diabetes UK Scotland , said : " It 's staggering that over 600,000 people in Scotland have pre-diabetes , which is often a precursor to Type 2 diabetes , a serious condition which can lead to long - term complications such as heart disease , stroke , kidney failure , amputation and blindness .
" Identifying and educating people with pre-diabetes is vital as it's not too late for many to make healthy lifestyle changes , reverse the condition completely and reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes .
" Scottish government statistics show that the numbers of people diagnosed with diabetes continues to grow .
219,463 people now have diabetes in Scotland , an increase of over 10,000 from 2007 .
" It 's time for all of us to get serious about our health if we want to have any chance of defusing the ticking timebomb of Type 2 diabetes . "
Physical activity Type 2 diabetes occurs when not enough of the hormone insulin is produced by the body for it to control the correct amount of glucose in the blood .
It also occurs when the body 's cells do not react to insulin .
The charity said pre-diabetes - which is also known as impaired glucose regulation - can often be reversed , cutting the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 60 % , by losing even just a " moderate amount of weight " , adopting a healthy , balanced diet and increasing physical activity .
Diabetes UK Scotland also called for a commitment from the Scottish government for diabetes screening programmes as part of an extension of the Keep Well programme .

Michael Steele and his peeps at the RNC were being deluged with calls from the DNC ad over the angry mobs they are sending to disrupt the health care town halls so they did what every conservative hatchet man would do .
They re-routed the calls ...
" The DNC released a Web video early in the morning accusing the GOP of inciting mob activity at town hall meetings .
At the end of the video , the DNC instructs people to call the Republican National Committee to express outrage .
Callers who dial the RNC 's main number to voice their concern about the DNC 's charges are told to press 1 , which sends them to the DNC 's main switchboard . "
This is a Karl Rove move for sure .
I think this is going to ignite a very dirty war between the two groups .
The RNC redirected these calls from its main switchboard over to the DNC ’s switchboard — a response , said Steele , to the White House arrogantly blaming regular Americans “ like my mother , like my sister ” for the health care impasse .
“ I thought it was a good idea , ” Steele said .
“ Do n’t sit there and think you ’re going to direct a bunch of angry liberals to call the RNC when I know full well what that ’s all about .
I get the joke .
My response was , talk to your own party , because they ’re the ones ginning this up . ”
Most of America is upset by our health care system , but the right is bent on destroying reform , so they are astroturfing the town halls .
HCAN has some tips on how to combat these Zombie Plumbers if you got to an event .
And do n't forget to send me a video of your experience .

We are closer to passing health care reform than we 've ever been in the history of this country , and the opposition knows it .
The small , lobbyist - funded right - wing is trying to scare Members of Congress and the American public away from supporting health care reform .
We can't let fear win - America has been at the mercy of the insurance industry from too long .
We need health care reform now , and we can't wait any longer .
You can help fight back against these right - wing disrupters .

Please call early and often .
DKos diary has more :
Long before gun powder was invented , the world ’s greatest empires were built on steel .
Be it Alexander the Great , Ancient Rome or the Ming Dynasty , conquering armies used a blade to spill blood on the battle field .
The sword may be an antiquated weapon in the 21st Century , but meeting your end via a foil still holds a high degree of honor .
Especially in the movies .
Big screen duels make for excellent entertainment .
Whether it ’s a period piece , horror / sci - fi or comedy , watching two combatants proficient in the art of swordplay rarely disappoints .
Here are ten battles that fit the bill .
( Note to all Star Wars geeks .
Lightsabers are not swords . )
10 ) Wang vs. Rain
Big Trouble in Little China rules for a myriad of reasons .
Hilarious hero , crazy plot , intense action and cool special effects are just a few .
Throw in a climatic mid-air cutlas clash and you can’t really ask for much more .
Right ?
9 ) Blade vs. Deacon Frost
Blade is somewhat responsible for jump - starting Hollywood ’s renewed interest in superhero franchises .
A vampire hunter who is half - bloodsucker .
Whoa .
The final showdown between Blade and Frost has a little bit of everything , including the clank of metal .
8 ) Nameless vs. Moon
To be fair , Hero is packed with several worthy engagements , so choosing just one was n’t easy .
The library scene actually features a pair of bouts , but it ’s the one between Nameless ( Jet Li ) and Moon ( Ziyi Zhang ) that stands out .
7 ) Captain Jack Sparrow vs. Davy Jones
The Pirates of the Caribbean films were a pleasant surprise .
Something based on an amusement park ride should n’t be remotely entertaining , but the filmmakers did a credible job .
As the third chapter wraps , the devious Captain Jack goes head - to - head with the vile Davy Jones .
It ’s an impressive scene .
6 ) Li Mu-bai vs. Jen
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon‘s “ Green Destiny ” has to be one of the coolest names for a sword in cinema history .
The tree - top confrontation in the bamboo forest is n’t the most exciting , but it is beautifully filmed and beyond amazing to watch .
5 ) MacLeod vs. The Kurgan
The original Highlander still ranks pretty high on the kick ass scale .
Clancy Brown ’s inspired performance as The Kurgan is both frightening and funny .
Christopher Lambert did n’t do much after this , but at least he can say that he was the first to be the last of the immortals .
4 ) Maximus vs. Commodus
Gladiator is all kinds of glorious .
Bloody battle scenes , doomed hero , stunning soundtrack — it has it all .
Russell Crowe and a pre-nutty Joaquin Phoenix both deliver the goods .
In particular , during the classic Coliseum combat .
Gladiator is easily one of this decade ’s top films .
3 ) King Arthur vs. Black Knight
The Pythons know funny like few others .
The needlessly violent joust from Monty Python and the Holy Grail still holds up , despite being 40 years old .
Whatever you do , do n’t eff with King Arthur .
And remember , the Black Knight always triumphs .
2 ) Westley vs. Inigo Montoya
The Princess Bride is as close to a perfect film as you ’ll find .
The story , dialogue , acting and directing are all first - rate .
Its centerpiece scene is one of the finest duels between master swordsmen ever put to film .
Up until a few years ago , this would have undoubtedly topped this list .
1 ) The Bride vs. The Crazy 88
The logistics involved in shooting this melee from Kill Bill must have been a nightmare .
The Bride – dressed in a bright yellow motorcycle suit – takes on O - Ren Ishii ’s gang , the “ Crazy 88 . ”
Single - handedly slicing and dicing forty to fifty guys in seven minutes takes the title , for now .
( CNN ) --
Like a lot of people , Anna Owens began using MySpace more than four years ago to keep in touch with friends who were n't in college .
Our real - world friendships are often a reflection of who we connect with online , experts say .
But soon she felt too old for the social - networking site , and the customizable pages with music that were fun at first began to annoy her .
By the time she graduated from the University of Puget Sound , Owens ' classmates were n't on MySpace -- they were on Facebook .
Throughout graduate school and beyond , as her network began to expand , Owens ceased using MySpace altogether .
Facebook had come to represent the whole of her social and professional universe .
" MySpace has one population , Facebook has another , " said the 26 - year - old , who works for an affordable - housing nonprofit in San Francisco , California .
" Blue - collar , part - time workers might like the appeal of MySpace more -- it definitely depends on who you meet and what they use ; that 's what motivates people to join and stay interested . "
Is there a class divide online ?
Research suggests yes .
A recent study by market research firm Nielsen Claritas found that people in more affluent demographics are 25 percent more likely to be found friending on Facebook , while the less affluent are 37 percent more likely to connect on MySpace .
More specifically , almost 23 percent of Facebook users earn more than $ 100,000 a year , compared to slightly more than 16 percent of MySpace users .
On the other end of the spectrum , 37 percent of MySpace members earn less than $ 50,000 annually , compared with about 28 percent of Facebook users .
Social networking by the numbers Users with household income above $ 75,000
Facebook -- 41.74 percent
MySpace -- 32.38 percent
LinkedIn -- 58.35 percent
Twitter -- 43.34 percent
Users with household income under $ 50,000
Facebook -- 28.42 percent
MySpace -- 37.13 percent
LinkedIn -- 17.34 percent
Twitter -- 28.36 percent
Female users
Facebook -- 56.33 percent
MySpace -- 56.69 percent
LinkedIn -- 48.11 percent
Twitter -- 53.59 percent Users aged 18 to 24
Facebook -- 10.27 percent
MySpace -- 15.46 percent
LinkedIn -- 3.99 percent
Twitter -- 9.51 percent
Users aged 35 to 49
Facebook -- 31.54 percent
MySpace -- 29.09 percent
LinkedIn -- 43.64 percent
Twitter -- 34.02 percent

MySpace users tend to be " in middle - class , blue - collar neighborhoods , " said Mike Mancini , vice president of data product management for Nielsen , which used an online panel of more than 200,000 social media users in the United States in August .
" They 're on their way up , or perhaps not college educated . "
By contrast , Mancini said , " Facebook [ use ] goes off the charts in the upscale suburbs , " driven by a demographic that for Nielsen is represented by white or Asian married couples between the ages of 45 - 64 with kids and high levels of education .
Even more affluent are users of Twitter , the microblogging site , and Linked In , a networking site geared to white - collar professionals .
Almost 38 percent of LinkedIn users earn more than $ 100,000 a year .
Nielsen also found a strong overlap between those who use Facebook and those who use Linked In , Mancini said .
Nielsen is n't the first to find this trend .
Ethnographer danah boyd , who does not capitalize her name , said she watched the class divide emerge while conducting research of American teens ' use of social networks in 2006 .
When she began , she noticed the high school students all used MySpace , but by the end of the school year , they were switching to Facebook .
When boyd asked why , the students replied with reasons similar to Owens : " the features were better ; MySpace is dangerous and Facebook is safe ; my friends are here , " boyd recalled .
And then , boyd said , " a young woman , living in a small historical town in Massachussetts said to me , ' I do n't mean to be a racist or anything , but MySpace is like , ghetto . ' "
For boyd , that 's when it clicked .
" It 's not a matter of choice between Facebook and MySpace , it was a movement to Facebook from MySpace , " she said , a movement that largely included the educated and the upper-class .
So why do our online worlds , unencumbered by what separates us in daily life , reflect humans ' tendency to stick with what -- and who -- they know ?
A lot of it has to do with the disparate beginnings of MySpace and Facebook , said Adam Ostrow , editor - in - chief of Mashable , a blog about social media .
Facebook originated at Harvard University and was limited at first to students at approved colleges before opening itself to the public in September 2006 .
MySpace , on the other hand , had a " come one , come all " policy and made a mad dash towards monetization , Ostrow said .
" They used a lot of banner ads without regard to the quality , and it really diminished the value [ of the site ] for the more tech - savvy demographic . "
And while the Internet can build bridges between people on opposite sides of the globe , we still tend to connect with the same people through online social networks who we connect with offline , said technology writer and blogger Sarah Perez .
" It 's effectively a mirror to our real world , " she told CNN .
" Social networks are the online version of what kids do after school . "
These social - networking divides are worrisome to boyd , who wrote " Taken Out of Context : American Teen Sociality in Networked Publics . "
Instead of allowing us to cross the boundaries that exist in our everyday lives , these online class differences threaten to carry those boundaries into the future .
" The social - network infrastructure is going to be a part of everything going forward , just like [ Web ] search is , " boyd said .
" The Internet is not this great equalizer that rids us of the problems of the physical world -- the Internet mirrors and magnifies them .
The divisions that we have in everyday life are going to manifest themselves online . "
Jason Kaufman , a research science fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University , examined the Facebook profiles of a group of college students over four years and found that even within Facebook , there 's evidence of self - segregation .
Multiracial students tended to have more Facebook friends than students of other backgrounds and were often the sole connection between white and black circles , Kaufman said .
Nonetheless , Kaufman feels that social networks may one day help us overcome our instinct to associate with those who share our income level , education , or racial background .
" I think it 's fair to say that the Web has great potential to at least mitigate everyday tendencies towards self - segregation and social exclusion , " Kaufman said .
" In some ways , [ Facebook ] levels the playing field of friendship stratification .
In the real world , you have very close friends and then there are those you just say " Hi " to when you pass them on the street .
" The playing field is a lot more level in that you can find yourself having a wall - to - wall exchange with just an acquaintance .
If you pick up the unlikely friend , not of your race or income bracket , the network may [ help you ] establish a more active friendship than if you met them in real life . "
But MySpace 's users still find something appealing about MySpace that they do n't about Facebook , and it may have nothing to do with class or race , blogger Perez said .
" It 's not just the demographics that have people picking one over the other , " Perez said .
" It also comes down to what activities you like .
If you like music , you 'll still be on MySpace .
If you 're more into applications , then you might go to Facebook because you 're addicted to Mafia Wars or whatever . "
In the end , boyd is n't as concerned about the reasons behind these divisions online as she is about the consequences of people only networking within their chosen social - media groups .
" Friendships and family relationships are socially divided ; people self - segregate to deal with racism sometimes , " she said .
" Okay , fine :
We 've made a decision to self - segregate , but what happens when politicians go on Facebook and think they 're reaching the whole public ?
What happens when colleges only go on Facebook to promote ? "
When and if that does happen , Mashable 's Ostrow said , we 'll know perhaps we 've given social networks more credit than they 're worth .
" When it comes to information , I do n't think social networks are the best source for that .
The Internet is so open , " said Ostrow , who believes users would go beyond their networks to search out information online .
If you 're looking to branch out of your social network box , your best option may be Twitter .
Nielsen 's survey did n't find a dominant social class on Twitter as much as they found a geographical one :
Those who use Twitter are more likely to live in an urban area where there 's greater access to wireless network coverage , Mancini said .
" The simplicity of Twitter definitely creates less of a divide , because it's not a relationship like it is on MySpace or Facebook , " Ostrow said .
" If you live in the middle of nowhere or you live in a city , you can follow anyone about anything . "

I swept floors , stocked vitamins , cleaned kale , stamped receipts , deposited money in a vault , scraped gum off the floor with a razor blade  and left with my affordable bag of Valencia oranges and a renewed sense of community .
Two years in , I scored the coveted role of “ exit worker , ” examining the receipts of departing members and performing the occasional bag check .
At one point , the job was amended to prohibit bag checks for fear of racial profiling  a change that worked out well for me since I would never dream of asking members to open their backpacks .
( Nor had anyone instructed me what to do if I found a shoplifter  give chase ?
Make a citizen ’s arrest ? )
Instead , I had always interpreted the exit worker ’s station as more of a farewell post , wishing members a good evening , perhaps offering an encouraging word about what we were all doing to make the planet better , leaving them smiling after the long lines .
But as membership surged  it was 8,000 when I joined 
I found myself sharing what I had come to imagine as my personal concierge booth with a superfluous co-exit worker .
Fortunately for me , she also was not particularly security conscious .

While similar food co-ops across the nation often hire nonmembers for checkout positions or other tasks , in Park Slope , members carry 75 percent to 80 percent of the workload , according to Joe Holtz , the general manager .
Such a relatively high workload , not surprisingly , leads to high rates of , well , shirking .
“ We knew there would be people who would try to drive a truck through the work - requirement rule , ” Mr. Holtz said in an interview , “ and we have to protect ourselves against that . ”
I can hear you thinking , “ A few hours every four weeks ?
Give me a break . ”
I know it sounds easy to keep up with the commitment .
All I can say is , for me and many other members with good intentions , it is n’t .
Whenever last - minute conflicts arose  a late night at the office , a grad - school deadline 
I would scramble to find a replacement , but often I would end up in the hole .

Mr. Paterson declined a request for an interview .
The Maine referendum , in which voters reversed lawmakers ’ earlier approval of same - sex marriage , was not the only cause for concern for supporters of the bill .
During the bitter fight for the 23rd Congressional District in upstate New York in recent weeks , state conservatives pressured the Republican candidate to withdraw in part because of her support of same - sex marriage .
And Gov. Jon S. Corzine ’s defeat in New Jersey has complicated efforts to legalize same - sex marriage there .
Opponents of the measure in New York expressed confidence that they would prevail .
“ I think we ’re starting from a position of strength , ” said Jason J. McGuire , executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms .
“ I do n’t believe they have the votes , and it ’s an act of desperation .
Our position is to maintain the votes we have , and people are certainly in contact with our senators and we are encouraging that .
This is not going to pass . ”
Republican officials said Senator Dean G. Skelos , the leader of the Republican caucus , would allow his colleagues to vote however they wanted and would not seek a unified position .
But none of the 30 Republicans have yet to commit publicly to voting for same - sex marriage , and the bill ’s supporters say that Republican votes are needed for the measure to pass .
Democrats were to meet in a closed - door caucus on Monday in Albany to decide how to proceed .
“ There is a school of thought which says that unless you have 32 votes , you should n’t pull a bill on the floor , ” Pedro Espada Jr. , the Senate majority leader , said in an interview on Saturday .
“ There ’s also an equally valid school of thought that says we should put it up for a vote and live with the results . ”
Mr. Espada , a supporter of the measure , said he and a number of other Senate Democrats , including the caucus leader , John L. Sampson of Brooklyn , had been discussing strategy while attending a conference of Latino lawmakers in Puerto Rico this weekend .
Senator Rubén Díaz Sr. , a Pentecostal minister and Bronx Democrat who is the most outspoken opponent of same - sex marriage in the Legislature , said last week that the issue should be voted on during an election year .

A ginormous amphibious air tanker called the Martin Mars just made a massive water drop over Mount Wilson , the hill northeast of Los Angeles where the century - old Mount Wilson Observatory and nearby TV , radio and cell phone towers are all located .
The World War II - era flying boat literally water - bombed the peak today to douse flames from the Station Fire , which has burned 127,000 acres ( the largest in LA County history ) .
Here 's an LA Times pic of this bad boy in action over Mt. Wilson .
Snip from the accompanying story :
Los Angeles County Fire Department Battalion Chief Steve Martin said , " We are going to burn , cut , foam and gel .
And if that does n't work , we 're going to pray .
This place is worth a lot , but it 's not worth dying for .
"
In a worst - case scenario , firefighters were expected to retreat to the safety of the observatory parking lot or seek refuge in the concrete and steel basement of the 105 - year - old , 100 - inch telescope observatory .
A Martin Mars air tanker , also known as a Super Scooper , dropped 7,500 gallons of water on Mt. Wilson .
In previous BB posts about the LA fires , I mentioned these giant 747s that have also been spurting water from the sky , to extinguish the blaze .
Wired has a nice photo gallery of those guys in action here .
And Popular Science has some interior shots of the 747s .
Spoiler : they are friggin huge inside .
The managers of the observatory are now very optimistic that the historic site will make it okay .

The Chamraj tea estate in South India was among the very first farms to receive fair trade certification in 1994 .
Now 15 years later , has fair trade made a difference to the lives of workers there ?
Nick Mathiason and Simon Rawles find out guardian.co.uk
The price of basic farm commodities has been hammered over the past 40 years , placing unbearable pressure on farmers .
At the bottom of the food chain are smallholders .
With processors , brokers , auctioneers , speculators and retailers all taking a cut , there is little left to pay the producer .
The situation adds to the rural poverty endured by a third of the world 's population .
It is why 15 years ago the Fairtrade Foundation started .
The idea is to offer growers a minimum price to make production cost effective and then pay a premium on top , to be invested in social projects – normally education , health , environment , energy and pensions .
How and where money is invested is decided by a committee elected by co-op members or workers on an estate or plantation .
The Chamraj tea estate in Tamil Nadu , south India , was one of the very first to be certified .
The estate used to be run by the family who founded the Hoare merchant bank in London .
It is now owned by Indians .
It produces 40,000kg of green leaf and 10,000kg of black leaf each day from what is the biggest factory in the Nilgiri hills , the main tea - growing region of south India .
Nearly 8 % of sales are Fairtrade .
It exports 85 % of its tea to Germany , Japan and the US , among other markets .
In 15 years the Fairtrade premium has bought a new school block with computers and laboratories , several school buses and a doubling of children in schools .
Workers on tea estates are automatically housed but when they retire they often become homeless .
The premium has paid for an enhanced pension that enables former workers to build a new home .
It has also paid for a doctor at the local hospital and for modern medical equipment , which is used by people from miles around .
Chamraj is thriving but the same cannot be said for the south Indian tea industry .
For most of the past decade prices have been so low many businesses have gone under .
The director of Chamraj , Titus Pinto , said : " Sixteen tea companies were abandoned in Kerala and a few gardens [ estates ] in the north .
Owners just vanished because they could n't produce tea and sell above the cost of production .
So there was no money coming in .
" And the workers lost their jobs .
The workers could n't afford to send their children to schools .
So children who were supposed to be at school started working , sometimes at very low salaries .
The workers were deprived of some of their benefits [ but ] they were not made homeless .
They could stay on the properties but they could n't leave because they had no money to go and buy a house somewhere else .
So they were trapped . "
More than 15 million people in the developing world rely on tea for a living but currently only 10 % of what is sold in the UK is Fairtrade .
The next year will see the beginning of an ambitious strategy to see half of tea bought in Britain become Fairtrade .
" Even though the price of tea has risen since 2002 , producers today still receive only half of what they did 30 years ago for their crop , " Harriet Lamb , the foundation 's executive director , said .
" The reality is that the tea trade continues to keep the poorest people in the supply chain – the growers and pickers in developing countries – in poverty .
Without the promise of a fair price for their harvest , tea producers have little hope of change in the future . "
The tea industry in south India
South India produces 200 m kilograms of tea , with half going for export .
In the past , the region exported much tea to the Soviet Union and then to the newly created Commonwealth of Independent States but , in the late 1990s , the rouble currency crisis and attendant economic fallout meant orders dried up .
Since then , south India has been on a mission to improve the quality of its tea to penetrate American , European and Chinese markets .
Parents say that honesty is the best policy , but they regularly lie to their children as a way of influencing their behaviour and emotions , finds new research from the University of Toronto and the University of California , San Diego .
Surprisingly little scholarship has been published on the subject of parental lying , so Gail Heyman , professor of psychology at UC San Diego , Diem Luu , a former UCSD student , and Kang Lee , professor at the University of Toronto and director of the Institute of Child Study at OISE , set out to explore the under - researched phenomenon .
They asked U.S. participants in two related studies about parents lying to their children – either for the purpose of promoting appropriate behaviour or to make them happy .
In one of the studies , many parents reported they told their young children that bad things would happen if they did n't go to bed or eat what they were supposed to .
For example , one mother said she told her child that if he did n't finish all of his food he would get pimples all over his face .
Other parents reported inventing magical creatures .
One explained , " We told our daughter that if she wrapped up all her pacifiers like gifts , the ' paci - fairy ' would come and give them to children who needed them ... I thought it was healthier to get rid of the pacifiers , and it was a way for her to feel proud and special . "
In the other study , the researchers surveyed college students ' recollections about their parents ' lying and obtained similar results : parents often lie to their children even as they tell them that lying is unacceptable .
The researchers refer to this practice as " parenting by lying . "
" We are surprised by how often parenting by lying takes place , " said Lee .
" Moreover , our findings showed that even the parents who most strongly promoted the importance of honesty with their children engaged in parenting by lying . "
Though Heyman thinks that there are occasions when it is appropriate to be less than truthful with a child – " telling a two - year - old you do n't like their drawing is just cruel , " she said – she urges parents to think through the issues and consider alternatives before resorting to the expedient lie .
" Children sometimes behave in ways that are disruptive or are likely to harm their long - term interests , " said Heyman .
" It is common for parents to try out a range of strategies , including lying , to gain compliance .
When parents are juggling the demands of getting through the day , concerns about possible long - term negative consequences to children 's beliefs about honesty are not necessarily at the forefront . "
The research also examined " parenting by lying " among Asian - American and European - American parents .
Asian - American parents were more likely to report lying to their children for the purpose of influencing their behaviour .
According to the researchers , one possible explanation for this finding is that as compared to European - American parents , Asian - American parents tend to place a greater emphasis on the importance of teaching children to be respectful and obedient , and they use a range of parenting strategies to meet these ends .
The research is published in the current edition of the Journal of Moral Education and was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Heyman and Lee are now preparing an international study to explore the subject further , and they are also beginning to study the possible consequences of " parenting by lying " :
Does it create confusion about right and wrong ?
Does it undermine a child 's trust ?
e Committee system improves select committee access
Office of the Speaker - Media release
e Committee system to improve access to select committees
5 October 2009
Members of the public can lodge online submissions to select committees following the successful launch of the new ‘ eCommittee ’ system .
Visitors to www.parliament.nz can now make online submissions on the Climate Change Response ( Moderated Emissions Trading ) Amendment Bill or on the Inquiry into the tobacco industry in Aotearoa and the consequences of tobacco use for Maori .
Pre-prepared submissions can be uploaded , or submitters can type a brief submission in the form provided .
All future calls for submissions will include the ability for submissions to be made online .
“ The ability for the public to lodge submissions online is one of the key components of the eCommittee system , ” Speaker Hon Dr Lockwood Smith said .
“ This is a significant step forward is making our parliament more accessible to the public , by making it easier for people to have their say , ” Dr Smith said .
The eCommittee system aims to make the select committee process more efficient and effective .
All of Parliament ’s subject select committees will be working with the eCommittee system by the end of 2009 , which will bring their processes up - to - date through the use of modern information management practices .
The select committee process traditionally required large quantities of paper with submissions , advice and reports being received in hard copy .
The eCommittee system , which was piloted successfully in 2007 , streamlines select committee processes by introducing electronic access to committee documents .
This means :
• MPs will be able to access committee documents through secure networks in Parliament , and remotely when outside Wellington .
• Members of the public will be able to view publicly - available select committee information and make submissions to select committees using the internet .
• The advice provided to committees by government departments will also become electronically based , ensuring that it is distributed quickly and is easier to access .
Dr Smith said the new system proved itself during the pilot , and had worked well at two initial committee meetings in the current parliament .
“ The eCommittee pilot was well received by MPs and staff , and showed the system could be implemented successfully .
I am looking forward to seeing eCommittee used by all our committees , and benefiting from the increased efficiency the system will offer . ”
The online submissions form can be accessed from http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/SC/MakeSub/

From the " Emperors of Rome Using Linux ' files :
The first Fedora 12 beta is now available and at first glance it sure looks to me like it 's jammed pack full of interesting and innovative new features .
Speed is a key issue for all Linux distros , and Fedora is taking an interesting approach by compiling all of its software for i686 with ' special ' optimization for Intel Atom .
What that means is instead of the typical generic x86 compilation , all apps could potentially run faster .
Fedora now does have a specific netbook Moblin graphical interface and a Fedora 12 Moblin Fedora Remix too -- who said Fedora ( or Red Hat ) was n't interested in netbooks or the Linux desktop ?
There is also an enhanced NetworkManager for network configuration , Bluetooth improvements as well as improved IP v6 support .
On the video side , Fedora 12 includes Theora 1.1 for improved video quality , as well as some preliminary support for the latest Radeon HD and NVIDIA graphics cards .
Virtualization which is a key focus for Red Hat overall gets a boost in Fedora 12 with the libguesfs library and the guestfish interactive tool for modifying guest images for virtual machines .
That 's just the short list from my perspective , but if you look at the full feature list , there a lot of features in this release .
So I just came across the soundtrack for the upcoming Spike Jonze flick Where the Wild Things Are. Jonze selected Yeah Yeah Yeah ’s frontwoman Karen O. to help make the soundtrack as reminiscent of childhood as possible .
I find this notion a little strange , since the Yeah Yeah Yeah ’s are more known for being in your face , off the wall , and quirky .
They are n’t known for their huge child fanbase .
From their Imeem Profile :
Inside Karen O is a Wild Thing – as singer for the Grammy - nominated Yeah Yeah Yeahs , her wild thing is in your face , vulnerable , obnoxious , tender , exciting … a self - proclaimed “ spazoid . ”
To Oscar - nominated Where the Wild Things Are director Spike Jonze , however , Karen O and her music possess something of a child - like innocence , a guileless charm that put her exactly on the right emotional wavelength to sonically capture the film , be it a tender moment or a wild rumpus .
To compose the music , O enlisted friends and fellow musicians she believed had a musical intuition that would bolster her intent to marry sound to vision .
Dubbed Karen O and the Kids , these include Tristan Bechet ( Services ) , Tom Biller ( co- producer with Karen O and member of Afternoons ) , Bradford Cox ( Deerhunter ) , Brian Chase ( Yeah Yeah Yeahs ) , Dean Fertita ( Queens of the Stone Age , The Dead Weather , The Raconteurs ) , Aaron Hemphill ( Liars ) , Greg Kurstin ( The Bird and the Bee ) , Jack Lawrence ( The Dead Weather , The Raconteurs , The Greenhornes ) , Oscar Michel ( Gris Gris ) , Imaad Wasif ( New Folk Implosion , Alaska ) , Nick Zinner , ( Yeah Yeah Yeahs ) and an untrained children ’s choir .
Take a look at some behind the scenes footage :

Where the Wild Things Are is set to hit theaters on October 16th .
仕事を変わることで、収入がアップし人間関係も円満で、すべてがプラスに作用するというケースばかりではありません。
企業が良いことばかりを求人票に書いてアピールしても、実際に入社すると面接で言われたことと実情が異なるといったことは珍しくはないようです。
例えば、収入面に関して求人票に書いてあった額よりかなり少ない額が入社手続きの際に告げられた事例もあります。
入社直前になって 「社会人経験が少ない」などの理由で低い給料を提示される事例は、実は珍しくはないのです。
また、転職先を決める前に退職してしまう場合は、非常にリスクが高くなります。
誰でもすぐに転職先が決まるとは限りません。
人によっては転職活動でまったく良い返事をもらえなかったために、経済的苦境に陥いることもあるかもしれません。
新卒採用と違って基本的に中途採用者には即戦力として期待されるので、期待に沿った仕事ができないと判断されると、新しい仕事は見つけられないでしょう。
そのため、簡単に次の仕事が見つかると考えていると、厳しい現状に向き合うことになるかもしれません。
そこで私がオススメしたいのは、人材紹介会社のコンサルタントを経由して転職活動を行う方法です。
コンサルタントは各業界の求人情報に詳しいだけでなく、求職者のスキルや要望と企業の条件とを客観的に見た上でマッチングをしてくれます。
また履歴書や職務経歴書の書き方をアドバイスしてくれたり、転職の悩みの相談にも応じてくれるので、リスクを減らして転職活動をすることができるでしょう。
Regardless of how President Barack Obama 's health - care agenda plays out in Congress , it has not been a success in public opinion .
Opposition to ObamaCare has risen all year .
According to the Gallup polling organization , the percentage of Americans who believe the cost of health care for their families will " get worse " under the proposed reforms rose to 49 % from 42 % in just the past month .
The percentage saying it would " get better " stayed at 22 % .
Many are searching for explanations .
One popular notion is that demagogues in the media are stirring up falsehoods against what they say is a long - overdue solution to the country 's health - care crisis .
First , Americans recoil at policies that strip choices from citizens and pass them to bureaucrats .
ObamaCare systematically does so .
The current proposals in Congress would effectively limit choice across the entire spectrum of health care :
What kind of health insurance citizens can buy , what kind of doctors they can see , what kind of procedures their doctors will perform , what kind of drugs they can take , and what treatment options they may have .

Remove carpet stains with vinegar
Here are some vinegar uses for more stubborn stains :
Rub light carpet stains with a mixture of 2 tablespoons salt dissolved in 1/2 cup white vinegar .
Let the solution dry , then vacuum .
For larger or darker stains , add 2 tablespoons borax to the mixture and use in the same way .
For tough , ground - in dirt and other stains , make a paste of 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon cornstarch , and rub it into the stain using a dry cloth .
Let it set for two days , then vacuum .
To make spray - on spot and stain remover , fill a spray bottle with 5 parts water and 1 part vinegar .
Fill a second spray bottle with 1 part non-sudsy ammonia and 5 parts water .
Saturate a stain with the vinegar solution .
Let it settle for a few minutes , then blot thoroughly with a clean , dry cloth .
Then spray and blot using the ammonia solution .
Repeat until the stain is gone .
If you ’re worried about the strong smell vinegar might leave behind , scented vinegar will help give your home a fresh and clean smell .

There 's an inevitable problem with trying to find trends in data that is subject to a great deal of random variability : unless the most recent point was a record high , it will always look like there 's a downward trend .
We 're currently seeing that happen with the global temperature record , where the warmest year ever recorded , 1998 , is receding into the past .
As a result , reports of " global cooling " are appearing in the popular press , and smaller percentages of the US public are confident that the globe is warming .
Unfortunately , all of this seems to be a misdirection ; the Associated Press has performed a statistical sanity check on the claims of global cooling , and found that there 's little to them .
As the AP report notes , the cries of global cooling have become increasingly obvious , with the phrase appearing on the cover of the new book Super Freakonnomics and the BBC asking " What happened to global warming ? "
But , as we noted in February , the recent drop in temperatures has been so small that 2008 was still the 10th warmest on record .
Other recent years were equally warm or warmer , while the hottest year on record , 1998 , was unusually warm compared to the surrounding years .
In fact , if you started tracking trends in either 1997 or 1999 , you saw a general increase in global temperatures .
The AP went beyond this analysis by sending out temperature data to four statisticians , without informing them what the data represented , and asked them to identify any trends in the data .
Apparently , none of them saw any sign of global cooling .
All of them detected the upward trend that is apparent when periods longer than a decade are examined , while the ups - and - downs of the last decade appear similar to the statistical noise that occurs in other decades within the data set .
One of the statisticians is even quoted as saying that seeing a downward trend in recent years involves " people coming at the data with preconceived notions . "
Statistically valid or not , the high profile of the sites where claims of global cooling are being given credence appears to be weighing in with the public .
Last week , the Pew Research Center released the results of a poll of 1,500 US adults , who were asked about climate change .
Over the past year , acceptance of the data showing that the Earth has warmed plunged , dropping from 71 percent of respondents to 57 percent .
Far fewer accept the verdict of most scientists , namely that human influences are the primary driver of recent climate changes .
Here , only 36 percent of the public agreed .
Although the partisan divide remained — Republicans are far less likely to accept the science — the decline occurred across all party affiliations , and was most dramatic among independents .
The poll also registered the typical confusion that the US public experiences when faced with scientific matters .
About half of those surveyed either do n't think the evidence for warming is solid , or think it 's the result of natural variation .
But a third of those still consider it a serious problem .
It would be tempting to view the recent drop in the acceptance of climate change as an indication that the public is losing its taste for the cap - and - trade legislation and negotiations for a binding international treaty that are leading up to the UN's Copenhagen meeting on carbon emissions limits .
But the poll provides little evidence of that .
Half of the respondents favored limits on carbon emissions , including 31 percent of those who think that there 's no solid evidence of global warming .
That does n't necessarily mean they favor the current cap - and - trade legislation , however , as about half admitted they knew nothing about it .
An even higher percentage ( 55 percent ) favors joining in an international agreement to limit carbon emissions , with another third saying we should set our own limits .
So , it appears that statistically bogus arguments remain popular with those who write about climate change for popular audiences , and that may be contributing to a general drop in the acceptance of the evidence and conclusions of the scientific community .
But , so far at least , the plunging acceptance levels have n't translated into a backlash against policy initiatives .
Operation Chastity , the Halo fan - film , made a big and important step to realisation today with the unveiling of their custom made full size M12 ‘ Warthog ’ LRV today at the London Expo .
The beast is built on the chassis of an old Land Rover by the talented guys from Custom Creations and certainly looks the part complete with internals and a mounting point for your gun of choice .
Hit the break for more details on Operation Chastity and some choice shot of the Warthog in full glory .
Taking a full year to put together , the completed warthog moves the fan - flick onto the next stage , which is due to start filming next March 2010 if everything goes to plan .
By November 2010 , Peter Cooper ( pictured above ) the Writer , Director and Producer of this epic undertaking , is hoping to enter post - production , which should last about 8 months .
With a bit of luck , lots of blood and sweat and a bit of will power , we might start seeing the finished masterpiece sometime in the second half of 2011 .
To make things even better , according to Mr. Cooper himself , you may even be able to own a little piece of this Halo universe as the props , costumes and uniforms ( including the 100 or so Spartan Marine outfits ) will go on sale after the films release .
Now I do n’t know about you but I ’m absolutely stoked by the thought of a Halo film and having met Peter , I can assure you that the fan - flick is in safe hands .
So if you want to support the film , get behind the crew and check out Operation Chastity and follow them on Twitter ( @opchastity ) .
In the mean time , check out the gallery of the impressive Warthog below .

City bankers entertain clients and try to generate business by offering trips to brothels , MPs heard today .
Kat Banyard of gender - equality pressure group the Fawcett Society told a Treasury select committee hearing into women 's role in the City of London that there was a growing trend in the City to use prostitution to entertain clients .
" We took extensive evidence from individual women who said it was becoming frequent for meetings to be held in lap dance clubs , and I also had women speak to me and say that prostitution was being used in client deals or in ways to generate business – and that all of this culture created a very hostile environment , as you would expect , for female employees of those firms , " she said .
One former City worker who gave evidence to the Fawcett Society said that while working for a top international investment bank in the City , she witnessed a senior manager looking for a brothel to entertain some Russian clients .
" I was out drinking with some guys in my team when a very senior guy came over , " she said .
" He asked if anyone knew of a good brothel in Edinburgh .
He said he had some Russian clients coming over and he wanted them to sign a multimillion - pound deal . "
She added that when she worked in the Tokyo office of the same company , her London - based colleagues would often bring British colleagues over to Japan for " sex trips " , where they would tell the company they were introducing clients to Japanese firms , but were actually visiting a number of seedy sex clubs .
" It 's a deeply troubling problem that needs to be discussed openly , " Banyard said .
" If we 're going to get more women into those institutions we need to change the culture before that happens . "
The committee launched the investigation into women 's role in the City as part of its attempt to prevent another crisis .
There will be two more hearings , during which more evidence will be taken from people such as Harriet Harman , the minister for women and equality , and Trevor Phillips , the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
But the select committee inquiry itself raised a few eyebrows on its launch in July as it emerged that only one of its 14 members would be a woman .
Former Bank of England policymaker Charles Goodhart , who is now professor emeritus of banking and finance at the London School of Economics , told the committee that the worst financial crisis since the second world war could have been prevented if more women were on the boards of major companies .
" Women tend to be more cautious and have a longer term outlook .
I think that men can be more aggressive and prepared to take larger risks , " he said .
" There would have been less likelihood of the financial crisis if we had a larger number of female chief executives in the financial sector . "
He said that there were " remarkably few " female chief executives in the financial sector and that it is " a great pity " .
" I think that the longer term and cautious tendency that women have and less of the alpha male would be beneficial . "
Nichola Pease , who runs the fund manager JO Hambro , told the committee that equality legislation in Britain was preventing women from getting the top jobs in the City .
She said that many firms were scared of hiring women because penalties for successful sex discrimination claims were unlimited .
Another factor that put companies off employing women was that women in the UK could take up to 52 weeks of maternity leave , compared with just 12 weeks in the US .
" A year 's maternity leave is too long , and sex discrimination claims that run into 10s of millions of pounds are ridiculous , " she told the committee .

Snapped by a digital infrared camera trap
One of the most elusive of all wild cats has been photographed deep in the jungle of Uganda .
Three images of a wild African golden cat were taken by a digital infrared camera trap set up by biologist Dr Gary Aronsen of Yale University in the US .
To his knowledge , just one other image of a wild African golden cat has ever been published .
Although taken in black and white , the new photos reveal this particular golden cat actually has a dark coat .
The cat is so rare few researchers working in African forests have seen it .
There is very little known about this felid , what kind of habitat it prefers etc
Dr Gary Aronsen
A colleague of Dr Aronsen 's has worked for years in Kibale National Park , Uganda where the photos were taken , and has seen the animal only once , while Dr Aronsen knows of only one other published photograph of the cat in the wild , taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
" Anecdotal evidence suggests that while many villagers and locals may see the cat crossing roads , or maybe raiding domesticates , there are just not that many researcher sightings .
We 're usually looking for other things . "
As a result , says Dr Aronsen , there are no direct field studies of the African golden cat ( Profelis aurata ) .
Most studies that have been done are based on scat analyses .
" There is very little known about this felid , what kind of habitat it prefers etc , " he says .
" It is spread across equatorial Africa , but it is cryptic and we presume solitary , making observations few and far between . "
The cat 's distinctive coat markings are clearly visible ( courtesy of G. P. Aronsen , Department of Anthropology , Yale University )
The African golden cat is a medium - sized cat , about 80 cm long , that lives within forest across central and west Africa .
Despite its name , its fur colour is variable and it can be either spotted or not .
" The golden cat is melanistic , meaning that its colour varies over its lifetime , and across the continent , " explains Dr Aronsen .
" I was disappointed that the cameras could not give me more data on [ the cat 's ] colour , but the images suggest it is a ' dark phase ' cat . "
It is one of two cat species known to live within Kibale National Park , the other being the serval .
Servals are slim , long cats , while the golden cat is muscular and compact .
The cat moves off ( courtesy of G. P. Aronsen , Department of Anthropology , Yale University )
Dr Aronsen originally set up his camera trap to take images of primates living within the park .
" For the most part , the cameras capture amazing images of elephants , monkeys , chimpanzees , duiker and buffalo .
The cameras also can record movies , so you can see multiple animals in a group , such as chimpanzees . "
But he was still surprised when it recorded three separate images of a golden cat , which are published in the African Journal of Ecology .
" That meant that the camera was located within the cat 's core area , " he says .
The images were taken in an old - growth forest patch located within a place called Mainaro , which is a patchwork of old - growth , regenerating , and replanted forests , Dr Aronsen explains .
" Given that three images were captured within an old - growth patch , I 'd say that the Kibale golden cats may prefer this habitat .
But the range of any cat is large , and so they can go anywhere to hunt . "
Aronsen himself saw his first and only wild African golden cat this summer , when one looped along in front of his motorbike as he travelled to conduct field work in a remote area of replanted forest .

Snapping broccoli was judged only a little worse than conning an old lady Researchers say the current " honesty test " used in courts should be reviewed after finding big differences in what is judged to be a dishonest act .
A survey of 15,000 people in England and Wales suggested a wide variation in views of what was honest or not - particularly for petty acts .
Just 47 % thought that it was wrong for a carer to persuade a patient to change their will in their favour .
The current test - the Ghosh test - assumes a universal view of honesty .
The Brunel University study also found that women were more likely to find activities such as taking stationery home from work dishonest , but less willing to convict the wrongdoer than men .
We have seen a massive difference in reaction to [ the scenarios ] and it seems to be based on whether or not the person speaking is likeable
Researcher Dr Emily Finch
The researchers , who are criminal lawyers , say that their early findings suggest the Ghosh test - which assumes a universal view of what constitutes dishonesty and is used in court cases - should be reassessed .
The findings are due to be presented at the start of the British Science Festival at the University of Surrey in Guildford .
The web - based " Honesty Lab " study , launched in May by the two Brunel criminologists in conjunction with the British Science Association , asked participants to watch five video clips in which morally questionable behaviour was dramatised .
They were then asked if they thought the actions were dishonest or worthy of conviction in a court of law .
In total , 40,000 scenarios were viewed , attracting one million hits to the web site .
The researchers say the results raise serious questions about people 's concepts of honesty and the reliability of the jury system .
The study found that 88.5 % women believed buying a dress for a special occasion and then returning it to the store and getting a refund was dishonest .
Broccoli stalks
But just 46.7 % took the same view of a care home nurse persuading an elderly patient to change a will in her favour .
A large majority of men had a similar attitude , with 82.6 % thinking it was morally wrong to " borrow " the dress but only 37.6 % disapproving of taking advantage of someone who was elderly and infirm .
The findings suggested that if a jury of 12 men and women was asked to pass a verdict on the care home nurse , only four would want to convict .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There is a wide variation in what people feel is acceptable Peter Symonds A higher proportion of women , 82.2 % , thought it was dishonest to lie about age on an internet dating site than believed it was wrong to benefit from the will alteration .
In a league table of dishonest acts , conning the elderly care home patient came 13th out of 16 - just one place above snapping off broccoli stalks in a supermarket and weighing the heads .
The two actions considered the most dishonest were buying goods online using a colleague 's shopping account and setting fire to a garage to make an insurance claim .
The Ghosh test asks if an action was dishonest according to the " ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people " .
But researcher Dr Emily Finch said : " We have some scenarios that are exactly the same in terms of the legal issue that they involve , but we have seen a massive difference in reaction to them .
" It seems to be based on whether or not the person speaking is likeable .
" When we like people or feel sorry for them , we are far less likely to condemn what they have done so this has a major effect on whether or not their conduct is rated as honest or dishonest . "

Thoughts And Discussion On Foreign Policy , Human Rights & The Environment ...
The results are in , and they 're mostly good .
Yesterday 's Peter Schiff money bomb raised almost $ 750,000 .
The morning after , his total for the event stands at $ 730,475 at 9:50 AM Eastern Time .
Compare this to the previous $ 25,000 money bomb , and the results represent a dramatic improvement indeed .
On the other hand , they did n't reach the original $ 1 million goal set by Schiff 's supporters .
Is that important ?
Supporters will probably say no , it 's not .
What 's important is that a significant amount of money was raised , an amount that puts Schiff 's coffers in the same neighborhood as Republican front runner Rob Simmons and former House speaker Tom Foley .
On the other hand , Schiff has a long way to go .
According to a Quinnipiac poll released July 23 , 2009 , Simmons is far - and - away the front runner in the early stages of the Republican race , while Schiff has virtually no voter support at all .
In other words , if Schiff does pull the trigger and commit to running , he 'll be starting from ground zero in terms of popular support .
Take a look at Quinnipiac 's percentages of support from its three most recent polls :
7/23 5/27 4/2 Simmons 42 % 52 % 32 % Foley 5 % 7 % 4 % Schiff – – – Caligiuri 5 % 7 % 4 % Someone Else 1 % – 2 % Would n't Vote 1 % 1 % 2 % Do n't Know / No Answer 45 % 33 % 56 %
In other words , despite having his name included in the poll , Schiff does n't score any support among registered Republican voters .
Even State Sen. Sam Caligiuri , considered by nearly everyone to be a long - shot in the race , scored some measurable amount of support , but Schiff is still completely failing to register with Republicans .
Of course , Schiff supporters do have some hope , given that all three polls show somewhere between 33 % and 56 % of Republican voters can conceivably be swayed in Schiff 's direction between now and next year .
Also , primary turnouts are usually much smaller than general election turnouts , meaning that Schiff has a lower target he needs to hit in order to win the nomination .
On the other hand , voters who tend to vote in primaries tend to be mainstream party supporters , and those supporters tend to support the candidate favored by party leadership .
That means the Schiff campaign will need to find an equal number of Republicans willing to break old patterns by voting in a primary .
That 's a lot easier said than done .
If they actually hope to achieve that goal , Schiff supporters will have to start right now .
The key to a dark horse winning anything is early organization .
If Schiff 's supporters want him to win in Connecticut , they need to build that organization right now .
They need to quickly establish precinct captains everywhere in the Constitution State .
They need to begin lit dropping and sign posting before the end of 2009 .
They need to work the voters before the big candidates kick their campaigns into gear .
In other words , they need to build some serious name recognition for Schiff now … not later .
It 's great to bask in the success of an off - year money bomb success .
They just better not bask too long and risk sunburn .
Enabling Highest - Quality Audio for Today ’s Ultra - thin TVs and Consumer Electronics
Emo Labs , Inc. , developers of invisible speaker solutions for display products , today unveiled the industry ’s first fundamentally new loudspeaker technology in decades at DEMOfall 09 .
Using ultra-thin , transparent material , Emo Labs has developed an invisible speaker system that delivers the highest - quality stereo sound from today ’s streamlined display products , including TVs , monitors and laptops .
By turning the display into a stereo speaker , the sound and dialogue come directly from the screen , just as they do in a movie theater .
The combination of this “ unified ” presentation with superb sound quality and space - saving design enables new consumer electronics products with embedded EMO  speaker solutions to deliver a more natural and realistic multimedia experience .
Advances in LCD , LED and Plasma display technology have enabled manufacturers to build TVs and other consumer electronics that deliver superior picture quality from a thin , sleek enclosure .
Unfortunately , the demand for these smaller form factors has forced manufacturers to squeeze tiny versions of traditional speakers into a strip along the bottom or on the back so they do n’t take up significant space .
As a result , the acoustic quality has declined substantially in newer TVs and other display products .
In fact , a recent study by leading industry research firm DisplaySearch confirms that the majority of new TV purchasers are not satisfied with the sound quality .
“ There is no question that sound is critical to the consumer digital media experience , and Emo Labs has forever changed how we ’ll experience sound in consumer electronics devices , ” said Chris Shipley , Executive Producer of the DEMO Conferences .
“ Emo Labs invisible speaker systems provide a very compelling value proposition for today ’s smaller and more streamlined consumer electronics : finally , new products that sound as good as they look . ”
While video display technologies have improved dramatically over the past decade , the basic sound - producing mechanism used in most of today ’s mass - produced speaker drivers is fundamentally the same as it was in the 1920’s .
In contrast , Emo Lab ’s patented Edge Motion audio systems use a completely different mechanical principle to generate high - quality , stereo sound .
Instead of pushing from behind , Edge Motion speakers use force on the sides of a very thin , transparent material to generate sound waves .
The result is a highly innovative , invisible speaker system that produces superior , stereo sound directly from the front of a video display panel , without adding to the size of the finished product .
“ Every day , people bring home the newest , most advanced consumer electronics — only to be disappointed by the poor sound quality these devices deliver , ” said Jason Carlson , CEO of Emo Labs .
“ With EMO  branded speaker systems , manufacturers can now deliver a richer and more natural user experience without sacrificing size and styling . ”
Emo Labs develops embedded audio solutions for leading electronics manufacturers that disappear into the display enclosure .
These state - of - the - art Edge Motion speaker systems offer significant performance and form factor benefits compared to conventional speakers , enabling manufacturers to create better , more satisfying consumer electronic products .

Your babysitter 's family is stranded on the roof of a flooded building in the Philippines .
What do you do ?
Thursday October 8 , 6:30 a.m. , the phone rings .
I pick up sleepily .
" My family !
My family !
Magda … my family ! "
I hear sobbing and low , sad groans on the other end .
It is our babysitter , Maricel , originally from the Philippines , where two typhoons - - " Ondoy " and " Pepeng , " as they are known locally -- have caused floods that , over the last few weeks , have killed hundreds , left hundreds of thousands homeless , and inflicted damage estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars .
Almost seven years ago , when her son was 15 months old , Maricel made the difficult choice to leave him with her parents so that she could make money in America .
Now she tells me that her seven - year - old son , her parents , her sister , and several of her nieces , aunts , and cousins are stranded on the second floor of a shaky 200 - year - old house on her family 's farm compound , about a five - hour drive from Manila .
Night is falling , and the water is rising .
The single - level home in which her son lives with her parents has been severely damaged .
I check the news :
The conditions are bad and getting worse .
People are dying in the floods , assistance can't get through , resources are scarce .
The U.N. appeal for the Philippines raised maybe a quarter of its $ 74 million target .
So there they sit , 19 people in an unstable , largely wooden structure , with no flotilla of lifeboats or helicopters from well - to - do countries headed their way .
And here I sit , an attorney in New Jersey .
Can I save a poor family in a rural disaster zone thousands of miles away ?
I am about to find out -- and , as the flood waters rise , time is of the essence .
The E-mail Plea
The Dollar 's weakness this week seems to be due to an organized attack on it , shades of Soros shorting the Pound in the early '90s .
The story on the secret cabal to replace the Dollar may have been a planned leak which was followed by an organized short and a surge in gold .
Now the Financial Times reports of massive intervention in Asia to support the Dollar and slow the rise of Asian Tiger mercantilist currencies .
The head of the Euro Central Bank has also been publicly bemoaning the weakness of the Dollar and a potential deal between the US and China to let the Dollar slide slowly while removing pressure from the US on forcing the Chinese to appreciate their currency .
In other words , organized debasing of both currencies .
In such a scenario , the Euro would continue to strengthen , threatening Euro exports .
So now the Euro wants to join the race to devalue .
Not really possible , is it ?
No one gets relative advantage .
These manipulations can explain why equities have been spiky in the past week .
They also support the ending diagonal formation the USD , a formation which can form as intervention emerges , and can reverse sharply .
Tomorrow may be a bounce in the USD and a fall in gold and US equities .
How sustained this will be remains to be seen .
The USD forex market is absolutely huge .
It is a treacherous moment , however , when the worlds reserve currency can suffer from mere rumors of secret cabals ; it shows a pervasive lack of confidence in the management of the currency .
The real secret cabal may be US leadership ( Obama , Geithner , Bernanke ) planning to continue to allow a slow fall of the Dollar in order to finance horrific deficits while lessening the burden of ever paying back the creditors .
Two very interesting analyses of this in the last few days :
Chris Martenson of The Crash Course argues that the Fed has postponed deflation by hiding the worthless debt for the banks .
During the Greenspan Bubble from 2002 - 2007 the US doubled its Dollar denominated debt , from $ 26T to $ 52T .
That increase is not supported by any concomitant increase in US productivity to support that level of debt , and hence can be expected to be written off to the tune of $ 20 - 25T .
The write down of such magnitude would create a deep deflation .
Some deflation is with us , but much of the worthless debt has been swapped into the Fed , where it sits without yet needing to be written off .
Various commentators including here have noted how the Fed needs an exit strategy from their swaps of toxic debt : " Paradoxically , by buying and accepting bad assets , the central banks did not fix the solvency problem : they merely delayed the inevitable .
The bad loans did not turn " good " by changing hands or being accepted as collateral by central banks . "
As the Fed swaps them back , they send the zombie banks back into insolvency , causing the financial crisis to re-emerge .
The internal debates inside the Fed to begin the exit , which would start with raising rates , is beginning to leak out .
The core rule of economics is TANSTAAFL , and in this case the consequence of the Fed hiding the hot potato of toxic debt is a crushing drop in credit availability that is continuing and maybe accelerating .
Simply put , zombie banks do n't lend .
See chart .
If this Dollar intervention gains scale , look for the USD to reverse up and US equities to reverse down .
If it is short - lived , watch whether the Dollar shorts come back strongly and continue to hammer it down .
In such an event the Fed may be forced to act to support the Dollar or risk a rapid devaluation .
I had not expected this Dollar Crisis to emerge yet , and view this as merely a warning shot across the bow of the US Ship of State .
Yet in the short term it ratchets markets and needs to be watched closely .
( CNN ) -- Nearly a year after the presidential election , the excitement of Barack Obama 's campaign has faded into the reality of an Obama White House .
As observers try to determine what time it is in American politics , they arrive at opposite conclusions .
To some , said Tulane University political scientist Thomas Langston , Obama is like Jimmy Carter , and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying Democratic coalition just as voters , tired of the Carter " malaise " era , handed the White House to Republicans in 1980 .
To others , Obama has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people .
To them , Langston said , it 's the dawning of a new age , as depicted in a famous 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad that declared , " It 's morning again in America . "
Both Obama and Carter were elected into office at a time when voters were hungry for change .
Carter represented the antithesis of President Nixon and a break from the disillusionment and mistrust of government caused by the Watergate scandal .
Carter , like Obama , learned the ropes in a state Senate .
Critics accused Carter of being inexperienced , having served one term as the governor of Georgia .
But the Democratic candidate presented himself as a politician outside of politics and a reformer uninterested in partisan games .
" With Carter himself , there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the Bush presidency , " said Russell Riley , chair of the Miller Center 's Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia .
Shortly after taking office , Carter 's approval rating peaked at 75 percent but dropped to the low 40s in a little more than a year .
He entered office weighed down by a sagging economy , and eventually , the energy crisis , the Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian hostage crisis took a toll on his administration .
" He ended his presidency , of course , holed up in the White House as a virtual captive himself of the Iranian hostage takers , " Langston said .
The parallels to Carter come primarily from Obama 's Republican critics .
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist speculated last month that a Carter - esque loss " may happen again , " and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has predicted that a Republican resurgence -- like the one he led in the mid '90s -- could be just around the corner .
" Carter is held up as the model of the ineffectual president -- a saint of a man but an ineffectual president .
And so when people compare Obama to Carter , that is an attack , " said David Gergen , a senior political analyst for CNN who also worked in the Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton administrations .
The comparison to Carter , Gergen said , is more of a danger sign for Obama than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed .
When Obama first came into office , observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in U.S. history , such as Franklin Roosevelt , Gergen said .
Now , Obama 's also being compared to a president who did n't live up to expectations .
The Carter comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election , Gergen said .
Under Carter , there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president 's party .
The liberal wing of the Democrats felt abandoned to the point that Sen. Edward Kennedy , one of the top liberals in Congress , challenged Carter in his 1980 re-election bid .
Kennedy came up short , but his bid severely weakened Carter and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to Reagan , Riley said .
While the similarities are not lost on Riley , what 's more telling is the " most important mistake that [ Obama ] did n't make . "
When Carter took office , there were Democrats with executive branch experience available , but he did n't want to use them .
" Carter was criticized for bringing in the ' Georgia Mafia , ' " Riley said , referring to Carter 's decision to give key positions to people from his home state .
Obama , however , stacked his bench with pros from the Clinton administration .
He brought in some advisers from Chicago , Illinois , some from Washington and others such as Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel with deep ties to both places .
That move was critical , Riley said , " because if you 've got seasoned people in these positions , they 're much more likely to make adjustments and to know Capitol Hill in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both Carter and Obama . "
John Geer , a Vanderbilt University political scientist , said the comparisons to Carter are weak .
" Jimmy Carter is a very rare exception in American history .
Most first - term presidents get a second term , " he said , adding that it 's especially rare since Carter 's term came on the heels of previous Republican rule .
President George H.W. Bush also served one term , but it came after eight years of Republican control of the White House .
The more analogous comparison so far , Geer said , is to Reagan , who also entered the White House with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the Cold War -- and a major economic crisis at hand .
Reagan was a gifted politician , Geer said .
He was known as an inspiring communicator , and his appeal crossed party lines .
Like Obama , polls showed that Reagan was more popular than his policies .
More than 20 years after he left the White House , Republicans still look to him as the last great face of the party .
" Reagan continues to be the touchstone , the smiling Buddha figure .
Everybody rubs his belly for good luck , " Langston said .
" Like the smiling Buddha , he is whatever you want him to be . "
In his book " The Audacity of Hope , " Obama wrote that although he and Reagan had differing political viewpoints , he understands the Republican president 's appeal .
" Reagan spoke to America 's longing for order , our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind , impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies , so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work , patriotism , personal responsibility , optimism , and faith , " he wrote .
Gergen , who was director of communications for Reagan , said the comparisons to Reagan are strained because of their opposite governing styles .
Where as Obama tries to draw consensus , Reagan drew lines , he said .
" Reagan was a conviction politician , and Barack Obama is a consensus - seeking politician , " Gergen said .
" Barack Obama was a magical figure in his campaign , ran an extremely good campaign , but also based it more on the sense of hope and change as ideas , the particular policy solutions , à la Reagan . "
Martin Anderson , an economic policy adviser to Reagan , said Obama and Reagan faced similar problems in their first year but approached them with different solutions .
Faced with an economic crisis , Reagan 's strategy was to reduce taxes , let the American people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong , Anderson said .
After Reagan cut taxes in his first year , there were no immediate changes .
" It looked terrible , and it did n't look very good during the second year .
And then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on , " Anderson said .
As for Obama 's approach to country 's economic woes -- it 's too early to tell what will happen , he said .
In his first few months in office , Reagan also went through a game - changing experience that had ramifications for both him and the country :
He got shot .
" He came very close to dying .
It was right down next to his heart .
Just stunned everything , stunned everybody , " Anderson recalled .
But within weeks , Reagan was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor .
" And the Democrats -- after he came to life again -- they took a deep sigh and said , ' OK , you can do whatever you want , ' " Anderson said .
As tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was , Reagan 's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from Democrats -- provided momentum for the president 's agenda .
" The first year is a very tough year for any president , " Anderson said , noting that each year thereafter is " dramatically different . "
Asked what he thinks about comparisons to Carter and Reagan , Anderson replied , " You know who he looks like ?
Obama . "
Looking to administrations past , Obama can learn a valuable lesson , Gergen said .
" Do n't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing . "
The similarities between Obama and his predecessors , while interesting to discuss , are not foreboding , Riley said .
" There is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now .
There are bits and pieces here and there , " he said .
It 's impossible , however to take those similarities and " piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place . "
That idea , he said , is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to Mark Twain : " History does n't repeat itself , it rhymes . "
Obesity is on a rampage , with the World Health Organization pegging the numbers at more than 300 million worldwide , with a billion more overweight .
With obesity comes the increased risk for cardiovascular disease , Type II diabetes , and hypertension .
Now comes more discouraging news .
In the current online edition of the journal Human Brain Mapping , Paul Thompson , senior author and a UCLA professor of neurology , and lead author Cyrus A. Raji , a medical student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , and colleagues compared the brains of people who were obese , overweight , and of normal weight , to see if they had differences in brain structure ; that is , did their brains look equally healthy .
They found that obese people had 8 percent less brain tissue than people with normal weight , while overweight people had 4 percent less tissue .
According to Thompson , who is also a member of UCLA 's Laboratory of Neuro Imaging , this is the first time anyone has established a link between being overweight and having what he describes as " severe brain degeneration . "
" That 's a big loss of tissue and it depletes your cognitive reserves , putting you at much greater risk of Alzheimer 's and other diseases that attack the brain , " said Thompson .
" But you can greatly reduce your risk for Alzheimer 's , if you can eat healthily and keep your weight under control . "
The researchers used brain images from an earlier study called the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study .
Scans were selected of 94 elderly people in their 70s who were healthy not cognitively impaired — five years after the scan was taken .
To define the weight categories , they used the Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , the most widely used measurement for obesity .
Normal weight people were defined as having a BMI between 18.5 - 25 ; overweight people between 25 - 30 , and obese people greater than 30 .
The researchers then converted the scans into detailed three - dimensional images using tensor - based morphometry , a neuroimaging method that offers high resolution mapping of anatomical differences in the brain .
In looking at both grey matter and white matter of the brain , they found that the people defined as obese had lost brain tissue in the frontal and temporal lobes , areas of the brain critical for planning and memory , and in the anterior cingulate gyrus ( attention and executive functions ) , hippocampus ( long term memory ) and basal ganglia ( movement ) .
Overweight people showed brain loss in the basal ganglia , the corona radiata , white matter comprised of axons , and the parietal lobe ( sensory lobe ) .
" The brains of obese people looked 16 years older than the brains of those who were lean , and in overweight people looked eight years older , " says Thompson .
" It seems that along with increased risk for health problems such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease , obesity is bad for your brain : we have linked it to shrinkage of brain areas that are also targeted by Alzheimer 's , " said Pittsburgh 's Raji .
" But that could mean exercising , eating right and keeping weight under control can maintain brain health with aging and potentially lower the risk for Alzheimer 's and other dementias . "

Dragon Age : Achievements
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Friday , 2nd of October 2009 - 07:53 PM ]
Yep , you will be boning your way to another 40 points or 4 trophies .
Now if only they would tell us what metal type those trophies where .
I 'm guessing Bronze , but it would be awesome if they were ranked based on the look of the person you are experiencing the thrill of romance with .
Setting a new form of Trophy Fuck .
All joking aside , while it is funny to have these types of awards in there , I think it is just open grounds for more bull shit like what happened with Mass Effect .
Except this time you are rewarded for engaging in suggestive themes in the game .
I have no issues with it , it 's the backlash that we as gamers are going to have to endure because of some virtual nookie taking place .
Even if it is n't seen .
I commend BioWare for having no issue with placing these types of themes and actions in their games .
Sometimes they are needed to enhance the story .
( No joke ) I just hope that they are ready to be on the ball again like last time with the alien side boobage .
I can see the prudes of the US going to town on this and trying to push for an AO release .
In any instance , here are the 46 of 50 announced Achievements that total 1000 GamerPoints :

So apparently , NASA needs this itsy - bitsy little thing called Plutonium - 238 to make their deep - space rocketships go ZoOOOooOoOooM ZooOOOOoMM , but they 're running out of it and need congress to drop $ 30 million to help make more .
Advertisement
NPR says that NASA has not made any new Plutonium - 238 since the 1980s , instead opting to borrow from Mother Russia .
And because they use up to 11 pounds of the material each year , it would take 8 years worth of production to begin satisfying demand again .
But the requested $ 30 million from Congress is only a start — the full Plutonium - 238 production program could cost up to $ 150 million .
Because it gets so cold in deep space ( reaching absolute zero ) , spacecrafts traveling out that far need a fuel generating a lot of heat , so they can convert that energy to electricity .
Plutonium - 238 naturally generates a serious amount of heat as it goes through radioactive decay , so it 's often the fuel of choice for these NASA adventures , such as voyages to Saturn and beyond .

According to a Johns Hopkins planetary scientist , NASA has enough Plutonium left to fuel the next Mars Rover mission , and maybe enough to test out some new power generators .
After that , they need more scratch for more fuel .

The magnetic equivalent of electricity in a ‘ spin ice ’ material : atom sized north and south poles in spin ice drift in opposite directions when a magnetic field is applied .
Credit : UCL /LCN
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A magnetic charge can behave and interact just like an electric charge in some materials , according to new research led by the London Centre for Nanotechnology .
The findings could lead to a reassessment of current magnetism theories , as well as significant technological advances .
The research , published today in Nature , proves the existence of atom - sized ‘ magnetic charges ’ that behave and interact just like more familiar electric charges .
It also demonstrates a perfect symmetry between electricity and magnetism - a phenomenon dubbed ‘ magnetricity ’ by the authors from the LCN and the Science and Technology Facility Council ’s ISIS Neutron and Muon Source .
In order to prove experimentally the existence of magnetic current for the first time , the team mapped Onsager ’s 1934 theory of the movement of ions in water onto magnetic currents in a material called spin ice .
They then tested the theory by applying a magnetic field to a spin ice sample at a very low temperature and observing the process using muons at ISIS .
The experiment allowed the team to detect magnetic charges in the spin ice ( Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 ) , to measure their currents , and to determine the elementary unit of the magnetic charge in the material .
The monopoles they observed arise as disturbances of the magnetic state of the spin ice , and can exist only inside the material .
Professor Steve Bramwell , LCN co-author of the paper , said : “ Magnetic monopoles were first predicted to exist in 1931 , but despite many searches , they have never yet been observed as freely roaming elementary particles .
These monopoles do at least exist within the spin ice sample , but not outside .
“ It is not often in the field of physics you get the chance to ask ‘ How do you measure something ? ’ and then go on to prove a theory unequivocally .
This is a very important step to establish that magnetic charge can flow like electric charge .
It is in the early stages , but who knows what the applications of magnetricity could be in 100 years time . ”
Professor Keith Mason , Chief Executive of STFC said : “ The unequivocal proof that magnetic charge is conducted in spin ice adds significantly to our understanding of electromagnetism .
Whilst we will have to wait to see what applications magnetricity will find in technology , this research shows that curiosity driven research will always have the potential to make an impact on the way we live and work .
Advanced materials research depends greatly on having access to central research labs like ISIS allowing the UK science community to flourish and make exciting discoveries like this . ”
Dr Sean Giblin , instrument scientist at ISIS and co-author of the paper , added : “ The results were astounding , using muons at ISIS we are finally able to confirm that magnetic charge really is conducted through certain materials at certain temperatures - just like the way ions conduct electricity in water . ”

Back in 2005 I was working at Fastclick.com ( now ValueclickMedia ) and we found out that Microsoft had just settled with a company called Eolas that claimed to have invented the browser plugin , and that the net effect of the settlement was that Microsoft would patch Internet Explorer to require a click to activate content rendered by a plugin if — and only if — the embedded html code was staticly included in the web page or created by code included in the web page ( e.g. produced via JavaScript document.write ( ) calls ) .
Did you get that ?
Let me try to make it clearer :
< html > ... < embed ... > ... </ html > fails , the embed code is in the page itself .
< html > ... < script > document.write ('< embed ... >') ;</script > ... </ html > also fails , the embed code is created by javascript in the page itself .
< html > ... < script src=" write_embed.js " ></ script > ... </html > works !
And by “ fails ” I mean that instead of your plugin stuff appearing you get a dotted frame and a “ click to activate ” message .
( Note that ads are delivered as linked JavaScript ( no problem ) , server - side JavaScript ( problem ) , and HTML to iframes ( problem ) .
Also note that Adobe has since modified the way it publishes Flash to html — adding a separate .js file to do the embedding . )
Now web advertising , as it was conceived in the late 90s ( which is largely the technology we ’re still stuck with ) is a primitive beast .
I wo n’t go into details but it ’s sufficiently primitive that most flash ads are stored in ad network databases as HTML or JavaScript that writes HTML at page load ( one of the most annoying things about coding for browsers ) .
And most of this code was written by people with no clue what they ’re doing using random versions of Dreamweaver , Flash , or Notepad .
The point is that you ca n’t just fix your single “ embed flash.js ” file , but you need to spelunk tens of thousands of pieces of adcode and rewrite them all , or do something clever .
I ended up doing something clever , which was a simple script that trolled the page it was in for Flash ads , ripped them out , and then put them back in again ( but now , because they ’d been inserted by JavaScript not directly in the page , no Eolas Bug ) .
Now , implementing the Eolas Bug was presumably no mean feat — I guess it works off the same metadata JavaScript sandboxing has to use to decide which script can see and talk to whom .
Anyway , moving right along …
Now Eolas is suing a whole bunch of people over the same patent .
I hate software patents .
I do n’t even like them when they ’re being used to screw Microsoft .
But I particularly hate it when someone buys a patent ( this patent was originally awarded to the University of California ) , sits on it for years , and then starts suing people over it — having done nothing useful with it or anything else in the meantime .
But let ’s take a look at this patent on its merits :
A system allowing a user of a browser program on a computer connected to an open distributed hypermedia system to access and execute an embedded program object .
The program object is embedded into a hypermedia document much like data objects ( 1 ) .
The user may select the program object from the screen ( 2 ) .
Once selected the program object executes on the user ’s ( client ) computer or may execute on a remote server or additional remote computers in a distributed processing arrangement ( 3 ) .
After launching the program object , the user is able to interact with the object as the invention provides for ongoing interprocess communication between the application object ( 4 ) ( program ) and the browser program .
One application of the embedded program object allows a user to view large and complex multi-dimensional objects from within the browser ’s window .
The user can manipulate a control panel to change the viewpoint used to view the image .
The invention allows a program to execute on a remote server or other computers to calculate the viewing transformations and send frame data to the client computer thus providing the user of the client computer with interactive features and allowing the user to have access to greater computing power than may be available at the user ’s client computer ( 5 ) .
I ’ve labeled what seem to me to be the main claims in the abstract .
( I will get to the specific claims — er claim — later , and IANAL let alone a patent lawyer ) .
Note that a lot of text — none of it bold — is devoted to implementing something like VRML but rendered on the server — I do n’t think they ’ll be suing anyone over that nugget .
My initial reaction to this is that it ’s not how browsers work at all , but on rereading perhaps what they mean by “ embedded ” is “ linked ” ( after all , both data objects and plugins are linked to web pages , not actually embedded in them ) .
The devil may be in the details here .
Nope , the user does no such thing .
This kind of describes networked computing for which there is ample prior art .
This is important — browsers do pass event information to plugins , and plugins do tell browsers how to draw pages etc .
This is exactly the opposite of what plugins do .
Plugins let you do stuff on the client specifically to avoid wasting CPU time on the server and / or bandwidth .
So , based on the abstract , one claim is utterly trivial and covered by ridiculous amounts of prior art , item 1 is possibly interesting , item 4 is right on the mark and the others are utterly irrelevant .
But then from what I can see patent lawsuits , especially software patent lawsuits , often seem to hinge on some tiny nook or cranny of a patent that seems to have no real relevance to the thing described in total .
Let ’s look at item 4 , communication between the browser and the plugin .
This seems like it might have some legs .
Did anyone before 1994 have a neat mechanism for automagically embedding arbitrary data with arbitrary software to handle it inside a container program ?
This sounds a lot like SGML conceptually , and it also sounds a lot like a really exciting and innovative type of technology that turned out to be a giant stinking turd : OpenDoc .
While no - one remembers OpenDoc particularly fondly , it was a shipping piece of software , it ran — often for minutes — without crashing , and it did some pretty remarkable things .
You could open a document comprising a collection of pieces of data for which you might or might not have specific editor or viewer components , and the OpenDoc framework would just deal with it .
It would allow the components ( “ editors ” or “ viewers ” ) to tell it which kinds of data they could handle , and events were passed back and forth ( to allow editing , obviously ) .
What ’s more , conceptually , OpenDoc was very much inspired by other shipping programs such as PageMaker and Quark XPress which had their own plugin architectures which did similar ( but less general ) things .
Since OpenDoc shipped in 1992 , and was in development for years beforehand , I think it ’s safe to say that Apple has prior art up the wazoo .
So , good - bye item 4 .
And of course OpenDoc worked just fine across a network .
In fact , Apple shipped a web browser component for OpenDoc ( Cyberdog ) which was perhaps the most well - loved feature of OpenDoc and the only thing most users missed when Apple finally scrapped it .
OK , so back to item 1 .
Let ’s drill down into the blow - by - blow claims in the patent ’s body .
Actually the two meatiest and most incomprehensible chunks of text pertain to the first point , so let ’s take a look at first and slightly more comprehensible chunk :
… a browser application , that parses a first distributed hypermedia document to identify text formats included in said distributed hypermedia document and for responding to predetermined text formats to initiate processing specified by said text formats ; utilizing said browser to display , on said client workstation , at least a portion of a first hypermedia document received over said network from said server , wherein the portion of said first hypermedia document is displayed within a first browser - controlled window on said client workstation , wherein said first distributed hypermedia document includes an embed text format , located at a first location in said first distributed hypermedia document , that specifies the location of at least a portion of an object external to the first distributed hypermedia document , wherein said object has type information associated with it utilized by said browser to identify and locate an executable application external to the first distributed hypermed ia document , and wherein said embed text format is parsed by said browser to automatically invoke said executable application to execute on said client workstation in order to display said object and enable interactive processing of said object within a display area created at said first location within the portion of said first distributed hypermedia document being displayed in said first browser - controlled window .
In other words , the “ embedded ” data object has “ type information ” used to pick the external plugin that displays and allows interaction with its data in a display area in the browser window .
This appears to be the single thing on which they are basing their lawsuit .
It ’s no small thing , but it does seem to me to be obvious .
After all , how do browsers handle links to non-textual embedded data that does n’t require a plugin .
The only major example in 1995 was images , e.g. gifs and jpegs .
These were , and are , embedded using < img > tags which contain a URL ( here ’s where the actual image data is ) and dimensioning information ( here ’s the width and height ) .
< img > tags do n’t contain any real metadata beyond themselves ( I ’m an < img > tag , which connotes I refer to an image ) and — arguably — the “ filename extension ” at the end of their src URL ( which is often garbage ) .
Now , browsers do n’t render images themselves , as a rule , they call on external libraries or the operating system to do it .
So an < img > tag is basically saying “ here ’s a link to some image data , and this is how big I ’d like you to render it ” and the browser gets this information and calls external software to render it .
Images are n’t interactive , so that ’s not covered — but OpenDoc and PageMaker and so forth have interprocess event handling covered in spades .
So let ’s suppose you ’re a programmer and you know about < img > tags and it occurs to you that there ’s no way to embed QuickTime movies ( say ) in your web page .
And no way to handle Illustrator files .
And no way to display 3D models .
What to do ?
Any decent programmer is going to immediately consider coming up with a new kind of tag for each kind of document , and then replace the code that handles < img > tags with a huge switch statement somewhere and decide this sounds like hard work and bad architecture .
Abandoning the totally obvious — but obviously bad — solution , the next most obvious solution is to invent a generic embed tag and move the information connoted by the tag ’s name ( “ img ” ) into the attributes of the tag itself ( e.g. type = ” image ” ) .
And , again obviously , expecting the browser to be modified and recompiled every time we pull a new media type out of our asses is stupid , so let ’s generalize the “ get the OS to render it ” side of things by mapping types to specific pieces of software ( “ plugins ” ) .
Oh , and the data might be interactive ( e.g. movies need a play button and they need to be refreshed more often than images ) so we ’ll need to pass events to and fro.
OMG call up the patent attorney .
The only thing missing from OpenDoc was the ability to embed a url for downloading the “ part editor ” you need if you do n’t already have it .
OK , that may be genuinely novel .
But how is it also not obvious given this is web browsers we ’re talking about .
I did n’t use OpenDoc for much serious work , so I do n’t remember what OpenDoc did when you opened a document containing parts for which you lacked editors — I know it coped , but I ca n’t remember exactly how much information it provided you with .
If it told you something about the component needed to deal with the part and from whom it might be obtained , then Apple even has prior art for this .
It ’s easy to claim something is obvious in hindsight .
I think I ’ve demonstrated that — at the very least —
OpenDoc represents prior art for almost everything in the patent ( even the minutiae ) .
If OpenDoc documents were web pages , and OpenDoc data embedding automatically included a way to obtain ( download ) the software required to handle it ( and — arguably — it did , just not URLs since OpenDoc was n’t a web browser ) then this patent would be completely meaningless .
( And , frankly , if web pages were OpenDoc documents it would be pretty awesome — if OpenDoc were still around and did n’t suck . )
Corrections / Amendments
After looking over more documents , it looks like the correct chronology is more like Publish and Subscribe ( part of System 7.x ) and OLE ( Windows 3.x ) were 1990 - 1991 , OLE II ( Windows 95 ) and OpenDoc ( System 7.5 ) were being specced in 1992 , both shipping in the 1994 -1995 timeframe .
( But again , in - house stuff will predate this significantly . )
And OpenDoc was ( eventually ) part of a huge ( unwieldy ) anti-Microsoft alliance , so all of its concepts were very widely and openly documented long before it shipped .
Acknowledgements
I got the screenshot from this article on MacTech — I hope they do n’t mind .
It sure beats reinstalling OpenDoc on an old Mac. Ugh .
I also found this really interesting paper written by people on the OpenDoc team .
It ’s a sobering reminder of how brilliant , idealistic , thoughtful people can produce really terrible software .
It also failed to address the question of how OpenDoc handled missing editors .
Maybe I will have to find an old Mac and reinstall it .
Well ?
How much cute is I ?

Q : Why is a Harvest Moon so Large ?
A : It is n't really .
You can test this by quantitative measurement : you can always cover up the moon with your pinkie held at arm 's length .
Slightly more quantitative : punch holes of various graduated sizes in a piece of thick ( opaque ) paper .
Hold the paper at arm 's length and look through the various holes at the moon until you find the hole that is just barely bigger than the moon .
This hole is valid when the moon is just rising and also when the moon is very high in the sky .
Best of all : take two photographs , one at moonrise , the other several hours later .
Providing you did n't overexpose , when the film is developed you will be able to measure the angular diameters of both moons with a ruler .
Q : OK , then why does a harvest moon LOOK so big ?
A : When the moon is on the horizon , we see it AND a bunch of reference objects at the same time .
Our brains are wired to recognize relative scale , so when we see the moon behind ol ' Farmer McCarthy 's barn our brains recognize that the moon is distant and hence quite large .
When we see the moon high in the sky , there is no other information , so all our brains can figure out is that the moon is about as big as a pinkie held at arm 's length .
We can illustrate this as follows :
In the first picture , the two lines are of equal length , but do not appear so to the eye !
The two lines are parallel to each other , and both are straight .
All figures are the same size .
Both rectangles are the same size .
It is the last image that perhaps most closely approximates the " Harvest Moon " illusion .
The " distant " rectangle appears on the horizon of a geometric landscape and so " looks " much larger .

Maged Shamdy 's ancestors arrived on the shores of Lake Burrulus in the mid-19th century .
In the dusty heat of Cairo at the time , French industrialists were rounding up forced labour squads to help build the Suez Canal , back - breaking labour from which thousands did not return .
Like countless other Egyptians , the Shamdys abandoned their family home and fled north into the Nile Delta , where they could hide within the marshy swamplands that fanned out from the great river 's edge .
As the years passed , colonial rulers came and went .
But the Shamdys stayed , carving out a new life as farmers and fishermen on one of the most fertile tracts of land in the world .
A century and a half later , Maged is still farming his family 's fields .
In between taking up the rice harvest and dredging his irrigation canals , however , he must contemplate a new threat to his family and livelihood , one that may well prove more deadly than any of Egypt 's previous invaders .
" We are going underwater , " the 34 - year - old says simply .
" It 's like an occupation : the rising sea will conquer our lands . "
Maged understands better than most the menace of coastal erosion , which is steadily ingesting the edge of Egypt in some places at an astonishing rate of almost 100 m a year .
Just a few miles from his home lies Lake Burrulus itself , where Nile flower spreads all the way out to trees on the horizon .
Those trunks used to be on land ; now they stand knee - deep in water .
Maged 's imperial imagery may sound overblown , but travel around Egypt 's vast , overcrowded Delta region and you hear the same terms used time and again to describe the impact climate change is having on these ancient lands .
Egypt 's breadbasket is littered with the remnants of old colonisers , from the Romans to the Germans , and today its 50 million inhabitants jostle for space among the crumbling forts and cemeteries of those who sought to subjugate them in the past .
On the Delta 's eastern border , in Port Said , an empty stone plinth is all that remains of a statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps , the man who built the Suez Canal ; somewhere along the Delta 's westernmost reaches , the long - lost tomb of Cleopatra lies buried .
With such a rich history of foreign rule , it 's only natural that the latest hostile force knocking at the gates should be couched in the language of occupation .
" Egypt is a graveyard for occupiers , " observes Ramadan el - Atr , a fruit farmer near the antiquated town of Rosetta , where authorities have contracted a Chinese company to build a huge wall of concrete blocks in the ocean to try to save any more land from melting away .
" Just like the others , the sea will come and go – but we will always survive . "
Scientists are n't so sure .
Two years ago , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared Egypt 's Nile Delta to be among the top three areas on the planet most vulnerable to a rise in sea levels , and even the most optimistic predictions of global temperature increase will still displace millions of Egyptians from one of the most densely populated regions on earth .
The Delta spills out from the northern stretches of the capital into 10,000 square miles of farmland fed by the Nile 's branches .
It is home to two - thirds of the country 's rapidly growing population , and responsible for more than 60 % of its food supply : Egypt relies unconditionally on it for survival .
But with its 270 km of coastline lying at a dangerously low elevation ( large parts are between zero and 1 m above sea level , with some areas lying below it ) , any melting of the polar ice caps could see its farmland and cities – including the historical port of Alexandria – transformed into an ocean floor .
A 1 m rise in the sea level , which many experts think likely within the next 100 years , will cause 20 % of the Delta to go underwater .
At the other extreme , the 14 m rise that would result from the disappearance of Greenland and western Antarctica would leave the Mediterranean lapping at the northern suburbs of Cairo , with practically all of the Delta underwater .
Already , a series of environmental crises are parking themselves on the banks of the Nile .
Some are subtle , like the river 's quiet vanishing act in the Delta 's northern fields ; others , like the dramatic collapse of coastal lands into the ocean , are more striking .
Major flooding is yet to become a reality but , from industrial pollution to soil salinity , a whole new set of interconnected green concerns is now forcing its way into Egyptian public discourse for the first time .
" The Delta is a kind of Bangladesh story , " says Dr Rick Tutwiler , director of the American University in Cairo 's Desert Development Centre .
" You 've got a massive population , overcrowding , a threat to all natural resources from the pressure of all the people , production , pollution , cars and agricultural chemicals .
And on top of all that , there 's the rising sea .
It 's the perfect storm . "
Follow the Nile north out of Cairo on the old agricultural road , and you find it hard to pinpoint where the city ends and the lotus - shaped Delta begins .
Carpeted with redbrick apartment blocks and spliced with streets in every direction , the lush greenery of the Nile 's splintered arteries is almost impossible to appreciate in isolation .
This is where the urban and the rural get lost in each other , with livestock living in doorways and workers camping out in fields .
In the past , literary giants venerated the Delta 's wild marshlands ; today , any clear - cut divisions between the metropolis and the countryside have long faded away .
Urban encroachment – the steady chipping away at arable land through unauthorised construction – haunts the Delta everywhere you look .
Despite a web of legislation outlawing illegal building practices and theoretically " fencing off " agricultural land , in every direction the sweeping vista of wheat fields and rice paddies always ends abruptly in a cluster of half - built homes .
There are more than 4,000 people per square mile in the Delta ; it 's hard to think of any other place where humans and the environment around them are more closely intertwined .
With Egypt 's present - day population of 83 million set to increase to more than 110 million in the next two decades , the seemingly unstoppable spread of bricks and mortar over the soil is both the most visible symptom of the country 's demographic time - bomb and an inevitable response to it .
More people in the Delta means more cars , more pollution and less land to feed them all on , just at a time when increased crop production is needed most .
Yet the desertification of land through human habitation is , worryingly , only the beginning of the problem .
Although few in the Delta have noticed it yet , the freshwater of the Nile – which has enabled Egypt to survive as a unified state longer than any other territory on earth – is creaking under the strain of this population boom .
The world 's most famous river has provided the backdrop to all manner of dramas throughout history , real and fictional .
Now , around its northernmost branches where the minarets and pylons thin out and the landscape becomes more windswept , another is playing out to devastating effect .
The villain is salinity .
I visit one of the worst - affected regions , Kafr el - Sheikh , on a Friday morning when the fields have emptied out for the noon prayer .
The streets are eerily silent ; with its people gone , the area takes on the appearance of one of Italo Calvino 's fantastical string cities , chock - a- block with the shells of human habitation but no living souls remaining .
The exception is Maged , who owns six feddan ( about six acres ) of land near the village of el - Hadadi .
Maged is halfway down a hole when I approach his house .
Clambering out apologetically , he explains that German experts visited this area last year and declared that the fresh water being pumped to local villages " was n't fit for a dog to drink " .
After months of phone calls to the national water company , none of which were answered , Maged decided to lay down a new set of pipes himself in the hope it would improve the quality of drinking water for his two young daughters .
It 's hot , exhausting work , which he fits in between his farming duties and a new part - time job as an accountant in a local alfalfa plant .
" We do n't have much time on our hands at the moment , " Maged says , dusting himself off and gulping down some fresh melon juice .
" Nobody can make a living solely off the land any more . "
On a tour of his fields , I see why .
The rich brown soil has greyed out in recent years , leaving a barren salt - encrustation on the surface .
The cause is underground saltwater intrusion from the nearby coast , which pushes up through the soil and kills off roots .
Coastal farmland has always been threatened by saltwater , but salinity has traditionally been kept at bay by plentiful supplies of fresh water gushing over the soil and flushing out the salt .
It used to happen naturally with the Nile 's seasonal floods ; after the construction of Egypt 's High Dam in the 70s ( one of the most ambitious engineering projects on earth ) , these seasonal floods came to an end , but a vast network of irrigation canals continued to bring gallons of fresh water to the people who worked the land , the fellahin , ensuring salinity levels remained low .
Today , however , Nile water barely reaches this corner of the Delta .
Population growth has sapped its energy upstream , and what " freshwater " does make it downriver is increasingly awash with toxins and other impurities .
Farmers such as Maged now essentially rely on waste water – a mix of agricultural drainage and sewage – from the nearby town of Sidi Salim .
The result is plummeting fertility ; local farmers say that whereas their fathers spent just a handful of Egyptian pounds on chemicals to keep the harvests bountiful , they now have to put aside between 25 and 80 % of their profits for fertilisers just to keep their crops alive .
" We can see with our own eyes that the water is no good , it 's less and less pure , " Maged says .
He points out huge swaths of neighbouring land that once glimmered with rice paddies ; recently they have been dug up and replaced by fish farms , the ground too barren for crop cultivation .
Further out , in the village of Damru , the green fields of 10 years ago are cracked and brown , now put into service as informal football pitches and rubbish dumps .
Experts believe the problem is only going to get worse .
" We currently have a major water deficit in Egypt , with only 700 cubic metres of freshwater per person , " explains Professor Salah Soliman of Alexandria University .
" That 's already short of the 1,000 cubic metres per person the UN believes is the minimum needed for water security .
Now , with the population increase , it will drop to 450 cubic metres per person – and this is all before we take into account the impact of climate change . "
That impact is likely to be a 70 % drop in the amount of Nile water reaching the Delta over the next 50 years , due to increased evaporation and heavier demands on water use upstream .
The consequences of all these ecological changes on food production are staggering : experts at Egypt 's Soils , Water and Environment Research Institute predict that wheat and maize yields could be down 40 % and 50 % respectively in the next 30 years , and that farmers who make a living off the land will lose around $ 1,000 per hectare for each degree rise in the average temperature .
The farmers here feel abandoned by the state ; there are regular dismissive references to the " New Age " , a euphemism for the much - hated regime of President Hosni Mubarak , whose neoliberal reform programmes and widespread corruption scandals have provoked a wave of popular discontent across the country .
This disconnect between the state and its people has led to distrust of government scientists who think coastal erosion , rather than freshwater scarcity , is the main reason for the farmers ' problems .
And , in a worrying twist for Egypt 's creaking economy , the erosion is n't only affecting farmers .
" Unfortunately , most of our industry and investment has been built on sites very close to the shore , " says Soliman .
" There 's only so much water we can hold back . "
Ras el - Bar is a small holiday resort at the mouth of the Nile 's Damietta branch .
This was the summer paradise that Nobel prizewinning novelist Naguib Mahfouz 's well - heeled characters would escape to when the heat of the capital became unbearable ; today its squat pink lighthouse and endless boulevards of deserted , low - rise holiday homes have the faded feel of a 50s Disneyland .
Although still popular in July and August , Ras el - Bar has been overtaken as a seaside destination by the brash consumerism of a new generation of towns : Sharm el - Sheikh , Marina , Hurghada .
In place of tourists , however , new factories have arrived here in abundance , including some that nearby residents believe are poisoning the air .
The arrival of one industrial plant in Damietta , which coincided with the ministry of environment 's last - minute decision not to designate the area a protected nature reserve , is a familiar story of shady backdoor deals , public outrage and the studious disregard of local opinions .
In this case , the locals managed to postpone the factory 's construction , but other plants remain .
" In the morning here you can see nothing but smoke , " says Mohammed Fawzia , who is fishing in a canal down by the side of an industrial complex run by the state - owned Mopco company .
" Take photos of it for us so we can show who is killing our children .
We want the factories gone . "
Many Cairo - based experts , however , insist that the task of coping with the dramatic ecological changes faced by the Delta is made harder by the ignorance of people such as Mohammed .
They claim the fellahin are too uneducated to change their ways .
But they are wrong : while farmers in the southern Delta , where Nile water is still relatively plentiful , have little knowledge of climate change , those in the north are painfully aware of the science behind the death of their land .
However , they also have little time to listen to the harrying of a government which is widely seen to preach green rhetoric on the one hand but is only too willing to sell out the environment on the other , along with the local people .
Money talks in Egypt , and sustainable development is forgotten when the interests of the rich and powerful – such as the industrial plants in Damietta or the influential Badrawi clan in Daqahliyah – are at stake .
The repression and self - interest of Mubarak 's inner circle have left them bereft of any moral authority on environmental issues .
And while scientists , academics and community organisers are making a concerted effort to educate Egyptians about the dangers of climate change , there is confusion over whether the focus of all these programmes should be on promoting ways to combat climate change , or on accepting climate change as inevitable and instead encouraging new forms of adaptation to the nation 's uncertain ecological future .
Efforts are further hampered by a popular feeling that this is a crisis made by the west .
" We 're not responsible for climate change , " says Soliman , pointing out that Egypt 's contribution to global carbon emissions is an underwhelming 0.5 % , nine times less per capita than the US .
" But unfortunately the consequence of climate change is no respecter of national borders . "
The scale of the crisis – more people , less land , less water , less food – is overwhelming , and has infected discussion of climate change with a toxic combination of cynicism and fatalism at every level .
There are senior environmental officials in top scientific jobs here who do not believe climate change is real ; others are convinced the problem is so great that human intervention is useless .
" It 's down to God , " one environmental officer for a major Delta town tells me .
" If the Delta goes we 'll find new places to live .
If Egypt was big enough for Mary and Joseph , then it will be big enough for all of us . "
Of course , if sea levels do rise significantly , " then the debate is over , " says Dr Tutwiler .
" The land will be underwater and crop production will be over . "
As a result , many now believe that Egypt 's future lies far away from the Delta , in land newly reclaimed from the desert .
Since the time of the pharaohs , when the Delta was first farmed , Egypt 's political leaders have rested their legitimacy on their ability to feed it by taming the Nile .
Mohammed Ali , Lord Cromer and Gamal Abdel Nasser all launched major projects to control and harness the river 's seasonal floods ; now Mubarak is following in their footsteps – not by saving the Delta , but by creating a bewildering array of canals and pumping stations that draw water out from the Nile into sandy valleys to the east and west , where the desert is slowly being turned green .
You can see evidence of these new lands on the Delta 's fringes ; mile upon mile of agri-business - owned fields peeking out behind the advertising billboards of the Cairo - Alexandria desert road .
The billboards depict gated compounds and luxury second homes , escapist dreams for the Egyptian upper - middle class .
The new lands behind them are another sort of escape , this time for the whole country .
Their very water - intensive existence is , though , only hastening the demise of the Delta ; once the glittering jewel of Egypt and bedrock of its survival , but now a region whose death warrant may already have been signed .

Alexandria :
An ancient city under threat
Alexandria has been through several reincarnations : as a small Pharaonic town in the 4th century BC , as the capital of Egypt for 1,000 years , and as a cosmopolitan melting - ground in the early 20th century .
While most of its former glories are already lying on the seabed , scientists now fear the city 's outer fringes could be among the first victims of any rise in sea levels .
A rise of only 1 m will leave the city centre cut off from the mainland .
If it does disappear , its literary chroniclers may provide some comfort .
Lawrence Durrell called it " the capital of memory " , a city where recollections stay " clinging to the minds of old men like traces of perfume upon a sleeve " .
The Greek poet Constantine Cavafy shared Durrell 's sense of being trapped by history .
In what may prove a remarkable piece of foresight , he wrote in The City :
You 'll find no new places , you wo n't find other shores .
The city will follow you .
The streets in which you pace
will be the same , you 'll haunt the same familiar places ,
and inside those same houses you 'll grow old .
You 'll always end up in this city .
Do n't bother to hope
for a ship .
Editor 's note : Steve Clemons directs the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation and publishes The Washington Note , a popular political blog .
Steve Clemons says the Nobel panel correctly decided Obama 's approach to diplomacy holds great promise .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Cynics will say that Oslo was jealous that Copenhagen , Denmark , scored a visit from President Obama , and giving him a Nobel was the only way to get him to Norway .
But the Nobel Committee 's decision to make Obama the only sitting U.S. president since Woodrow Wilson to receive the Nobel Peace Prize shows the committee 's clear - headed assessment that Obama 's " unclenched fist " approach to dealing with the world 's most thuggish leaders has had a constructive , systemic impact on the world 's expectations of itself .
Obama has helped citizens all around the world -- including in the United States -- to want a world beyond the mess we have today in the Middle East and South Asia .
They want a world where America is benign and positive , and where other leaders help in supporting the struggles of their people for better lives rather than securing themselves through crude power .
Obama has found a way in this interconnected world of cell phones , Twitter , Facebook and other social networking to reach a majority of the world 's citizens with his message of hope for a better world .
He speaks past the dictators to regular people and has , on the whole , raised global political expectations about everything from climate change to nuclear nonproliferation in ways that no one in history has done before .
Americans tend to look at everything from a U.S. - centric lens , and many woke up this morning shocked that Obama , who just saw a lot of his political capital wasted on trying to secure the 2016 Olympics for his hometown of Chicago , has gotten a fresh injection of sizzle to fill the Obama bubble .
The world has been mesmerized by Obama since he started to run for the presidency .
The battle between Hillary Clinton and Obama for the Democratic nomination did more to educate the rest of the world about real political choice -- and about a system in which no candidates had an automatic lock on victory -- than any USAID program could have achieved .
Obama 's decision to make the ulcerous Israeli - Palestinian negotiations one of the first foreign policy challenges of his administration , rather than the last , defied most seasoned analysts ' expectations .
His message to Iran 's citizens , marking the Persian new year holiday of Nowruz , and his powerful and captivating speech in Cairo , Egypt , communicated to Muslims all around the world that their lives and their faith and their expectations for a better world were vital and as valid as any others .
From his perch in the White House , Barack Obama affirmed the humanity of Muslims and told them that America does value Muslim lives .
Obama 's posture and rhetoric have reversed the collapse of hope and trust that the world 's citizens had in America and stopped the degradation of America 's image during the tenure of George W. Bush and Richard Cheney .
Should a U.S. president get the Nobel Peace Prize if he 's about to send more U.S. troops , armed drones , bombs , tanks and other military hardware into the war - ripped zones in Afghanistan ?
Or should Obama get the prize if he has n't even succeeded in getting Israeli - Palestinian negotiations going ?
Or if he has n't gotten Iran to drop its nuclear ambitions and to re-enter the international system on constructive terms ?
The answer is yes .
I think that given how the odds were already so stacked against Obama on the global economic and security fronts , one can only be amazed at what this unlikely and fascinating president has done with " optics . "
The night before Obama 's inauguration , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel accepted my congratulations and responded , " It 's going to be tough , and right now we can only change the optics , " meaning that political perceptions and appearances could be changed more quickly than hard realities .
What is brilliant about Obama and why he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is that he is a global leader who clearly saw the gains that could be made in changing " the optics " of the global order , upgrading the level of respect between the United States and other nations , making a point of listening to other leaders .
Obama saw that before the world could move to a more stable and better global equilibrium , it had to believe it could -- and this is what Obama has done in ways that no other leader has in memory .
Obama will still make mistakes .
Leaders will still wrestle with him .
Hard choices and the gravity of war will still generate challenges for Obama 's leadership .
But the Nobel Prize Committee has shrewdly given a key down payment for a kind of leadership it wants to see from the U.S. for many more years and given Obama another tool to help craft a new global social contract between the United States and other responsible stakeholders in the international system .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Clemons .
All About Nobel Peace Prize • Barack Obama
German novelist Herta Müller , who received death threats in her native Romania after she refused to become an informant for the secret police during Ceausescu 's totalitarian regime , has become only the 12th woman in 108 years to win the Nobel prize for literature .
Praised by the Nobel judges for depicting the " landscape of the dispossessed " with " the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose " , Müller returns constantly to the oppression , dictatorship and exile of her own life in her novels , essays and poems .
In a statement this afternoon Müller said she was " delighted " by the award , and " still could n't believe it " .
Worth 10 m Swedish kronor ( £ 893,000 ) , the Nobel is awarded to " the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction " , as described in Alfred Nobel 's will of 1895 .
According to the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy , Peter Englund , Müller 's " moral momentum " means she fits the criteria for the award " perfectly " .
" On one hand she 's an excellent author with truly fantastic language , " he said , " and on the other she has the capacity of really giving you a sense of what it 's like to live in a dictatorship , also what it 's like to be part of a minority in another country and what it 's like to be an exile . "
Englund also praised Muller 's " extreme precision with words " .
" She has been living in a dictatorship which constantly misused and abused language , and this has forced a sort of scepticism in her regarding the use of words , the use of language , " he said .
" She has a very , very fine - tuned precision in her language . "
He advised readers new to Muller to start with her novel Herztier ( published in English as The Land of Green Plums ) , which he said many considered to be her best novel .
Her latest novel , Atemschaukel ( Everything I Possess I Carry With Me ) , was " absolutely breathtaking , " he added .
Born in Romania in 1953 , Müller refused to cooperate with Ceausescu's Securitate , lost her job as a teacher and was the subject of repeated threats until she emigrated in 1987 .
She now lives in Berlin , where she has been the recipient of a multitude of literary awards , including Germany 's most prestigious , the Kleist prize , the Frankz Kafka and the 100,000 euro ( £ 85,000 ) Impac award for Hertzier .
The story of five young Romanians living under Ceausescu 's dictatorship , Müller has said that she wrote it " in memory of my Romanian friends who were killed under the Ceausescu regime " , and that she " felt it was my duty " .
The New York Times called it " a novel of graphically observed detail in which the author seeks to create a sort of poetry out of the spiritual and material ugliness of life in Communist Romania " .
Although Müller left Romania over 20 years ago , she returns constantly to the themes of oppression , exile and dictatorship in her novels and poems , which also include The Appointment , about a young woman during Ceausescu 's regime who works in a clothes factory , and sews notes into the suits of men bound for Italy , saying " marry me " .
Der Fuchs war damals schon der Jäger , published in English as The Passport , follows the story of a village miller in a German - speaking Romanian village , who applies for permission to emigrate to West Germany .
Published in August , Atemschaukel follows a 17 - year - old boy who is deported to a Ukrainian labour camp .
Shortlisted for the German book prize , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it " phenomenal , moving and humbling novel , perhaps the most memorable read of the autumn " .
" The most overwhelming experience for me was living under the dictatorial regime in Romania .
And simply living in Germany , hundreds of kilometres away , does not erase my past experience , " Müller has said .
" I packed up my past when I left , and remember that dictatorships are still a current topic in Germany . "
Pete Ayrton , who has published Müller in translation at Serpent 's Tail , said he was " absolutely thrilled " at the news .
" It 's terrific and I think it shows the Nobel prize are doing their job to bring the writings of wonderful , neglected writers , who are underappreciated in the Anglo Saxon world , to our attention " he said .
" She is from the German minority in Romania and from that experience , she writes extraordinary accounts of being an ethnic minority in a totalitarian regime .
But this is not overtly political writing ; it 's very poetic and elliptical .
She 's an extraordinary writer . "
The Nobel prize winner is selected by 18 members of the Swedish Academy , who receive around 200 nominations at the start of the year , whittling this down to a secret shortlist of five and then choosing their winner , who must receive more than half of the votes cast .
Müller becomes its 106th winner ; last year French novelist JMG Le Clézio won , cited for his " new departures , poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy " , and for exploring " a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization " .

Greater awareness leads to greater action .
The more we are aware of each aspect of our life , the better equipped we become when making decisions and solving problems – which is a pretty often occurrence in our daily world … so why not spend the time to build the skills of living mindfully and fully conscious ?
Of course due to our limited cognitive resources we cannot be aware of everything simultaneously .
Instead , we must balance our awareness between different aspects of our lives : our career , our relationships , our health , and our happiness .
And finding a balance is rarely easy .
Within a period of time , it is easy to get in the habit of pouring too much focus into one aspect of our life while neglecting others .
We are always relating with the world in different ways , and by being better aware of our actions and their consequences we can improve upon our skills , act more purposefully , and build upon the world in a way that we want to see it .
Gaining knowledge and spreading it to others is the best way to expand awareness on various social , political , and environmental issues .
College campuses are some of the best mediums for this , where it is common to see protests regarding war , civil rights , abortion , cancer , poverty , the environment , and much more .
Newspapers , TVs , websites , blogs , and forums are all different tools to help spread awareness – to inform people on how to make better decisions .
They change people ’s lives , how they see the world , and how they behave .
Awareness can seem like a simple and harmless thing but it makes a real impact .
People love to blame commercialism , advertising , propaganda , and other societal pressures for the evils of society , but rarely do we take the responsibility or time to expand our awareness by making the effort to seek information about things that are not right in front of us .
Being more conscious of our world can seem inconvenient and often not worth the effort .
It wo n’t give you immediate pleasure or satisfaction like what you would get from eating a delicious dessert .
No , awareness takes effort and determination to understand the interests of both your self and others , but it is worth it as time will prove later on .
Stay dedicated to the pursuit of growth , knowledge , and conscious living ; but keep in mind your benefits will only be in proportion to your efforts .
Conscious living is not a belief but a skill .
With practice you can expand awareness in all areas of your life , both personal and social .
work on living mindfully , and remember each moment is a new opportunity to practice and improve your well - being .
This is one of the most empowering ideas one can instill in their behavior .

Dr. Ron Paul defies all conventional wisdom .
Conventional wisdom says that the Ron Paul boom would have blown over after the campaign ; he ’s just a fly in the ointment , a flash in the pan , a wisp in the election wind .
Well , well , time has proved Conventional Wisdom is just an oxymoron for morons .
So how did this obscure 11th term congressman from Texas defy the predictable batch of Washington play - by - the - rules candidates and raise more than $ 34 million seemingly out of nowhere ?
Conventional wisdom should suggest that this impressive haul would cause Paul to be taken seriously as a candidate .
Conventional wisdom errs again .
In the long run , Dr. Paul triumphed because he was the exception to the rulers .
He is the last of the breed .
As a small - government tight - money Republican this gynecologist - obstetrician ( 4,000 babies claimed as a career total ) regularly votes
No on pork barrel projects that would put money into his own district , came into the campaign with a conservative platform that blew everyone away : a return to the gold standard , abolition of the I.R.S. , a literal view of the Constitution .
His campaign was bare bones .
Then he started appearing in debates .
His emphatic grandfatherly presence and fierce opposition to the war in Iraq set him apart from his fellow Republicans .
Setting him even farther apart were ideas like blaming American foreign policy blowback for the attacks of 9/11 and abolishing the Federal Reserve .
If his campaign had taken place in the pre-Internet era , it might have gone the way of his 1988 Libertarian campaign for president , as a footnote to history .
But because of the Internet ’s low - cost ability to connect grass - roots supporters with one another — Mr. Paul ’s once - solo quest had taken on a life of its own .
It evolved from a figment of cyberspace into a traditional campaign , with yard signs , meet - ups , direct mail , old - fashioned rallies and good old American chutzpah .
Their goal was to agitate like in a washing machine , until all the dirt came out .
While the ditto heads cheered Giuliani and Romney , even though their speeches often veered into rhetorical culs - de-sac , the audience roared their support for torture and rule by emergency decree , Paul told the crowd and the TV cameras that No , torture is wrong and the Constitution is paramount .
Paul was asked if 9/11 changed anything .
US foreign policy , he answered , “ was a major contributing factor .
Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us ?
They attacked us because we 've been over there ; we 've been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
We 've been in the Middle East .
So right now we 're building an embassy in Iraq that 's bigger than the Vatican .
We 're building 14 permanent bases .
What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico ?
We would be objecting . ”
But even as Fox 's pundits tossed Paul on their devilled horns , the instant poll totted up the numbers .
Of the 40,000 viewers expressing an opinion , 29 % wrote in that Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney had done best .
Second was Ron Paul , with 25 % , barreling ahead of Giuliani with 19 % .
The most pro-war of the lot , McCain , got 5 % .
So now just when you thought it 's all been said about Ron Paul , along comes a crack team of Wisconsin - based cybernauts Chris Rye and Corey Kealiher , two deeply informed grassroots documentary filmmakers who produced the strikingly honest Inaugural DVD For Liberty : How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty to show why Dr. Paul inspired such a strong grassroots movement , unmatched in American history .
By filming the dedicated millions of Paul followers who made the Ron Paul Election Phenomenon , Rye and Kealiher produced a hard - knuckled , knockout DVD that lays bare Paul ’s fervent philosophy of sound money , stern non-interventionist foreign policy born of pragmatics not idealism , and individual liberty as defined by that holiest of American grails , the Constitution .
As with almost every cinema - verite subject , people in everyday action -- politics in particular -- reveal themselves with such absorbing originality , you do n't need a script .
It 's great to watch characters in For Liberty operating as most of us do -- by the seat of their pants .
This entertaining look under the tent flaps of the Paul campaign , For Liberty fairly bristles with the frenetic energy , flat - out fun and Southern - fried cunning that won so many hearts along the campaign trail .
For Liberty serves as a tour guide along the deeply flawed 2008 election trail , blowing the lid off of decades of secretive world - class cronyism and high finance fraud .
Confident and secure with his ideas , we watch Paul maneuver , spin and speechify with the best and worst of them , always a quiet eye in the political storm .
By contrast with the snake oil salesmen of the political establishment who sold their recycled wares to Middle America , Paul came off as the safe port in the political storm .
A significant portion of Paul ’s dedicated and mushrooming base was because of his fierce opposition to the Iraq war .
He alone among the Republican club of warhawk presidential candidates called a war is a war early on -- that the war was an anti-Constitutional betrayal of America 's interests -- and thereby stood out from the snarling pack .
Hence Paul was able to draw visceral antiwar support from both sides of the blurred ideological divide .
He inspired millions regardless of party affiliation , who believe in conditionally supporting their country all the time and their government only when it deserves it .
When Paul ’s campaign coffers swelled above and beyond his debate mates , the knives started to come out .
This is how politics in the US currently works , and it ’s not a pretty sight .
It has very little to do with democracy of the kind we might romanticize about and is idealized in the Declaration of Independence or the US Constitution .
What we really have is an oligarchy wrapped up in the trappings of democracy .
To the utter fury of the Republican organizers there was an intrusion of rational thought , in the person of Ron Paul , a US congressman from Texas they deemed a rank outsider .
Despite their snarling glances , Paul blew the lid off the WMD deception , the 9/11 blame game and the danger America faces as a result of the “ greatest military blunder in American history , ” the true character of his opponents and the absolute lie of their war on terror were laid bare for all to see .
And , rest assured , For Liberty is not about tired , old , right - versus - left political bickering and backstabbing .
No , it ’s about right vs. wrong , according to time - honored American values and the fundamental principals that 99 % of us chose to live and abide by .
Paul sees government as a clenched fist protecting corporate interests , maintaining economic hegemony through military might abroad while greasing the wheels for privileged elites to make money off the working majority at home .
This is a must - see DVD for all of us who treasure our unique American heritage .
With murmurings of another Ron Paul Presidential run in 2012 , For Liberty may be more important than ever .

The 21st century The 21st century began with the United States as the sole superpower in the absence of the Soviet Union , with China emerging as a potential superpower .
The debate over what should be done about fossil fuel pollution and alternative energy raged in the new century after most of the 20th century was marked by rapid industrial expansion .
As the Cold War was over and Islamic fundamentalist - related terrorism on the rise , the United States and its allies turned their attention to the Middle East .
Digital technology – in its early stages of mainstream use in the 1980s and 1990s – became widely adopted by most of the world , though concerns about stress and anti-sociality from the overuse of mobile phones , the Internet and related technologies remained controversial .
Over 1.5 billion people worldwide used the Internet by the end of the first decade and over 4 billion ( more than half the world 's population ) used cell phones .
A global financial downturn – triggered by a sub - prime mortgage crisis in the U.S. – resulted in soaring levels of personal and national debt .
Alongside this were ever - growing divides between rich and poor .
At the same time , citizens were becoming more and more aware of excessive surveillance , privacy intrusion and erosion of civil liberties by governments and the corporations influencing them .
A new set of crises would emerge in the 2020s .
Climate change was beginning to have a significant impact on worldwide commodities ; in particular , food and water supplies .
In the Middle East , Africa and elsewhere , growing instability led to a number of resource wars .
Perversely , the hunt for fossil fuels continued , with even the Arctic becoming a political and economic battleground as nations sought to claim the last remaining deposits .
The 2030s were marked by a rapid , worldwide shift towards clean energy , algae biofuel and other renewable sources – aided by startling breakthroughs in nanotechnology .
This was followed by progress in nuclear fusion , though widespread adoption would have to wait until later decades .
Despite this , conflict was now brewing around much of the world .
Africa , Asia and other regions were suffering mightily due to food shortages and a growing influx of refugees affected by climate change , resource wars and political instability .
Exponential advances in computing power – in parallel with genetics , nanotechnology and robotics – continued into the 2040s , leading to what many called the birth of " transhumanism " .
Ever smaller , more complex and sophisticated devices were becoming implantable and integrated within the human body – able to combat disease , enhance the senses and provide entertainment or communication in ways that simply were not possible before .
Geopolitics was undergoing a revolution too , with India now surpassing the U.S. in terms of economic power and even threatening to overtake China in the near future .
Mankind began to escape the confines of its crowded home planet with a permanent colony on Mars in the 2050s .
Even greater advances in computing power saw AI beginning to play a major role in business and government decisions .
Economic growth was now under severe strain , however , due to ecological impacts , resource scarcity , demographic trends , technological unemployment and other factors .
By 2060 , the world 's population had begun to level off and plateau .
This was partly a result of declining fertility rates ( aided by improvements in education and birth control ) , but also from significant numbers of deaths caused by deteriorating environmental conditions .
Entire nations were now being devastated by the effects of climate change .
Despite advances in technology , the fundamental problem remained that humanity was consuming too much , too fast , beyond what the Earth could sustainably provide .
Desperate attempts were made to improve carbon capture and geoengineering methods , but the sheer magnitude of this crisis would persist for decades to come .
The 2070s saw major growth in the use of fusion power .
Accelerated space development also marked this time , with expansion of the lunar colonies and their automated mining operations .
By now , a full - scale environmental catastrophe was unfolding on Earth , with sea levels forcing the large - scale evacuation of cities .
With continuing advances in AI , the 2080s saw an explosion in scientific discoveries .
This helped to slow the rise in global temperatures and pave the way for a more sustainable future in the 22nd century .
Transhumanism was now a mainstream phenomenon , the average citizen becoming heavily reliant on brain - computer interfaces and other implantable devices , contributing to a decline in religious adherence .
By the 2090s , it became clear that Homo sapiens were no longer the dominant species on the planet .
Much of the day - to - day running of world affairs was now handled exclusively by ultra-fast , ultra - intelligent machines , robots and virtual entities .
Hockey fans in Phoenix must like what they 've seen during the Coyotes ' first three games on the road .
Team President and Chief Operating Officer Douglas Moss announced Thursday that the team 's home opener against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday night is sold out .
" The fan response to the ' Welcome Back WhiteOut ' offer has been tremendous and we'd like to thank everyone for their support , " Moss said .
The Coyotes , who won at Los Angeles and Pittsburgh before losing 2 - 1 at Buffalo on Thursday , are holding a " Welcome Back WhiteOut " during the home opener to celebrate the beginning of the 2009 - 10 season .
The team will put a limited number of standing - room tickets on sale Friday morning .
The Coyotes spent most of the summer in bankruptcy court before Judge Redfield T. Baum opted not to allow either the NHL or Canadian businessman Jim Balsillie to buy the team .
Balsillie had intended to move the franchise to Hamilton , Ont .
Goldman Sachs : Income inequality will ‘ achieve greater prosperity and opportunity for all ’
In a sign the Obama administration may finally be reacting to Main Street anger over Wall Street bonuses , the Treasury Department ’s “ pay czar ” is planning new limits on compensation for the senior - most executives at seven companies that received large amounts of bailout cash .

The 25 highest - earning executives at the seven firms — Citigroup , Bank of America , A.I.G. , as well as GM and Chrysler and their respective financing arms — will see their compensation for this year slashed by an average of 90 percent , the New York Times reported in an exclusive on Wednesday .
Overall , compensation for all executives at the seven companies will drop 50 percent compared to last year .
At A.I.G. , whose bailout alone cost taxpayers $ 180 billion , executives in the company ’s financial products division will see their compensation limited to $ 200,000 .
Notably , some of the most high - profile recipients of government aid , such as investment bank Goldman Sachs , are not on the list .
The Times said Kenneth Feinberg , the administration ’s “ pay czar , ” whom the newspaper refers to as “ the special master at Treasury handling compensation issues , ” will announce the new restrictions in the next few days .
“ The pay restrictions illustrate the humbling downfall of the once - proud giants , now wards of the state whose leaders ’ compensation is being set by a Washington paymaster , ” wrote the Times .
“ They also show how Washington in the last year has become increasingly powerful in setting corporate policies as more companies turned to the government for money to survive . ”

GOLDMAN SACHS ADVISER : INCOME INEQUALITY PROVIDES ‘OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL ’
But there is little indication that the Obama administration ’s new hard line on executive bonuses is changing the mentality on Wall Street .
News of the pay restrictions came the same day as controversy erupted over comments by a Goldman Sachs adviser that growing income inequality between senior executives and employees is “ necessary ” to rebuild the economy .
“ We have to tolerate the inequality as a way to achieve greater prosperity and opportunity for all , ” Bloomberg news service quoted Brian Griffiths as saying .
Griffiths is an adviser to Goldman Sachs International and once served as a special adviser to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .

Goldman Sachs set aside $ 16.7 billion this year for compensation and benefits , an increase of 46 percent over 2008 .
As Pat Garofalo noted at ThinkProgress , executive compensation is on the rise in the United States even as employee salaries in almost all economic sectors decline .
Pay cuts in sectors other than finance are “ occurring more frequently than at any time since the Great Depression , ” Garofalo wrote .

As RAW STORY reported in August , income inequality in the United States is at its highest level since records began .
But the phenomenon of runaway bonuses appears to be limited for the most part to the financial industry .
A recent report from Grant Thornton indicates that executives in most industries are cutting back on bonuses , with 55 percent of executives reporting that their companies are in the midst of reducing compensation packages .
Only nine percent said their companies were increasing compensation .
Financial Considerations for a Physical Therapy Assistant Graduate
adminequal | July 23 , 2012 | 0 Comments
For aspirants seeking qualified physical therapy assistantschools , there are many things to consider , not the least of which is , the degree to which , a school attempts to support a graduate seeking appropriate job opportunities , after completion of academic requirements and successful licensing obligations .
This is an extremely important consideration since , how a student fares in the marketplace may be directly related to the amount of guidance , support and reputation of the academic institution .
Potential students would be well advised to seek a strong and positive response when posing this question to recruitment representatives or admissions staff .
Any school that simply ejects its graduating student body , into the swift current of the job - seeking miasma is , not supporting its ethical obligations to ensure a smooth entry into the world of professional employment .
Too many inexperienced or naive candidates are left to the cruel ministrations of those who would prey on such neophytes , and take advantage of them .
It is therefore incumbent upon the educational facility to not only train a student to achieve success within their medical field , but to prepare them for the eventuality of seeking after employment with a variety of industries , and practices that can offer the best wages for which they are qualified .
Metropolitan Schools for wage Increases in Physical Therapy
Depending on your current place of residence , seeking an education from physical therapy assistant schools located near your residence , may prove unwise if not thoroughly researched .
The ultimate goal may be to find a school that is not only affordable , but requires little to no moving expenses .
One option for today ’s aspirant is the distance or online learning extension now offered by many reputable academic institutions .
This option solves not only costs , but also accommodates an aspirant ’s lifestyle .
Another important factor is the quality of physical therapy education a school can offer , and the strength of their reputation for graduating qualified candidates for the profession .
The worst thing a graduate can experience is the denial of employment based on the fact that employers consider a specific school ’s graduates as unqualified or unprepared for the rigors of the profession .
There is also little doubt that certain schools also enjoy a highly regarded reputation in this healthcare industry for graduating the best and highly qualified candidates .
These students are sought after and are in demand for the credentials they bring to the profession .
You might say these schools represent the Harvard ’s and Stanford ’s of the physical therapy industry .
Watch : Charlize Theron's $ 140,000 Lady Kiss For Charity

The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
At the OneXOne charity gala Thursday night in San Francisco , Charlize Theron auctioned off a kiss for an incredible $ 140,000 — to a woman .
The lip service was a last - minute addition to a South Africa / World Cup package she was auctioning .
When bidding stalled at $ 37,000 , well below the $ 280,000 that Jeremy Piven had just raised , Theron upped the ante .
From US
Weekly ,
“ For f*** sake !
You can do better , ” she tells attendees .
“ There is no way I am leaving here with Jeremy Piven getting a higher bid .
I ’ve got t**** for God ’s sake . ”
To sweeten the pot , she offered up a 7 - second kiss for $ 130,000 to a male bidder .
“ Swine flu is going around .
This is high risk kissing ! ” she told him .
After one man bid $ 135,000 , a woman upped the stakes to $ 140,000 — ascending the stage for a 20 - second smooch as the audience counted down .
Check out video of the donated smooch below ( click to play ) :
There is a female colleague at my workplace who 's so goddamned attractive and also very pleasant by nature that I literally can't take my eyes off her .
I lose track of time in her company so everyday I end up being late in my work delivery .
Even though I keep trying to strike a balance between working productively and spending time with her , she 's way too much of a distraction .
When it 's 6 PM , OMG I 'm late !!!!
Quantitatively , my productivity should be at least 20 ~ 30 % lower .
I even discussed this problem with her on Friday and she coyly suggests me to " " find another seat if you can " - she 's cruel and beautiful simultaneously .
Riding the train from Rome to Bologna , I am constantly reminded as to how much nicer the train experience is in Italy .
The seat feels nicer , the cabin feels bigger and the scenery blows away anything I would see between Newark and Philadelphia .
Staring at the two suit - wearing gentlemen next to me , I have to feel a little bit sorry for them because chances are their journey is n’t going to end at the Ducati factory .
Ever since the US press officer , John Canton , confirmed the tour , my wife has met all my outbursts of jubilance with a monotone , “ that ’s great , honey . "
It ’s not that she does n’t share my affinity for Ducati , she ’s just tired of hearing my nonstop yapping about it .
Once on the property , our tour guide , Natasha , leaves us in the cafeteria momentarily and gives us very strict instructions to stay out of the service corridor .
“ You will get run over by a fork lift " is something we easily make out through her Italian accent .
While awaiting her return , I have an epiphany – Journalists take this tour all the time , what fact could I possibly present that has n’t been shown to the world a hundred times over ?
While pondering a fresh angle on an over told story , a factory worker walks past the glass doors rolling a Desmosedici RR down the very corridor I ’ve just been forbidden to enter .
By the time I ’ve got my head to the edge of the doorframe and peeked around , the man and the bike are gone .
At that moment , it dawns on me – to a true sport bike lover , a Ducati is n’t about statistical data , it ’s about the experience I just had .
It ’s an elusive taste of something just beyond our reach .
The entire brand identity is cloaked in the idea that by owning one of these hand built Italian machines , you are or part of something that is , for lack of a more complicated word , special .
Some would have you believe that the difference strictly comes down to money , but as we enter the assembly floor and are told to put away our cameras , I would have to disagree .
My vote is that it has more to do with the experience of the ride and having a connection to the machine .
For those of you that have to have numbers , let me get that out of the way .
The sole Ducati assembly plant in Bologna produces around 100 bikes a day in the slow season , 200 a day in the spring and summer .
Our guide proudly informs me that in 2006 , ( the year control of the company was taken back from investment group Texas Pacific ) the rate of errors on parts was six percent , but since that time they have squashed that number down to one percent .
They now machine their own parts in house and can assemble a two - valve engine in 50 minutes , a four - valve in 75 .
The average assembly time on a complete bike is three hours .
The assembly floor is plenty loud and it ’s all I can do to hear our guide and digest the stream of info as we walk though a sea of crankshafts and engine cases .
We follow a painted yellow line on the floor and move past the areas where workers both male and female sit at stations and cobble together bottom ends .
Next come cylinder heads .
Metal rolling racks look like Christmas trees covered with four valve heads as they sit waiting to be matched up to a 1098 .
As Natasha moves us to the next station , I almost have to laugh just thinking about how much just one of those heads would cost at a dealership if purchased as a replacement .
“ Do you know what this is ? " she asks .
“ It ’s a camshaft . " I blurt out .
I think I ’m feeling a little inadequate because I do n’t have a garage full of Ducatis at my house in Los Angeles .
I figure I can partially make up for my lack of prowess by being able to identify every internal part that my tour guide might hold up .
Next up is the engine testing station .
It ’s a clear booth manned by one employee .
We stand and watch him roll what looks like a Sport Classic engine into the box , then hook up some sensors and let the automated procedure begin .
The device takes it up to about a thousand RPM to check for oil pressure , strange noises and vibrations .
There is no fuel or spark at this point , just a testing of the rotating assembly .
After passing , updated documents are put back in their vinyl sleeve and sit with their completed engine until it finds its new home in the cro-moly tube chassis of a finished bike .
On the way to the assembly lines – which are really mobile stations positioned in a linear fashion – we pass a wall of engine racks .
Each stand carries assembled engines individually tagged : 848 USA , 848 Europa , 1098 USA , etc .
Between that and the overall cleanliness of everything , and this place is starting to feel like Santa ’s workshop , only Santa does n’t have 40 superbike frames hanging from hooks in unison in the same way a candy machine displays bags of M&Ms .
“ Are these painted or powder - coated ? "
It ’s a question I ask to seem smart and make Natasha feel good about giving me this tour .
They ’re painted in case you were wondering , but I ’m writing information so quickly that I do n’t have time to ask why .
The assembly line is exactly what I would expect as we watch a small team put a tank and seat on a Monster .
The crew is so content that I ponder the thought of getting a job here so that I could apply my 30 percent employee discount towards an RR , but I let it go because my Italian is so sloppy .
Completed bikes sit in a holding pen before being pulled up to a stand for cleaning and emissions testing .
Again , a clean - cut guy in bright red coveralls attaches hoses to the ends of the mufflers and fires the engine for the first time .
I stand to take it all in before we make our way to the end of the station and take a sharp left turn .
At this point , I see what amounts to the Legend of Bigfoot .
Nearing the end of its own assembly line is a Desmosedici RR .
There ’s no mistaking its identity , as it stands by itself in aggressive red glory with nothing around it but a single worker .
There is another on a lone stand finishing its final inspection .
I envision cracking the guy over the head and making a break for it , although I do n’t think there is enough gas in the tank to get me to the front gate and being a single mount , I would have to leave my wife behind , which , after explaining myself to John , would make for an awkward flight back to the states with Nichole .
I ’m not allowed to bother the guy handling the finishing touches , but Natasha informs us that an RR engine takes about 3.5 hours to complete and three workers finish a bike in six .
Between six to eight make their way out of this building every day .
The last of the 1500 RRs will move through this very spot in December , but even if you just won the lottery , they were all spoken for a long time ago .
So what will happen on this assembly line after the RR is done ?
That ’s anybody ’s guess , because Natasha is n’t talking .
It ’s a pretty big deal to stand in the place where they make the fastest production bike in the world .
The RR holds the top spot in a group of tag - able race bikes that can be counted on one hand .
As Natasha puts it , “ It ’s a Ferrari on two wheels . "
While passing an inconspicuous door with a high round window , our guide informs us that behind it lies the “ racing " department .
You would laugh if you could see me standing on my tippy toes with my nose pressed against the glass .
You have to wonder how many other grown men have assumed the same position trying to get a mere glimpse of anything they could later brag about to their friends .
That ’s the reason we are not allowed inside , and also the reason for the procession of “ dummy " engines that line the hallway behind the door , so that nosey journalists have something to look at .
John Canton later informs me that the racing department is really run from the paddocks of racetracks on their respective tours , and that even when here in the off season , there is n’t much to look at but computers and graphs .
I politely take his word for it , but I ’m not sure I entirely believe him .
After completing the tour and taking a stroll through the museum , John walks the two of us over to the abandoned utility buildings that were bombed during World War II .
On our stroll , we talk about our own bikes and the roles they play in our lives .
I reluctantly admit to him that I have a restored 1990 GSXR 1100 as it was the bike I could n’t afford when I was a kid .
He does n’t miss a beat and tells me that restoring eighties sport bikes is a trendy thing to do right now .
He asks if I have a Ducati and I answer “ Not yet . "
The main reason is because I wanted to do a little more homework before looking for a bike .
I think my search will ultimately bring me to a 916 .
It ’s an iconic example of the brand ’s history and its breakthroughs paved the way for so many great things .
One might call foul if I were to toss out the word “ classic " while describing a fourteen year old bike , but in a way , almost every Ducati is a classic .
Which brings me back to the reason I took this tour in the first place .
Owning a Ducati is n’t about statistics , although theirs are impressive .
It ’s about that elusive taste of something just beyond my reach and the hope that at some point , if I ’m lucky , I just might be able to grab it .
Because doing so would mean owning a piece of history and being part of something that is , for lack of a more complicated word , special .
Perhaps pointing out hypocrisy from the GOP is akin to letting people in on the secret that the sky is blue , but what the heck ...
Over the past nine months , House Republicans have worn their Party of No badge with pride , opposing every spending bill to come down the pike and littering the airways to moan about America 's descent into socialism .
And while no one is arguing that an entire state should be punished because their congressman puts politics over country , their blatant hypocrisy in scurrying home to take credit for the money they voted against must be noted .
Which brings us to just a few examples from the 67 members of the House Republicans Hypocrisy Hall of Fame , compiled by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) from various media reports , press releases , and in the case of Pete Hoekstra , a tweet :

Representative Pete Hoekstra ( MI - 02 ) – " If you know of someone thinking of buying first home , now may be the time .

Of course Washington is rife with people who try to take credit where none is due ( see : Bush , George ; " Mission Accomplished " ) , and if it was just one or two shameless hypocrites pulling this nonsense we could dismiss it as just that -- shameless hypocrisy .
But sixty - seven times ?
That 's not coincidence , that 's policy .
In various stages of your life , you will have to face various types of legal situations .
As someone living in the modern society , …
Is social media engagement leading people to aimlessly waste time and effort for no high value in return ?
Can utilizing social media and monitoring your presence on social channels be optimized ?
What are the current tools available for Twitter users that aim to boost your Twitter productivity ?
In a fast - moving technology cluttered virtual environment , any platform or application specifically designed to save both time and effort embraces a high irreplaceable value to its users and its developers as well .
When it comes to certain social media channels , such as Twitter , it is absolutely essential to be aware of the applications that allow you to use those channels efficiently and effectively while reaping the benefits you desire .
Therefore , and in efforts to help you obtain the most value out of your social media experience via Twitter , I prepared for you a list of the 5 top free Twitter time - saving applications and sites available online :
TwitIQ : A service which is very similar to Twitter yet offers you added value through options such as simple “ retweet ” and “ reply ” buttons which save time and hassle , in addition to the ability to add and remove followers without leaving the site , both easily and quickly .

Boy traps head between buildings
A young boy who fell out of his third floor window ended up getting his head wedged between two buildings .
IF it is n't weird enough that Steve Killeen walks his pet goat through Sydney every day , it turns out the animal was part of a divorce settlement .
The Foxtel salesman from Darlington , in Sydney 's inner suburbs , said his then wife chose the animal a year ago after she went looking on the internet for another odd pet , a hairless cat .
" She saw pictures of baby goats and that was it , " Mr Killeen said yesterday .
" We checked with council , and four weeks later we got a goat . "
While Mr Killeen 's wife did n't hang around - she took the family dog , for some reason - his trusty sidekick " Maxie " did .
Now Mr Killeen takes the goat , and his friend 's goat Joanie , for daily walks .

" On Sundays we religiously walk to Hyde Park , " he said .
" There 's a tree that they like , they just go nuts . "
The daily strolls - which are fast becoming a familiar sight to locals - take longer than you might think because so many people stop Mr Killeen to comment on his " herd " .
Mr Killeen , who keeps both the goats in his friend 's large backyard in Chippendale , said dogs could be a problem for an urban goat - herder .

Jeff Kinney 's " Diary of a Wimpy Kid " is the " New York Times " best - seller that -- as the title suggests -- is written up to look like the spiral - bound diary of a seventh grader , complete with comic book - style illustrations .
Its popularity among kids shows that they can easily relate to the main character 's problems , like an angry soccer coach , a mean older brother and an ill - fated slumber party at a house where bedtime hits at 7 , but we comics readers have always related to our childhood problems in a more metaphorical sense .
And by that , we mean that we were too busy reading about Wolverine fighting ninjas to worry about whether some other kid was getting his homework done .
So naturally , we wondered what it would look like if " Diary of a Wimpy Kid " focused not on a regular seventh grader , but on a gifted youngster in a school that hates and fears him , and thanks to some pages from the diary of a ten year - old Charles Xavier , we think we 've found out !
Hall montors , crushes , study groups ...
Pretty typical stuff so far .
Let 's skip ahead a bit .
While I liked The Middle better than I liked Hank , the show was still pretty bad .
There have been comparisons of this show to Malcolm in the Middle .
It is a fair comparison in that both are quirky family comedies , but The Middle lacks several key ingredients .
The cast is n't as good as a long shot .
While Patricia Heaton and Neil Flynn come close , the kids on The Middle cannot match up against the ones on Malcolm in the Middle , and which group of kids could ?
Frankie Muniz adds so much that is n't there on The Middle .
The jokes lack the edge of Malcolm in the Middle and while I was amused , I think I laughed only once .
The story actually has direction and purpose unlike in Hank .
Heaton 's character Frankie ends up in the middle of nowhere , so the episode leads in what happened .
It turns out that her really weird son Brick needed her for a presentation , so she dresses up in tights and arrives at his school , except the presentation is next week .
Her son is so bizarre that he is funny most of the time , though I was confused whenever he repeated the same word in an undertone .
Frankie rushes back to the car dealership where she works to get a desperately needed sale .
The customer suggests they just drive off which she does .
By then , we can kind of see what will happen .
The customer steals the car , leaving her stranded .
The writing was average with typical jokes about a middle - aged mom and her family .
I actually think the concept of Hank is better than that of The Middle , so the episode was n't too terrible .
Nevertheless , I 'm not touching either show again .
Unless of course , one suddenly becomes a megahit .
One thing I would commend The Middle for is the lack of the laugh track which was lame on Hank .
Score : 7.5/10
Democratic congressman Alan Grayson beat the Republicans at their own game last week , when he ripped into them for dragging their feet on the American healthcare crisis .
On the floor of the House of Representatives , he summarised the Republican healthcare plan as : " Do n't get sick , and if you do get sick , die quickly . "
It has caught Republicans like a deer in the headlights , understandably so because Republicans are not used to Democrats with guts .
Far from surrendering to immediate Republican outrage and demands for apology , Grayson stood firmly by his stance , teasing his opponents that he 'll apologise , but " to the dead and their families " for government 's failure to improve the system .
In fact , Grayson has since stepped up his rhetoric in a recent media blitz , calling Republicans " knuckle - dragging Neanderthals " and " a lie factory " whose only approach to policy is obstructionism .
By failing to produce a counter - proposal in the following days , Republicans have effectively proven Grayson 's point .
This kind of pugnacious spirit is common among Republicans but very rare among Democrats , which is largely why Democrats so often get trampled in legislative battles where they have the upper - hand politically , intellectually , morally , historically and in opinion polls .
Grayson 's star power has surged since his remarks .
While the GOP has designated him public enemy number one , Grayson has lit up the Democratic base .
What 's unique about Grayson is that he 's passionate about championing liberal causes , and he forcefully calls out the lies of his Republican opponents and the vapidity of today 's conservative movement .
With the significant rightward shift of the Democratic party in the last few decades , progressives are hardly represented in American government any longer .
Though there are a few notable exceptions , none have quite the determination Grayson showed this week .
In the last 30 years , Republicans have yanked America further to the right than was once conceivable .
Democrats have been complicit in this .
Many Democrats sat idly by – if not supported – Republicans starting unnecessary and destructive wars , violating the Constitution and international law , redistributing wealth upward from the working poor to the rich , letting tens of millions lose their health care , and actively ignoring the threat of global climate change .
Democrats have effectively allowed Republicans to elide the word " liberal " from an adjective into a smear .
This continues today , despite the fact that conservatives have steered America to one of its darkest places yet .
President Obama 's self - consciously conciliatory approach plays right into this meme .
The zeal with which Republicans continue to promote their agenda , despite its immense failures , provides a stark contrast to the tepid Democratic spirit .
This is why Grayson is not a typical Democrat , and why he 's exactly what Democrats have needed for a long time .
The party dominates the House of Representatives , has a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate , and boasts a popular president – yet continues to get pushed around the bullied by the GOP , which is less popular than ever and has no serious proposals for solving today 's problems .
What gives ?
A lack of fortitude .
Capping an era of great political cynicism and unprecedented domination of money in politics , progressives have lost their footing and have tumbled behind conservatives , facing an increasingly steeper mountain to climb as Democrats continue to capitulate to the perpetrators of these quandaries .
In an age where campaign contributions from wealthy , narrow interest groups are so critical to political survival , the incentive for ordinary Democrats is to play the game , not change it .
With the Democratic party slowly morphing into a watered - down Republican party , progressives have grown increasingly cynical of politics .
Many feel little incentive to vote or participate in the political process .
A Grayson - like fervor for liberal causes can help recapture this waning enthusiasm , perhaps eventually motivating Democrats to be real progressives again .
The internet age provides as much potential for political self - harm as it does opportunity , but Grayson seems happy to take the heat .
Democrats need representatives who genuinely believe in liberal values , who have the courage to fight for their beliefs , and who wo n't prioritise political expediency over doing their job the right way .
" We need Democrats with guts , " Grayson said of the whole matter .
He 's right .

UPDATE : Response from CRU in interview with another website , see end of this post .
The details on this are still sketchy , we ’ll probably never know what went on .

I ’m currently traveling and writing this from an airport , but here is what I know so far :
An unknown person put postings on some climate skeptic websites that advertised an FTP file on a Russian FTP server , here is the message that was placed on the Air Vent today :
We feel that climate science is , in the current situation , too important to be kept under wraps .
We hereby release a random selection of correspondence , code , and documents
The file was large , about 61 megabytes , containing hundreds of files .
It contained data , code , and emails from Phil Jones at CRU to and from many people .
I ’ve seen the file , it appears to be genuine and from CRU .
Others who have seen it concur - it appears genuine .
There are so many files it appears unlikely that it is a hoax .
The effort would be too great .
Here is some of the emails just posted at Climate Audit on this thread :
http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=7801#comments
I ’ve redacted email addresses and direct phone numbers for the moment .
The emails all have US public universities in the email addresses , making them public / FOIA actionable I believe .

Mike ,
In an odd way this is cheering news !
One other thing about the CC paper – just found
another email – is that McKittrick says it is standard practice in Econometrics journals
to give all the data and codes !!
According to legal advice IPR overrides this .

Dear Ray , Mike and Malcolm ,
Once
Tim ’s got a diagram here we ’ll send that either later today or
first thing tomorrow .
I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps
to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd from
1961 for Keith ’s to hide the decline .
Mike ’s series got the annual
land and marine values while the other two got April - Sept for NH land
N of 20N .
The latter two are real for 1999 , while the estimate for 1999
for NH combined is +0.44C wrt 61-90 .
The Global estimate for 1999 with
data through Oct is +0.35 C cf. 0.57 for 1998 .
Thanks for the comments , Ray .
Cheers

Hi all – I ’m not too comfortable with this , and would rather not sign – at least not
without some real time to think it through and debate the issue .
It is unprecedented and
political , and that worries me .
My vote would be that we do n’t do this without a careful discussion first .
I think it would be more appropriate for the AGU or some other scientific org to do this –
e.g. , in reaffirmation of the AGU statement ( or whatever it ’s called ) on global climate
change .
Think about the next step – someone sends another letter to the Senators , then we respond ,
then …
I ’m not sure we want to go down this path .
It would be much better for the AGU etc to do
it .
What are the precedents and outcomes of similar actions ?
I can imagine a special - interest
org or group doing this like all sorts of other political actions , but is it something for
scientists to do as individuals ?
Just seems strange , and for that reason I ’d advise against doing anything with out real
thought , and certainly a strong majority of co-authors in support .
Cheers , Peck
Dear fellow Eos co-authors ,
Given the continued assault on the science of climate change by some on Capitol Hill ,
Michael and I thought it would be worthwhile to send this letter to various members of
the U.S. Senate , accompanied by a copy of our Eos article .
Can we ask you to consider signing on with Michael and me ( providing your preferred
title and affiliation ) .
We would like to get this out ASAP .
Thanks in advance ,
Michael M and Michael O

http://briefingroom.typepad.com/the_briefing_room/2009/11/hadleycru-says-leaked-data-is-real.html
The director of Britain ’s leading Climate Research Unit , Phil Jones , has told Investigate magazine ’s TGIF Edition tonight that his organization has been hacked , and the data flying all over the internet appears to be genuine .
In an exclusive interview , Jones told TGIF , “ It was a hacker .
We were aware of this about three or four days ago that someone had hacked into our system and taken and copied loads of data files and emails . ”
“ Have you alerted police ”
“ Not yet .
We were not aware of what had been taken . ”
Jones says he was first tipped off to the security breach by colleagues at the website RealClimate .
“ Real Climate were given information , but took it down off their site and told me they would send it across to me .
They did n’t do that .
I only found out it had been released five minutes ago . ”
TGIF asked Jones about the controversial email discussing “ hiding the decline ” , and Jones explained what he was trying to say … .
UPDATE3 : McIntyre has posted an article by Jean S at climateaudit.org which is terribly overloaded .
We have mirrored it .

Uni-Pixel , a company based in Woodlands , Texas , has announced it is about to start mass production of a thin - film to be used in time - multiplexed optical shutter ( TMOS ) displays , a next - generation display technology that exploits retinal persistence in the human eye and promises significantly better performance than CRT , LCD and OLED displays with , among other things , great durability and dramatically improved energy efficiency .
The vast majority of displays available today use spatial superimposition of a synchronized red , green and blue light , each shining with a specific intensity , to create millions of color combinations .
For instance , in LCD displays each pixel is made up of three RGB - colored dots that can take up discrete values over a 6 - or 8 - bit range : when watching the pixels from a distance , the human eye blends these three components together and perceives a single color over a total 18 - or 24 - bit range respectively .
TMOS displays harness a different principle in human vision : rather than superimposing the three components spatially , they do it temporally , exploiting the retinal persistence by intermittently sending just one of the three components at a time at very short intervals , and letting our brains " do the math " by adding the colors .
This approach greatly simplifies the manufacturing process , basically subtracting components from existing LCD lines and reducing others — such as the thin - film transistors for the RGB dots — by a factor of three , resulting in monitors that are 60 percent cheaper to manufacture than LCDs .
Because each layer placed between the top and the bottom glass sheet reduces the monitor 's overall light output ( each layer acts as a filter ) , removing components and simplifying the rest makes TMOS displays highly energy - efficient , letting through more than ten times as much light as a conventional LCD screen .
Intuitively , this means one could obtain the same picture brightness using less than one - tenth of the power .
The intermittent red , green and blue light come from side - mounted LEDs that illuminate the bottom glass layer .
Applying a voltage to the specially - developed film causes it to deform downward and touch the bottom glass , routing light from LEDs up to a particular pixel .
The routing is done with the help of tiny mirrors , each less than 10 microns in size , that can manipulate the signals very quickly and achieve refresh rates 1,000 times higher than in LCD displays .
This simple but seemingly very powerful architecture also has other advantages : for instance , because of its small pixel size , it will be possible to reach densities as high as 300d pi .
But the figure that might well be the most impressive is the projected display 's life .
The first component expected to fail in a TMOS display is one of the three LEDs , each of which have a life of 100,000 hours under continuous operation .
However , TMOS displays use the three LEDs intermittently , which puts display life to approximately 300,000 hours , much more than LCDs or OLEDs .
" It is our plan to have film production begin in low volume this coming quarter for these initial customer orders and then ramp to high volumes for additional opportunities in the beginning of 2010 , " UniPixel 's president and CEO Reed Killion explained .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner testified in the House today on his plan for addressing too - big - to - fail financial institutions .
And it did n’t take long for lawmakers to attack the proposal , from how it would fund the resolution of failing firms ( first by taxpayers , then recouped through fees on other institutions ) to the decision to put broad powers in the Federal Reserve .
The draft legislation released by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank establishes a council of regulators to monitor risks across the financial system .
But the Fed would get the most power in what ’s described as “ backup ” authority to take action when the council does not .
“ Although it ’s not singled out as a systemic uber - regulator in name , do n’t anyone be fooled , ” said Republican Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey .
“ The Fed is given primary supervision over systemic firms and can override lesser regulators that do n’t comply with its wishes .
In the name of mitigating systemic risk , the Fed is given almost unlimited authority to systemically dismantle a private company .
…
I ’m very uncomfortable with the sweeping , unchecked power of the same entity that failed to effectively mitigate many of the large bank holding companies already under its purview . ”
Mr. Geithner said Congress and the administration must “ close loopholes and reduce possibilities for gaming the system . ”
The proposed Financial Services Oversight Council would identify firms that pose a systemic threat and put them under heightened supervision .
But the Fed , he said , “ would oversee individual major financial firms so that there is clear , inescapable , single - point accountability . ”
In prepared testimony , Fed governor Daniel Tarullo effectively endorsed the legislation .
He said the Fed ’s Board of Governors believes the proposal “ provides a strong framework for achieving a safer , more stable financial system . ”
But Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said the oversight council as outlined in the proposal “ currently lacks sufficient authority to effectively address systemic risks . ”
Apart from a loving tribute to a landmark act , Harmonix 's singularly - focused rhythm game The Beatles : Rock Band is just as significant a work for being what is essentially gaming 's first , best interactive documentary .
Tracing the band 's rise and rise from their inauspicious Cavern Club beginnings to the Apple Corps rooftop finale , TB : RB offers a look inside the life of the band both overt ( see : the traces and ephemeral snippets in the form of unlockable photos and fan club merch ) and covert ( see , here : the difficulty - arc - dip from their early , more technical work — a band with something to prove — to the remarkably simple bliss - outs as they move into their , er , higher , altered states ) .
But possibly its most remarkable achievement is the art and motion graphics that went in to the game , from Passion Pictures ' eye - searingly gorgeous intro and outro videos , aided by Alberto Mielgo 's concepts ( at top ) , and the ' Kid Stays in the Picture ' - esque interstitials by Kansas City , MO's MK12 .
Below the fold , then : the best of all the above in a high - res gallery , giving you everything but the game .
The intro and outro videos directed by Pete Candeland ( the Passion Pictures producer best known for his work animating The Gorillaz ) remain the highlight of the entire TB : RB experience , as becomes instantly clear with a quick view of the following .
BUNDELKHAND , India ( CNN ) --
The cattle slowly drag the old - fashioned plow as a bone - thin farmer walks behind , encouraging them to move faster with a series of yelps .
Drought , debt and desperation have pushed some farmers in rural India to sell their wives .
It is a scene from times of old , but still the way many farmers operate in rural India , where the harvest often determines feast or famine .
The region is called Bundelkhand , spanning the two northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh .
It is here that drought , debt and desperation have pushed people to extremes .
To survive the bad years , some farmers say they turn to the " Paisawalla " -- Hindi for the rich man who lends money .
Farmers say the loans from these unofficial lenders usually come with very high interest .
When the interest mounts up , lenders demand payment .
Some farmers work as bonded laborers for a lifetime to pay off their debts .
Others here say because of years of little rain and bad harvests they are forced to give money lenders whatever they ask for .
Sometimes that includes their wives .
" It happens sometimes when somebody borrows money , " says a farmer 's wife who did not want to be identified .
She should know , considering what police say she told them .
She said a rich man bought her from her husband .
" He did buy me , " she says .
" That 's why he told me he bought me . "
For 30 days she says the man forced her to live with him .
When her case drew public attention , she retracted her police report and her husband took her back .
Ranjana Kumari with India 's Center for Social Research says the exploitation of women is common in the region .
And , she says , there is little support for women in India who have the courage to file a case with authorities .
" Nobody 's going to support or help them , " Kumari says .
" If a family decides not to help them , the system is already not so sensitized towards them , whether it is police , judiciary , whether the legal system .
So the women themselves tend to withdraw these cases . "
In another village , another story involving another farmer , and money lender .
" I sold my water engine and land and gave back his 30,000 rupees , " the farmer says , describing his $ 600 loan payment .
The farmer , whom CNN is not identifying to protect his wife and children , says the lender then asked him to send his wife to help with chores while the lender 's wife was sick .
The farmer says he complied , and his children -- including his daughter -- went too .
But the mother never returned .
The farmer says he believes she was stolen from him .
The daughter says the lender sold her mother to another man .
State authorities say they have investigated the matter and found that the mother denies she was sold and has simply gone to live with a lover .
The daughter says that 's not true , and claims that she and her father were told to keep quiet by some of the village leaders .
During CNN 's interview with the family , officials with the state magistrate 's office barged into the farmer 's home and began videotaping .
An Indian government report completed in 1998 says the region is prone to what it calls " atrocities , " including the buying and selling of women .
However no one can say just how common these kinds of incidents are .
Social workers say this is n't just about poverty , but also an indication of the low social status of women in poverty - stricken areas such as Bundelkhand .
" Those women are very vulnerable to all kinds of physical and sexual exploitation . "
Kumari says .
" Also there is much higher level of violence against women in that area . "
The government and charities have been trying to help but the status of women and girls , often illiterate and seen as a financial burden , remains low .
Nevertheless , attitudes are slowly beginning to change , Kumari says .
A farmer 's wife in yet another village in the region said she was sold by her own parents 14 years ago .
" My mother and father got 10,000 rupees ( about $ 200 ) , " she says .
" That 's why they sold me . "
She says she was 12 years old at the time her husband bought her .
She never considered going to authorities because she says she had no where else to go .
She accepted it as her destiny .
But now she has a daughter of her own and her perspective has changed .
Would she allow her daughter to be sold ?
She looked up and shook her head firmly .
" No , " she said , " I would not want this for her .
Let her marry however she wants . "
All About India
Baseless organ theft accusations are a propaganda gift for Israel , and deflect attention from its well - documented war crimes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
( Matthew Cassel )
TV
TV
After the show , a producer in Tehran thanked me and told me that it was nice to get someone from the “ other side . ”
But I had to make it clear , that I was not from the “ other side ” as she meant it .
I support uncovering human rights violations and war crimes wherever they occur , especially in Palestine , where I have worked for many years .
I do believe Bostrom ’s intentions were to do much the same but that his process was highly irresponsible .
The problem is not that he is accusing the State of Israel of wrongdoing , but that he is making accusations of what would amount to extremely serious war crimes while providing absolutely no evidence to support his claims .
Rather than advancing the cause of Palestinian human rights , such behavior hurts the many organizations , journalists , activists and others working tirelessly to expose and document Israel ’s numerous violations of international law committed against Palestinians and people of other Arab nations in recent decades .
Bostrom ’s article lacks credibility for a number of reasons .
In the opening paragraph he tells the story of Levy Rosenbaum , a Jewish man in New York linked to illegal trafficking in human organs with counterparts in Israel .
While Rosenbaum has admitted to buying organs from destitute Israelis , until now there has been nothing outside Bostrom ’s article to suggest that this trade involved the organs of Palestinians killed by the Israeli army .
Rosenbaum has also admitted to being involved in the trade for the past ten years which is well after 1992 , when Bostrom claims the organ theft may have occurred in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
Other than Israel being involved , there is no evidence to make a direct link between these incidents .
It is poor journalism on Bostrom ’s part to use a timely event and try to connect it to something that happened nearly two decades earlier without offering any evidence .
Bostrom also refers to Palestinians disappearing for days at a time and who have in many cases returned dead .
This is known to have occurred before , especially Palestinians being arrested and taken to detention centers without the Israeli authorities bothering to inform the families .
This is something that has been reported on and documented by numerous Palestinian human rights organizations .
Israel may have even performed autopsies on the bodies without the families ’ consent , as Bostrom reports .
He publishes a horrific photograph of one of these bodies alongside the article , but again , this is not proof that organs in that person ’s body were removed and sold , or given to Israelis in need , as the author implies .
One must also ask why this story was not covered in 1992 , when Bostrom claims the organ theft occurred .
It seems this would be a more appropriate time to expose such a story when bodies of those killed by Israel could have been autopsied to determine for a fact whether or not organs from those Palestinians killed by Israel were in fact removed .
In the Press TV interview , Bostrom claimed that he did approach many Palestinian , Israeli and international organizations but none , minus the UN , heeded his call for further investigation .
Yet , he only makes brief mention of this in the article and says the UN staff was prevented from doing anything about his findings .
Unlike Bostrom ’s reporting , when most Palestinian human rights organizations or other journalists have uncovered Israeli violations , they are sure to provide well - documented evidence to prove beyond a doubt that such violations were in fact committed .
Even though Israel has made it very difficult for both Palestinian and international journalists and human rights workers to practice inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip , many have risked their lives to see that evidence of Israel ’s crimes is uncovered and reported .
Many such well - documented violations committed over recent decades include : willful killing of civilians , including children ; torture ; extrajudicial executions ; depriving a civilian population of food and other necessities ; blackmailing patients in need of medical care to try to turn them into informers ; wanton and deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure ; punitive home demolitions ; and illegal use of restricted weapons against civilian targets , including white phosphorus and cluster bombs .
The list of UN resolutions and international treaties violated by Israel is far too long to list here , although these violations have been carefully documented over many years by human rights organizations that have worked tirelessly for their enforcement .
I am not trying to argue here that Israel or some Israelis could never have trafficked stolen Palestinian organs .
In a place like Palestine , however , where evidence of Israeli war crimes has never been difficult to find — despite Israel ’s consistent efforts to block investigations — those concerned with holding Israel accountable should not level allegations of such seriousness without producing some evidence .
Following Israel ’s winter invasion of Gaza — during which more than 1,500 Palestinians were killed , the vast majority civilians — several well - known international human rights groups issued reports containing irrefutable evidence of shocking crimes .
Israeli soldiers who participated in the attack on Gaza have been quoted in the Israeli press talking about how they or their colleagues committed atrocities , such as shooting dead unarmed civilians , including children .
The fact that Bostrom did not offer evidence for his organ theft claims has given Israel an enormous propaganda gift .
Because he offered nothing more than conjecture and hearsay , Israel has launched a major campaign casting itself as an aggrieved victim of “ blood libel . ”
This allows Israel to distract attention from the mountains of evidence of well - documented war crimes , and even to discredit real evidence .
If there is no evidence behind the organ theft claims , Israel can argue , then maybe all these other claims about crimes in Gaza are equally dubious .
Predictably , Israel and its supporters launched a ridiculous campaign not only targeting Bostrom and his newspaper , but against all of Sweden and its population of more than nine million .
Some have started an online petition calling for the boycott of the furniture retailer IKEA , founded in Sweden , while the Israeli interior ministry claims it will freeze the entry visas for Swedish journalists .
Furthermore , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is demanding that the Swedish government declare its “ condemnation ” of the article .
This is a strategy that Israel could not use in response to the Gaza war crimes reports .
With each violation clearly documented and coming from a wide range of credible sources and testimonies , Israel could not demand that governments condemn the human rights groups and publications that disseminated them .
Israel predictably objected to the reports issued about Gaza , but tried to bring as little attention to them as possible — understandably , because the reports are irrefutable .
But Israel has done all it can to draw attention and create an international crisis out of the organ theft allegation .
Even the president of the Official Council of Jewish Communities in Sweden has condemned the response , saying that Israel “ had blown the issue completely out of proportion . ”
As Israel does with increasingly little discrimination , it has claimed that the article was motivated by “ anti-Semitism . ”
So far , Sweden has withstood Israel ’s hectoring that its government must take a position on an article published in a free press .
But given the record of pandering to Israel , it remains to be seen if Sweden will stick to this position .
If Sweden does bow down to Israeli pressure , it would set a frightening precedent for journalists whereby Israel can affect a state ’s policy of freedom for the press .
Israel ’s tactics of intimidation are not justified by Bostrom ’s article , which is nothing more than an example of irresponsible journalism and publishing .
The editors at the Swedish daily Aftonbladet who published this piece , should ’ve sent it back to the author and told him to investigate the issue further until he found evidence to corroborate his claims .
If there is any basis for the organ theft allegations , diligent reporting would bring it out .
As Malcolm X said , “ Truth is on the side of the oppressed ; ” all we need is to collect the evidence to prove it .

Mayor Thomas M. Menino ’s administration , prompted by public records requests from the Globe , has acknowledged that city employees were routinely deleting e-mails , a potential violation of the state public records law .
The acknowledgement came after the Globe filed several requests for e-mails sent and received by Menino ’s Cabinet chief of policy and planning , Michael J. Kineavy .
He is one of Menino ’s most powerful and trusted advisers , intimately involved in nearly everything at City Hall , but a search of city computers found just 18 e-mails he had sent or received between Oct. 1 , 2008 , and March 31 of this year .
The unusually low figure prompted administration officials to question him about what happened to the rest of the e-mails he was presumably sending and receiving during that period .
Kineavy , who is also one of the mayor ’s chief political advisers and a strategist on Menino ’s reelection campaigns since 1993 , told them that he deletes all his e-mails on a daily basis , in such a way that they are not saved on city backup computers , administration officials said .
There are indications that Kineavy was not the only city employee who may have violated the law .
In June , the Globe filed requests for copies of six months ’ worth of e-mails sent or received by five other employees , including Transportation Commissioner Thomas Tinlin .
City officials said that a search for Tinlin ’s e-mails turned up only those he had received , none he had sent .
Alarmed by the deletion of e-mails that could have contained potentially significant information , administration officials recently instituted a new electronic document retention policy and temporary “ journaling ’ ’ program , to keep copies of every e-mail sent and received by every city employee .
The city ’s chief lawyer , William Sinnott , said the city is working on a more permanent fix .
Sinnott also said problems with preserving e-mail are not unique to Boston .
“ E - mail retention is a challenge with which cities and towns throughout the country struggle , ’’ he said .
“ Both the law and the technology in this area have been evolving and the city has made every effort to comply with the law as we understand it . ’’
According to the Massachusetts secretary of state , the state public records law requires municipal employees to save electronic correspondence for at least two years , even if the contents are of “ no informational or evidential value . ’’
The only e-mails that can be deleted are those containing completely inconsequential information , such as spam or questions about lunch orders .
“ Clearly , employees cannot delete e-mails that have substantial content , ’’ said Secretary of State William F. Galvin , who is responsible for enforcing the law .
“ The improper deletion of e-mail is a violation of the public records law .
Period . ’’
Without copies of substantive e-mails that Kineavy or others deleted , however , there is no proof of violations and therefore no sanctions can be imposed , Galvin ’s office said .
Violations can result in fines of up to $ 500 or prison sentences of up to a year .
The Globe obtained the e-mails of only two employees as a result of its requests , in part because of the cost estimates provided by the Menino administration .
City officials estimated they would charge $ 5,000 for six months worth of e-mail for each employee , for a total cost of $ 30,000 .
One City Hall watchdog said the Menino administration should have known better than to allow top officials to delete e-mails without keeping backup records .
Samuel R. Tyler , president of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau , said Kineavy holds a critical position in the administration , where a lot of business that the public should be privy to is conducted .
“ The city needs to institute a system to make sure those e-mails are protected and preserved , ’’ Tyler said .
Pamela H. Wilmot , executive director of Common Cause of Massachusetts , a nonprofit group that focuses on government accountability , agreed .
“ I would n’t be surprised if a top government official would n’t have 10,000 e-mails , ’’ she said .
“ People write you from all sorts of quarters and , whether you send things back or not , incoming traffic needs to be retained . ’’
The city ’s most powerful official , Menino , leaves almost no electronic trail that is subject to the public records law , in part because he conducts some city business on his personal cellphone and does not use e-mail .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The government 's case in what it is calling the largest insider trading case involving a U.S. hedge fund contains a detailed list of trades involving household - name companies .
Investigators have pieced together a case that alleges more than $ 25 million in illegal gains based on trading in 2006 - 09 on companies including Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD , Fortune 500 ) , Akamai ( AKAM ) , Clearwire ( CLWR ) , Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , Hilton , Polycom ( PLCM ) and Sun Microsystems ( JAVA , Fortune 500 ) , among others .
The six people charged include hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam , founder of Galleon Group ; Robert Moffat , IBM's ( IBM , Fortune 500 ) top hardware executive and an oft - discussed CEO candidate ; Mark Curland and Danielle Chiesi , executives of the hedge fund New Castle Partners ; Anil Kumar , a director at consulting firm McKinsey & Co. ; and Rajiv Goel , an executive in Intel 's treasury department .
Just what did they allegedly do ?
Using information gleaned from wiretapped conversations between the accused and others , along with the statements of an apparent informant , SEC investigators have pieced together a series of episodes alleging to show how the defendants used inside information and well - timed trades to turn million - dollar profits .
Those charged have yet to enter pleas in the case .
Jim Waldman , a lawyer for Rajaratman , told the Wall Street Journal that the hedge fund chief " is innocent .
We 're going to fight the charges . "
Lawyers for some of the other accused said their clients are shocked by the charges and deny wrongdoing .
What follows is a condensed account of eight major trades the suspects made and the inside information they capitalized on , according to the the SEC investigation and complaint .
At the center of some of the trades is an unnamed " Tipper A , " a person who gathered a great deal of information on companies for Rajaratnam , and whose identity presumably will be made public as the case unfolds in court .
Polycom beats the Street
On Jan. 10 , 2006 , the unnamed source identified in the SEC 's complaint as " Tipper A " told Galleon 's Rajaratnam that , based on information received from a Polycom insider , revenues at the video - conferencing company for the fourth - quarter of 2005 were about to beat Wall Street estimates .
Polycom was set to announce its earnings more than two weeks later .
Rajaratnam sent an instant message to his trader instructing him to " buy 60 [ thousand shares ] PLCM " for certain Galleon Tech funds .
All told , from Jan. 10 through Jan. 25 , the date of the Polycom earnings release , Rajaratnam and Galleon bought 245,000 shares of Polycom and 500 Polycom call - option contracts .
Polycom did beat the Street , and collectively , the Galleon Tech funds made over $ 570,000 in connection with their Polycom trades based on Tipper A's tip .
The same scenario was repeated for Polycom 's first - quarter 2006 earnings , the complaint says .
Galleon made $ 165,000 on the information .
Tipper A made $ 22,000 .
The Hilton takeover
Tipper A allegedly obtained confidential information in advance of a July 3 , 2007 , announcement that a private equity group would be buying Hilton for $ 47.50 per share , a premium of $ 11.45 over the July 3 closing price .
Tipper A obtained the information from an analyst who , at the time , was working at Moody's , a rating agency that was evaluating Hilton 's debt in connection with the planned buyout .
Tipper A bought call option contracts based on the information , and passed on the tip to Rajaratnam .
On July 3 , Rajaratnam and Galleon bought 400,000 shares of Hilton in the Galleon Tech funds .
That evening , the Hilton transaction was announced .
Tipper A sold all of the Hilton call option contracts for a profit of more than $ 630,000 , the complaint says .
To compensate the source for the Hilton tip , Tipper A paid the source $ 10,000 .
The Galleon Tech funds sold their Hilton shares after the July 3 announcement for a profit of more than $ 4 million .
Google Misses
Around July 10 , 2007 , a PR consultant to Google allegedly told Tipper A that Google 's second - quarter earnings per share would be down about 25 cents .
The Street had estimated yet another strong quarter for the search giant , which was scheduled to report earnings July 19 .
Two days later Tipper A bought put options in Google and passed along details of the pending Google miss to Rajaratnam .
He and Galleon began buying Google put options for the Galleon Tech funds , and continued buying them through July 19 .
In addition , Galleon funds bought other options betting on a fall in Google shares and sold short Google stock beginning July 17 .
On July 19 , Google announced its earnings results , disclosing that its earnings - per - share was indeed 25 cents lower than the prior quarter .
Google 's share price fell from over $ 548 per share to almost $ 520 per share .
The Galleon Tech funds ' profits from the Google tip were almost $ 8 million .
Tipper A sold all of the put options the day after the July 19 announcement for a profit of over $ 500,000 .
Trading in Intel
Rajaratnam allegedly tapped former Wharton classmate and Intel executive Rajiv Goel just before Intel 's ( INTL ) scheduled fourth - quarter 2006 earnings announcement to get inside information on the world 's largest chipmaker .
On Jan. 8 , 2007 , Rajaratnam contacted Intel 's Goel .
The next day , Rajaratnam bought 1 million shares of Intel at $ 21.08 per share .
On Jan , 11 , he bought 500,000 more at $ 21.65 per share .
Goel and Rajaratnam communicated again multiple times over the Martin Luther King Day weekend that followed .
On Tuesday , Jan. 16 , the day the markets reopened , Rajaratnam reversed course , selling the Galleon Tech funds ' entire 1.5 million share long position in Intel at $ 22.03 per share , and making a profit of a little over $ 1 million
Later that day , after the markets closed , Intel released its fourth - quarter 2006 earnings .
Although the company 's earnings beat analysts ' projections , its guidance was below expectations .
Intel 's stock price fell nearly 5 % on the news , but Rajaratnam was already out of the stock .
According to Intel officials , Goel has been placed on administrative leave pending the court case .
Clearwire Gets a Partner
In early February 2008 , Goel allegedly tipped Rajaratnam that there was a pending joint venture between wireless broadband company Clearwire and Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) .
Intel was a huge shareholder in Clearwire .
Over the next three months , Galleon Tech funds bought and sold Clearwire shares on three occasions .
Each time , the Galleon Tech funds traded in advance of news reports relating to the deal between Clearwire and Sprint , and shortly after calls between Goel and Rajaratnam .
Overall , the Galleon Tech funds realized gains of about $ 780,000 on their Clearwire trading between February and May 2008 .
On May 8 , the joint venture between Sprint and Clearwire was publicly announced .
As payback for Goel 's tips , Rajaratnam ( or someone acting on his behalf ) executed trades in Goel 's personal brokerage account based on inside information concerning Hilton and PeopleSupport ( the government notes that a Galleon director sits on the PeopleSupport 's board of directors though no charges of wrongdoing have been brought against that person ) , which resulted in nearly $ 250,000 in profits for Goel .
Shorting Akamai
Another hedge fund executive , New Castle 's Danielle Chiesi , is an acquaintance of Rajaratnam .
When an Akamai executive told her that the Internet infrastructure company would trend lower in the company 's second - quarter 2008 guidance to investors , the government claims she passed along the information to Rajaratnam .
The consensus among Akamai 's management was that Akamai 's stock price would decline in the wake of the lowered guidance scheduled for July 30 .
Chiesi and the Akamai source spoke multiple times between July 2 and July 24 .
Chiesi told what she had learned from the Akamai source to her colleague at New Castle , Mark Kurland .
On July 25 , several New Castle funds took short positions in Akamai shares .
The positions grew through July 30 .
Rajaratnam 's Galleon funds also built up a short position during the same period .
In its second - quarter 2008 earnings announcement on July 30 , Akamai 's results disappointed investors .
The stock fell nearly 20 % following the announcement .
New Castle made $ 2.4 million .
The Galleon Tech funds took home more than $ 3.2 million .
IBM knows Sun
In January 2009 , IBM was conducting due diligence on Sun Microsystems in preparation for an offer to buy it ( Sun was ultimately bought by Oracle ( ORCL , Fortune 500 ) ) .
As part of that process , Sun opened its books to IBM , providing its second - quarter 2009 results in advance of the scheduled Jan. 27 announcement .
Because much of Sun 's business is hardware , IBM 's top hardware executive Robert Moffat was involved in the evaluation of Sun.
Moffat allegedly had access to Sun 's earnings results .
He and Chiesi were also friends and contacted each other repeatedly during January 2009 .
The frequency of contact between the two increased just prior to the Sun earnings release , investigators say .
On Jan. 26 , New Castle began acquiring a substantial long position in Sun. On Jan. 27 , after the market close , Sun reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street 's estimates , posting a two - cent per-share profit when analysts had expected a loss .
Sun shares soared 21 % on the news .
New Castle made almost $ 1 million .

On June 1 , 2008 , McKinsey & Co. began advising Advanced Micro Devices over its negotiations with two Abu Dhabi sovereign entities .
One , a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi government , Advanced Technology Investment Co. , would take over AMD 's chip manufacturing .
The other , an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund , Mubadala Investment Co. , would provide a large investment in AMD ( in the end , it would total $ 314 million ) .
According to the SEC , Anil Kumar was one of the McKinsey team briefed on the negotiations .
Kumar also knew Rajaratnam .
On Aug. 14 , Kumar learned that the two deals were finally getting done .
The next day he told Rajaratnam , investigators say .
Almost immediately , Rajaratnam and Galleon increased their long position in AMD by buying more than 2.5 million shares in Galleon funds and continuing to build their long position until just before the announcement of the AMD transactions .
Rajaratnam and Galleon bought 4 million AMD shares on Sept. 25 and 26 , and 1.65 million more on Oct. 3 . On Oct. 8 , the deals were announced publicly .
AMD 's stock price increased by about 25 % .
All told , the value of Galleon 's entire position in AMD increased approximately $ 9.5 million in Oct. 6 - 7 .
However , the allegedly ill - gotten gain was wiped out by the financial crisis of the time .
Because the Galleon Tech funds had accumulated much of their AMD position beginning in August , before the crisis sent stock prices , including AMD's , tumbling in September and October , the funds lost money on the overall trade .
* Jet would incorporate advanced Israeli systems , arms
* Lockheed Martin promises delivery in 2015
* Would not have Israeli electronic warfare system
WASHINGTON , Nov 23 ( Reuters ) - The United States has offered to add Israeli systems and munitions to a new U.S. - built fighter jet and deliver it to Israel by 2015 , provided a deal is sealed in coming months .
Lockheed Martin Corp
LMT.N
, maker of the radar - evading F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , would tie in Israeli - built command , control , communications , computer and intelligence systems for a unique version of the jet for sale to Israel , Jon Schreiber , a senior Pentagon program official , told Reuters Monday .
The United States also would integrate bombs that use an Israeli precision guidance kit called Spice along with Python 5 air - to - air missiles made by Israel 's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. , Schreiber said in an interview .
In addition , he said , Israel would get a relatively inexpensive path for hardware and software upgrades to add future weapons .
On the other hand , the United States does not plan for now to put an Israeli electronic warfare system aboard the F - 35 , which is in early stages of production .
" Some time in the future , if policy changes , or things change , that could change as well , " said Schreiber , who heads the F - 35 program 's international program for the Pentagon .
Dropping plans for incorporating electronic warfare systems would be a significant switch for Israel , which bought modified U.S. - built F - 15s and F - 16s to incorporate such know - how .
The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin are eager to wrap up an F - 35 deal with Israel , which is tentatively planning to buy an initial 25 F - 35s in fiscal 2012 with an option for 50 more .
The single - engine aircraft , designed to avoid detection by radar , could play a role in any Israeli effort to knock out what it regards as the threat to its existence posed by Iran 's nuclear program .
Schreiber said he met Israeli procurement officials in New York last week to discuss a " roadmap " for the proposed government - to - government F - 35 sale .
The United States planned to submit its offer and prices formally in January , he said .
Israel must approve this no later than March and reach a deal with Lockheed on integrating the Israeli weapons and other systems by June or July , he added , to buy in fiscal 2012 for delivery in 2015 .
The Israeli defense ministry did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment .
Lockheed had no comment .
Schreiber declined to discuss prices other than to say that Israel would buy the basic aircraft at the same price as the United States and its co-development partners , plus a standard government - to - government sales commission and whatever the integration of its systems might cost .
Israel uses U.S. security assistance to buy much of its arsenal .
The United States co-developed the F - 35 with eight foreign partners -- Britain , Italy , the Netherlands , Turkey , Canada , Australia , Denmark and Norway .
Together , the core group is projected to buy about 730 aircraft .
Schreiber said the United States had not yet begun to market the F - 35 to any other potential buyers in the Middle East .
The United States is committed to maintaining Israel 's " qualitative " military edge over any regional rival .

The following comes from WorldNetDaily publisher Joseph Farah , in reference to Safe Schools appointee Kevin Jennings and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) nominee Chai Feldblum ( both of whom are openly gay ) :
I wonder what kind of database Obama uses to locate people like this ?
Is it Monster.com ?
That would be appropriate .
Or is it FreaksUnlimited.com ?
Maybe Obamanations.com ?
No , it 's got to be Perverts.gov .
I 'm telling you , the entire federal government is going to have to be fumigated some day when these deviants and degenerates are finally sent packing .
Obama 's freak show [ WND ]
Oh , you 're telling us , alright , Mr. Farah .
Telling us how comical your side 's false hijacking of morality truly is .
Telling us how wantonly hurtful you social conservatives are willing to be .
Telling us how fully you are willing to wreck qualified , educated people 's careers simply because they happen to be queers .
Telling us how easily you 'll resort to hurtful , ad hominem attacks .
Telling us how little desire you have for unity , with a divided nation that 's constantly at odds with itself seeming to be your unabashed goal .
Telling us that you will never support anything that this president ever does , because the script that your movement wrote before the man was ever even in office tells you not to .
Yea , you 're telling us a whole heckuva lot , Joseph Farah .
And we 're telling you that we will never , ever stoop to the grossly negligent level on which you conduct your unfortunate affairs .

If you ’re wondering whatever happened to the Scarlet Speedster , tales his film adaptation ’s death have been greatly exaggerated .
According to screenwriter Dan Mazeau , “ The Flash ” is still zipping along .
and he should know since he ’s the screenwriter currently working on the movie .
Put on your winged helmet and hit the jump for more on what ’s happening with Barry Allen / Wally West / your - preferred - Flash - alter - ego .
Yesterday , IGN ran an interview they did with producer Charles Roven , whose credits include “ Twelve Monkeys ” , “ Three Kings ” , and “ The Dark Knight ” , as well as the adaptation of DC Comics popular superhero , The Flash .
He said that development of the film had slowed down due to Warner Bros.
wanting to take a different approach to the character ; an approach where he would be a part of the larger DC Universe and help pave the way for a Justice League movie .
He noted that he hopes he can get re-involved with the project in the future .
That would help since he could meet its current screenwriter , Dan Mazeau .
Building off their interview with Roven , today IGN wrote a follow - up piece where Mazeau had this to say :
“ Just to chime in on your latest article : The Flash has not been hobbled .
Everything is moving forward as planned , ” Mazeau explained .
“ I ’m still writing the script .
Geoff Johns is still consulting .
Flash fans have no cause for concern , and — IMO — lots to be excited about . ”
I ’m assuming this quote came via e-mail and that Mazeua does not use the term “ IMO ” in real life .
It ’s good that he said fans should be excited because I think a lot of us would be shocked if he said something like , “ Fans should be having nightmares about what I ’m going to do to this character .
Imagine two and a half hours of the Flash wearing leg - braces and he does n’t get better .
He just hobbles around to mundane locations like the grocery store and the post office .
It will be totally depressing and all the money will go to making the braces completely CG .
Enjoy , nerds !
Oh , he ’ll also be a convicted sex offender . ”

The monounsaturated fats in olive oil are an important part of the diet The Mediterranean diet , already thought to protect against heart disease and cancer , may also help to prevent depression , Spanish researchers say .
They found depression was more than 30 % less likely to develop in people who followed a diet high in vegetables , fruit and cereals , and low in red meat .
They studied 10,094 healthy adults over four years , the Journal of the American Medical Association reports .
However , the team stressed additional , larger - scale studies were required .
Researchers at the Universities of Las Palmas and Navarra recruited university graduates to take part .
Dietary patterns
They completed questionnaires and the researchers calculated their adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern ( MDP ) for an average of four - and - a - half years .
MEDITERRANEAN DIET FEATURES
A high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids like olive oil A moderate intake of alcohol and dairy products A low intake of meat A high intake of fruit and nuts , cereals , vegetables and fish Participants who had a strong adherence to the MDP tended to be male , ex-smokers , married and older individuals .
They were more active physically and showed a higher total energy intake .
The researchers identified 480 new cases of depression during the follow - up period - 156 in men and 324 in women .
They found that those with the highest adherence to the MDP were more than 30 % less likely to develop depression .
They took into account marital status , the number of children and factors associated with a healthy lifestyle and found the relationship did not change .
Even taking account of personality traits , such as competitiveness and anxiety , had no effect on the results .
' More research needed ' Professor Miguel Martinez - Gonzalez , of the University of Navarra , said the results would have to be confirmed in longer trials with more participants but they had found a strong inverse association between the Mediterranean diet and depression .
" Thirty per cent is a large reduction in the risk and this could be very important considering the large burden of disease represented by depression .
" We know how important the Mediterranean diet is in reducing cardiovascular risk factors and the same inflammatory proteins are also raised in patients with depression . "
He said it was likely that the overall dietary pattern was more important than the effect of single components and " may exert a fair degree of protection against depression " .
Dr Cecilia D'Felice , a clinical psychologist , said there was mounting evidence for the importance of diet in treating depression .
She said : " What we do know is that a diet high in olive oil will enhance the amount of serotonin or brain transmitter available to you .
" Most anti-depression drugs work to keep more serotonin available in the brain . "

I wish you could have been here to share my glee when I unpinned the blocking Milkweed scarf .
It was soft and lovely before I blocked it , but in its finished state , it ’s phenomenal .
Soft , drapey , scrunchy , and yeah … soft .
I am now actively looking for the next opportunity to knit with Malabrigo Sock for not - socks .
I ’m not sure what else to say about this project !
It ’s just that good .
I ’m in love with the finished scarf !
I do n’t often make the exact same project more than once , but I am considering the possibility of knitting some very similar designs .
I love the garter stitch and the great use for sock yarn .
This blog is going to look a little like a FO - parade for the next little bit .
After this post , I have two more finished objects to show off … and all the while I ’ll be furiously trying to finish up another one in the background .
I have a sweater on the needles – that I have n’t shown you yet – and I ’m trying to get it finished in time for the Lorna ’s Laces knit - along for the Pioneer sweater , which I ’m looking forward to getting started .
Researchers in Japan are reporting new evidence that the ordinary vinegar — a staple in oil - and - vinegar salad dressings , pickles , and other foods — may live up to its age - old reputation in folk medicine as a health promoter .
They are reporting new evidence that vinegar can help prevent accumulation of body fat and weight gain .
Tomoo Kondo and colleagues note in the new study that vinegar has also been used as a folk medicine since ancient times .
People have used it for a range of ills .
Modern scientific research suggests that acetic acid , the main component of vinegar , may help control blood pressure , blood sugar levels , and fat accumulation .
Their new study showed that laboratory mice fed a high - fat diet and given acetic acid developed significantly less body fat ( up to 10 percent less ) than other mice .
Importantly , the new research adds evidence to the belief that acetic acid fights fat by turning on genes for fatty acid oxidation enzymes .
The genes churn out proteins involved in breaking down fats , thus suppressing body fat accumulation in the body .
Mollie Orshansky had no intent for her calculations to be used in this fashion , of course :
http://www.ssa.gov/...
The poverty thresholds were developed in 1963 - 64 by Mollie Orshansky , an economist working for the Social Security Administration .
As Orshansky later indicated , her original purpose was not to introduce a new general measure of poverty , but to develop a measure to assess the relative risks of low economic status ( or , more broadly , the differentials in opportunity ) among different demographic groups of families with children .
She actually developed two sets of poverty thresholds - one derived from the Agriculture Department 's economy food plan and one derived from its somewhat less stringent low cost food plan .
She described an initial version of these thresholds for families with children only in the July 1963 article cited in footnote 6 .
She published an analysis using a refined version of the thresholds expanded to include thresholds for unrelated individuals and families without children in a January 1965 article .
The Johnson Administration announced its War on Poverty in January 1964 , not long after the publication of Orshansky 's initial poverty article .
The 1964 Report of the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) contained a chapter on poverty in America .
The chapter set a poverty line of $ 3,000 ( in 1962 dollars ) for families of all sizes ; for unrelated individuals , the chapter implicitly set a poverty line of $ 1,500 ( a selection that was shortly made explicit ) .
The $ 3,000 figure was specified as being on the basis of before tax annual money income .
There was a brief discussion of the theoretical desirability of using estimates of " total " incomes including nonmoney elements such as the rental value of owner occupied dwellings and food raised and consumed on farms but it was not possible to obtain such estimates .
The CEA chapter pointed out that the total of money plus nonmoney income that would correspond to the cash - ­income only poverty line of $ 3,000 would be somewhat higher than $ 3,000 .
The CEA chapter referred to Orshansky 's July 1963 article and its $ 3,165 " economy plan " poverty line for a nonfarm family of four .
" Other studies have used different market baskets , many of them costing more .
On balance , they provide support for using as a boundary , a family whose annual money income from all sources was $ 3,000 . . . . "
This passage has led some people to think that the CEA 's $ 3,000 poverty line was derived to a greater or lesser degree from Orshansky 's $ 3,165 poverty line .
However , Robert Lampman ( a member of the CEA staff ) had been working on an analysis of poverty using the $ 3,000 figure as early as the spring of 1963 ­several months before Orshansky 's initial article was published .
Instead , the $ 3,000 figure was a consensus choice based on consideration of such factors as the minimum wage level , the income levels at which families began to have to pay Federal income taxes , and public assistance payment levels .
Orshansky was concerned by the CEA report 's failure to adjust its poverty line for family size , which resulted in understating the number of children in poverty relative to aged persons .
This prompted her to begin the work that resulted in her January 1965 Social Security Bulletin article , extending the two sets of poverty thresholds at the " economy level " and at the " low cost level " to the whole population .
This article appeared just as the Office of Economic Opportunity ( OEO ) was being established .
The OEO adopted the lower ( " economy level " ) of Orshansky 's two sets of poverty thresholds as a working or quasi official definition of poverty in May 1965 .
As noted below , the thresholds were designated as the Federal Government 's official statistical definition of poverty in August 1969 .
Orshansky did not develop the poverty thresholds as a standard budget that is , a list of goods and services that a family of a specified size and composition would need to live at a designated level of well being , together with their estimated monthly or annual costs .
If generally accepted standards of minimum need had been available for all or most of the major essential consumption items of living ( for example , housing , medical care , clothing , and transportation ) , the standard budget approach could have been used by costing out the standards and adding up the costs .
However , except for the area of food , no definitive and accepted standards of minimum need for major consumption items existed either then or today .
The " generally accepted " standards of adequacy for food that Orshansky used in developing the thresholds were the food plans prepared by the Department of Agriculture .
At the time there were four of these food plans , at the following cost levels : liberal , moderate , low cost , and economy .
The first three plans had been introduced in 1933 , and the economy food plan was developed and introduced in 1961 .
Data underlying the latter plan came from the Agriculture Department 's 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey .
In developing her two sets of poverty thresholds , Orshansky used the low cost and economy food plans : 15
The low cost plan , adapted to the food patterns of families in the lowest third of the income range , has for many years been used by welfare agencies as a basis for food allotments for needy families and others who wished to keep food costs down .
Often , however , the actual food allowance for families receiving public assistance was less than that in the low cost plan .... spending as much as this food plan recommends by no means guarantees that diets will be adequate . . . . Recently the Department of Agriculture began to issue an " economy " food plan , costing only 75­ - 80 percent as much as the basic low - ­cost plan , for " temporary or emergency use when funds are low . " . . . The food plan as such includes no additional allowance for meals eaten out or other food eaten away from home .
Of course , today , food is around 1/10 of a typical family 's budget .
Housing , health insurance , and transportation have all skyrocketed compared to the cost of food ... though food showed a dramatic uptick in 2007 .
Health insurance was n't even on the radar in the 1960s , but today the cost of a median family health insurance policy is about 2/3 of the corresponding FPL .
The current poverty level is not calculated using a basket of food , but rather by using that 1963 basket of food and multiplying each year by the Consumer Price Index - which again , only lightly considers housing costs and does not include health insurance at all .
The CPI has a strong representation of durable goods , such as cars and washing machines , goods that families at the poverty line rarely buy new if at all .
According to DHHS :
Programs using the guidelines ( or percentage multiples of the guidelines — for instance , 125 percent or 185 percent of the guidelines ) in determining eligibility include Head Start , the Food Stamp Program , the National School Lunch Program , the Low - Income Home Energy Assistance Program , and the Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) .
You can see some alternate poverty numbers proposed by the Census Bureau , that take region into account and that better reflect the increasing cost of housing .
Frankly , when I first came across this in 2007 , I had no idea that the calculation was so , well , random , compared to today 's typical expenditures .
There 's an initiative by the California Budget Project to develop some more useful numbers .
Their study suggested that a California family of four with two working adults needed a 2007 income of $ 72,000 to make ends meet without government assistance , more than three times the federal poverty level .
Their complete report , Making Ends Meet : How Much Does it Cost to Raise a Family in California ? ( PDF ) , builds a budget for a single adult , a single parent family with two children , a two - parent family with one worker and two children , and a two - parent family with two workers and two children from the ground up .
It was meant to be a modest living , without any public assistance , consisting of rent , food , child care , health care , transportation , taxes , and incidentals .
It does not include any savings for retirement or college , home ownership , or emergencies .
Jean Ross , executive director of the California Budget Project , in comparing the two , said :
" The poverty standard does n't take into account the real cost of housing .
It does n't take into account that many more families today have two working full - time parents and need to purchase childcare for their children .
It does n't take into account the decline in job - based health insurance . "
There 's a fairly thorough methodology laid out , showing what expenses they included and what they did n't .
This is n't poverty , but it 's definitely living paycheck to paycheck .
There 's no allowance for savings , toys ( aside from birthday presents ) , or entertainment .
No dental care .
Transportation is figured as the IRS ' national per mile allowance , with no separate car payment for a newer vehicle , or for that matter , reflection for California 's higher gas prices , which average 23 cents per gallon more than the national average .
It is important to note what is not included in the basic family budget .
For example , these estimates assume that families rent , rather than own , their homes and live in housing that many would consider overcrowded for a three - or four - person household .
For many families , homeownership remains a dream , particularly in many of California 's urban communities , which are among the most costly housing markets in the country .
The basic family budgets assume that families use home - based child care , rather than more expensive center - based care , and that health coverage is purchased privately with no assistance from an employer .
Finally , these estimates allow very little to no room for savings toward retirement or a child ’s college education .
Many Californians support their families on less than the standard estimated by this report .
Some can live on less because they receive health coverage from their jobs , are able to leave their children with family or friends while at work , or because they cut costs to make ends meet .
Others , including many working families , rely on public programs such as food stamps , Medi-Cal , or Healthy Families ; others rely on private charities , or go into debt because their income is insufficient to pay for basic needs .
Many of these families rely on Medi-Cal , child care assistance , and other public programs in order to make ends meet .
The California Budget 's ( CBP ) basic family budget wage provides an estimate of the income needed to meet basic needs without assistance .
This is an obscure , wonky , detail , but it colors so much of the debate for many social programs , including health care .
It 's reasonable to see a multiplier like 350 % of the federal poverty level and think , " Hey , those families are doing just fine " and therefore do n't need help with health insurance .
What 's missed is that the FPL number is completely unrelated to the true cost of living in the United States in 2009 .
It 's time for some new , regional numbers .
This week could be Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœtheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ watershed for the USD for this quarter !
If nothing else , politically may be an eye opener for many of us .
With Japan on holidays today , it has given us a slow start , definitely a false one , as the rest of this week is jam - packed with ingredients for some Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœexcitementÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
There is an interesting FOMC meeting .
Will they or wonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t they present some sort of exit strategy ?
There is the German IFO and German elections , followed closely by the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh .
If nothing else , some of these events will break the monotony that we have been trading over the past week !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
There was nothing to guide the USD on Friday apart from suspicion and innuendo .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s done rather well after printing yearly lows vs. most of the G10 countries .
Perhaps US assets are turning the corner slightly and becoming more in Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœvogueÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
That would not be a surprise , technically we have been very pedestrian and one directional that requires some sort of retracement .
However , fundamentally we could be doing the exact opposite .
Perhaps these Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœelevatedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ levels are giving us an opportunity to unwind or establish our dislike for the anything USD denominated at the moment !
The USD $ is currently higher against the EUR - 0.38 % , GBP - 0.46 % , CHF - 0.41 % and JPY - 0.80 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.50 % and AUD - 0.56 % .
After printing an 11 - month high last week as both global equities and commodities pushed the currency to dominate its southern neighbor , it has neatly pared some of its strength ahead of the FOMC meeting this week .
Investor have been speculating that the global recession is Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœoverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ which boosted the appetite for higher - yielding assets including commodity - linked currencies like the CAD and AUD .
Is it sustainable was the question that had pushed the greenback to new yearly lows last week .
Rumors were rife that the BOC was checking rates and gave the illusion that they would enter the fray .
It was exactly that , just rumors .
Do not expect them to waddle in Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœWilly - nillyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
Year to - date the loonie has appreciated +15 % vs. its southern trading partner , last year it depreciated - 18 % !
Dealers continue to play the range and will take their cue from commodities and equities .
With global equities and commodities coming under pressure , higher yielding assets were bound to come under threat .
After printing New Year highs early last week , the AUD managed to fall for a 3rd - day amid speculation the Fed will this week signal plans to withdraw stimulus measures , boosting the appeal of US assets ( 0.8615 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 71.02 down - 102c ) .
Crude oil fell for a 2nd - consecutive day on Friday as the dollar strengthened vs. the EUR , paring investorsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ demand for dollar - priced assets to hedge against inflation .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report supported higher crude prices .
US oil stockpiles fell much more than expected as imports continued to decrease while inventories of refined fuels increased .
Crude inventories fell by - 4.7 m barrels w/w to +332.8 m , beating analysts ’ forecasts of a drop of - 2.4 m .
Imports fell - 192 k barrels per day .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that refiners cut crude runs by - 56 k bpd as refinery utilization was off - 0.3 % to 86.9 % of capacity .
The market was anticipating a - 0.5 % fall .
Inventories of distillates fuels ( heating oil and diesel ) were up + 2.2 m barrels at +167.8 m , vs. forecasts for a rise of only + 1.3 m .
On the flip side , gas supplies increased +500 k barrels to +207.7 m , w/w .
The data would have included the Labor Day holiday , which historically marks the end of the US summer driving season .
Surprisingly , the API report painted a slightly different picture .
Crude stocks gained +631 k barrels last week as refiners slowed run rates by - 146 k bpd .
Inventories of distillates rose + 5.2 m barrels and gas inventories were up by + 1.3 m barrels .
Stronger US fundamental and Governor BernankeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s belief that worst of the recession is over will provide further support on pull backs in the short term .
Last week , we were subjected to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœweakÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ dollar boosting the appeal of commodities to investors as an inflation hedge , perhaps this week we will see the greenback rebound !
Gold has fallen in the O/N session , which is threatening rally that has sent prices above $ 1,000 an ounce this month , as a rebound by the greenback is curbing demand for the yellow metal as a hedge against inflation ( $ 1,002 ) .
Follow the USD that will validate current metal prices .
The market does feel slightly squeezed at these elevated levels !
The Nikkei closed at 10,370 down - 73 ( holiday ) .

NEW YORK -- Joe Mauer became only the second catcher in 33 years to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award , finishing first in a near - unanimous vote Monday .
The Minnesota Twins star received 27 of 28 first - place votes and 387 points in balloting by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America .
New York Yankees teammates Mark Teixeira ( 225 points ) and Derek Jeter ( 193 ) followed .
The Detroit Tigers ' Miguel Cabrera drew the other first - place vote and was fourth with 171 points , one point ahead of the Los Angeles Angels ' Kendry Morales .
Mauer became the second Twins player to win in four years , following Justin Morneau in 2006 .
Morneau gave Mauer a bottle of champagne Monday at the Metrodome .
" Hopefully we can pop that open here a little later , " Mauer said .
Mauer set a major league record for highest batting average by a catcher and won his third batting title , becoming the first repeat batting champion since Nomar Garciaparra in 1999 - 2000 .
" I love catching .
I love the demands that are put on me and the responsibilities that I have , although it might beat you up a little bit physically and mentally , " Mauer said .
" I like being back there making those decisions , you know , for my team . "
After missing April with a back injury , Mauer homered on his first swing of the season and went on to lead the AL in batting average ( .365 ) , on - base percentage ( .444 ) and slugging percentage ( .587 ) , the first AL player to top all three categories in the same season since George Brett in 1980 .
Mauer set career bests with 28 homers and 96 RBIs .
He had more walks ( 76 ) than strikeouts ( 63 ) and batted .378 after Morneau 's season - ending back injury Sept. 12 , helping the Twins overtake Detroit for the AL Central title .
He was voted to his third All - Star team and won his second straight AL Gold Glove .
Mauer said the injury and his minor rehabilitation assignment might have been a " blessing in disguise . "
He was forced to do more core work on his abdominal muscles .
" In April , I could n't watch a whole lot of the games , " he said .
" I 'd watch for a little bit and I 'd get so frustrated that I was n't out there . "
Born in St. Paul , the 26 - year - old can leave the Twins and become a free agent after the 2010 season , when he is to make $ 12.5 million .
Minnesota is expected to try to sign him to a new deal .
Piquet Jr has continually struggled to impress in Formula 1 for Renault
Nelson Piquet
Jr has been told by Renault he will not continue driving for them in Formula 1 this season .
The 23 - year - old has had 28 races in F1 without recording a win and has not won a point in his 10 races this season .
" I have received notice from Renault of its intention to stop me from driving for them in the current F1 season , " read a statement on his website .
Piquet described this season as " the worst period of my career " and has criticised team boss Flavio Briatore .
" I believe without doubt in my talent and my performance , " said the Brazilian , who finished second to current F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton in the 2006 GP2 championship .
A manager is supposed to encourage you , support you , and provide you with opportunities ...
Flavio Briatore was my executioner
Nelson Piquet Jr " I did n't get this far by getting bad results .
Anyone who knows my history knows the results I am having in F1 do not match my CV and my ability .
" The conditions I have had to deal with during the last two years have been very strange to say the least - there are incidents that I can hardly believe occurred myself .
" If I now need to give explanations , I am certain it is because of the unfair situation I have been in in the past two years .
" I always believed that having a manager was being a part of a team and having a partner .
" A manager is supposed to encourage you , support you , and provide you with opportunities .
In my case it was the opposite - Flavio Briatore was my executioner . "
He added : " I am a team player and there are dozens of people I have worked with in my career who would vouch for my character and talent , except unfortunately the person that has had the most influence on my career in F1 . "
606 : DEBATE Piquet
Jr is a mediocre driver .
He 's OK for F1 , but is never going to trouble the top ...
JimClark07
Piquet also accused the Italian of behaving unfairly towards him during his time driving alongside two - time world champion Fernando Alonso .
" On numerous occasions , 15 minutes before qualifying and races , my manager and team boss would threaten me , telling me if I did n't get a good result , he had another driver ready to put in my place . "
Piquet Jr - whose father Nelson Piquet was F1 world champion in 1981 , 1983 and 1987 - vowed to remain in motorsport but did not specify whether he would stay racing within F1 .
" I feel a sense of relief for the end of the worst period of my career , and the possibility that I can now move on and put my career back on the right track and try to recover my reputation of a fast , winning driver , " he said .
Piquet Jr's replacement is unknown as yet though Renault test driver Romain Grosjean is expected to be in contention .

California is on path for a record 2009 .
By the end of the year over 475,000 notice of defaults will be sent to California homeowners .
This of course is simply from lenders that actually even bother to send a notice of default .
The shadow inventory is growing and we have some concrete data showing the mismanagement in the housing market .
Banks for the most part are playing hot potato with bad mortgages like Alt - A and option ARMs .
It is interesting to note that today , we have data showing a record number of notice of defaults for 2009 yet actual foreclosures are less than 2008 .
What gives ?
Well for Q3 we found out that the median months behind before a lender filed a NOD is 5 months .
That is right , 5 months with no payment before the lender even notices .
First let us look at this trend on a chart :
Source : Data Quick
The first key point is that 2009 saw more notice of defaults sent out than in 2008 .
In terms of housing distress , 2009 was a tougher market than in 2008 .
Sales have boomed but this is mostly due to the lower end of the market enticing investors and first time buyers .
Throw in every incentive you can imagine and you can understand why it “ feels ” better .
The data as you can see above shows otherwise .
The Q4 data is an estimate but I lowered the number even below the current average .
Given that many lenders are not even moving on some properties , we can expect NODs to probably fall again in Q4 .
Some lenders like Bank of America have stated that they will start moving and foreclosing on loans that do n’t qualify for HAMP soon but we ’ll see .
I take what the banks say with a grain of salt .
You would expect that with a high NOD and weak cure rate , that actual foreclosures would be higher this year for California .
Not the case :
This is a fascinating trend .
A loan that enters the NOD phase in all likelihood is going to be foreclosed .
But banks are n’t moving through the process in full form .
In many cases this is where the shadow inventory is being built .
At this point , it is n’t the REOs on the books that are a problem but loans that are sitting in a sort of mortgage purgatory .
Not paying but also no NOD .
Given low cure rates and the abundance of toxic mortgages in California it is a major red flag that NODs are at a record but foreclosures are falling .
We now know the average foreclosure timeline is 18 months to 2 years so some of these will become foreclosures in 2010 .
If we look at quarterly data , you can actually see this .
NODs will spike followed by a jump in actual foreclosures :
You ’ll see NODs spike in 2006 and 2007 followed by actual foreclosures .
We see a dip in 2008 because of moratoriums but the trend emerges with one caveat .
Foreclosures do n’t seem to have a trend but move sideways .
So what is the reason for this ?
Banks are largely operating with no system in place and many institutions are selectively ignoring certain non-payers .
So in terms of actual data , they look fine in some areas .
After all , if the bank is n’t pursuing the property why would the public care ?
The public should care because taxpayers now subsidize the entire banking and mortgage industry ( hello FHA insured loans ) .
Many of our favorite toxic mortgage all - stars appear in Q3 of 2009 .
In fact , the largest defaulter in Q3 is now defunct Countrywide :
In fact , out of the top 5 culprits only two stand in 2009 and that is Bank of America and Wells Fargo .
Bank of America swallowed up Countrywide Financial and Washington Mutual is now part of Chase ( as if I need to tell anyone in California with Chase ’s massive marketing blitz partly subsidized by the American taxpayer ) .
The lenders are gone but the loans are still here wrecking havoc .
Yet that is only half of the story .
If we look at some of the subprime outfits we get default rates for the period of :
ResMAE Mortgage : 73.9
Ownit Mortgage : 69.5
BNC Mortgage : 61.4
Argent Mortgage : 59.9
First Franklin : 59.4
These suckers are long gone but here are their mortgages clogging up the California housing market .
Is anyone going after these people criminally ?
Look at those rates !
You have fraud factory written all over them .
Nationwide Housing Market
The nationwide housing market is still in deep trouble .
The amount of single family homes in delinquency is an all time high :
Source : Congressional Oversight Panel
Now here is where the above California data does n’t coincide .
California has 5.3 million homes with a mortgage .
Keep in mind California is in much worse shape than the overall trend .
So using this data , you would expect some 530,000 homes in a form of distress .
That nearly matches up with the 475,000 figure for NODs .
But then , if we look at actual cure rates , we are left asking what is really going on here ?
Most of the Alt - A loans and a ton of subprime is here in California .
Meaning , of the 475,000 NODs we would expect only 23,750 to cure ( assuming better nationwide stats ) .
Yet actual foreclosures are trending more in the figure of 230,000 for 2009 .
In other words even by this data some 200,000 homes are sitting in the California pipeline .
The number is much higher because we are not looking at many homes with non-payers or strategic defaulters that have yet to even receive an NOD .
Ca n’t track something you do n’t report but we know it is happening .
We have never had so many housing units in foreclosure :
This is the trend that we should be following .
So far , we have seen no major decline in actual foreclosures .
Negative equity is a big reason for the defaults and California is one of the prime negative equity states :
Source : Congressional Oversight Panel
30 percent of California homes with a mortgage are underwater ( equals 1.745 million home owners / debtors ) .
35 percent are near negative equity .
That is why pushing the 3.5 percent down with FHA loans is such a losing proposition .
If homes decline say another 5 or 10 percent , there goes another batch of people into negative equity positions which increase the chance of foreclosure .
The data is right here but gimmicks trump good public policy .
Nationwide 20 percent of mortgages are underwater .
Not good .
I ’ve been searching for a chart that measured the overall foreclosure rate with unemployment for some time now .
It would reason that higher unemployment would lead to more foreclosures .
Yet that is n’t always the case :
You ’ll notice in the early 1990s recession that as unemployment went up , foreclosures merely moved sideways .
In the early 1980s , unemployment shot sky high yet foreclosures modestly increase .
But during this decade , housing and employment coupled .
Why ?
Our entire economy became dependent on the housing bubble .
What this meant was that wherever housing went , unemployment was sure to follow .
Now , foreclosures are busting through any historical trends .
The Congressional Oversight Panel also does n’t believe in the hype of another housing bubble :
If anything , the futures market does n’t see any price increase well into 2013 .
So much for the housing shills pumping up the current market .
They fail to see that the recent price increase is based on :
- Moratoriums
- First time home buyers
- Investors
-$ 8,000 tax credit
- Fed buying $ 1.25 trillion in GSE MBS keeping rates artificially low
These things ca n’t go on forever .
Those betting with actual money in the markets do n’t believe this either .
Why ?
Employment is still weak .
We have a glut of housing to last us through 2013 .
That is why you do n’t see massive home building even 2 years after the bubble burst .
We also have an artificial amount of inventory on the market with government programs :
As I discussed before , the HAMP is largely a misguided program because it is based on the extend and pretend philosophy .
So far , only 1,711 modifications have been permanent through HAMP .
But you ’ll love this data .
Remember that HOPE program ?
Bwahahahaha !
94 refinanced loans since the program launched in 2008 !
I remember talking about this back in 2007 when it was pre-launch .
It turned out to be a bigger joke than even I could have imagined .
Even when we drill down in the 1,711 HAMP perm-mods , you will notice that the loans are largely fixed rate products :
So much for redoing those Alt - A and option ARMs here in California .
By the way , good luck on getting a 31 percent ratio on some of these homes in mid to upper tier SoCal areas .
These homes are underwater to the point of needing a scuba diving suit to refinance the mortgage .
Plus , most people will strategically default on these places anyways .
Banks on the other hand , will probably prolong the foreclosure process as long as they are sucking taxpayers dry .
What were reasons given from the HAMP modifications ?
The top 3 reasons include , loss of income , excessive obligations , and unemployment .
Basically the job market !
You will not solve housing without having a solid employment base .
Some people have asked me why does n’t Wall Street and the government see this ?
They do .
They just do n’t care .
Their assumption is that if Wall Street is raining , somehow some little drops will sprinkle on the poor typical American .
Ask the 27 million unemployed and underemployed how happy they are that the S&P 500 is now up 62 percent from the March low .
Lagging indicator ?
To the point of lagging you out of a decade .
And let us look at the data of what is being done .
This is the actual ruse of the HAMP mods .
It is extend …
And pretend …
The loan rate is only low for a fixed time .
The principal is fully intact allowing banks to claim these loans at full face value which is a crock .
Without the HAMP government subsidy , these loans would need to be foreclosed .
I have no problem working with homeowners only if the banks fit the bill .
Yet they are so corrupt and cynical that they want the money for the mods to come from the government !
Bail us out and then pay for the mods .
What a load of insanity .
Seriously ?
Enough of this and let the trials begin .
It looks like a couple of hedge fund gurus are being taken down with more to follow .
I ’ve sent letters to Congress , called up representatives , and some agree but the sense I got from many is “ what can I do ? . ”
Also looking at the extend and pretend , you ca n’t modify property taxes and insurance .
These are based on the assessed value of the home which according to the bank is still up in the peak ranges .
What horrible policy .
The OCC and OTS have some more data in other types of modifications :
The same kind of pattern emerges as the 1,711 HAMP mods .
That is , extend the term and pretend to lower the rate for a few years .
You can also capitalize some of the principal on the back end rendering many of these option ARM - lites .
That is why the re-default rates are through the roof .
I imagine the HAMP re -default rates will be equally high .
You saw the reason for payment problems .
You did n’t see , “ because my payment was too high ” but more employment based .
For those that saw reductions in their income , what if they lose their job ?
This is basically underwriting ala 2005 again .
People ask then what is really the solution ?
I ’ve said it many times but you ca n’t have an economy without job growth .
This sounds obvious but it would appear to be off the radar for Wall Street and our government .
If you focus on the job situation , then housing will right itself .
Notice that 1991 recession and foreclosures ?
What happened ?
Well we had the technology boom and added 20 million jobs over the decade .
That was a bubble and that burst but you can see that yes , you can have an economy that runs outside of housing .
But this decade housing was the economy .
And the government and Wall Street basically want that industry back .
Well it is n’t coming back .
They need to figure out what to do .
And there is nothing wrong with renting !
In fact , it is a shame that there is no actual initiative encouraging renting .
Some of these people in distress will do much better to downsize .
They are even telling the HAMP mod survey that they are financially strained .
Maybe renting a lower priced home will help .
Nothing wrong with that until you land on your feet again .
Yet this notion that everyone deserves to own a home is largely a reason we are in this mess .
Wall Street exploited this “ American ” desire and people ate it up .
In fact , the dream was no longer to own a modest home but to own some oversized McMansion and drive a gigantic V - 10 tank that got 8 miles per gallon .
When did the American Dream become a Marvel Comic ?
Some suggestions are to bring back our industrial base to the U.S.
Make ourselves more competitive .
Flipping homes to one another while quant jocks play Halo on one screen and do billion dollar trades on another Bloomberg Terminal is not a real economy .
It basically strips the value out of the real economy .
These banks posting record profits ?
JP Morgan making $ 3.6 billion last quarter .
Really ?
Most of it was through their i-banking and private equity division .
If they want to act like a hedge fund so be it but they have zero access to the Fed and U.S. Treasury .
Instead , they are a primary dealer .
Healthcare is a big part of our economy and will remain that way with over 70 million baby boomers entering retirement age .
Surely we can create some jobs in this arena .
At least it is better than installing granite countertops in every home and adding Jacuzzis and pretending we are keeping up with technological innovations of other countries .
In large part , housing has become a major distraction .
It is a cultural neurosis like Tulip Mania or watching UFOs on TV taking away a kid but in the end , it is all fake .
The equity in these California homes was fake .
The Wall Street profits were a sham .
So until we can return to a real economy , focusing on housing only serves as a form of therapy .

AV - Comparatives is known for the thorough tests it does on security software .
Following its May 2009 retrospective / proactive report , the company has released its August 2009 on - demand comparative .
Sixteen products , last updated on August 10 , were set on the same highest detection settings ( except for Sophos and F - Secure ) and put to the test .
There were two sets of malware : Set A , which contains malware from December 2007 to December 2008 ( most products could detect over 97 percent ) , and Set B , which contains malware from the last seven months ( 1.6 million samples ) .
The set included the following categories of malware : Trojans ( 69.5 percent ) , Backdoors / Bots ( 20.7 percent ) , Worms ( 6.1 percent ) , other malware ( 1.5 percent ) , Windows viruses ( 0.4 percent ) .
Here are the results for Set B :
G DATA Antivirus 20.0.4.9 : 99.8 percent AVIRA AntiVir Premium 9.0.0.446 : 99.4 percent McAfee VirusScan Plus 13.11.102 : 98.7 percent Symantec Norton Antivirus 17.0.0.136 : 98.4 percent Avast Professional Edition 4.8.1348 : 98.0 percent F- Secure Antivirus 10.00.246 : 97.9 percent BitDefender Antivirus 13.0.13.254 : 97.8 percent eScan AntiVirus 10.0.997.491 : 97.7 percent Trustport Antivirus 2.8.0.3017 : 97.6 percent ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0.437.0 : 97.2 percent Kaspersky AntiVirus 9.0.0.463 : 94.7 percent AVG Antivirus 8.5.406 : 94.0 percent Sophos Antivirus 7.6.10 : 91.3 percent Microsoft Windows Live OneCare 2.5.2900.28 : 90.0 percent Kingsoft Antivirus 2009.08.05.16 : 86.4 percent Norman Antivirus & AntiSpyware 7.10.02 : 84.8 percent
Detection rates are n't the only thing that matters for an antivirus , though .
The following graph shows missed malware samples ( in percentage points ) for each of the 16 products :
The second graph shows false alarms ( number of detections that were n't actually malware ) when scanning ( on - demand ) a set of clean files for each of the 16 products :
The final graph shows the throughput rate ( in MB / sec ) when scanning ( on - demand ) a set of clean files for the 16 products :
Using all of the above results , AV - Comparatives rated the security companies from best to worst in four separate categories :

Answer
A rock is a naturally formed mass of mineral matter , majorly consisting of parts of the Earth 's crust and mantle .
Rocks are NOT living creatures themselves , although many organisms that live in , on or around rocks may make it appear as though the rock itself is alive , and has the ability to eat .
Examples of what rocks appear to ' Eat ' :
Ants and worms .
Want proof ?
Turn over just about any rock and you will find all their victims trapped underneath .
They are always grateful when you release them .
Rocks are so cruel .
In fact , the bigger the rock , the bigger the prey .
Rocks will eat just about anything significantly smaller than themselves , including humans ( see related link below ) .
It is obvious that rock eating habits are responsible for the extinctions of various plants and animal species .
Just look at the bones of dinosaurs that have been found inside of rock .
The eating habits of the rock coal were obviously responsible for the extinction of the Carboniferous Period forests .
And limestone must have had a voracious appetite for sea creatures and shark teeth .
It is important to distinguish between land rocks and sea rocks , however .
If you turn over a rock on the beach , you will find crabs and snails .
It is also known that rocks eat your brains ; as in " You have rocks in your head " !
After digesting a kill , rocks excrete their waste through tiny pores on their bodies .
This green waste , called " lichen " , is a prized delicacy and is the basis of the French cheese " Roquefort " ( literally , " Rock Fart " ) .
One of the most amazing species of rock , the Death Valley sailing stones , actually can take advantage of wind current to pursue their prey .
Sailing Rocks are a huge mystery to scientists because the rocks move in long tracks along a valley floor without human or animal intervention .
They have been recorded and studied by researchers but the force behind their movement is still not understood .
( CNN ) --
The next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes , do n't fault bad driving , but genetics .
In a study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex , researcher Steven Cramer found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it .
The study by Cramer , a neurology professor at the University of California Irvine , might also help explain why there are so many bad drivers on U.S. highways : About 30 percent of Americans have the variant .
Ordinarily , when a person performs a task , a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) is secreted to the area of the brain that is associated with that activity .
The protein helps facilitate communication among brain cells and helps retain memory .
However in people who have the gene variation that Cramer studied , BDNF secretion is limited .
" These people make more errors from the get - go , and they forget more of what they learned after time away , " Cramer said in a statement .
Cramer and his team of researchers set out to find how the variant affected driving .
They recruited 29 people to drive 15 laps on a simulated course with difficult curves and turns .
Twenty - two of the participants did not have the gene variant ; seven did .
The researchers wanted to see how effectively the participants learned to navigate the twists and turns in each subsequent lap .
Four days later , they repeated the test .
The participants with the variant did worse both times .
They also retained less the second go - round .
" I 'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes , " Cramer said .
" I wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant . "
Unfortunately , a test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available .
The dissenter 's pleas can be heard by all who will give ear .
It seems as though all is well in our utopia , or that is how the mainstream media will have us to believe .
The bureaucrats of our government seem wanton of the same .
To see the truth , all one has to do is open their eyes and see how their neighborhood fairs .
Elitist dreams of a fascist brand of leadership .
Leadership , that is a peculiar way to direct their version of thought on how our society should suffice the population .
This leadership facet can only take us further from the truth .
They seem to govern on how they believe we should live , instead of the way we want to live .
What kind of life is that ?
No life is the answer .
This branded agenda will only be brought to light via the idea of population control .
How is this , you may ask ?
Well , it is like this .
The General Welfare clause of their own demise has been usurped to bring Big Brother evermore into the facet of daily life .
As in all forms of authoritarian rule they have used general welfare as an all - fairing guide to enlist the citizen to perform the tasks in revolution .
The call for General Welfare has an implication of liberty that can be of an unassuming nature .
If the citizen is convinced that such activity will improve such liberties , if only they were suspended for a period of time .
Yes , the relinquishing of liberty to perfect society as a whole .
Sounds good , does n't it ?
If you want government to make the decisions in every manner possible , then that is the plan for you .
For me , no .
I know that freedom and liberty are derived from the securing of such rights and not the relinquishing of such .
Have you been derided for your expressions of freedom ?
Are you called a racist because you do n't agree with everything your government states ?
When you speak out in public , are you named a traitor ?
That is what has happened in the recent debates on legislation .
If you spoke in favor of such matters then you were a great American .
Now , if you spoke against the legislation you were noted as a political terrorist or a traitor .
This is by your elected representatives .
With this being stated , who are they representing ?
As I recall , I did n't vote for anyone that was going to accuse me of being unpatriotic or a terrorist .
Maybe I am mistaken , but I do believe the Constitution calls for the citizen to reform the government .
Of the people , by the people , for the people .
That is a beautiful statement .
Simple , yet assuring of freedom .
So , one might think .
Our elected government does not seem to see it this way .
They are educated and elite in all that they do .
That is what they believe .
What do you think ?
After all you are the elector .
Do you feel equally represented ?
You should , since you pay more than your fair share of taxes .
The truth can only be told , “ One person , one vote ” .
The representation of the people is totally inadequate .
It can be seen when a legal vote of the people is disallowed the administration or courts .
At hand , is a matter of who has convening authority ?
The legal vote of the people or the elitist bureaucrat ?
What do you say ?
Oh , I forgot .
Your opinion matters , not !
Am I entitled to my opinion ?
Are you ?
Does your vote count ?
If politically correct , then yes .
To be politically correct seems to be unpatriotic and immoral .
Of course this is just one man 's opinion .
How would history have changed if this manner of correctness would have been followed ?
Think about it .
The founding fathers were definitely not of the politically correct crowd .
Everything they did was illegal , under the laws of the government of the day .
Obviously , if they were politically correct they would have supported the monarchy .
Apparently they supported the revolution .
This should give you something to think about .
As far as politically correct , I am definitely not a functionary .
I am an American citizen , and therefore a citizen sovereign .
What is a citizen sovereign ?
The citizen sovereign is an individual that identifies with the inherent liberties and rights guaranteed through that of a constitution .
Now that may not be the affirmed definition , but it is one that I will use .
As a citizen sovereign you are the elector , and therefore a guarantor of government seat .
The government that you elected has not seen it as your right , but their right .
They feel that you are not good enough to see to your own being .
Your rights and liberties are being abated as we speak .
You are the guarantor of the election , yet you are not represented in your own right .
If you are good enough to elect them , it is free to assume that you are good enough to have a job done right .
If this is so , why do you still elect the same individual to office that refused to perform the duties of the elected post .
These duties meaning the performance based on their campaign platform .
The political platform is invariably , a promise to the constituent .
A promise is supposed to be kept .
Now it can be reasoned that some promises cannot be completed as stated , yet the mere attempt is expected .
The politician tends to show indifference to the the constituent .
Thus , the constituent must fulfill their duties as citizens ' sovereign .
To take the responsibilities of such serious , one must maintain the very citizenship status .
In order to invoke their elitism , they must first dissipate with your citizenship .
It must be understood that these usurpers are out to diminish the sovereignty of the states .
By doing this they will handily take to the centralization of powers .
A central governing authority to undermine what is left of the several states and their authority .
It is time for these state legislatures to set their motions toward a sovereignty , all their own .
This is not to be taken as an act of secession .
To be sure , a backlash will fall upon me for writing this .
It is all I can do to protect and serve my nation , and that of my children .
We cannot allow for the usurping of the obligation to our founding .
The founding fathers set forth the documents , by which were inherent rights and responsibilities .
These responsibilities must be fulfilled .
The accomplishments of our great nation will only endure such matters by re-establishing the Constitution as the primal basis of our liberty .
I will end this subject matter with a statement of , “ I regret that I have neglected my responsibilities as Citizen Sovereign , and will from this day forward defend this nation .
It is my honor to fulfill this service to the betterment of life for my children . ”
“ REFORM , REFORM , REFORM ! ”
Is Barack Obama about to drive his Presidency into a bloody ditch strewn with corpses ?
The President is expected any day now to announce his decision about the future of the war in Afghanistan .
He knows US and British troops have now been stationed in the hell - mouth of Helmand longer than the First and Second World Wars combined – yet the mutterings from the marble halls of Washington DC suggest he may order a troop escalation .
Obama has to decide now whether to side with the American people and the Afghan people calling for a rapid reduction in US force , or with a small military clique demanding a ramping - up of the conflict .
The populations of both countries are in close agreement .
The latest Washington Post poll shows that 51 per cent of Americans say the war is " not worth fighting " and that ending the foreign occupation will " reduce terrorism " .
Only 27 per cent disagree .
At the other end of the gun-barrel , 77 per cent of Afghans in the latest BBC poll say the on - going US air strikes are " unacceptable " , and the US troops should only remain if they are going to provide reconstruction assistance rather than bombs .
But there is another side : General Stanley McCrystal says that if he is given another 40,000 troops – on top of the current increase which has pushed military levels above anything in the Bush years – he will " finally win " by " breaking the back " of the Taliban and al - Qa'ida .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
How should Obama – and us , the watching world – figure out who is right ?
We have to start from a hard - headed acknowledgement .
Every option from here entails a risk – to Afghan civilians , and to Americans and Europeans .
It is not possible to achieve absolute safety .
We can only try to figure out what would bring the least risk , and pursue it .
There is obviously a huge risk in sending an extra 40,000 machine - gun wielding troops into a country they do n't understand to " clear " huge areas of insurgent fighters who look exactly like the civilian population , and establish " control " of places that have never been controlled by a central government at any point in their history .
Every military counter - insurgency strategy hits up against the probability that it will , in time , create more enemies than it kills .
So you blow up a suspected Taliban site and kill two of their commanders – but you also kill 98 women and children , whose families are from that day determined to kill your men and drive them out of their country .
Those are n't hypothetical numbers .
They come from Lt. Col. David Kilcullen , who was General Petraeus ' counter - insurgency advisor in Iraq .
He says that US aerial attacks on the Afghan - Pakistan border have killed 14 al - Qa'ida leaders , at the expense of more than 700 civilian lives .
He says : " That 's a hit rate of 2 per cent on 98 per cent collateral .
It 's not moral . "
It explains the apparent paradox that broke the US in Vietnam : the more " bad guys " you kill , the more you have to kill .
There is an even bigger danger than this .
General Petraeus 's strategy is to drive the Taliban out of Afghanistan .
When he succeeds , they run to Pakistan – where the nuclear bombs are .
To justify these risks , the proponents of the escalation need highly persuasive arguments to show how their strategy slashed other risks so dramatically that it outweighed these dangers .
It 's not inconceivable – but I found that in fact the case they give for escalating the war , or for continuing the occupation , is based on three premises that turn to Afghan dust on inspection .
Argument One :
We need to deprive al - Qa'ida of military bases in Afghanistan , or they will use them to plot attacks against us , and we will face 9/11 redux .
In fact , virtually all the jihadi attacks against Western countries have been planned in those Western countries themselves , and required extremely limited technological capabilities or training .
The 9/11 atrocities were planned in Hamburg and Florida by 19 Saudis who only needed to know how to use box -cutters and to crash a plane .
The 7/7 suicide - murders were planned in Yorkshire by young British men who learned how to make bombs off the internet .
Only last week , a jihadi was arrested for plotting to blow up a skyscraper in that notorious jihadi base , Dallas , Texas .
And on , and on .
In reality , there are almost no al - Qa'ida fighters in Afghanistan .
That 's not my view : it 's that of General Jim Jones , the US National Security Advisor .
He said last week there were 100 al - Qa'ida fighters in Afghanistan .
That 's worth repeating : there are 100 al - Qa'ida fighters in Afghanistan .
Nor is that a sign that the war is working .
The Taliban or warlords friendly to them already control 40 per cent of Afghanistan now , today .
They can build all the " training camps " they want there – but they have only found a hundred fundamentalist thugs to staff them .
Even if – and this is highly unlikely – you could plug every hole in the Afghan state 's authority and therefore make it possible to shut down every camp , there are a dozen other failed states they can scuttle off to the next day and pitch some more tents .
Again , that 's not my view .
Leon Panetta , head of the CIA , says : " As we disrupt [ al - Qa'ida ] , they will seek other safe havens .
Somalia and Yemen are potential al - Qa'ida bases in the future . "
The US can't occupy every failed state in the world for decades – so why desperately try to plug one hole in a bath full of leaks , when the water will only seep out anyway ?
There are plenty of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan – but they are a different matter to al - Qa'ida .
The latest leaked US intelligence reports say , according to the Boston Globe , that 90 per cent of them are " a tribal , localised insurgency " who " see themselves as opposing the US because it is an occupying power " .
They have " no goals " beyond Afghanistan 's borders .
Argument Two :
By staying , we are significantly improving Afghan human rights , especially for women .
This , for me , is the meatiest argument – and the most depressing .
The Taliban are indeed one of the vilest forces in the world , imprisoning women in their homes and torturing them for the " crimes " of showing their faces , expressing their sexuality , or being raped .
They keep trying to murder my friend Malalai Joya for the " crime " of being elected to parliament on a platform of treating women like human beings not cattle .
But as she told me last month : " Your governments have replaced the fundamentalist rule of the Taliban with another fundamentalist regime of warlords . "
Outside Kabul , vicious Taliban who enforce sharia law have merely been replaced by vicious warlords who enforce sharia law .
" The situation now is as catastrophic as it was under the Taliban for women , " she said .
Any Afghan president – Karzai , or his opponents – will only ever in practice be the mayor of Kabul .
Beyond is a sea of warlordism , as evil to women as Mullah Omar .
That is not a difference worth fighting and dying for .
Argument Three :
If we withdraw , it will be a great victory for al - Qa'ida .
Re-energised , they will surge out across the world .
In fact , in November 2004 , Osama bin Laden bragged to his followers : " All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen [ jihadi fighters ] to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written " al - Qa'ida " in order to make generals race there , and we cause America to suffer human , economic and political losses – without their achieving anything of note ! "
These wars will , he said , boost al - Qa'ida recruitment across the world , and in time " bankrupt America " .
They walked right into his trap .
Yes , there is real risk in going – but it is dwarfed by the risk of staying .
A bloody escalation in the war is more likely to fuel jihadism than thwart it .
If Obama is serious about undermining this vile fanatical movement , it would be much wiser to take the hundreds of billions he is currently squandering on chasing after a hundred fighters in the Afghan mountains and redeploy it .
Spend it instead on beefing up policing and intelligence , and on building a network of schools across Pakistan and other flash - points in the Muslim world , so parents there have an alternative to the fanatical madrassahs that churn out bin Laden - fodder .
The American people will be far safer if the world sees them building schools for Muslim kids instead of dropping bombs on them .
He can explain – with his tongue dipped in amazing eloquence – that trying to defeat al - Qa'ida with hundreds of thousands of occupying troops and Predator jets is like trying to treat cancer with a blowtorch .
Now , that really would deserve a Nobel Peace Prize .

Despite signs of an economic recovery , the state of California remains in a deep fiscal mess and recession .
The state has been a particularly good proxy of the overall state of the economy due to their high leverage to the real estate market – the crux of our issues .
According to the State Controller the economy continued to deteriorate in September , but is showing some signs of stability .
The recent report said :
The State ’s General Fund continued to deteriorate in September .
Year to date , both corporate and personal income tax revenues were down by double - digit percentages over last year ( 13 % and 16 % , respectively ) .
Additionally , the numbers indicate that Californians are still feeling the pinch of this recession in a very real way .
For example , withholdings on personal income are down by 7.1 % this year .
Estimated tax payments for both personal income and corporations are down even more sharply , falling by 34.9 % and 11.0 % , respectively , compared to last year .
Californians have lost nearly 1 million jobs and the Franchise Tax Board now says that tax delinquencies are up 28 % over the last 2 years .
Nonetheless , the state is beginning to see some signs of stability :
Still , the fact that some indicators are stabilizing provides some reasons to be positive about the State ’s economy .
Compared to 2008 , sales and use taxes are up for the second
month in a row .
Although these are small gains , they signal that the consumer spending is reaching for a bottom .
In addition , residential building permits have leveled off in recent months , and home prices , though still below last year , stabilized in June and July .
This should decelerate the losses in the State ’s construction employment , which has been especially hard hit .
There also are indications that the nation ’s gross domestic product will grow modestly in the third quarter of 2009 .
An important question for California is how the expiration of the federal income tax cut and temporary payroll tax cuts will impact the State ’s economy in 2010 .
Of course , if the real estate market in Southern CA is any proxy then the state budget office could be counting their tax revenues sooner than we think .
The bubble is back !

Planes were restricted from entering the affected area
Air traffic control systems are back up and running after an earlier computer breakdown at Prestwick grounded transatlantic flights from UK airports .
Some travellers may still experience delays due to the problem at Prestwick 's air traffic control hub .
A spokeswoman for NATS , responsible for the UK's air traffic management , said engineers had resolved the problem .
Airports are now working to clear a backlog of flights which had been unable to leave due to the fault .
BBC transport correspondent Richard Scott said the computer had gone " zero rated " which meant it could not process any routings and everything had to be done manually .
' Some delays '
The problem concerned Shanwick Oceanic Control , which is the airspace area for the north east Atlantic 250 miles west of Ireland .
BAA , the company which owns seven major UK airports including Heathrow and Gatwick , said they were working to get delayed passengers on their way .
" There are some delays still but it is getting back to normal , " a spokeswoman said .
British Airways said not all of its flights were affected .
Its statement said : " Air Traffic Control issues are affecting all airlines operating flights out of the UK on transatlantic routes .
" We , like all airlines , are experiencing some minor delays but our flights are still operating . "
One passenger waiting on an American Airlines plane at Heathrow , Sam Mosley , said the airline had put them on the aircraft but said there could be a considerable delay .
" They said they would get us on the plane and see how it goes .
Everyone 's pretty stoic , we 're just passengers waiting to get away , " he said .

Aloe is n't medicine , and yet it cures
How it works
A cancer cure the whole world needs to hear
About the author
What the experts say about aloe vera and cancer :
( NaturalNews ) Living in South America , I often find myself steeped in abundant natural cures for many diseases , including cancer .
You can hardly walk out your front door without finding yourself surrounded with natural medicines made by Mother Nature , and it 's true across the continent , from Ecuador ( where I live ) through Peru and Bolivia , and all the way to Brazil .
In Brazil , a humble monk named Father Romano Zago has uncovered a powerful yet simple cure for cancer based on just three ingredients ... one of them being whole Aloe Arborescens ( not just the gel , but the whole leaf , including the skin and the sap ) .
What follows is his explanation of how this Brazilian Aloe cure works to help reverse not just cancer , but several other diseases , too , like obesity and depression .
He 's compiled this rare knowledge into a book entitled Aloe is n't medicine , and yet it cures !
For many years , this little - known book has been extremely difficult to find .
Some of the rare book collectors are selling used copied for more than double the original new price .
So Truth Publishing contacted the author and reached an agreement to reprint the book , making a new print run available to the world .
We 're happy to announce that new print run is complete , and this extremely valuable book is available right now ! ( http://www.truthpublishing.com/ProductDetail...
What 's really valuable about this book is that in addition to detailing the aloe vera recipe , it gives you two options for acquiring it :
You can either make the recipe yourself ( for just pennies per dose ) using aloe arborescens ( I personally use Aloe Vera instead ) and two commonly - available ingredients , or you can find the same formula ready - made from a company distributing it in the United States .
Here 's the description of the book from Father Romano Zago : " Aloe is n't medicine , and yet ... it Cures " is the latest book by Father Romano Zago , author of " The Scientific Monographic History of Aloe Vera and Aloe Arborescens " .
Over the last few years , his books have received widespread acclaim in the field of alternative medicine in Europe .
With his latest book , Father Romano Zago presents the curative properties of Aloe Arborescens and describes , in simple practice , how to use this plant in curing over 100 types of illnesses including obesity and depression .
The Aloe Arborescens immune formula used by Brazilian natives that is described in this book is unmatched in its potency to provide the human body a complete spectrum of phytonutrient and nutraceutical properties needed to support a healthy immune system while gently eliminating waste particles .
This returns the body to a normal state of structure and function .
A number of recent worldwide clinical studies listed in the bibliography of the book offer scientific evidence supporting the fact that Aloe Arborescens has a high concentration of complex sugars called glucomannan polysaccharides and as many as 200 biologically active phytonutritional compounds that work in synergy to promote the modulation of innate immunity and macrophage function .
In test after test , it has also been shown to kill a broad range of viruses , fungi and monilia ( a particularly active fungus that attacks the mucous membranes ) .
Consequently , it provides extraordinary support for the gastrointestinal tract , mucous membranes and connective tissue .
" Aloe Is n't Medicine , and yet ... it Cures ! " offers a scientifically supported , simple and low - cost alternative to pharmaceutical medications .
Get the book from Truth Publishing today at :
The human body heals itself from within and , because of its more than 200 phytotherapeutic substances , the juice from the whole leaf of Aloe Arborescens provides the perfect complement to the biological requirements of the body .
In Aloe , you will find a true arsenal of useful substances that are essential for good health , such as enzymes , vitamins , proteins , amino acids , minerals , monosaccharide oils , polysaccharides , anthraquinone compounds , etc .
The cleansing initiated by this recipe of Aloe will detoxify the body , renew the blood and strengthen the immune system so the body can restore itself to health .
Plant saccharide research indicates that properties in the Aloe Arborescens plant support the immune system , helping it to fight illnesses of all kinds , including general infections , cancer and HIV .
To learn more about the many benefits of this Brazilian recipe , as well as the clinical studies and properties of this aloe species , see the website www.aloearborescens.org Father Romano Zago 's book describes how a healthy immune system keeps chronic illness in check .
If a person develops a chronic illness , something was not working in the detoxification process and the immune system .
If a person is undergoing treatment for any chronic disease , it very important to detoxify the body and support the immune system .
Many conventional cancer treatments leave the immune system in tatters .
This aloe recipe nourishes the body , replenishing what has been lost , and cleanses away toxins that have accumulated .
It will leave the body rejuvenated , with an immune system that is stronger and more able to preserve and protect health .
A strong immune system is our most powerful weapon against disease and this Aloe Arborescens recipe is the secret recipe for broad based supreme immune health .
When we get the nutrition from the right kinds of foods , we give our bodies the tools they need to heal themselves .
Father Zago , in his books on the benefits of Aloe Arborescens , shares with readers the results of his research into this amazing plant .
Based on his observation of numerous people with chronic illness who have used it , he maintains that this Brazilian recipe of unprocessed whole leaf Aloe Arborescens juice , pure bees ' honey and 1 % distillate can restore health through nutrition .
It is the discovery of the century -- a miracle health breakthrough for the benefit of humanity .
In 1757 , British naval surgeon Dr. James Lind conducted clinical observations that eventually ended the chain of over two million deaths of British sailors due to scurvy .
He did it by introducing lemon or lime juice , or the fruit where possible , into the diet of English seamen .
This solution to eliminate scurvy was a different approach from accepted medical practice at the time , but it led to significant savings in the cost of maintaining the navy and saving the lives of sailors .
Today , more than 200 years later , the medical community still ignores the benefits of good nutrition in the prevention of disease .
Father Zago believes members of the medical profession should step outside orthodox pharmaceutical medicine and extend their approval to remedies that include homeopathic medicine , plant therapy and other health cures known since ancient times that are far less lucrative to the pharmaceutical industry but are far more effective at promoting human health .
The ultimate objective is to save lives .
Thus , rather than exclude these alternative methods , physicians should incorporate them into their medical practice .
" Aloe Is n't Medicine , and yet ... it Cures ! " is available now from Truth Publishing : Father Romano Zago , OFM , was born in Lajeado ( RS ) Brazil on August 11 , 1932 .
He was ordained a Franciscan friar in 1958 after having studied philosophy and theology .
In 1971 , he received a degree in literature and foreign languages ( Latin , Portuguese , French and Spanish ) from PUCRS faculty of literature , Universita Pontifica Cattolica .
In 1988 , while presiding at the San Antonio parish in Pouso Novo ( RS ) Brazil , he learned from local natives about a potent , all - natural Aloe Arborescens recipe they use for curing cancer , and he began to test it with the chronically ill .
It was here he first observed the positive results obtained with nutrition against advanced disease states .
Later , he was sent to Jerusalem and Italy , where he continued to see great success in the chronically ill , witnessing them being cured with this recipe made with the whole leaf of the native Aloe arborescens plant .
This inspired him to devote his life to researching and understanding the healing properties of Aloe .
At the request of many people and organizations , Father Zago has given lectures and conferences in Portugal , Spain , Switzerland , France , Italy and Brazil about the ability of the human body to heal and regulate itself when supplied with the cell - required concentrated micronutrients found in the polysaccharides ( complex sugar molecules ) of this Aloe plant species and the recipe .
Contact information for Father Zago is included in the book .
Some clinics have used aloe vera to increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment with the chemotherapy agents cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan , Neosar ) and 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) .
Several studies indicate that aloe vera gel can protect both the immune system and the skin from the effects of radiation treatment .
In addition , at least one study suggests that taking aloe internally can reduce the likelihood of lung cancer in smokers . -

This noise is about race .
It is about " othering " a President who is seen as a symbol of white dispossession : dispossession of white hegemony , white entitlement , white expectation , and white power , unquestioned and unchallenged from the darker skinned other .
On Health Care ,
It 's " E Pluribus " Without the " Unum . "
The fact that 50 million American citizens have no access to health care and when they get sick or injured they are either driven into bankruptcy or suffer from being denied care does not seem to register with these people .
Sarah Palin's Death Panels .
The " town meetings " that are now spewing such anger reflect deepseated fears that are welling up across America during this economic crisis .
Healthcare reform may ease some of these fears .
But the demagogues that are manipulating those fears for political gain do n't give a hoot .
Adam Schiff 's Town Hall Fracas .
Last night tempers flared during a boisterous town hall meeting on health - care reform attended by 3,000 people .
The event was organized by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff ( D- Burbank ) .
The President needs to be very specific about two things in particular : ( 1 ) Who will pay ?
and ( 2 ) Why the public option is so important - and why it 's not a Trojan Horse to a government takeover .
Obama Did Not " Punk " the Common Guy .
Obama is using every political chit to secure health coverage for 47 million " common " Americans , strongly endorsing the public option that other Democrats and the Republican Party are seeking to kill .
Health - Care Reform Key Issue in 2008 Campaign : What Happened ?
The current state of the health care " debate " illustrates , even with the election of Barack Obama and large Democratic majorities in Congress , we might have already lost the vocabulary for collective moral discourse .
Progressives Should n't Mimic Teabaggers
In Promoting Health Reform .
Activists often make the mistake of fighting battles on their opponent 's turf .
Small town hall meetings are so easy to disrupt that they offer a perfect forum for the passionate Rush Limbaugh crowd that lacks a broad base .
How the White House 's Deal With Big Pharma Undermines Democracy .
The White House confirmed it has promised Big Pharma that any healthcare legislation will bar the government from using its huge purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices .
That 's basically the same deal George W. Bush struck in getting the Medicare drug benefit .
The latest failure to communicate on the part of Democrats is in using the term " health care reform . "
What does that term mean to the public ?
Why it means that the government will diddle with our great medical care !
In her new memoir , the actress talks about going under the knife – and finally learning to love her body
Sure , she may have the confidence to strut around in a bikini now , but for years Kathy Griffin struggled with low self - esteem .
“ What I ca n’t figure out is why I wasted time worrying about my looks .
I am a comedian .
I ’m not on the runway in Milan , ” says Griffin , whose memoir , Official Book Club Selection : A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin , hits stores in September .
“ Believe it or not , people do n’t come to see me really thinking I ’m going to look like Jennifer Aniston . ”
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Still , for years Griffin did what she could to change her appearance .
Trying to land an agent in Hollywood , the actress decided to get a nose job at age 26 .
“ I was told repeatedly , ‘ You would be pretty if it were n’t for that nose .
You ’d work more if it were n’t for that nose .
Hey have you considered getting a nose job ?
You would think I had a nose the size of Texas .
I was young and impressionable and I was told that enough that I started to believe it , so I got a nose job . ”
Griffin also became obsessed with her weight .
She would take back - to - back step aerobics classes , starve herself all day and then binge at night .
She tried diet pills , and even took things a step further .
“ I am very proud of my two weeks on speed , ” she jokes .
“ It was full - on illegal speed .
I took it to lose weight , which is not very smart . ”
The result : “ I just felt three times as hungry afterward , ” she says .
Even once she got her big break on the Brooke Shields sitcom Suddenly Susan , Griffin felt pressure to slim down .
“ I lost 15 lbs. friggin ’ fast in season 1 , ” she says .
“ But being on television I was never thin enough .
[ Being on TV ] told me that clothes did n’t come in anything larger than a four .
That got to me . ”
Griffin turned to liposuction , but complications from the procedure nearly killed her .
Opening up about the experience , and showing never before seen post - surgical pictures in her book , “ is embarrassing , ” Griffin says .
Still , she says , “ I want women to know that this is what lipo looks like .
Like , are you sure you do n’t want to just work out a little more ? ”
Now at her “ thinnest ” weight , at 5 feet 3 inches tall and 115 lbs. , Griffin admits , “ staying in shape is a struggle .
I struggle with it every day .
I just came from a very healthy lunch but the whole time I was having the healthy lunch I wished I was having cupcakes , ” she says .
“ It ’s not a simple thing .
I have to watch what I eat and I have to work out quite a bit . ”
As for getting into bikini - ready shape , “ The funny thing is the lipo , which was more than 10 years ago , has nothing to do with it , ” says Griffin .
“ I actually got into fairly good shape from yawn : diet and exercise . ”
A " saber - toothed cat in armor " and a pancake - shaped predator are among the strange crocodile cousins whose bones have been found beneath the windswept dunes of the Sahara , archaeologists say .
The diverse menagerie of reptiles ruled Gondwana — a landmass that later broke up into the southern continents — about a hundred million years ago , during the Cretaceous period .
" There 's an entire croc world brewing in Africa that we really had only an inkling about before , " said Paul Sereno , a paleontologist at the University of Chicago and leader of a new study .
" We knew about SuperCroc , the titan of all crocs , but we did n't have quite an idea of what existed in the shadows of the Cretaceous , " he said .
Ancient crocodile cousins — called crocodilyforms — were not widespread in the Northern Hemisphere .
But the south blossomed with bizarre riffs on the croc theme , added Sereno , also a National Geographic explorer - in - residence .
( The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News . )
The team found three new species , nicknamed PancakeCroc , BoarCroc , and RatCroc , as well as new skeletons of the previously named DuckCroc and DogCroc .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama called on the U.S. Congress on Saturday to be willing to compromise on a plan to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system now that a key Senate committee has wrapped up work on its proposal .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Obama concentrated on the healthcare debate in his weekly radio and Web address at the end of a week dominated by foreign policy challenges in Iran and Afghanistan and a quick trip he made to Copenhagen in a losing effort to get the 2016 Summer Olympics for his adopted hometown , Chicago .
The Senate Finance Committee finished debate on a massive overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system on Friday and prepared to vote on the legislation next week .
The bill calls for sweeping insurance market reforms and seeks to rein in soaring medical costs and expand coverage to millions of uninsured people .
With Democrats divided and Republicans battling what they consider a government - takeover of healthcare , Obama tried to lay down some markers for the coming debate as he seeks to gain passage of a plan this year .
“ I welcome any sincere attempts to improve legislation before it reaches my desk .
But what I will not accept are attempts to stall , or drag our feet .
I will not accept partisan efforts to block reform at any cost , ” he said .
The Finance bill will be melded by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid with one passed earlier this year by the Senate health panel , and the combined product is expected to hit the Senate floor by mid-October .
Whatever bill emerges from the Senate would have to be merged with legislation that comes out of the House of Representatives .
Obama ’s Democratic
Party remains divided on key issues , including a government - run insurance option , and party leaders in Congress will face a gauntlet of competing demands from liberal and conservative Democrats .
And Republican critics of the overhaul are set on new attacks on provisions on taxes , mandates and Medicare , the healthcare plan for seniors , that could resonate with a wary public as the battle snakes its way through Congress .
Obama said he realized that lawmakers from both parties would want to engage in a vigorous debate and contribute their own ideas .
“ I expect us to move forward with a spirit of civility , a seriousness of purpose , and a willingness to compromise that characterizes our democratic process at its very best .
If we do that , I am confident that we will pass reform this year , ” he said .
( CNN ) --
The man who shot three women dead in a Pennsylvania gym before killing himself this week posted at least two videos on YouTube last year , apparently referring to a desire for a girlfriend in both .
George Sodini addresses the camera in his basement in one of his YouTube videos .
George Sodini , 48 , gave a tour of his house in one clip , his camera briefly panning across a book called " Date Young Women " in his living room .
" The couch and chairs , they match .
The woman will really be impressed , " he says just before showing the book .
In the bedroom , he says , " It looks pretty clean .
I 'm sure she 'll be impressed . "
It is not clear whether he is speaking about a particular person .
He speaks directly to the camera in the second video , posted four months later .
" It is easy for me to hide from my emotions for one more day , " he says , speaking to a mirror in his basement .
" Take a long drive in a car , listen to some music , daydream or just do some mundane task around the house that really does n't need to be done that 's not too important .
And there you go , one more day , and one more day turns into one more year . "
Watch some of the shooter 's videos »
Sodini walked into a gym aerobics class and began shooting about 8 p.m.
Tuesday , killing three women and wounding nine others before turning the gun on himself .
He " just had a lot of hatred in him , " Allegheny County police superintendent Charles Moffatt said Wednesday .
He brought four handguns into the LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh and used three of them , firing at least 36 times , Moffatt said .
Those killed were identified by the county 's medical examiner as Heidi Overmier , 46 , of Carnegie , Pennsylvania ; Elizabeth Gannon , 49 , of Pittsburgh ; and Jody Billingsley , 38 , of Mount Lebanon .
Authorities think Sodini targeted the aerobics class specifically , as a schedule was found in his home with that class circled , Moffatt said .
But police do not believe that he targeted anyone personally .
Rather , because of an online diary he left , as well as notes at the scene and at his home , they think he was targeting women in general .
In the note left at the scene in Sodini 's gym bag , Moffatt said , he complains that he had never spent a weekend with a woman , never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman , and that he had had limited sexual experiences .
He makes similar complaints in his blog , which also documents his growing rage at women for their rejection of him and at the world he felt had abandoned him .
Sodini , a member of the gym , was found dead in the aerobics room of the gym , lying on top of one of his guns about 7 feet from one of the victims .
He had worked as a systems analyst in the finance department of K&L Gates , a law firm with an office in Pittsburgh , since 1999 , said Mike Rick , a spokesman for the firm .
Neighbors described him as reclusive and said he had stopped talking to them in the past few years .
Sodini apparently had " practice runs " before the shooting Tuesday , Moffatt said .
Someone at the gym had showed him how to shut off the lights , he said , not knowing of his plans .
" He was hell bent on committing this act , " Moffatt said .
Three of the four guns found with Sodini were traced back to him , and authorities are in the process of tracing the fourth , Moffatt said .
They were two 9 mm semiautomatics , a .45 - caliber revolver and a .38 in his pocket .
Sodini also had 30 - round ammunition clips that were illegal before the assault weapons ban was lifted in 2004 , police said .
On Tuesday , Sodini visited the gym three times : the first about 11 a.m. , a second time at 7:40 p.m. and a third time at 7:56 p.m. , Moffatt said .
Members of the gym are required to swipe a card to check in but do not have to check out , he said .
The first 911 call was dispatched at 8:16 p.m .
However , police know that Sodini made a telephone call at 7:45 p.m. and think he may have left the gym to make it .
Authorities are attempting to find the person he contacted , Moffatt said .
Witnesses said he was dressed in black when he entered the class , shut off the lights , walked about 10 feet and began shooting .
Mary Primis , 26 , an aerobics instructor who is pregnant , was shot twice .
" I remember thinking I wanted to hold my breath because I was afraid , if he saw that I was breathing , he would shoot again , " she told CNN affiliate WPXI from her hospital bed .
Asked whether she thought she was going to die , she said , " I was n't sure . "
Her husband , Alex Primis , told WPXI that she was shot once in the left shoulder and again through the back of her shoulder blade .
Sodini did not mention killing himself in the note found at the scene , which was mostly typed with handwritten notations , but did mention it in a handwritten note found at his home , Moffatt said .
Police seized Sodini's car for processing ; no guns were found in it , he said .
They also seized his computer and were examining it .
Moffatt said he believed that none of the shooting victims who remained hospitalized Wednesday had life - threatening wounds .
County officials said counselors were being made available to area residents in the wake of the shooting .
Police spoke to a pastor mentioned on Sodini 's online diary .
The man said that Sodini had attended his church but stopped in 2006 and that there was a minor incident involving a woman who felt " he was paying too much attention to her , " Moffatt said .
The pastor spoke to Sodini , and it stopped , he said .
Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini but are still puzzled at the violence .
" I can't ever make sense of murders , " he said .

“ The economic calculation problem is a criticism of socialist economics , or more precisely central economic planning .
It was first proposed by Ludwig von Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Friedrich Hayek .
The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy .
The free market solution is the price mechanism , wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it .
The price conveys embedded information about the abundance of resources as well as their desirability which in turn allows , on the basis of individual consensual decisions , corrections that prevent shortages and surpluses ; Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution , and without the information provided by market prices socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources .
Those who agree with this criticism argue it is a refutation of socialism and that it shows that a socialist planned economy could never work .
The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s , and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by economic historians as the The Socialist Calculation Debate . ”

UK : The BNP — A Party for the Fashion Discerning Fascist
Angry at the world ?
Suspicious of foreigners ?
Looking for a scapegoat ?
In need of a racist ideological movement to follow but do n’t think a skinhead haircut will match your wardrobe ?
If so , then why not take a look at the new Autumn range of clothing and fashion accessories from the British National Party .
Bomber Jackets , Doc Martens and a Hitler tattoo on your arse cheeks are soooo last season .
That ’s why when you join the BNP you are free to don snazzy suits , corporate ties and smart yet comfortable leather shoes .
Get out that Giorgio Armani shirt and feel just divine whilst secure in the knowledge that your natural penchant for style is aiding the cause of racial purity .
In the European elections last year , we at the BNP won our first two seats in the European Parliament ( not bad for an organisation who ’s constitution has recently been ruled as illegal due to its restrictions on non-white membership would n’t you say ? ) .
We failed miserably to win seats in the previous set of Euro elections , but through low turnout and voter apathy we have this time triumphed , acquiring the seats without increasing our share of the vote .
But do n’t think that we are just an obscure , irrelevant minority party with a support base consisting of toothless hicks and 11 fingered inbreds .
Far from it – as the recession has set in our popularity has soared .
Our fat , toad - faced chairman Nick Griffin is a TV hit , pulling in an audience of almost 8 million viewers last week on the BBC ’s flagship political debate program , Question Time .
The following day a poll revealed that 22 % of the population are now ‘ seriously considering ’ voting for us at the next general election .
So it ’s confirmed , this years ‘ in - thing ’ is thinly veiled fascism and bigotry – forget ‘ Springtime for Hitler and Germany ’ , this is Autumntime for Griffin and England .
But if you ’re an old fashioned sort of racist , with a longing for the good old days when ‘ bashing a paki ’ and knifing a Jew or two was considered a good evening out , then do n’t feel as if you have no place in our party .
The BNP has its origins in violent militias such as the National Front and Combat 18 , and our current policy of dressing like highstreet insurance - salesmen is really just a dubious ploy to convince people that we are no longer thuggish criminals .
If you do n’t believe me then why not do a quick search on YouTube for the video of our chairman making a speech with white - supremacist David Duke to a KKK meeting , in which Mr Griffin spells out a strategy for gaining power by cynically moderating the message in order to dupe the masses ?
Truly , we are all things to all men ( apart from Jews , Homosexuals , the ‘ Liberal Elite ’ , those funny looking ‘ coloureds ’ , and Extremist - Terrorist - Islamofascist - Marxist - InsertRandomDerogatory PrefixHere-Muslims of course )
Be quick with filling in that BNP application though , because sooner or later the economy might fix itself and people might stop looking for scapegoats .
Worse still , some bright spark might figure out that our main base of support is non-racist working class folk who just feel frustrated after being consistently disenfranchised by the state - monopolised political process .
If that happened then efforts might be made to re-empower people with control over their own lives , workplaces and communities – and god forbid we could ever allow that , because support for our piddling little party would collapse overnight .
No , it is much better that we preserve the current state - capitalist system that subsidises industry and thus causes the market to produce too much .
It is much better that we soak up this excess product via the use of central banks to print money that does n’t really exist .
It is much better that the resulting boom - bust cycle is used as a way of creating a pool of constantly unemployed labour .
It is much better that we deprive opportunities for working class self - dependence by leaving in place laws that enclose the commons of land , capital and intellectual property .
It is much better that the inevitable migration of workers is used to divide society into opposing groups of foreign and ‘ indigenous ’ labour .
It is much better that anti trade - union laws are left in place so that wages can be forced constantly downwards and then blamed on the influx of migrants .
Yes , it is much better that the current setup of so - called ‘ democracy ’ and ‘ free - trade ’ is left in place so that filthy , fascist , authoritarian scumbags such as us can take advantage of peoples insecurities to make a grab at the controls of the whole shitty system .
Vote for us and ruin your country whilst causing misery for everyone that does n’t fit the mold of an ‘ Indigenous Brit ’ .
Yes , go ahead and destroy any chance that the lives of ordinary people can ever be bettered .
In short , there is no problem caused by state authority that ca n’t be solved by even more state authority — especially when it ’s exercised capriciously and based on contemptible premises .
Yours Insincerely

Head Propagandist for the British National Party
Is This A Double Dip Recession ?
Now that most countries have stated they are coming out of the recession , we ’ll now have to see if the economy will truly improve from here or if it ’s only a technical end due to one positive quarter .
There is quite a bit of research that suggests recessions happen in a “ W ” or “ double dip ” pattern .
By that I mean , the bubble bursts and there is an initial correction in the market .
The market then begins to improve as government , media and investors feel we have returned to normal .
Unfortunately , this is accomplished through government policy that increases debt , often only to move future sales and growth up to the present .
Another issue is the ease in which companies can temporarily improve their bottom line growth through reductions in salaries and other expenses .
However , they cannot continue this trend without an actual increase in their sales growth .
So as government debt and corporate financial statements provide a sense of recovery , eventually the government will have to decide to increase taxes or let bond yields increase which therefore increases the cost of borrowing .
Around the same time , companies will run out of options to increase earnings as their sales remain flat .
All this then begins to unravel , leading to the second major drop in the market .
This drop is historically a much deeper correction since most resources have been exhausted and investors become fearful as everyone tries to unload their portfolios at lower and lower prices .
Since the stock market can be unpredictable , it ’s possible that this wo n’t be the case this time around .
Most would agree that we could be flat for some time , if not at least a slight correction .
Since we can’t predict the future , it ’s always helpful to improve your personal finances as a form of recession proofing .
Then , no matter which way the economy and stock markets head , you ’ll be prepared .
Employees will need to take more care with their avatars in the future , according to a new report .
Analyst firm Gartner has predicted that by the end of 2013 , 70 per cent of enterprises will have issued guidelines to their staff about behaviour and dress code when it comes to using an avatar associated with the company .
" As the use of virtual environments for business purposes grows , enterprises need to understand how employees are using avatars in ways that might affect the enterprise or the enterprise 's reputation , " said James Lundy , managing vice president at Gartner , in a statement .
" We advise establishing codes of behavior that apply in any circumstance when an employee is acting as a company representative , whether in a real or virtual environment . "
Gartner encouraged businesses to trial using avatars , but advised them to help users learn to control their digital selves by educating users on reputation management and extending codes of conduct to virtual environments .
However , the analyst firm added that businesses must recognise that users will have a " personal affinity " with their avatars , and take pride in personalising its appearance .

Rep. Marcy Kaptur cites an example of how bailing out the banks has done little to help struggling home owners in Ohio .
Bill Moyers also asks Kaptur about her speech on the House floor where she urged foreclosed homeowners to be squatters in their own homes .
This was a really fantastic segment from Bill Moyers Journal and I encourge everyone to watch the entire interview with Kaptur and Simon Johnson at Moyers ' site .
MARCY KAPTUR : Let me give you a reality from ground zero in Toledo , Ohio .
Our foreclosures have gone up 94 percent .
A few months ago , I met with our realtors .
And I said , ' What should I know ? '
They said , ' Well , first of all , you should know the worst companies that are doing this to us . '
I said , ' Well , give me the top one . '
They said , ' J.P. Morgan Chase . '
I went back to Washington that night .
And one of my colleagues said , ' You want to come to dinner ? '
I said , ' Well , what is it ? '
He said , ' Well , it 's a meeting with Jamie Dimon , the head of J.P. Morgan Chase . '
I said , ' Wow , yes .
I really do . '
So , I go to this meeting in a fancy hotel , fancy dinner , and everyone is complimenting him .
I mean , it was just like a love fest .
They finally got to me , and my point to ask a question .
I said , ' Well , I do n't want to speak out of turn here , Mr. Dimon . '
I said , ' But your company is the largest forecloser in my district .
And our Realtors just said to me this morning that your people do n't return phone calls . '
I said , ' We can't do work outs . '
And he looked at me , he said , ' Do you know that I talk to your Governor all the time ? '
He said , ' Our company employs 10,000 people in Ohio . '
And I 'm thinking , ' What is that ?
A threat ? '
And he said , ' I speak to the Mayor of Columbus . '
I said , ' Why do n't you come further north ? '
I said , ' Toledo , Cleveland , where the foreclosures are just skyrocketing . '
He said , ' Well , we 'll have someone call you . '
And he gave me a card .
And they never did .
For two weeks , we tried to reach them .
And finally , I was on a national news show .
And I told this story .
They called within ten minutes .
And they said , ' Oh , we 'll work with you .
We 'll try to do some workouts in your area . '
We planned the first one after working with them for weeks and weeks and weeks .
Their people never showed up .
And it was a Friday .
Our people had taken off work .
They 'd driven from all these locations to come .
We kept calling J.P. Morgan Chase saying , ' Where 's your person ?
Where 's your person ? '
And they finally sent somebody down from Detroit by 3:00 in the afternoon .
But out people had been waiting all morning and a lot of people that 's how they treat our people .
BILL MOYERS : You did a remarkable thing on the floor of the House recently .
And I want to show my audience a clip of a speech in which you urge people to break the law .

MARCY KAPTUR : So why should any American citizen be kicked out of their homes in this cold weather ?
In Ohio it is going to be 10 or 20 below zero .
Do n't leave your home .
Because you know what ?
When those companies say they have your mortgage , unless you have a lawyer that can put his or her finger on that mortgage , you do n't have that mortgage , and you are going to find they can't find the paper up there on Wall Street .
So I say to the American people , you be squatters in your own homes .
Do n't you leave .
In Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and Illinois and all these other places our people are being treated like chattel , and this Congress is stymied .
( END VIDEO )
BILL MOYERS : Wow .
You are urging them to resist the law when the Sheriff shows up to throw them out of their home .
MARCY KAPTUR : I 'm saying that they deserve justice , too .
And that the scales of justice in front of the Supreme Court are supposed to be balanced , and they 're not .
And that possession is 90 percent of the law .
And that you have legal rights , as a home owner .
You have a right to legal representation .
You have a right before the judge to have the mortgage note produced by whomever in the system has it .
Judge Boyko of Cleveland threw out six cases , because when the foreclosures came up , the financial institutions could n't produce the note .
Our people deserve their day in court .
WASHINGTON  Caught between a pivotal industry ally and the protests of Congressional Democrats , the Obama administration on Friday backed away from what drug industry lobbyists had said this week was a firm White House promise to exclude from a proposed health care overhaul the possibility of allowing the government to negotiate lower drug prices under Medicare .
The reversal underscored the delicate balancing act the White House has pursued in its strategy of negotiating behind - the - scenes deals to win industry support without alienating liberal supporters on Capitol Hill .
Pressed by drug industry lobbyists , a White House deputy chief of staff , Jim Messina , confirmed in an e-mail message on Wednesday that the White House shared the drug lobbyists ’ interpretation of the deal : that any health care overhaul would not include allowing direct government negotiation of drug prices or require certain additional price rebates .
Since Wednesday , other representatives of the White House had also stood by Mr. Messina ’s statement as well .
After reading reports about Mr. Messina ’s e-mail message , House and Senate Democrats loudly protested that they would not be bound by any such agreement to remove clauses allowing government negotiation of drug prices under Medicare  something Democrats have sought for years .

George Smitherman has stepped down from Premier Dalton McGuinty 's cabinet to run for mayor of Toronto next fall .
Smitherman , who has mused about a municipal bid for months , made it official during a meeting at McGuinty 's midtown home Sunday , tendering his resignation as deputy premier and minister of energy and infrastructure .
" I 'm not someone who 's going to operate well with one foot in two camps , " the Etobicoke native said in an interview with the Toronto Star .
" I 've taken myself out of the realm of speculation and moved into the realm of certainty .
I want to take that track record of getting things done to my city , " said Smitherman , who will remain as Liberal MPP for Toronto Centre until he officially launches his mayoral bid before March .
Sources said veteran Gerry Phillips , a minister without portfolio who ran the energy ministry in the past , will be sworn in Monday as energy and infrastructure minister and serve till the end of the legislative session next month .
There will be no deputy premier until after a larger cabinet shuffle in the new year .
Painting himself as " a candidate of the broad centre , " Smitherman pledged to " build a campaign with people from all parties . "
" It 's time for post - ideological solutions , " said the 45 - year - old political trailblazer , who was Ontario 's first openly gay MPP when he was elected in 1999 and was a key aide to former Toronto mayor Barbara Hall .
He and his businessman husband , Christopher Peloso , are in the process of adopting a child .
Credited with implementing massive reforms to the province 's health - care system as health minister from 2003 till 2008 – though opponents have blamed him in part for the eHealth Ontario spending scandal that cost his successor David Caplan his cabinet job last month – Smitherman said he would take his no -nonsense style to city hall .
With Mayor David Miller not seeking a third term next year , Smitherman and former Progressive Conservative leader John Tory , who is mulling a mayoral run , would be the frontrunners to be the most powerful civic politician in Canada .
Smitherman , who vowed to field a well - funded campaign , took some not - too - subtle shots at city councillors now considering a run for mayor .
" I love my city , I see such good things happening , but there 's a sense of unrealized potential .
How do you redress a psyche ?
Leadership , " he said .
While reluctant to criticize Miller 's performance during last summer 's 39 - day strike by city workers , Smitherman , who led much - publicized street clean - ups when garbage was starting to pile up , castigated those councillors who took pay raises prior to the job action .
" That really stuck in my craw as a failure of leadership .
Councillors failed to convey a collective view of fiscal responsibility , " he said .
Nor was he impressed by a suggestion last week from Councillor Shelley Carroll ( Ward 33 - Don Valley East ) , the city budget chief and a possible mayoral candidate , that Toronto should impose a municipal sales tax .
" A lot of people were shaking their heads and ... there 's folks that were saying , ` They do n't get it . '
There is only one taxpayer . "
While Smitherman had been wavering on whether to make the jump to city politics after Auditor General Jim McCarter 's scathing report into eHealth , he said comments from friends reignited the fire in his belly .
" Someone said to me , ` Well why would you want to be mayor , it 's a powerless job . '
It 's not a powerless job – it's a bully - pulpit , " he enthused , emphasizing he can govern in a " constrained fiscal environment " by being " innovative " and " transformative . "

Having spearheaded sweeping reforms of Ontario's health system and overseeing a budget of more than $ 40 billion , which dwarfs the city 's $ 8.7 billion in spending this year , Smitherman is no stranger to wrestling with the vast bureaucracy inside a huge , intransigent organization .
" There 's a dose of fiscal reality that needs to be brought to bear , " said the man who also championed McGuinty 's City of Toronto Act , which gave the cash - strapped municipality increased taxation power .
While his mercurial temperament has led some to dub him " Furious George , " even his political foes grudgingly admit he is a big - hearted and fearless competitor .
Nine days ago outside the Liberals ' annual general meeting in Windsor , a Star reporter and a Tory operative watched in astonishment as Smitherman sprinted to help stop a street brawl between some drunken teenagers before the police had even arrived .
His departure from cabinet robs McGuinty of his most powerful minister at a time when the province is facing a $ 24.7 billion budget deficit , the possibility of unpaid " Dalton Days " for public servants looms , and a new 13 per cent harmonized sales tax that comes into effect July 1 , 2010 .
While the premier 's office had no comment Sunday , Smitherman said he had a cordial meeting with McGuinty .
" He was somewhat surprised about it , of course .
But he was just so generous in his comments and his good wishes for me – more than I could have hoped for .
We have a rock - solid relationship and we 've been good partners , " the MPP said , adding he thanked the premier " for the patience you 've had with me . "
His move caught cabinet colleagues off guard – the Star spoke with several ministers late Sunday who expressed surprise that he was leaving so soon .
But Smitherman , who hosted a celebratory party Friday at Labatt House to mark Toronto being named host of the 2015 Pan Am Games , said he and his husband decided the time was right .
" There 's a lot we can do yet in Toronto . "

The Unity engine is becoming even more affordable to independent and hobbyist developers , as Unity Technologies has retired the $ 200 " Unity Indie " offering and replaced it with a free license , simply called Unity .
Developer Unity Technologies is keeping the full - fledged Unity Pro license priced at $ 1500 .
Alongside the new pricing shift , Unity is moving from version 2.5 to version 2.6 , adding new graphics and pipeline capabilities .
And Unity CEO David Helgason tells Gamasutra the company has Xbox 360 support in the works as well .
Features new to Unity 2.6 include full integration with Visual Studio and support for external revision control solutions like Subversion and Perforce .
Both these inclusions Unity says are aimed at allowing the engine to better slot into existing large - scale developers ' production pipelines .
Also new to 2.6 are graphics and performance capabilities like post - processing - compatible anti-aliasing , screen space ambient occlusion , and background fully - threaded asset streaming .
Gamasutra spoke with Helgason prior to his keynote address at the currently - underway Unite Conference in San Francisco , and he discussed the company 's thinking behind its new free license , how the engine 's Mac roots helped development even as it hindered growth , and why Unity can help restore faith in humanity .
David Helgason :
The thinking was that Unity Indie is n't generating a significant portion of our revenue , and we 've always had this vision of democratizing our tools .
We have over 13,000 customers using our product , so we figured , let 's take Indie and just give it to everyone .
Whether that becomes a cash flow positive or a cash flow negative -- and some people will upgrade -- is not really important .
What 's important is to get this in the hands of as many people as possible .
DH : That 's definitely part of it .
It 's also that Unity is just really infectious .
You get your hands on it and you do n't want to let it go .
That 's across the indie communities and educational communities , but also the pro studios .
Often , our MMO customers and big guys like thedevelopers went with Unity because somebody on the team had Unity and had played around with it .
That will get us more big - ticket items .
For the pros , the difference between a $ 2000 fee and a $ 0 fee is almost nothing , except that individual developers can just try it out for free and fall in love with it .
We think it 's really exciting .
The [ Unite ] conference is already underway , and we already had a couple hundred people do classroom sessions .
DH : That 's a good question .
Really , everyone is always competing with everyone .
Even when you 're doing something for the web , you have to decide between 2D and 3D -- if you 're doing 2D , you go Flash , and if you 're 3D , you go Unity .
We 're not competing with Flash directly , but there 's competition on the edges .
There 's a team called Nurien , who built this dance game using Unreal Engine 3 in Asia , and they 're coming to the West with the product as well -- but they found the download size was getting too big [ for most broadband connections in the West ] , so they 're using Unity to remake it for the West .
But are we competing with Unreal ?
Not really .
The platforms compete , and we 're waiting for you when you want to go to the platforms that people realize matter most .
DH : We do Nintendo Wii , and there are a handful of titles both disc - based and download - based .
We 're also announcing that we 're going to Xbox 360 as well .
We 're excited about consoles , but we 're more excited about mobile and the browser .
The really big opportunities are mobile and the web .
DH : The way we see it is that Unity is a really broad platform .
It enables all kinds of stuff , including medical visualization , furniture fitting for apartments .
We love all those non -gamey things , but we do n't need to focus on them so much as just enable them .
The tool and the workflow and the polish just fills itself .
DH : Definitely .
We 've been thinking about that for a long time .
We 're mostly covered in the game developer media , but when we met her , she really saw some applications outside the game space .
She 's a real visionary , obviously .
DH : Well , we know that currently a third of our audience is using Unity outside of the game space .
That 's things like product visualization , art projects , stitching interesting projects together -- if you search , you can find a crazy 3D Etch - a - Sketch art project done with Unity .
Give powerful tools to people and they 'll come up with crazy things , and use the tool to solve their problems .
There 's something called the Visible Body , which allows you to browse the entire body in 3D , and it 's used as a training tool for doctors .
Most of these applications never come outside of their companies , because they 're for trainings , but there are applications for people in retail stores , for the military and for rescue [ professionals ] , for pilots -- someone created a program to train pilots securely .
We see some of those publicly , but it 's usually private stuff .
Then the last thing is semi- gamey virtual worlds and social spaces , people building meeting spaces .
DH : Some of our customers are doing this already .
There 's , a multiplayer game that lives inside Facebook but also elsewhere on the web , and as a widget for Mac OS .
Everyone plays on the same server as a team shooter , - style , and you can buy weapons with microtransactions .
There are some other early things going into Facebook , but that 's the biggest success of our application in Facebook so far .
DH : Unity 's so flexible that it wo n't get in your way , but one of the talks this week is by one of the creators of , and they 'll be discussing how they integrated Unity into Facebook , and they will give away some of their binding code to be freely available to anyone .
We do n't even have to build it in .
It 's so flexible that they can just add that on top , and you can bring it to other social networks , or use Facebook Connect to get information into the games .
DH : It 's been happening slowly over the summer , but I 'm permanently based here now , and the headquarters are here , although development is still in Copenhagen .
We 're getting marketing and sales now , though , and becoming a more normal company .
[ laughs ]
Until now , we were still primarily engineers , and ex-engineers who became other things .
But it 's been happening .
" DH : It 's a good question , and it 's impossible to know how else it could have been .
We kicked ourselves for years for going to the Mac first .
We knew we had to go to PC at some point , but we had to wait until we had the resources to do it .
The good thing though , and I think this was a good thing , is that we grew up with that love for simplicity and polish as Mac guys , and a respect for the user .
If there 's a decision that needs to be taken , instead of giving tons of options , think what the actual use case is .
In the back end , you have the flexibility , but you start with less flexibility and then open up when people need it .
Then you get much cleaner design and a better project in the end .
So it definitely benefited us .
And people feel that .
They love how it 's designed , and that the naming conventions are logical , and it all builds on that .
They realize it's all been thought through , foreseeing the things they would need , and they 're super happy when they experience that .
And you can see it on our forums and when people blog about it -- actual joy .
They do n't just think it empowers them , they 're happy when they 're being empowered .
For the longest time , we had no funding .
It was just organic growth .
But when you create something that makes people happy , it makes it easier when you 're dealing with not having that funding or marketing budget to keep pushing up .
DH : It 's always really cool .
We get the most incredible emails .
One of the most recent was , " I 've been using Unity for four days now , and I 've regained my faith in humanity . "

An economy that is struggling needs an injection of cash to get it going again , at least according to basic Keynesian economic theory .
That ’s more or less what our government is doing right now , and we ’re running up massive debts in order to do it .
The biggest concern is how this debt will cripple the next generation when they have to pay it down .
Surprisingly , however , this may be a lot easier than we think because the USofA is , by one important measure , a younger nation than it has been in a long time and worth a significant investment .
The issue is , as always , what we get for our money .
This line of thinking starts from one interesting piece of information I gleaned from a report to the US Senate in 2006 .
The chart below was taken from page 6 of “ Age Dependency and Social Security Solvency ” ( pdf ) by Laura B. Srestha of the Congressional Research Service ( Library of Congress ) .
It shows the history and projections of the number of dependents non-working age people , the young and the old , per 100 people of working age in the nation .
If you look at this closely , the number of dependents is , currently , at a historic low .
That means that we have more people of working age without someone else to support than we have as far back as we ’ve kept track of these things .
In fact , by this measure we ’re even better off than the 1950s , when there was a rapid rise of dependent children of the endless summer .
More surprisingly , the projected retirement of Baby Boomers is not projected to give us a dependent population that even comes close to the late 60s , when it peaked at around 95 dependents per 100 workers .
What does this mean ?
A young nation is a nation that needs work , which is to say that the need for jobs that we see in this Depression is a feature that is likely to be with us for a long time .
Part of the issue we are facing right now is clearly demographic .
An investment in the economy , particularly jobs , is likely to have payouts over a long period of time .
The key is always what kind of investment makes sense .
I ’ve been arguing that our infrastructure investments , public and private , are often not aligned with the developing social networks in the fluid world of the internet and need to change .
That ’s one area of investment .
We also have to encourage flexibility in job creation to not only maximize the number of jobs that we have as well as their ability to change with new conditions .
Where this gets interesting is when we look at the expected changes in the US Dollar around the world .
We have gone to rather incredible lengths to support the buck over the last few decades , and I believe that we even started a war to keep it strong .
We have done this because a strong dollar allows us to buy goods cheaply from around the world , ranging from toys made in China to oil pulled out of the Venezuelan fields .
It has long seemed like a good deal .
That ’s all about to change .
Right now , there is about $ 1.50 to the Euro , which is 25 % more bucks than the single currency demanded when they first launched it 10 years ago .
We ’ve fallen against every major currency you can think of , and in fact good from China now cost about 30 % more than they did just 4 years ago .
This is likely to continue to fall as ForEx traders borrow money at roughly 0 % interest here to loan in nations that have higher interest rates , like Australia or Indonesia .
It ’s called the “ Carry Trade ” , and it means that cheap dollars will continue to not only jump - start our economy , but they ’ll flood the world .
As it picks up , we can expect the buck to continue falling .
That means that we ’ll have a weak currency .
It also means that imports will be more expensive , and that it ’ll start to look relatively cheap to make stuff here in the USofA again .
The problem is that you do n’t just turn on a factory overnight , so we can expect it will take time and plenty of investment to turn on the factories that take advantage of this situation .
More to the point , that ’s exactly what we need demographically , too .
Things are actually aligning quite well for a return to a manufacturing based economy in the USofA which provides good paying jobs .
The problems remain – we have too much overhead per employee , and we import too much energy to make this all work .
If we look to an even younger nation , Brasil , we see a nation that is committed to providing full employment and is energy independent – they are even more worthy of investment than we are right now .
But compared to major economies , and even compared to China and Russia , we are young and ready to work .
The right investments will make all the difference .
Munyaneza will be in jail for at least 25 years
A Rwandan man convicted of war crimes has been jailed for life by a Canadian court , without the prospect of parole for 25 years .
Desire Munyaneza , 42 , was found guilty in May in the first court case brought under Canada 's 2000 War Crimes Act .
He was convicted of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in 1994 .
The sentencing judge said the law considered the crimes committed by the accused to be the " worst in existence . "
Judge Andre Denis described the sentence , the harshest possible , as " severe " .
The trial took place over two years , and heard emotional testimony from 66 witnesses about the atrocities .
' Boost for survivors '
Munyaneza was accused of leading a militia whose members raped and killed dozens of Tutsis , and of orchestrating a massacre of 300 - 400 Tutsis in a church .
His lawyer has said he will appeal against the conviction .
Munyaneza arrived in Canada in the 1990s and tried to claim asylum - but the authorities rejected his claims .
He was arrested in 2005 in a Toronto suburb after allegations emerged that he had been a militia leader during Rwanda 's civil conflict .
Rwandan Jean - Paul Nyilinkwaya said : " The fact that he was found guilty is a very big boost for the survivors .
Everybody there is desperate for justice . "
Mr Nyilinkwaya , who now lives in Canada , was instrumental in Munyaneza 's capture , according to Associated Press news agency .
FISCAL CONSERVATISM ….
David M.
Walker , the comptroller general who left office last year , recently reflected on George W. Bush * .
“ There ’s no question in my view that Bush was the most fiscally irresponsible president in the history of the republic , ” Walker said .
And if there ’s one aspect of this that was consistent throughout Bush ’s two terms , it ’s that Republican lawmakers supported Bush ’s fiscally irresponsibility every step of the way .
It ’s why I share Andrew Sullivan ’s frustration .
Charlie Cook and others are predicting a sea- change in public mood , with support for the GOP rising because of deficits .
This strikes me as an amazing thing .
It makes Charlie Brown , the football and Lucy look like the model of intelligent interaction .
If you believe in fiscal conservatism , the last place on earth you should look for salvation is the GOP .
They have single - handedly destroyed America ’s finances since the 1980s , with the sole exception of George H W Bush , who was rejected by his own party precisely because of his fiscal sobriety .
The current debt is overwhelmingly inherited by Obama , and it would have been nuts to enter office in the downdraft of the sharp recession and set about cutting spending .
Bush had eight years to restrain it and he did n’t .
He let it rip .
Recent history suggests voters ’ concerns for deficits are , at best , superficial .
A poll will show that Americans overwhelmingly support deficit reduction at the conceptual level , but the same poll will show the same respondents rejecting various proposals to improve the budget outlook .
But the conventional wisdom is that the public really is concerned this time , and it ’s Democrats who ’ll feel the brunt of the discontent .
I realize that perceptions matter more than reality on issues like these , but I still feel compelled to at least acknowledge how ridiculous this is .
During their reign , Republicans took an annual surplus of a quarter of a trillion dollars and , in just eight years , turned it into a $ 1.2 trillion deficit .
The GOP added $ 5 trillion to the national debt , and inexplicably put two tax cuts , two wars , Medicare Part D , and No Child Left Behind on the national charge card , left for some future generation to worry about .
If fiscal responsibility is the new chief concern of voters , they literally could n’t find a less qualified , less credible bunch than the congressional Republican caucus .
But wait , our conservative friends remind us , that was the recent past .
What about the ongoing deficit problems on the Dems ’ watch ?
The answer is n’t complicated .
As Michael Ettlinger and Michael Linden recently explained : “ The policies of the Bush administration , which included tax cuts during a time of war and a floundering economy , are clearly the primary source of the current deficits . ”
And what of those recent reports about deficit projections rising from $ 7 trillion to $ 9 trillion ?
The bottom line , Kevin Drum recently noted , is simple : “ [ P ] roperly accounted for , the deficit actually goes down when you compare Obama ’s budget proposals to current policy , not up . ”
If Americans want to prioritize deficit reduction , fine .
But they should at least recognize who has credibility on the issue , and who does n’t .
* corrected : Walker was appointed by Clinton in 1998 , and served throughout Bush ’s presidency .
Bush was not , however , Walker ’s boss as my post originally indicated .
Being magnanimous
Originally , the issue had been something of a three way between Google , Apple and wireless US phone carrier AT&T who , it was believed , wanted the app squashed so its customers would n't be able to make cheap international calls on AT&T 's own network .
But with everything out in the open , the AT&T conspiracy theory has now dissolved , albeit leaving Apple a little bit red faced .
The reason for the rejection by Apple was apparently that the firm " believed the application duplicated the core dialer functionality of the iPhone " according to Google 's letter .
Google 's letter to the FCC also notes that Apple also rejected its Google Latitude app , claiming it to be potentially confusing for users who already had a built in Maps application which ships with the iPhone .
Apple has been trying to become a tad more open about its app store approval process of late , but the emergence of Google 's correspondence with the FCC has n't done the firm any favours .
Still , Google - whose CEO Eric Schmidt used to sit on the Apple board - is being magnanimous about the incident , noting " We continue to work with Apple and others to bring users the best mobile Google experience possible , " he said .
In case you were wondering why we bother with sex , University of Oregon scientists have produced compelling scientific evidence to explain the mystery .
The answer may seem obvious .
" Behold , it was very good , " the Bible 's book of Genesis points out after man and woman begin multiplying fruitfully .
But evolutionary biologists have been scratching their heads about sexual reproduction for decades because it's far more efficient for living things to reproduce solo .
The ability to self - fertilize offers huge theoretical advantages .
For one thing , you would n't need to search and compete for a mate , so you could forget about speed dating , personal ads and trying to look or sound impressive .
And as a " selfing " organism , all of your offspring would be capable of making babies .
Among competitors committed to sexual mating , only half of their offspring are capable of bearing young .
All else being equal , selfers can multiply at twice the rate of " outcrossers " that need mates .
Biologists have come up with theories to explain the evolution and persistence of sexual mating .
For instance , it should be a good way to purge unhealthy genetic mutations .
" If a new , harmful mutation arises in an organisms that is reproducing by self - fertilization , there is a good chance that mutation will become stuck in that group , " UO biology professor Patrick Phillips says .
" When you have sex with other individuals , you have a chance to get the normal type gene back . "
Hooking up with others to reproduce also gives individuals frequent opportunities to add new genes to their repertoire , which should help them adapt more readily to a changing environment .
But scientists had no experimental evidence to support these theories -- until now .
Phillips and colleagues Levi Morran and Michelle Parmenter enlisted the help of a millimeter - long nematode called C. elegans .
The worm species is composed of males and hermaphrodites , which can either self - fertilize or mate with males .
The UO biologists bred one population that could reproduce only by selfing and another that could reproduce only by sexual intercourse with another worm .
Then they compared their ability to hold up after generations of exposure to hostile conditions .
In one experiment , the worms had to cope with a chemical that triggered genetic mutations at four times the normal rate .
" The selfers did horribly , " Philips says .
In 50 generations , a pileup of mutations eroded their fitness .
The sexually mating worms showed no loss of fitness .
In a second experiment , researchers challenged the worms with a strain of bacteria that kills 80 percent of infected individuals .
After 40 generations , the sexually mating worms adapted swiftly to the pathogen , showing a 150 percent increase in their ability to survive .
The selfers failed to adapt at all .
on Wednesday
" Why there is sex is actually not easy to understand , and although we do have a number of hypotheses , progress has been hampered by lack of experimental evidence , " says Marcel Salathé , a post - doctoral researcher at Stanford University .
" This paper is a missing piece in this puzzle because it provides such evidence . "

Computer Card Counter Detects Human Card Counters
All it takes is a computer that can track every card :
The anti-card - counter system uses cameras to watch players and keep track of the actual “ count ” of the cards , the same way a player would .
It also measures how much each player is betting on each hand , and it syncs up the two data points to look for patterns in the action .
If a player is betting big when the count is indeed favorable , and keeping his chips to himself when it ’s not , he ’s fingered by the computer … and , in the real world , he ’d probably receive a visit from a burly dude in a bad suit , too .
The system reportedly works even if the gambler intentionally attempts to mislead it with high bets at unfavorable times .
Of course it does ; it ’s just a signal - to - noise problem .
I have long been impressed with the casino industry ’s ability to , in the case of blackjack , convince the gambling public that using strategy equals cheating .

Google on Tuesday released an SDK for Android 2.0 , revealing some new features that will come with the upgraded mobile operating system .
The news comes a day before a Verizon event in New York City that will introduce the operator 's first Android phone , which will run Android 2.0 .
However , the upgrade path for existing Android phones , and some that are soon to go on sale , is uncertain .
Android 2.0 includes a number of new features , such as digital zoom on the camera , multi - touch control and an e-mail inbox that combines messages from multiple accounts .
The new Quick Connect feature will let users touch the photo of a person in the contact list and then select call , text or e-mail from a menu .
It is designed to make it easy for users to communicate with contacts .
The feature is a welcome addition , said Avi Greengart , an analyst with Current Analysis .
" The knock on Android has been that it 's boring .
The UI 's whole functionality is not as polished as what you get on WebOS , iPhone or even Android with third - party overlays like the HTC Sense , " he said .
Sense is a user interface that HTC developed for some of its Android phones .
Android 2.0 also includes Exchange support .
Android users have been able to get e-mail from Exchange in various ways , including through third - party applications or support provided by the hardware vendor .
With the latest version of the operating system , Exchange support is built in , although Google specifically notes that handset makers can choose whether to include Exchange .
Google has also updated the Android mobile Web browser , with support for a quartet of APIs ( application programming interfaces ) from the emerging HTML 5 standard .
That 's significant because now browser - based applications can act much more like native applications .
For example , the HTML 5 Database API supports client - side databases using SQL , to store data such as Web e-mail messages locally .
This is now a feature of the browser in Android 2.0 .
In addition , the HTML 5 Application Cache lets developers store application functions and the UI , in JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets , so users can access them offline .
Other browser improvements include : the HTML 5 Geolocation API , opening up information on the device 's location ; support for full - screen video ; a new URL bar that users can tap for instant searches and navigation ; bookmarks outfitted with Web page thumbnails ; and double - tap zoom .
While Verizon 's Droid phone will run Android 2.0 , it 's uncertain which other recently introduced or currently available phones will be able to use the software .
For example , Motorola 's Cliq , expected to go on sale in early November , runs Android 1.5 .
It 's unclear whether users will be able to upgrade the phone to Android 2.0 .
Google said it 's up to carriers and handset makers .
" Because Android is open source , all software updates we release are available for carriers and handset makers to take and update their current or future Android - powered devices , " Katie Watson , a Google spokeswoman , said via e-mail .
Past updates to the operating system have been automatically pushed out to the few available models .
It 's possible that hardware requirements could prevent some devices from upgrading to the newest software .
In addition , Greengart wonders if users of devices such as the Cliq or the Sense , with custom user interfaces , would have to also update the user interface after receiving the new operating system .
Motorola and T - Mobile , which will sell the Cliq and offers two other Android phones , did not reply to questions about whether their phones would be upgradable to the new version .

Two years ago , in the throes of a Bush administration that disregarded states ' rights whenever it felt like getting high on itself , there were fewer than two hundred medical - marijuana outlets in Los Angeles .
Today , even the most conservative estimates say that number has quadrupled .
On one stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard alone , four thriving pot shops estimate their tax payments at $ 4 million a year .
Got an emergency radiation treatment and can't find the nearest store ?
There 's an iPhone app for that .
With patient demand pushing dispensaries in several of the fourteen states that allow medical marijuana to expand their business , the Obama administration last week ordered the Justice Department to respect state laws and stop harassing them .
You would think , after our new president 's ups and downs on what is ultimately the road to wholesale legalization , that calling off the pot bullies would be , by all accounts , A Good Thing .
Hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of Americans have used the approved stuff , after all , whether as therapeutic medicine or therapeutic something else .
Trouble is , all this common sense seems to have fried the brains of the law - enforcement leaders in the City of Los Angeles .
They 've suddenly come up with a bizarre new interpretation of the law — that the requirement for pot dispensaries to be " nonprofit " actually means that they can't accept cash .
Yes , you read that right .
This is how Deputy City Attorney David Berger put it : " We can still use state law to enforce , and we still believe that the only legal way to do that is to enforce against the selling of marijuana , as opposed to giving it away as a collective . "
This has to be the first time in American history that the government is ordering its citizens to start collectivizing our farms .
The backwards logic was codified in the fourth version of a draft ordinance that City Attorney Carmen Trutanich submitted last Tuesday to the Los Angeles city council .
Apparently a hard - core member of the Marxist - Leninist wing of the Republican party , Trutanich even argued that dispensary owners should n't use cash to pay for labor or fertilizer — that the voters of California actually intended for marijuana to be produced and dispensed , unlike all other drugs in the known universe , on a pure barter system .
( This from the man who made Michael Jackson 's funeral look like it switched from the Staples Center to Tammany Hall . )
Naturally , the government 's marijuana bait - and - switch over the past eight days has producers and dispensers very upset .
When I spoke with her late last week , Yamileth Bolanos , owner of a shop called PureLife Alternatives and president of an influential medical - marijuana trade group , summed up the general sentiment :
" They expect people who are sick and on chemotherapy to get up and farm their own crop ?
If you 're not directly involved in growing the crop , you can't have any of it ? "
Imagine the unintended consequences , Bolanos said .
" They say there 's between 250,000 and 300,000 medical marijuana patients in the city of Los Angeles , and we do n't have wide - open spaces here where we can grow .
That means every building in Los Angeles will be a grow site . "
The draft ordinance is city 's latest attempt to bring some kind of order to the explosion of pot stores , all of which have so far failed .
Bolanos insists that she and the marijuana community want to be partners in this , helping to clean up the shady cannabis clubs that do n't pay taxes or check prescriptions .
" We 've been screaming for regulation , " she told me .
" I 've gone to the city council and said , ' Show us the rules .
Tell us what to do , so we can provide for patients in a safe manner . '
[ But ] the city let the situation get out of hand — they would n't give us regulations , so we made up our own regulations , we started accrediting clubs .
We follow the rules very strictly , but what they 're asking us to do now is impossible . "
For example , the draft ordinance includes a clause saying you can't have a shop across an alley from a residential area .
" That alone wipes us all out , " Bolanos says .
" Who does n't have an alley behind a commercial property in Los Angeles ?
That 's how the blocks were built — the outer block is commercial and there 's residential behind it . "
A true believer in medical marijuana , Bolanos began smoking when she was diagnosed with liver cancer .
" I use cannabis every day — I have a new liver , I do n't want to put any medicine in my body that will tax my liver .
What are people supposed to do , go back to the streets ?
That 's what they 're doing : they 're sending sick people out on the street to get their medication . "
As a result , she has no sympathy for the argument that the government should just stop the charade and legalize pot altogether .
" No , no , I am not for full legalization — this is medicine to me .
There are real patients here .
It 's very sad that because of a few people who are abusing the system , the real patients have to suffer .
What is the old line ?
Non-sinners pay for what sinners do ? "
Despite all that , nobody really thinks this fight is about medicine .
It 's about the virtual legalization of drugs that is slowly but surely happening in California .
Here 's are some of the online reviews for a club in Reseda called Nature 's Natural Collective Care , for example :
" They have a nice little smoke room where you can try your samples and they have a few water pipes , glass pipes , papers in there for you to use .
I was asking about a certain strain and the guy busted out the Cannibible and gave me the low down on that strain .
I like that type of service . "
" They have over 60 strains at times all capped at $ 50 an 1/8th and no more than $ 400 an oz on the highest quality .
With ounces ranging from like $ 180 - $ 400 .
They even let you have free samples . "
" Full O's are all sub $ 400 for great shit and the service here from the budtenders is beyond fantastic .
Their knowledge and ability to work with you is amazing . "
As the right - wingers warned from the beginning , medical marijuana is turning out to be the genie you can't stuff back in the bottle .
Even if the L.A. city council 's rushed vote comes down in favor of the Trutanich ordinance , it seems likely that the regulations will be overturned in the courts — which is exactly what happened with Trutanich 's last attempt to shut down the clubs .
The state attorney general has already gone on record saying — and reiterated to Esquire.com when we asked him for comment — that the law allows sales .
In the end , this case of bureaucratic bullying — and others across the country as states come to terms with a ( relatively ) sane White House pot policy — will be just another pointless and expensive skirmish on the inevitable road to marijuana legalization .
But for now , the fight is on :
One day after Trutanich submitted the draft ordinance , the LAPD raided Nature 's Natural .
" We expect more , " Bolanos says .
" They told us there are going to be more .
We are in the fight for our lives . "

Money and Your Life : Investors Bet on Mortality Financial market banking on profits buying and selling life insurance policies .
Oct. 18 , 2009  --
Fresh off the meltdown of the mortgage business last year , Wall Street 's bankers have found a new way to make money : the buying and selling of life insurance policies belonging to the sick and elderly .
Advocates of these " life settlements " call them a valuable option for people who want or need money before they die .
Critics call it a morbid and risky business that proves Wall Street has n't learned from the mistakes of the past .
After Dr. Eddie Powell lost both his legs to a hospital infection , he desperately needed financial help to support his practice and two children in medical school .
" I had to get the money , you know , for my family to survive , " Powell said .
Powell says he sold three life insurance policies valued at nearly $ 1 million for $ 150,000 .
" I did n't know if I was going to be able to work .
Heck , I did n't even know if I was going to live , " Powell said .
" I needed the money pretty desperately .
I had bills to pay . "
Coventry , a life settlement company , bought Powell 's policies , bundled them with others and sold them to investors like banks or hedge funds .
Those investors continue to pay Powell 's premiums , hoping to cash in after he dies .
Gambling on Death
Life settlements have been around for years as an option for those looking to cash in on their life insurance before they die .
The insured sells a policy to an investor for two to three times the cash surrender value they'd get from the insurance company , and the investor continues to pay the premiums .
The sooner the insured dies , the more money the investor makes .
Life settlements got their start in the 1980s during the AIDS crisis when investors bought up the policies of patients expected to die within two years .
The insured received money for improving their quality of life , and the investors seemed certain to earn a hefty profit in a short period of time .
But when new medications prolonged the life of AIDS patients , many of those investors lost money .
Another Meltdown in the Making ?
The subprime mortgage crisis began when banks gave loans to people who could n't afford them , but it got much worse when Wall Street started betting that those loans would go bad .
The practice created a demand for more and more subprime loans .
If Wall Street creates a demand for more life insurance policies , some worry that shady brokers will fill it by preying on seniors and investors .
' Life Settlements ' Called a Morbid Business
In 2004 that company , Mutual Benefits Corp. , was shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission after federal investigators uncovered a $ 1 billion ponzi scheme .
" I did n't understand that these people had to die before you got your money , " said Nancy Scott , who said she was convinced to put all of her retirement savings in life settlements .
" I was n't investing in a person 's death , or betting on it .
To me , I was investing in the quality of a terminally ill person 's life . "
But several years later , the people Scott and others invested in are still living , or may not even exist .
Several former top officials at Mutual Benefits Corp. are in prison , including a doctor who was convicted of misrepresenting the life expectancies and medical histories of the people listed on the policies .
" Supposedly when she dies , then I 'll get $ 102,000 .
But I do n't even know if this woman is really 89 , I do n't know if she 's sick , " said Carol Tonzi , another investor involved in the suit .
Scams aside , critics warn that if enough people have a financial interest in death , everyone 's health could suffer .
" As sure as night follows day , people who have bets on early death , will find themselves lobbying against effective health care , " said Michael Greenberger , a former commodities trading regulator .
" There 's no two ways about it , this is an accident waiting to happen in terms of investment . "
" The 'ick ' factor is certainly there and we are aware of it , " Life Insurance Settlement Association president Russel Dorsett said .
" Basically , mortality , morbidity is a multitrillion dollar market . "
In the past five years , around $ 40 billion worth of policies have been sold , which Dorsett said is a tiny percentage of the multi-trillion insurance industry and too small to pose a risk to the system .
On the contrary , he said the industry provides a valuable financial tool for those who can't afford or no longer need their life insurance .
' Life Settlements ' Called a Morbid Business
" It does n't trouble me at all , no .
The insurance companies are in that business every day , " Katz said .
" The difference is they 're not betting on or against someone they know .
Katz said that someone from the company now holding his father 's policy calls him every several months to check whether his father is still alive .
When the family sold the policy , Katz had the option to specify that he receive the call rather than his father .
Down in North Carolina , it is Powell who receives a call every few months .
He said he plans on answering the phone for a long time .
" I think my grandma lived to be 113 years of age , " he said .
" You 've got a long time before Eddie Powell dies . "

ST .
PAUL , MINNESOTA ( CNN ) --
Just a few years ago , Ron Kenebrew was in prison .
When he got out , he moved from Arizona to Minnesota , but he soon wound up homeless .
Ron Kenebrew directs " Voices for Change " from the control room of the television studio .
It was at that point that he realized it was time to turn his life around .
" I had time to re-evaluate my life , " Kenebrew says , " and find the path that I 'm supposed to be on . "
He says homelessness can be one of two things : " a place in despair or ... a slingshot to opportunity . "
It 's clear he chose the latter .
" Now it 's all about giving back , " he says .
He 's doing that through a cable - access TV show .
But it 's not just any local program .
This show is produced and presented by people who 've experienced exactly what it means to be homeless .
It 's part of a multimedia collaborative created by Luis Alvarenga , a former TV and radio reporter from El Salvador who now works as a pastor at St. Paul 's First Lutheran Church .
His focus there has largely been on using cable television as an outreach medium .
The latest in his series of programs has been a weekly cable access show titled " Voices for Change . "
Alvarenga says the program accomplishes two things .
Not only does it give those in the homeless community a much - needed voice , it also provides hands - on training and , in the end , a marketable skill .
" When they 're in the streets they can't work , " Alvarenga explains .
" And that 's my goal , that a person can come in and learn a skill . "
" I am amazed that many of the people who come from the streets are sometimes well - educated and also very versatile in computer skills , " he adds .
" My hope is that they will understand solidarity , what it means to work together with others , so they can achieve a skill , use it for themselves in the future . "
Watch how the program works »
The men and women are allowed access to the local studios of the St. Paul Neighborhood Network .
Kenebrew has even taken additional classes through the station , learning about cameras , editing equipment , producing and directing .
He says he 's thinking about possibly becoming a cinematographer one day .
Kenebrew has already put what he 's learned to use , even receiving some reimbursement for shooting freelance videos for high schools .
" [ I want to ] find something that I can offer and make a positive contribution , " says Kenebrew , stressing that the collaborative is nothing without the whole team .
" The components of the team comprise disabled people , a pastor ... people from homelessness and some who have fell along the waysides , as well , " Kenebrew says .
" So now we ... as a group really want to be the voice of change . "
Ted Dennis , the program 's host and chairman of the non-profit group also titled Voices for Change , has frequently been homeless himself .
Dennis first introduced Kenebrew to the idea .
" The most rewarding part , " Dennis says , " [ is ] the idea that we 're changing the image of the stereotypical homeless person . "
" Because of our efforts on the air ... people think about what it means -- who 's homeless , what it means to be homeless , what it means to call someone homeless -- differently . "
For Kenebrew , being part of a show that centers on this issue means a lot .
" I came out of that community , " he says .
" So wanting to make a success story out of a situation of despair is the engine that drives my mind . "
" A door was opened for me , us , the homeless community , to show that a situation can turn from homelessness to hopefulness . "

Time to pad the wallet a bit more to prepare for the epic hit it will be taking .
Few universities make required reports to the government about the financial conflicts of their researchers , and even when such conflicts are reported , university administrators rarely require those researchers to eliminate or reduce these conflicts , government investigators found .
In a report expected to be made public on Thursday , Daniel R. Levinson , the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services , said 90 percent of universities relied solely on the researchers themselves to decide whether the money they made in consulting and other relationships with drug and device makers was relevant to their government - financed research .
And half of universities do not ask their faculty members to disclose the amount of money or stock they make from drug and device makers , so the potential for extensive conflicts with their government - financed research is often known only to the researchers themselves , the report concluded .
The report is the latest in a series of investigations that have found that conflicts of interest in academic research are at best lightly supervised .
Federal rules require that researchers report to their universities any outside income that may conflict with government - financed research , much of which comes from the National Institutes of Health .
Those rules also require universities to manage those conflicts in ways that protect patients and the integrity of research .
Simple question time .
When a software vendor records on their product label the HDD space requirements for their program .
. .is that measurement in base2 or base10 ?
I ask this because I honestly do n't know .
If it 's Base10 , then at least when it comes to storage I can compare apples to apples and I can just be pissed about having been sold a product that does not have the capacity advertised .
[ You can sell me all the B/S in the world about why you think Base10 is superior / smarter / better , and my brain will * STILL * compute space in Base2 .
After over 2 decades , you 're not going to get that to change ]
* IF * , however , programs and files are still reported in Base2 , then not only are you losing space off the top [ @ the HDD end ] but you 're losing space off the other side as well [ according to computer , program is bigger than advertised on the label due to Base10 calculation ] .
And if THAT'S the case , why have n't they standardized it all around ???
[ Sure , maybe they have . . but I 've never heard or seen anything on this argument outside of the HDD sector .
Either way , corporations = money and money = their way , no matter who likes / dislikes their practices .
I 'd say if you do n't like it find another company to do business with , but that 's kinda hard when they 're all in bed with each other to begin with .
The Global - Warming Crusade has been prosecuted vociferously for more than 20 years .
Far too many scientists have jumped on this politically hot topic and its corollary public - grant - funding potential .
An intragovernmental body has been created for this .
This entity called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been created to lend legitimacy to this fraud .
Taxpayers from all over the globe have been , and will continue to be bilked to put up this large and slick monument to questionable science .
The site has made copious amounts of material available for free .
By all means download it , do n’t buy any of these ponderous tomes ; save some trees .
I have been a critic of this effort for almost 20 years .
Global Warming is a massive threat to humanity , so the story goes , such that only massive and dramatic government intervention can save us from its " effects . "
This intervention would come as socialist policies designed to cripple the economies of capitalist countries whose carbon dioxide emissions ( it is alleged ) are turning the planet in a pressure cooker .
My criticism takes two fronts of argument : firstly what mankind can do with all our technological wizardry is next to nothing compared to the immense forces of the natural world and secondly because I actually have some expertise in these types of mathematical models .
I was critical of Al Gore ’s award - winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth before it was even released .
I have offered a criticism that is both elementary to understand , and very simple that easily shows basic flaws in the data .
Ironically the world ’s foremost expert on Atmospheric Physics , MIT Professor Dr. Richard Lindzen has not participated in this charade ( IPCC ) .
He is a vigorous and vocal critic of this IPCC hype .
Many others have realized that this farce was nothing more than a crude attempt to implement socialism and control of the economy via environmental regulation based on mendacious , uncritical , and fundamentally wrong interpretations of this " science . "
I eschewed these models based upon years spent performing mathematical modeling on a variety of topics , one of them being , atmospheric physics .
Lots of people are now recognizing that Global Warming does not exist .
The temperature peaked in 1998 and things have been getting colder in the intervening years .
A bold theory has emerged from Dr. Henrik Svensmark that is actually experimentally verifiable .
Dr. Svensmark ’s thesis is that cloud formation is a much more important climate driver for temperature change than carbon dioxide — type " greenhouse gases " whose concentrations change in the parts per million .
It is bold because it is simple and easily verified .
Almost every human being has experience with temperature changes on a cloudy day .
Cloudy days are inevitably cooler than sunny days .
The answer is obvious : less of the sun ’s heat radiation gets to the surface .
Clouds also serve to reflect significant amounts of the sun ’s radiation back into space .
What controls cloud formation ?
Global - warming advocates will say it is evaporation from the surface and the oceans .
Any school boy can demonstrate the flaw in this argument .
Pour water on your skin on a warm day and the evaporation cools the skin as it removes the heat of vaporization from the surface of the body .
Humans depend on this ( sweating ) heat removal mechanism to survive .
Thus warm temperatures will serve as a buffer for average temperature change if evaporation is considered as a forcing function .
The Chilling Stars : A ... Henrik Svensmark Best Price : $ 2.01 Buy New $ 1.99 ( as of 07:25 EST - Details )
Dr. Svensmark ’s excellent book The Chilling Stars exposits that ionized and high - energy particle absorption in the atmosphere is the pre-dominant mechanism for cloud formation .
He has an impressive amount of detailed scientific evidence to prove this fact .
It is based on literally hundreds , if not thousands , of independent experiments .
If you only buy one book on the global - warming / climate - change debate this is the one to procure .
The science he lays out is compelling and is valid over time frames of hundreds of millions of years .
Most of the global - warming debate centers on ice core experiments that look back in time for only a few hundred thousand years .
This model has many flaws because the results are very sensitive to the mechanism of specimen collection and the particular gas analysis tools chosen .
High - Energy Physics is one of the most accurate scientific theories to date .
A primary tool in this endeavor is the cloud chamber .
The cloud chamber is a controlled volume of water vapor such that high - energy particles enter the chamber and leave trails characteristic of the type of particle and the energy of the particle .
Cloud chambers have been used for more than a century and their physics is long - established and well - understood .
Most detectors in high - energy physics derive much of their design from cloud change — type measurements .
The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) and the Stanford Linear Accelerator have detectors based upon these types of scattering principles .
The trail of high - energy particles in the cloud chamber show , unequivocally that high - energy particles streaming ( what physicist ’s call flux ) into the atmosphere form clouds in greater and lesser amounts corresponding to hotter and colder epochs of the planet ’s history .
What is the source of this particle flux ?
Threefold mainly , some stream from the sun ( spaceweather.com ) , some from inside our galaxy the Milky Way , and the rest come from outside of the Milky Way from the myriad and incredibly violent events like black hole formation , accretion disk acceleration , magnetic flux tube formation and destruction , magnetar and quasar jets , etc .
We live in a very docile and calm neighborhood in an immense volume of conditions very hostile to life as we understand it .
There is nothing that can be done about any of these three sources ( except perhaps to call out the Oh - Oh - Squad ) ; they stream down from all directions around the earth as they will .
Most of these were created billions of years ago and are just now reaching the Earth .
The conclusion then is that if Dr. Svensmark ’s theory is correct than global - warming / cooling is just another of Nature ’s characteristics that man can do little to control , so a debate and policy changes based upon this are feckless .
The most rational thing we can do about climate change is to stop wasting taxpayer ’s money on dubious scientific programs that produce questionable data that lead to a foregone conclusion : socialism .
In closing let ’s review some unpleasant , but accepted historical facts .
Some 600 million years ago the Earth was completely covered in ice that was a mile thick on average , No life existed here .
The sun then , was about 10 % younger than it is now so it was still on the same stellar evolutionary rung as currently .
Only 100 million years later the snowball planet melted and life became abundant .
This tells us that the planet can freeze , and the freeze can kill everything .
Just 50 years ago the scientific consensus was that global cooling was the expected trend for the future not warming .
An ice age on the scale of the one just 20,000 years ago caused glaciers to form as far south as Tennessee .
Canada was completely smothered as were much of Russia and the northern half of Europe .
This most recent ice age would have dramatic effects on the human population ; billions would die as food production plummeted .
The planet can support less than 10 % of the current population with subsistence farming as the technology of the day .
Not to mention the fact that the most productive farmland on the planet would now be glaciated exacerbating this trend .
On the other hand what does a slight amount of global warming portend ?
The North Pole might completely melt .
A significant part of the Antarctic ice shelf might also melt .
This would raise average sea levels slightly .
Oceans cover 2/3 of the planet ’s surface ; the average depth of the ocean is about a mile .
A rise in sea level of say 10 feet ( much larger than expected ) would change the shoreline for a lot of real estate that was put too close to the water anyway .
It would not make much difference to mankind ’s ability to survive .
Cropland would not be massively destroyed .
Florida real estate would take a beating , but then it was never a good idea to overpopulate what is essentially a large sand bar .
If you go to a farm that is more than 100 years old you will almost never find that the farmhouse is in the valley or on the shoreline .
Farmers were much too smart to make that mistake .
They built on hilltops !
Why ?
They learned the hard way about shifting shorelines , water and what it can do to your life and livelihood .
In closing let ’s just stop wasting breath on global warming , the science is of such poor a quality that it should be ignored .
It is at its heart a mendacious attempt designed to strip prosperity from millions that have it and billions more that want it .
" Global - warming Political Science " is the product of an affluent society that allows a spoiled rich brat like Al Gore to get a Nobel Prize for telling un - truths .
The American people fired him !
He is currently unemployed and for a good reason ; he has no job skills of any value , as would many of the " scientists " prosecuting the global - warming crusade if the market were free to choose .
We cannot predict weather accurately for more than a week , why should we allow the same predictions to be accepted for all of the future ?
The answer is we should not .

“ It can happen to anyone , ” Obama said in his weekly address .
“ In the United States of America , no one should have to worry that they ’ll go without health insurance — not for one year , not for one month , not for one day .
And once I sign my health reform plan into law — they wo n’t . ” — CNNMoney.com
According to President Obama , a health insurance crisis is upon us .
He states in the New York Times that there are 46 million Americans who do n’t have insurance , in some cases for as much as one day .
This exemplifies how the current debate about health care has turned into a debate about the insurance which will pay for the care , not on how people will obtain the care itself .
Even on Mises.org , Dr. Robert Murphy devotes a considerable portion of his analysis to the problems with insurance .
But that ’s not the end of it .
It is usually assumed without question that a fourth party ( either the employer or government ) will pay for the insurance premiums .
The most common ways that we pay for goods and services are cash out of current income , obtaining credit , or paying out of saved cash reserves .
There are two parties in the transaction : the buyer and the seller .
It makes sense for most of us to use insurance in a small number of purchases .
The more common examples for individual and families are : residential property destruction , auto - related ( liability for injury ; theft ) , and accidental death or permanent disability .
But when it comes to health care , why is most of the discussion about ways to reform the current four - party system , not about reducing the number of parties involved from four to three or even two ?
Why is a cash - payment system direct from the patient to the provider not featured in most of the prominent reform plans ?
I believe that the word insurance has come to mean the same thing as health care in the minds of most Americans .
In the current climate of opinion , it goes without saying that a third party ( know as an insurance company , but not really an insurer in the strict sense ) should pay most health care expenses .
The idea of cash payment — the way we pay for most services — is inconceivable .
While the pathologies of the current health care system and possibilities for reform are a huge topic , I will attempt to address only a small corner of the issue : the preoccupation with three - and four - party payment systems .
First I will explain what insurance is , what it is not , why the insurance model only works for some purchases but not for others , and why most existing insurance plans are not really insurance .
Let ’s look at the definition of insurance :
Insurance , in law and economics , is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent loss .
Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss , from one entity to another , in exchange for a premium , and can be thought of as a guaranteed and known small loss to prevent a large , possibly devastating loss .
Only some future events are insurable .
Insurable risks share certain characteristics : the risk of a single loss is small , the insured cannot cause the insurable event to occur , the magnitude of a potential loss would be too great for the insured to afford , and when the risk is spread over a large number of similar cases , the premium for each insured is affordable .
For market conditions to make insurance a sensible model , a risk must meet all of these characteristics .
It would not make sense to obtain insurance against a certain expense — even it were possible — because the premium paid to the insurer would be equal , or greater than , the expense itself .
Your house burning down is an insurable risk , while your car running out of gas or your pantry running out of grocery supplies are not .
Let ’s segment health care expenses into insurable and non-insurable categories :
predictable care
annual physicals , teeth cleaning , a chronic but manageable condition , e.g. a medication or regular chiropractor visits , planned events such as giving birth
Not insurable
unpredictable non-serious care
minor injury , tooth cavity , a cut
Not worth the overhead to insure .
unpredictable but serious health emergencies
getting hit by a car , a life - threatening illness
Insurable
The first two of these categories are clearly not insurable because the risk of an event is close to 100 % .
In the second case , the cost does not warrant obtaining insurance .
The third category is the best suited for the insurance model , presuming that the cost of obtaining care for an accident or illness is necessarily too great for an individual to afford .
One of the many bad side effects of the current system is that the meaning of the word insurance has become corrupted in public discourse .
The way that the word is used in the current debate means , approximately , “ a third - party payer who will provide unlimited health care at minimal or no cost to the patient . ”
I frequently hear people ask , “ how can someone with an illness obtain insurance ? ”
What the sick person needs is care , not ( necessarily ) insurance .
In any case it would not make sense for an insurer to provide a policy to someone who is already sick .
When I blogged about this recently , I received several emails with questions along the lines of , " I have medical expenses that I cannot afford , therefore I need insurance . "
But insurance as such can only replace large unpredictable risks with small but known payments by distributing the small risk over a large pool of insured .
Insurance cannot solve the problem of funding all routine or regular care because distributing a fixed and even expense does not reduce the cost — it probably increases the cost .
A policy that covered predictable and recurring care would have to charge at least as much as the care itself , and then some to account for the overhead of claims processing .
The insurance company must prevent fraud and ensure that the care they are paying for is necessary .
This imposes additional monitoring costs .
For the people who emailed me , a policy would only reduce costs if someone else paid the premium .
It is not necessarily the case that costs of care under a cash payment system would be the same as they are now .
Under a cash payment system prices would have to be lower , for several reasons : people would become price - sensitive in their consumption decisions ; third party monitoring costs would be eliminated in most cases ; and providers would have to compete on the basis of price .
See this discussion of health care in India for some insight into how a cash paying system might function .
While the current four - party system is not the only reason that costs are as high as they are , it is one reason .
So we are stuck in a loop where costs are high because we have insurance but we must have insurance because costs are high .
For more information about the history of the four - party system , I recommend the excellent paper The Modern Health Care Maze : Development and Effects of the Four - Party System by Kroncke and White .
Also , most people do not perceive the costs of the current system accurately .
I believe that employer - provided plans are partly at fault for this .
Because the plans are nominally paid for by the employer , they create an illusion that care is provided at no cost to the insured .
Most employed workers do not understand that they pay for their health plan through reduced wages .
The tax system is also partially responsible for this system because the employer ’s expense is tax deductible , but the employee ’s purchase of a similar plan out of their after - tax income is not .
People are for the most part unaware how much lower their wages are due to employer - provided plans .
If your employer is providing a family plan that costs several hundred dollars per month , this is costing you thousands of dollars annually in lower wages .
Having your employer purchase a policy on your behalf also creates the well - known issue of lack of portability when you change jobs .
I wonder how many people do not change to a better - paying or otherwise more attractive job due to the portability issue .

Without benefits , the present employer costs would have to go back into wages .
In my experience trying to explain this point , it is an unfamiliar concept and many people are skeptical .
The most common response I get is that employers have the ability to simply lower wages by cutting benefits without increasing the cash component of wages , as if the level of wages is totally discretionary on the part of the employer .
Economic reasoning is required to understand that the total wage consists of cash payments paid directly to the worker plus expenses incurred on the worker ’s behalf by the employer .
The opportunity cost of providing employee benefits is less money available for the payment of wages .
( If you are not familiar with this idea , see a text on the marginal product theory of wages , for example , Man Economy and State , Chapter 7 ) .
Another cost of the three - and four - party system is the needs and requirements of intermediaries who come in between the consumer and the provider .
The provision of care now must satisfy not only ( or maybe not at all ) the consumer , but the insurer , the employer , and actual or potential attorneys and regulators .
Another advantage of a cash payment system would be the elimination of these intermediaries .
The present debate about health care reform must not remain a debate about insurance reform .
We should be talking about what is the best system for everyone to obtain care at a reasonable price .
Insurance plans with high deductibles and low premiums might be part of the solution .
But the word insurance should not be used to mean the same thing as care itself .
All of the energy that is presently expended arguing about insurance has crowded out the more fruitful discussion of alternative payment models , including a cash payment system directly from consumer to provider .
Contrary to Obama ’s statement , people would not worry so much about health insurance if health care itself were a normal good that they could afford out of current income .

The Best of Robert Blumen
1 . In the absence of a state , highly undesirable forms of coercion would probably persist .
2 . In a stateless society , some associates might in any case acquire sufficient resources to create a highly oppressive state .
3 . A degree of social control sufficient to avoid the creation of a state appears to require that an association be highly autonomous , very small , and united by multiple bonds .
4. Creating such associations on a significant scale in the world today appears to be either impossible or highly undesirable .
These judgments support the conclusion that it would be better to try to create a satisfactory state than try to exist in a society without a state .

I never liked him , the bastard .
Always cocky , always smiling , always making like being handsome was easy — had the gift of an easy manner , did Handsome Jack .
I never liked him .
I ’ve always known he was a bastard .
But he does tell a good joke , and he ’ll usually pick up the tab whenever there ’s a tab to be picked up .
He ’s good like that , real loose with his money .
Comes and goes , he says , just like the flu and rare women .
Just like happiness .
Just like opportunities , he ’s saying , just like all the opportunities you ’ve missed in your life little Edward and that ’s why you never have sex and that ’s why you ’re lonely .
He may have a point .
He says I never see anything , that I have n’t the eyes for opportunities .
I want him to tell me how he sees but I do n’t think he knows how to verbalize it .
He tries and tries but it never computes .
Imagination , he says .
Find out what you want and then fill in the gaps going backwards .
Audacity is key .
This is what he says to me .
This is why I do n’t like him .
Do n’t like the way he jiggles his umbrella as we step out of a coffee shop that is the same coffee shop as everywhere else and on to the sidewalk .
It ’s raining and he ’s taller then me and I do n’t have an umbrella so what can I do but stand under his ?
We ’re in a shopping center -- or plaza -- or square and right in front of us some young guy is trying to park his parent ’s monstrous SUV into a little space between a beat - to - shit Buick and someone ’s shiny midlife crisis .
The little fool drives right into the side of the sports car .
Big , ugly dent .
And you know what Jack does ?
He does a quick look around , then down at me , and grins .
Opportunity , he says , Audacity is key .
Oh , what the fuck !
Jack ’s checking for damage , petting his baby , and the kid ’s all apologies .
Sorry , man !
Really !
He ’s holding his head in his hands because he knows when his parents find out they will take it from him .
Jack starts to calm down , he ’s not mad anymore , it ’s cool , man , it ’s cool .
We can work this out .
Say , kid , my friend here works as a body mechanic , and I ’m sure he can help me out with deal where I can get this fixed for pretty cheap , so do n’t even worry about it .
We were young once , too .
Shit , Mac , what ’ll this cost me ?
Four hunnerd .
Five ?
And Jack expects me to answer so I grunt an affirmative .
Like he knew I would .
He sighs .
Well , fuck .
That ’s a handful of money .
Wo n’t insurance cover it ?
The kid asks .
Yeah , sure , but then our premiums will go up and your parents and I will end up paying much more in the long run .
I ’m better off paying out of pocket to old ugly Mac here .
Shit , kid .
You ’ve really put me in the pinch .
Good news is that your parent ’s truck is n’t hurt so it looks like you get off scott - free .
It ’s your lucky day .
Which leaves the kid feeling like he should do something .
I just got paid , he says , please , it ’s Friday , take some money , I have about a hundred here , it ’s the least I can do seeing how kind you ’re being .
And Jack awkwardly accepts .
The kid asks if they should exchange contact information , just in case .
Jack says no .
It happened quickly and it ’s quickly finished .
Thanks but we have errands to be running .
Have a good life .
Let ’s take your car , Mac , come on .
And we leave .
I wonder what that kid is thinking , if he has any inkling at all to how easily he was duped .
I wonder if he ’ll leave before the real owner of the sports car shows up .
I wonder what would have happened if the real owner had shown up sooner .
Run , says Jack .
Lie some more , play stupid , skedaddle .
He did n’t show up , though .
That ’s the point .
You want fifty bucks ?
No .
Twenty five ?
I agree your role was minor .
No .
You stole from a kid .
Of course I stole from a kid .
They ’re the easiest to steal from .
You think that would have worked with a grown man ?
No !
And , he adds , they ’re young enough to really learn a lesson .
They ’re stupid .
They ’re naïve I say .
Exactly .
Now maybe less so .
Plus I can buy a new coat .
Everybody wins .
What about the owner of that sports car ?
Well , everyone wins except the losers .
Do n’t look so glum , Ed .
You always look so glum .
What you did was wrong .
Wrong !
Wrong and right , good and bad , Jesus , you actually believe that stuff ?
There is no good or bad , Ed , just cause and effect .
It ’s the nature of the universe ; you ’d do well to wise up .
He irks me .
Purposely he irks me .
Do n’t say the Lord ’s name —
Ah !
Yes , always I forget of your penchant for divinity .
Your poor soul .
You lost sheep .
You ignorant dope .
You should study evolution .
It ’s a far more interesting version of events than the one you cling to .
This smug bastard looks down on me , he who just pilfered some toddler ’s piggy bank .
This scoundrel .
This rogue .
He thinks he ’s a better person then me .
Seriously Eddie , he says , how can you be taken in by all that ?
I do n’t get it .
Some All - Father in the sky ?
Adam and the evil woman ?
Heaven and hell ?
Do good deeds , say your prayers , we ’ll all meet at the gates for an eternity of perfect paradise ?
How does that work ?
I do n’t know , Jack .
I do n’t go into heavy details about that stuff .
God is in heaven .
That ’s good enough for me .
But he ’s not satisfied .
He asks whether or not I believe that the bible is the true word of god .
I wish he ’d just shut up .
He says to me how can it be if it ’s written by the hands of man ?
He asks me why I do n’t read Hebrew .
He says if he thought there was a book from on high then he ’d want to read the original .
He says he feels sorry for how dumb I am .
What an arrogant prick .
How lamely he tries to justify himself .
The narcissist .
I tell him so .
He pauses just before opening the driver ’s side door of his own car , a gaudy black Cadillac .
A narcissist ?
He asks , and he sounds hurt but you can never tell with a guy like him .
It makes me madder .
He says , Ed , man , is that what you really think of me ?
How dull your perception !
Do you not realize that I care deeply for every living thing on the planet ?
Even for the repugnant creatures like slugs and yourself .
I do n’t make a habit of ripping off kids , you know .
I was just trying to show you what an opportunity looked like .
A great service , I thought .
You made me an accessory to fraud .
Potato Potaddo , little Edward .
Get a grip .
I hurt the kid far less then your preacher would .
Religion !
He wo n’t drop it , and the audacity to say something like that .
Something so downright stupid .
Look , I say , very few men of the cloth molest —
Bah !
Molest .
As if being diddled were a traumatic a thing as everyone makes it out to be .
I was diddled as a boy , Ed , by some neighbor guy .
I thought it was kind of weird and a bit gross so I distanced myself from it .
I would n’t wish it on another but I hardly found it devastating .
I meant your preacher will hurt the kid more by peddling his institution .
By promoting his in - crowd .
By dividing his mind .
It ’s so goddamn superfluous .
You ’re familiar with the Neanderthal ?
The what ?
Neanderthal .
He shakes his head .
You mean like , the caveman ?
Yeah .
Sure , the caveman .
Show some respect you ignorant upstart .
Gah , look at you sneer .
The Neanderthal is n’t a mere caveman but an elegant puzzle piece to The Epic Saga Still Unfolding , the big one , our story , little Edward .
The real one .
Not the one you found in your head but the one other ’s have found in the dirt , in the bones , in the evidence of our past .
He looks as though he suddenly developed a migraine .
Lordy , Ed , but you just should n’t open your mouth .
It ’s too embarrassing .
He stops talking and so do I. Respite , finally .
The only sound I hear comes from other cars rushing past my window as we head down the highway toward Jack ’s apartment , where — as he had promised me over our coffee — he would ‘ blow my mind . ’
I still have my doubts .
Suddenly he ’s fumbling in the pocket of his coat and he pulls out the wad of cash he took from the kid .
You sure you do n’t want a cut ?
He asks .
I do n’t answer .
Okay , he says , and tosses it out the open window .
I watch in the rearview mirror as the bills take flight past the traffic , little green pieces of trash , and I ca n’t help smiling .
Too much guilt , I say .
Nah , he says , but if anyone finds it I hope they buy a drink .
That ’s what I need .
A strong motivator .
Ed , boy , I must say that I ’m suddenly doubtful you ’ll be receptive to the gift I want to give you .
You can keep your gifts , I say .
You ’re perception is all twisted , anyway .
Any gift you give is probably more of your bullshit propaganda .
More of your arrogant asshole shit .
I wish I said that .
I just grunted .
Dumb little pig I am .
Grunt grunt grunt .
Seriously , little Eddie , I ’m going to need you to open up your head a little bit .
You ever smoke weed ?
Drugs !
Great !
No , I say , and I wo n’t .
I do n’t do drugs .
Weed ?
Ain’t a drug , man , it ’s a leaf .
I forget who said that , but fine .
You ’ll take a drink , though ?
Please tell me you will .
I ’ll beg .
Ha .
I would n’t mind a drink , I say .
And he sighs contented and turns off the highway .
Now we ’re in his apartment , and I ’m starting to feel surrounded .
It ’s not messy , not quite , but it ’s not clean either .
Cigarette smoke clings to the fabric of everything .
On the table sits a charred pipe flanked by a score of empty bottles , some Irish brew called Killian’s .
Now about that drink ,
He says , and I say yeah well what about it ?
Strong or soft he says and I ’m feeling like something strong might help this whole thing operate , so I watch him pull a big jug of Old Crow from atop his cupboards .
He blows the dust off and asks how I want it and next thing I know four empty shot - glasses are staining the countertop .
Old , dead crow is right .
Now enough fucking around , Jack .
Show me what you need to show me .
Come here , he says , and he leads me to a corner of his cornered apartment .
He shows me to a dusty pile of records and an old ugly record player .
I can see him waiting for it to take effect .
I can feel his anticipation , his need , just as clearly as if he asked me to .
I ’m not impressed , and I tell him so , even though I know it must have taken a long time to gather this many albums ; he has them lying everywhere .
Stacked as they are like pancakes or bills : his little reverent shrine .
Sit down , he says , and would you listen ?
Please ?
He pulls an album out of the pile , all white , and when he puts it on the player it sounds like a campfire , all crackles and hisses .
This is music , he says .
You ’ve never heard its like .
And I ’ll admit it sounds nice .
He ’s playing me the white album and all the boys are doing their best .
All harmony and jangles .
That old crow is sitting in my chest like my own warm bullet , all pretty for my gullet , all pretty like a sonnet and I ’m thinking maybe that Jack , he ain’t so bad .
Then he starts to talking , then he starts mentioning my sister , and I tell him this is so nice why do you feel the need to tear it down ?
Because this is your sister , man .
This is what she saw .
And what do you know of my sister , you simple shark ?
You ugly tramp ?
You blip upon her radar ?
You were with her , what , a year ?
I was hers for a lifetime !
Do n’t you dare talk about her , do n’t you fucking dare .
And I swear to you that I ’ve never looked before so fierce , never before made such an impression on a person .
He ’s looking like he should n’t say a thing and the music keeps playing , keeps pouring out the speakers , and I ’m fuming so bad I find myself in front of the bottle again , and I ’m pouring us shots but he ’s filling up his pipe , and he ’s saying to me man , wo n’t you just shut your mouth and listen ?
So we do .
Me with the bottle and him with the blues .
Me forcing down that Old Crow and him filling the room with his incense , his little fragrant clouds , and he ’s saying you know man ?
Once upon a time people had to stop for their music , had to sit down and hear it , you know ?
There you go with your Ipods and your internets and everything you ever wanted is right there at your fingertips , instant gratification and instant karma .
You do n’t appreciate shit .
I ’d appreciate a little quiet , I tell him .
There ’s a blackbird singing in the dead of night .
A beautiful sound , and everything he says is taking away from it .
Keeping me here when I want to be there .
Floating with that perfect pleasant plucking — but no .
Jack ’s keeping me here and he ’s staring at me like he ’s got something to say .
He says : I did n’t kill your sister .
He says she killed herself .
I got nothing to say to that and you would n’t either , you would n’t .
He says he gave everything to her .
And he would say that , he ’d lie .
He ’d make another excuse to stack neatly with the others , as per his modus operandi , ( which is Latin for being a fucker . *)
He never gave anything to her , I know , only took , always taking .
Just like he ’s trying to take now , trying to steal a bit of comfort from me so he can sleep a little easier in the night .
Too much guilt , I know it .
It rides on your shoulders .
I do n’t want to talk about this , I tell him .
And I wo n’t .
You do n’t know how stubborn I am , Jack .
You ’ve no idea .
But of course he does , he must .
He knew my sister , after all , and lord knew she was the biggest stubborn bitch of them all .
And I can see what she was talking about now , how she always complained that you could be as stubborn as you wanted with old Jack , it did n’t faze him .
He just sat there looking at you like you were an idiot and sooner or later you started to agree with him .
Made you want to smash his face in .
Makes you want to vomit .
Makes you wish you never agreed to coffee in the first place .
But then he just gave up , plum quit .
I do n’t want to talk about it either , he says .
It was a bad idea .
Hey , no one ’s perfect , right ?
As you well know , oh imperfect punk , oh faulty fucker .
Are you sure you do n’t want a hit ?
What I want is a cab , I say .
And soon I have one .
I do n’t want to go home , not with the buzz I picked up at Jack ’s place .
Abby ’d slit my throat , and I would n’t be able to talk to baby Julie for more then half a minute without wanting to bawl my eyes out at her , but what can I do ?
Where could I go ?
The park ?
It ’s freezing out , forget it .
The movies ?
That ’d be another cab ride later , more money after more money .
No .
Home is where I ’m headed , and damn the consequences .
And you ’re drunk , Abby says , immediately .
Ten years will do that .
Ten years and the only one you ’re able to lie to is yourself .
She twists her face up in that special way and is able to cram ten minutes debasement into a single caustic scowl .
By reflex I cringe and that pisses me off .
This whole day pisses me off , but I ’m going to need this woman to drive me to my car later , so I say nothing , tread lightly .
Where ’s Jules ?
I say .
She crosses her arms in a very irritating and bitchy way , and by this she means :
Fuck you But she tilts her head towards the staircase and in her eyes I spot the conditional mercy , blessed reprieve .
Never argue with a drunk .
My baby girl is sleeping .
Light from the cracked door splits her face in half , bothers her , and she rolls over to her other side .
Her teddy , Luke , falls to the floor with hardly a sound .
I know I should n’t , I know , but I do anyway .
I slip off my shoes and tread lightly to her bed , heavy feet thwarted by years of practice .
My back cracks loudly as I bend for Luke , but it does n’t wake her .
I never wake her .
Not often , anyway , not lately .
Look at her , please , just look .
She ’s so beautiful .
So small and perfect , the only innocent thing I ’ve ever known , and she ’s dying .
Not dying dying , not really , but every day after every day a little more of the outside world slips in under the door and through the cracks , is brought in by bad attitudes and office squabbles , traffic and rainy weather .
It ’s infecting her , and I ’m powerless to stop it .
Luke looks at me with those sad old bear eyes .
He sees it .
He knows .
He ca n’t do shit about it either .
Now ,
time is a funny thing , apparently it ’s measured , always there , tick tick tick .
But sometimes you get away from it , or vice versa , or whatever and when I look at my watch it ’s somehow ten after midnight .
I ’ve been sitting here awhile , but I do n’t want to move yet .
I want another drink but this is n’t the sort of thing you should stop for refreshments .
Daddy , she says , why are you crying ?
Her little eyes are open .
I do n’t know when she woke , perhaps from some subtle readjustment on my part , maybe just because , but there she is and I had n’t realized I was crying .
I think about lying to her but I do n’t want to .
It ’s because you ’re very beautiful , sweetheart .
It ’s because sometimes when you ’re very happy about something you cry , that ’s all .
I do n’t know why .
It does n’t really make sense , huh ?
She shakes her head sleepily , side to side .
Go back to sleep , sweetheart , okay ?
I was just leaving .
Daddy ?
Yes ?
I do n’t believe in god .
Shit .
Daddy .
Sorry .
The church man says god made everything , so does Dennis Hanratty .
Who ’s Dennis Hanratty ?
He ’s stupid .
Oh .
I say .
Did he ?
Did who what ?
God , Dad .
She says .
I tuck Luke under her arm , and stand from the bed .
Yeah , I say , he created everything in the whole universe , sweetheart .
Well I do n’t believe that .
Why ?
You know the new house at the end of the street , by Mr. Smart’s ?
Yeah ?
I saw men building it .
Infected , I told you .
I bend down and kiss her cheek .
In the morning , I say .
Good night , sweetheart .
I love you more then anything .
Gudnight , Daddy .
I love you too .
When the door closes I lean my back against it , sag to my knees .
Behind me , behind closed doors , behind that ticking clock ,
lies the sleeping child :
My sister 's daughter .
the end .

( Dr. Salmony is a concerned global citizen , without expertise in population science . )
Link : Human Carrying Capacity is Determined by Food Availability ( R. Hopfenberg )
Imagine for a moment that we are looking at a huge ocean wave , watching it move toward the shore .
Think of a tsunami .
The wave is moving toward us ; however , at the same time , there are many molecules in the wave that are moving in the opposite direction , against the tide .
If we observe that the propagation of the global human population is like the wave , and the reproduction numbers of individuals or certain locales are like the molecules , it may be inaccurate for the latter to be looked at as if it tells us something meaningful about the former .
Abundant research indicates that countries like Australia , Italy , and Tunisia , among many others , have recently shown a decline in human population growth .
These geographically localized data need not blind us to overwhelming facts that the absolute global population is still growing and may reach 12 billion by the end of this century .
Earth Policy Institute data from February 2005 indicate that global numbers will be above 9 billion by 2050 .
As suggested above , the world population is like a wave ; individual or localized reproduction numbers are like the molecules .
Put another way , human propagation data and evidence of reproduction numbers among individuals , even in many places , may be pointing in different directions .
Choosing the scope of observation is like deciding to look at either the forest or the individual trees , at either the wave or its molecules .
Thus , the global challenge before us is a species propagation problem , in a way unrelated to individual or local counts .
For too long a time , human population growth has been viewed as being somehow outside the course of nature .
The possible reasons behind population growth rates and numbers have seemed complex , obscure , numerous , or even unknowable , so that a strategy to address what could be a clear and present danger has been thought to be all but impossible to develop , let alone implement .
To have suggested , as many scientists have done , that understanding the dynamics of human population does not matter , that the human population problem is not about numbers , or that human population dynamics have so dizzying an array of variables as not to be suitable for scientific investigation , in a way seems not quite right .
Dr. Russell P. Hopfenberg has made it possible for us to grasp human population dynamics as a natural phenomenon and to liberate vital understanding of skyrocketing global population growth from the discombobulated realm of the preternatural .
Hopfenberg gives us empirical data of a non-recursive biological problem that is independent of ethical , social , legal , religious , and cultural considerations .
This means human population dynamics are essentially like the population dynamics of other species .
It also means that world human population growth is a rapidly cycling positive feedback loop , a relationship between food and population in which food availability drives population growth , and population growth fuels the impression that food production needs to be increased .
The data indicate that as we increase food production every year , the number of people goes up , too .
With every passing year , as food production is increased , leading to a population increase , millions go hungry .
Why are those hungry millions not getting fed year after year after year … and future generationl of poor people may not ever be fed ?
Every year the human population grows .
All segments of it grow .
Every year there are more people growing up well fed and more people growing up hungry .
The hungry segment of the global population goes up just like all the other segments of the population .
We are not bringing hunger to an end by increasing food production ; we are giving rise to more hungry people .
Perhaps a new biological understanding is emerging with Russell Hopfenberg ’s research .
It is simply this : human population numbers , as is the case with other species , are primarily a function of food availability .
Although the human population “ explosion ” appears to be a huge problem , we can take the measure of it and find a remedy that is consonant with universally shared human values .
As San Francisco schools have cut budgets to the bone , the city 's school board president used her district - issued credit card to charge thousands of dollars for personal items and thousands more at city restaurants and cafes , according to a Chronicle analysis of financial records .
Board President Kim - Shree Maufas charged $ 4,300 on the district 's Diners Club card for a wide range of personal purchases .
They included more than $ 2,000 for a cultural exchange trip to China , $ 196 for tickets to the Florida Epcot theme park , $ 40 for black Crocs , a $ 125 car battery and a $ 162 car windshield , $ 160 in U.S. passport processing fees , a $ 37 medical visit in Los Angeles and $ 3 for Apple iTunes .
In addition , Maufas charged $ 3,000 on the district 's Diner 's Club for food and beverages to conduct meetings across San Francisco , although the people whom she met and specific district purposes typically were not divulged .
The records showed that she was often a big tipper with taxpayer funds .
In more than 40 instances , a taxi or restaurant tip exceeded 20 percent of the final bill .
Maufas reimbursed the district in four payments over several months for the personal expenses , even as she continued to charge personal gas , food , parking and other items to the Diner 's Club card .
Her repayments did not include interest .
Meeting at Starbucks
Expenses paid by the district included workday meetings at a Starbucks near her place of employment , charges that at times included only a single beverage and a single pastry or sandwich .
Receipts submitted to the district rarely explained the purpose of the meetings or who was present .
Her personal and local business meeting expenses far exceeded those of the sixother school board members , who combined spent about $ 1,300 at city restaurants and cafes to conduct district business during the same 16 - month period ending in June , including credit card charges as well as out - of - pocket expenditures that were reimbursed .
None of the charges Maufas racked up appeared to be illegal , but Superintendent Carlos Garcia said The Chronicle 's investigation spurred him to tighten district policies related to credit cards used by board members and some administrators .
District credit cards are relatively new to board members , a practice initiated by Garcia after he arrived two years ago to ease the burden of out - of - pocket expenses that are part of being an elected official .
" When I got here I noticed that if some of our board members wanted to attend a meeting , it was n't easy for them in terms of how to pay for it , " he said .
" If you want to get on the board to serve children , you do n't necessarily have to have means . "
' Wo n't happen again '
Maufas said in an interview with The Chronicle that she believed that as long as she paid back the personal charges " we were fine . "
" There definitely was a misunderstanding about how we use our credit card , but we have had training on that , " she said .
" You can rest assured that wo n't happen again . "
The Chronicle 's investigation covered a 16 - month period from late February 2008 to the end of June this year , a period of such severe budget shortfalls that the city twice kicked in rainy day funds to help the district avoid teacher layoffs .
About half of Maufas ' personal use of the Diner 's Club card came during an education - related trip to China in June 2008 .
Maufas said she believed the district would pay for the costs of the trip , which was sponsored by the Chinese government and the College Board .
The trip would have required authorization by the board or its president because the cost exceeded $ 250 .
Maufas , 46 , who was elected to the board in November 2006 , has served as board president since January .
School board members serve on a part - time basis and receive $ 500 per month for the position .
Maufas agreed to a 35 - minute phone interview to answer questions regarding her spending patterns .
At the end of the interview , Maufas requested that further questions be sent in writing via e-mail .
She later declined to answer the inquiries related to her tipping patterns and unexplained expenses .
" ( I'm ) looking ahead at my schedule for the next few months and suggest you move on ahead with what you have already , " she said in an e-mail in response to the additional questions .
Explanations lacking
Use of district credit cards operates largely on the honor system , with board members submitting receipts to explain the expenditure .
Maufas ' receipts gave only general explanations , often stating that her district - related expenses resulted simply from a meeting or from a meeting with a teacher , constituent or staff member , none of whom was identified .
Sometimes the receipts only included a topic that was discussed , like " SFUSD Schl programs " or " JROTC , " referring to the district 's Junior Reserve Officers ' Training Corps .
" I absolutely , absolutely believe people should meet with me in confidence and tell me things they would not tell any other person , " Maufas said .
" If it 's valid , in the district interest , and it serves that purpose and we gain from that , I think it 's appropriate and I think people understand that . "
Records show Maufas frequently met at Starbucks , with more than $ 300 spent at the chain for business purposes .
Receipts show many of the meetings were conducted at the Divisadero Street Starbucks near UCSF , where she worked at the time .
Times of the meetings ranged from early morning to midafternoon and those she met with typically were not identified .
She said her job at UCSF as a program director for the National Center of Excellence in Women 's Health allowed her flexibility to conduct district business during the workday .
She otherwise declined to address the spending .
Average tip : 27 percent
Maufas refused to discuss the inflated gratuities that were charged to taxpayers .
They include a $ 20 tip on a $ 50 cab ride in April 2008 ; a $ 20 tip on a $ 60 meal in December ; and a $ 10 tip on a $ 24 meal in June .
Her average tip over the 16 - month period was about 27 percent , compared with an average 17 percent tip paid by other board members .
Three other board members currently have a district credit card including Jane Kim , Hydra Mendoza and Jill Wynns .
Board members Sandra Fewer , Rachel Norton and Norman
Yee turned down the credit cards and seek reimbursement for district expenses .
During the same 16 - month period , credit card records show Mendoza charged $ 66 in personal expenses , Kim had $ 310 in personal use and Sanchez had $ 564.32 in personal charges , most of that a $ 481 meal at Morton 's The Steakhousewith Garcia and others .
Like Maufas , they reimbursed the district for the expenses .
Tightening the rules
Garcia said the district now has much stricter policies governing the use of its credit cards , including banning personal use and a requirement that board members and administrators include detailed explanations for all expenses , including the purpose and anyone who was present .
" I suspended the use of all the credit cards until we had some really tight guidelines , " he said .
" We 're going to stay very much on top of this .
" We work for the public .
I think it 's important for us to be transparent . "
Maufas said the credit cards have allowed her to conduct district business without waiting for reimbursement .
" You do n't have to be independently wealthy to serve on this board , " she said .
" You should n't have to be . "

For the first time since for more than 6 months the new deal on climate change is being discussed , Bulgaria officially announced that it is preparing for the agreement .
This will happen today during the session of the European Affairs Council , which under the auspices of the government .
It is expected the members of the Council to discuss the results of the exchange of opinions among the Eu member states , as well as the future actions .
You could read more about the position of Bulgaria in the links right of this article .
And although there are less than 4 months to the Copenhagen conference , still there is no clarity neither on the parametres of the deal , nor on which countries will sign the agreement .
At their meeting on Friday the finance minister of the G20 - the group of the developed and developing countries , could not reach consensus about how the basic measures in the new climate change agreement will be financed .
According to Reuters , the differenced between the rich and the developing countries are still too big .
The issue will dominate the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , USA on the 24th and the 25th of September .
In the meantime , the US have undertaken bilateral policy .
It is expected in November the president Barack Obama to visit Beijing to conclude a bilateral agreement with China .
China and the US produce together 40 % of the greenhouse gasses in the world .
The Republican Party has ramped up its opposition to Federal Communications Commission proposals to enact tough net neutrality rules with a call for the agency to conduct a " market analysis " of the broadband landscape before going any further .
Representative Cliff Stearns of Florida , who asked for the study on Monday , was not shy about telling the FCC what he thinks it should conclude .
" At first glance , net neutrality regulations may appear reasonable and harmless , but , a deeper examination reveals that net neutrality is neither reasonable nor harmless , " he warned .
" These mandates would harm consumers , reduce competition , and discourage new investment and innovation at a time of tremendous technological growth . "
Stearns is the top Republican on the House Commerce Committee 's Communications , Technology and the Internet Subcommittee .
FCC Chair Julius Genachowski says he wants the Commission to beef up its " Four Freedoms " Internet Policy Statement with two more provisions : a plain thou - shalt - not against device discrimination on the ' Net and a transparency principle — ISPs must inform subscribers about their network management practices .
The FCC plans to launch a rulemaking on the matter in a little over two weeks .
But Stearns says that before any of this goes through , he wants an agency probe of the Internet market showing that there 's a " failure " requiring it .
" The FCC bears the responsibility to prove a market failure , especially since its 2002 , 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 decisions on cable modem service , digital subscriber line service , broadband over power line service , and wireless broadband service were predicated on the notion that the broadband market nationwide is competitive and that regulation is unwarranted . "
The FCC 's cable modem decision , which deregulated the cable ISP services , was not supported by the agency 's then - Democratic minority , now the majority at the FCC .
The letter did concede that such an FCC study might conclude that regulation is still necessary , but if it does , " the intervention should be tailored to your analysis and should be the minimum required to prevent the practices you have identified as appropriate targets of regulation , " Stearns told Genachowski .
Surprised and disappointed
The missive , signed by 20 House Republicans , followed a statement sent to President Obama on Friday by House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) and Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia .
Those two told the White House that given the state of the economy , they were " extremely surprised and disappointed " that the FCC plans to go through with enacting net neutrality rules ( they can't have been too surprised ; net neutrality was part of Obama 's campaign platform ) .
" We believe that network neutrality regulations would actually thwart further broadband investment and availability , and that a well - reasoned broadband plan would confirm our view , " Boehner and Cantor concluded .
And that commentary was proceeded by the efforts of seven Republicans in the Senate to whack net neutrality via an amendment to a Department of Interior appropriations bill .
Kay Bailey Hutchison 's ( R - TX ) rider would have forbidden the FCC to spend any money to " implement any Internet neutrality or network management principles " or " to promulgate any rules relating to such principles . "
It appears that the Senate never voted on the proposal .
The reform group Public Knowledge sent us a response to the Stearns letter , dismissing his investment concerns as a " delaying tactic . "
" Billions of dollars were invested in the Internet ecosystem , not only by carriers , but by companies doing business on the Internet , and by consumers subscribing to Internet services , " declared PK's Gigi B. Sohn .
" That is the investment we seek to expand .
There is nothing in banning discrimination on the basis of source , ownership or destination of bits would create lower speeds or raise prices .
Those are simply distractions . "
The road ahead
You can expect plenty of this kind of back - and - forth as the FCC 's net neutrality proceeding gets underway .
Here 's a quick tutorial and time - line on what should happen next .
The Commission has announced that it will launch a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking " on policies to preserve the free and open Internet " at its next Open Commission meeting scheduled for Thursday , October 22 .
Once that NOPR gets published in the Federal Register , the agency will solicit , first , formal comments on the proposal , and then replies to the comments .
Then , after some period of deliberation , if a simple majority of three out of five Commissioners agree on the need for new rules , they 'll ask the FCC 's staff to write up a Report and Order , which the majority will vote for at a subsequent Open Commission gathering .
We'd be surprised if the FCC's Republicans — Robert M. McDowell and Meredith Attwell Baker — go with Genachowski's proposals , but you never know .
It does n't appear likely that Republicans can stop this process on Capitol Hill — although additional letters and statements will doubtless follow it with regularity .
But it 's quite possible that the telcos and / or their allies will sue the FCC in some federal district court once a decision is made .
Speaking of lawsuits , what the DC Circuit Court of Appeals decides about Comcast 's action against the FCC's Order sanctioning it for BitTorrent throttling could also have an impact on this proceeding , especially if DC rules during the NOPR process .
Even if the court does n't , the various third - party briefs being sent to the judges , such as the latest from Professors Lawrence Lessig , Tim Wu , and others defending the FCC 's authority to act , will certainly influence this discussion on a " going forward basis , " as the policy wonks like to say .

IncGamers were invited once more to Blizzard HQ for a chat with the devs and a sneak peek on the progress of StarCraft II development .
Blizzard naturally did not want us to cover multiplayer again , and gave us a very interesting look at the new single player mode and missions .
We have many new single player screenshots , new single player gameplay footage and a very thorough preview ( released tomorrow ) in addition to this interview where we talk to lead designer Dustin Browder , VP of creative development Chris Metzen and VP of game design Rob Pardo .
What ’s so exciting about StarCraft II ’s single player ?
“ Well , I think the biggest thing for us is the ability for you to choose missions as opposed to on a single rail right and the ability tocustomize your technology , ” Browder said to us .
He thinks “ those two things are the biggest things that allow the players to have a different gameplay experience then a lot of other RTS ’es have given in the past . ”
In terms of single player aspects of RTS games , they are usually pretty linear and StarCraft II will try and change that .
He said games that take you “ straight on a rail ” can be fun , “ but its on a rail . ”
With the added options for players , you can also choose just how much of the story and the universe you want to take part of .
It “ allows the players that are really fanatical about the lore to get very deep into the story , ” while at the same time giving gamers that just want to play the missions “ the service level information and move on . ”
“ It was more of a reaction to WarCraft III , honestly ” Metzen , the loremaster of Blizzard , told us .
WarCraft III and its expansion features a story that is very much embedded into the missions .
It has alot of content , but also a completely linear progression .
“ So we took a few steps back looking as we built StarCraft II , ” he said .
“ We identified pretty early that we wanted the feel different . ”
With a system where a player choose his own story “ route ” , it ’s important that their context is not as immersed in the story .
“ We wanted the mission dynamics , the mission objectives and the amount of story happening to feel distinctly different from WarCraft III , ” which is why the team built the Story Mode .
Compared to StarCraft I and WarCraft III , Dustin thinks the big difference is the ingame cutscenes “ to get a lot of details of the story we could n’t have done back in the day . ”
The technology did n’t exist back then “ you either had to do a full pre-render or you had to do an ‘ in - mission cutscene ’ which did n’t look very good , ” and was pretty limited .
“ There is a lot of background and a lot of action which we can see in these characters because we can do these ingame cutscenes .
It gives us a lot more freedom to tell a lot more story then we ever could before . ”
So , how will the missions work in StarCraft II ?
Browder said “ I think I am most happy with the diversity of missions ” .
All “ - Craft ” games [ WarCraft , StarCraft ] have had great diversity , but the team “ makes sure that each mission is its own little mini game ” in StarCraft II where each mission is unique .
Browder said “ each one of these mission could be a mechanic for a whole game but we make it just for one mission . ”
[ Browder is quite excited talking about the game , talking really fast , waving his hands ] .
“ We ’ve got missions on lava worlds where you ’re fighting against rising lava all the time ; we ’ve got missions where you ’re stealing relics from Protoss ; we ’ve got hold - outs against the Zerg . ”
When picking missions , Blizzard do n’t want players to just pick between what race they should play : “ Each mission should feel like its own custom experience , ” according to Browder , “ that really gives you a chance to try out some new mechanics and play a crazy little mini - game each time you sit down to play a mission . ”
There will always be “ something that keeps you on your toes and keeps you thinking creatively and thinking differently when you come to each mission . ”
Our dear lead designer said the game is currently about 30 missions , which might change a little before release .
19 or 20 of those as part of the “ critical path ” of the story , but “ that will also grow or shrink as we get closer to shipping and make more decisions . ”
“ But we have a Battle Report screen I think is enabled in the build you are playing right now , ” he told us .
It ’s a console on the Bridge in Story Mode “ where you can see a whole list of the movies you have seen and a list of missions that you have played so you can play them at will .
If you choose A we also put B in that list for you . ”
If you play these missions , they will not affect your continuity , but are there if you are curious of what happened in the other mission .
“ So you do n’t have to do like some “ save game shenanigans , ” where you save , choose , play , load , ” he said .
The campaign is very individual , and because of this “ there is no co-op campaign . ”
For the completionist who want to play all missions in their own continuity , “ you could do it if you play the whole game twice and see everything , ” Dustin said , but most will likely just use the Battle Report console .
What was your thoughts behind the start of the campaign ?
“ It ’s a funky start right ? ” Metzen asked back .
“ It ’s a strange thing .
We ’ve always wanted to construct something that was n’t [ a ] typical video game intro , ” he said .
“ I wanted you to get a slow start in these characters . ”
Blizzard did n’t want this story line to be “ the same old same old thing , ” but as a top industry game developer expectations are always high , and it ’sa fine line between doing somethign different and disappointing the fans who just want to blow things up .
Action components are very much needed .
In either way Metzen told us “ it ’s an experiment to start of a little slower .
It has been interesting to see the reactions .
A strange experiment , so we are still kind of : “ Whoo , please work ! ” , you know ?
But it has been a lot of fun . ”
So , what is this Story Mode then ?
The Story Mode in StarCraft II is there to “ pull a lot of character interactions out of the map experience and put them in their own space , ” according to Metzen who said the team wanted the game to have a bit of own sense of self : its own vibe .
The intent from Blizzard is to give the space RTS “ a little bit more retro than WarCraft III ” , which basically was a RPG in the shape of an RTS .
“ It ’s a little more like adventure gaming to a degree , ” he told us .
” It ’s a little more ambient .
You can click on objects and get information about the characters , the history , without it being this linear gameplay in front of you . ”
Blizzard wanted to build a very different world that was attractive to the team .
“ So we are stilltrying to nail it in and figure it out . ”
The story mode in Wings of Liberty is either in a small bar on the desert planet Mar Sara ( for the first three missions ) , or the interior of the massive spaceship Hyperion .
This is “ where you come in between missions to interact with characters , buy different technologies and make some choices about which mission you might want to take next , ” Browder explained .
“ One of the critical components of this space is that you can click on all of these characters and have conversations with these characters and learn a lot more about the StarCraft universe . ”
The original plans was for the Star Map on the Bridge of Hyperion to work as an encyclopaedia for all things related to StarCraft , but Blizzard is “ doing a whole different UI for the planets , ” according to Dustin .
Metzen explained the team “ wanted the interface to be as clean as possible , ” and the team “ pulled a little bit more away from the grinding ‘ Encyclopedia Galactica ’ idea .
It just did n’t take the shape that we were anticipating . ”
Blizzard feel “ less is more ” in this instance and the game “ still got alot of lore based on the planets and their histories and their unique environments , ” according to Metzen .
“ There ’s some data there that gives you a sense of the context of each planet . ”
Dustin also mentioned the interiors of Hyperion is full of people and objects to interact with for more background information .
Browder gave us a quick mention of all the Hyperion locations : “ Now one of the first places you are probably going to go to when you come back to story mode from a mission is going to be the Armory .
What you can do in the Armory is you can purchase different types of technologies to upgrade your units .
“ Another place the players will often go to is the Cantina .
In the Cantina there is lots of stuff you can do .
This is a kind of storycentred kind of place .
On of the most important things about this placeis this TV screen which gives you news reports .
You can also come in here and buy mercenaries .
“ Another location on the Hyperion that you might be visiting pretty frequently is the Lab .
You can come here and see how your research is progressing .
So you go out and you ’ll look for alien organisms that you have to find and collect .
Once you find enough of them you ’ll unlock an upgrade .
“ So once you ’re done with the Lab , the last place you ’re probably goingto go to is the Bridge .
In the bridge we ’ve got access to our mission selection .
From here you can choose which kind of mission you want to do next .
Between the Armory and this , this is the heart and soul of our story mode environment . ”
There is currently no way to undo tech choices , respecs if you will , and the team is currently discussing it .
“ There is all kinds of reason not to do respeccing , ” Browder told us .
He do n’t want players feel they have to “ respec ” for every mission , but “ at the same time , if you actually make a mistake you may want to get rid of it .
So there is not a clear answer as to which way is better . ”
The team is looking for somesort of clear answer .
“ So once we figure it out , we will go with it , but we are still debating it . ” {PAGE TITLE=StarCraft II Developers Talk Single Player – Page 2}
Can I choose any mission , and will that exclude other ones ?
“ We ’re not locking out a lot of missions for you , ” Dustin told us .
“ For the most part , you can come back and absolutely choose to do any mission you ’ve skipped over in the past . ”
The only crux would be a player coming back to a very old mission might find it no longer give comparatively good rewards for the new ones that are open .
In addition , there are a few places where Blizzard does ask you to make a choice .
Dustin explained “ a couple of characters will come up and they ’ll say , ‘ Hey , help me ! ’ , ‘ No , the heck with him , help me !’
And you ’ve got to make a choice about which one to help . ”
It will only happen between two to four times in the entire game , however .
“ For the most part you can come back and do any of these missions at any point down the road . ”
Blizzard have not emphasised urgency on the missions .
“ Like a quest in WoW will say ‘ Oh my god , we ’re being attacked !
[ high pitched tone ]
Any time you want to show up will be cool ’. ”
Even though the NPC is in peril “ she will wait , just like a quest in WoW will wait for you ” .
It ’s still a strategy game and Blizzard want “ to preserve that choice ” according to Browder .
The team is not making 50 or 60 missions just to be able to exclude them by player choice , since the development of one map “ is about a three or four month endeavour to build . ”
What about those mercenaries , are heroes no longer in maps ?
“ One of the things we really loved about WarCraft 3 are hero units , ” Browder explained .
“ We still have some hero units in StarCraft 2 , like Jim Raynor and Tychus , they are on maps , but they only really exist on maps where it is appropriate for them to be . ”
He explained the “ heroes really need to be on a map that is designed for them in order to be usable and visible on the battlefield so they do n’t get killed by some random thing that you did n’t even notice . ”
He mentioned the original StarCraft heroes saying “ we did have some heroes in the original StarCraft and they spent a lot of time in the back of bases .
Kinda hanging out and hoping not to get killed . ”
The team really feels like ” if you have got to hide Raynor in the back of your base it ’s not cool . ”
Metzen added “ if you do have a hero on a map he has got to live , you know ? ”
He did n’t remember the exact way it works in all maps , but “ it ’s about that simple . ”
He also said there could be an alternative , allowing “ a gimmick : instead of letting him just blow up and die he takes a knee , he ’s hurt , and you got to get a Medic there to get him back on his feet . ”
Blizzard is trying “ to fade away from the hero - based mechanics , ” according to Metzen , “ but there is a few of them there that are really cool .
Dungeon robbing type scenarios are pretty cool . ”
“ They need to be on a map where there is only a handful of guys , ” Browder added .
“ They got their buddies and they gotta go and kill the bad guys .
If there is a commando raid and you break into a Dominion Labor taking nuclear weapons deep under an infested world to blow up a hive .
Then Raynor and Tychus will show up with their armour and weapons to really deal some rough justice to the enemy . ”
The team really liked hero units in WarCraft III , however , and they still “ wanted to have some elite units that could appear on any map and you would n’t care if they got killed . ”
These are special forces type units who can take a beating as well as deal “ terrible terrible damage ” to the opponents .
“ And if they get killed its cool , you do n’t care .
It ’s fine , you can get more mercenaries back in the next mission . ”
It ’s just that you have access to the cavalry , just purchasing their services from the Cantina on Hyperion .
They do not grow between missions if they survive .
Browder explain that “ if we put in a reward where they got a benefit from a grow then in many cases I think you feel obligated to make sure that they survive .
StarCraft is a blood and guts kind of game .
Units live and die all the time and as a hard - bitten Commander of a StarCraft universe we want you to be comfortable with that . ”
They can get brutally killed and “ it ’s totally cool just to move on . ”
Hero characters in StarCraft II will not be able to carry items like in WarCraft III , but Blizzard has added the ability to put in items for mod makers , “ but it ’s not something we typically use in StarCraft environment ” according to Browder .
“ They are not around often enough for you to collect a lot of items , but we are working on the interface having the UI available for people who want to make mods because we know there is a huge tradition of mods from WarCraft III that are dependent upon that interface ”
Will StarCraft II feature Achievements ?
“ We do have some achievements that you can use to show off to your friends , ” Browder told us , explaining “ not all the interface is in yet [ but ] that will be one measure of success in a mission . ”
There are plenty of achievements in single player mode , but “ if you want access to achievements and your friends lists and all the good stuff that comes with it then you have to be connected . ”
The current Achievement count is about two to four per mission , and Browder did say “ it might be a little bit much but we are still looking at the details on how we want to implement that . ”
On Hyperion ’s Bridge , the Battle Report console is made just for this .
” We play them for Achievement points , that primary reason why we play those missions , ” Dustin explained .
The main difference between difficulty modes , besides the actual difficulty , is what Achievements a player can complete .
For instance , ” in some missions there is like a timer element that ’s going to be MUCH faster on a hard or insane level then it is on normal , ” Dustin told us , and this also affects how hard it is to finish cerain Achievements .
So , will Battle .
net be completely free to play , or have fees / microtransactions ?
Pardo answered the question by saying Blizzard is still finalizing that .
He said : “ I know the big question out there is : ‘is there going to be a subscription to Battle . net or anything like that ’ , and we ’re certainly not doing that for StarCraft 2 . ”
Blizzard ’s approach on business model for a game is to do ‘ what ’s right for the game ’ . ”
Monthly fees on World of WarCraft might be a hit , but not necessarily so for StarCraft II “ because it ’s an entirely different sort of a game . ”
More information will be released in the future .
“ I do n’t want to put the scare out there that it ’s somehow subscription based because we ’re not gonna do that , ” he clarified even further .
Battle.net might possibly have smaller “ microtransactions ” , however , as “ value - added services . ”
Pardo did not give any examples on how this could work on Battle.net , only referring to WoW ’s character name changes and the like .
What are your plans to combat piracy , and is excluding LAN mode going to help ?
This has not really been a big issue in the past , but the discussion of excluded LAN mode has brought it up again .
However , Pardo assured us “ piracy really historically has not been that big of deal for [ Blizzard ] . ”
He said there has been a few examples , but “ for the most part we can shut down those services . ”
Dustin also said “ I think the most powerful solution for piracy is to try to create a compelling experience so people do n’t want to go elsewhere .
That is ultimately our best weapon . ”
There will always besome hacker who manages to crack software , and Blizzard is instead focusing on “ trying to make the experience so strong that players really want to come to [ Battle. net ] to get that experience . ”
“ Even if those services exist , ” Pardo explained , “ I do n’t think there is any way they are gonna compare with the sort of features that we are going to build in our version of Battle . net . ”
He mentioned World of WarCraft , and the fact there are pirate servers for it right now .
“ You can do your own setup servers and gear emulation technology but it ’s just not going to be as good . ”
Beside the actual content , there would just not be enough players on the pirate services to reach “ critical mass ” , making people rather logon to Battle .
net where there will be plenty of players to meet your skill level .
“ So there is a lot of things that Battle . net have going for it and I ’m just not overly concerned about the small amount of piracy that I think will exist within StarCraft II , ” Pardo finished .
A level of “ DRM ” will also be used by limit installation .
Dustin explained “ you need to connect once to install the game . ”
While singleplayer will be available offline , installation must have an internet connection in order to proceed .
You are also required to have or signup for a Battle .
net account in order to install the game .
All achievements and friends lists etc will be available as soon as you logon , but the actual single player game is available anyway .
“ You can [ play single player offline ] , but we do n’t encourage it . ”
Browder said .
“ We totally allow it if you want to do it , ” but the point is “ you do n’t get access a lot of the stuff . ”
This is not the way they think of LAN mode , however .
At the time of the interview , 80.000 fans had signed an online petition to convince Blizzard to include it .
Today that number is 98.000 .
Since LAN mode is one of the main reasons for Blizzards “ - Craft ” games ’ [ WarCraft & StarCraft ] popularity , many have speculated what could be behind this decision , and most have attributed it to piracy .
Pardo said it was not , explaining “ I ’m just saying that getting rid of LAN is not getting rid of piracy . ”
Dustin added “ that ’s really not why it was done either . ”
Piracy , he said , is not the motivating factor to remove LAN .
“ The really big reason for looking at this is we ’re trying to create an integrated experience .
When you log into StarCraft you ’re logging into Battle .
Net .
When you sit down to play , when you ’re playing solo play – hopefully – you ’ll play on Battle .
net with us .
You ’ll have access to your friends list [ and ] you ’ll have access to your achievements . ”
He argued that if you add LAN to the equation , players ca n’t get achievements or take part of Battle .
net features , so it feels “ a little bit dumb ” .
There is also a lot of content “ that really comes from Battle .
net that we would have to duplicate again specifically for LAN . ”
For Blizzard “ it was a combination of making a better user experienceand also just trying to get the game done .
These are some of the bigger issues there . ”
While they did not say so specifically , it seems the extra work , and lack of offline achievements are worth it for single player , but not LAN .
They were , however , thinking of not even allowing single player offline at one time .
Pardo said Blizzard “ actually thought about , ‘ well , what if we just go full ahead ’ , ” but decided “ maybe it ’s not quite time for this game . ”
What about downloadable content ( DLC ) ?
Especially for single player ?
Many publishers use DLC as an additional way to promote legal use of their games .
Browder said Blizzard has “ always done multiplayer stuff before , ” and the company has had “ downloadable content since 1996 , 1997 with downloadable maps .
I am sure will continue this with some sort of project like that . ”
He also promised “ a bunch of stuff that I am sure will occur on Battle .
net in terms of feature improvements for the core game itself that will not be quite worthy enough for one of our expansion products , but we want to do it now .
So I am sure there will be stuff in between . ”
Blizzard have also planned “ trial versions and all kinds of stuff , ” according to Browder , but Blizzard “ will do those after release though , like we ’ve kind of done with all the Blizzard games , ” Pardo added .
“ We always do those after release . ”
Flashback
He said that Baxter ’s Ukrainian lab was in fact producing a bioweapon disguised as a vaccine .
Flashback
" Kiev -
The death toll from a swine flu outbreak in Ukraine rose to 34 on Saturday , as the government announced new measures to control the spread of the virus .
Two of the victims were infants , Health Minister Vasyl Kniazevych told Channel 5 television .
As of Saturday morning , the flu was thought still to be limited in to the country 's western provinces , but because of the number of suspected cases , a spread was likely , he said . " " August 21 , 2009 - Today , the MSM are not talking about this case any more .
Yesterday , they wanted us to believe that Joseph Moshe was a nutcase and a terrorist , arrested for threatening to bomb the White House .
Interesting detail about his arrest ( the “ Westwood standoff ” ) was that he seemed to be immune to the 5 cans of tear gas and 5 gallons of law - enforcement grade pepper spray they pumped into his face .
He very calmly remained in his car , as the video footage of his arrest shows .
Professor Moshe had called into a live radio show by Dr. A. True Ott , broadcast on Republic Broadcasting claiming to be a microbiologist who wanted to supply evidence to a States Attorney regarding tainted H1N1 Swine flu vaccines being produced by Baxter BioPharma Solutions .
He claimed that the vaccine contained an adjuvant ( additive ) designed to weaken the immune system , and replicated RNA from the virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic Spanish flu , causing global sickness and mass death .
Sources tell us that Bar - Joseph Moshe made no threat against the President or the White House .
He did not mention any bomb or attack .
He then proceeded to inform the White House he intended to go public with this information .
When he noticed men in suits in front of his house and feared that the FBI was about to detain him , he packed some belongings into his car and , him being a dual Israeli citizen , tried to reach the Israeli consulate located in close proximity to the federal building where the standoff took place .
The FBI and the bomb squad prevented him from reaching it .
Who is this man ?
His profile on biomedexperts.com says he is a plant disease expert with many publications on his name involving the genetic manipulation of virii . " -
MSM story about the incidentSo did this man have something extremely important to disclose or was he a dangerous terrorist who " threatened to bomb the white house " ?
Considering how officials have consistantly lied about terrorist threats we should take all their declarations with a large grain of salt .
The fact of the matter was that he had called into a talk show and then the word came down from above to mount a gigantic operation to aprehend the man .
The " neighbor " in the video above appears to be a plant specifically to bolster the offical version that has Moshe mentally unbalanced , off his " meds " , not to be taken seriously .
Apparently he was immediately sent to Israel .
added - " An apc , at least 50 officers with weapons drawn , streets closed , apartments evacuated , fed building on lockdown , 8 hours plus to remove him from his RED BEETLE , all because he " threatened " the White House ?
From L.A.?
In a red v dub ?
And he took 3 tear gas shells in that tiny car and was hosed with pepper spray ?
And he 's not dead ?
ok ... is it just me ?
Or does anyone else see something wrong with this picture ?
" But what about his assertion that Baxter was deliberately releasing tainted vaccines in Ukraine ?
Take a look at the story at the top .
Then one more little flashback about another Baxter vaccine release : March 3 , 2009 " It could be a Hollywood Worst Case Thriller , but it is real : According to the scientific network PROMED ,
Balloon Boy ’s mom , Mayumi Heene , hired her own lawyer — as a friend described her as a “ slave ” to an abusive husband .
The lawyer , Lee Christian , met with Mayumi yesterday , then attempted to downplay speculation that her client is about to sell out her reality TV - obsessed hubby Richard Heene .
“ I do n’t do divorces , ” Christian told The Post .
“ I do criminal defense . ”
Mayumi , 45 , and Richard , 48 , duped the world into believing their six - year - old son Falcon was floating away on a homemade balloon .
Probers believe the couple , featured on the ABC show “ Wife Swap , ” hatched the bizarre plot to score their own reality series .
They are expected to be hit with felony conspiracy charges next week as the Federal Aviation Administration weighs civil penalties that up to $ 2 million .
Mayumi has displayed a tough persona on TV .
But her pal , Barbara Slusser , told ABC , “ Whatever [ her husband ] says , goes .
She ’s basically a slave .
He kept her isolated and separated from everyone else . ”
If you were lucky enough to be in attendance last Monday for Barley 's Beer School you may have heard that the third installment of the Beer School series will feature guest speakers Steven Pauwels and Jean - Marie Rock .
Pauwels , of course , is the Brewmaster at Boulevard and Rock is his counterpart at a Trappist Brewery at the Orval Monastery in Belgium .
Pauwels seems like an obvious choice as a speaker since it 's just a twenty minute drive to Barley 's for him , but Jean - Marie Rock has a bit more of a commute .
You might be asking yourself , " Man , Belgium seems so awesome ... why would this guy leave Orval to come teach Midwesterners about beer ?
Ain't it against a Monk 's religion to fly in an airplane anyways ? "
Well , for starters you 're thinking of the Amish and they do n't really drink beer .
Secondly , it sounds like this visit is a dual purpose one ...
KC Hop Head , who was at the last Beer School event , says that Rock and Pauwels are collaborating on a new beer that will carry a Boulevard label when it 's finished .
Now you might be wondering why the Brewmaster of a world renowned brewery like Orval would choose Boulevard to collaborate with .
Well , one reason is that Boulevard makes solid beers .
Their Belgian style beers , like Two Jokers and Sixth Glass , are particularly good .
This is due , in no small part , to Pauwels who came to Boulevard from Belgium about a decade ago .
Apart from the obvious parallels here , you can imagine the Monks back in Orval probably are n't particularly keen on innovation , so it would make sense for Rock to look elsewhere if he were interested in trying something new , and who better to team up with but a fellow Belgian ?
So , if KC Hop Head is to be believed , it sounds like we 'll be seeing at least one new Orval inspired Boulevard beer in the not too distant future .
On the other hand the entire thing could fall apart and all we get is yet another Saison release .
Either way , I hope I 've whetted your appetite for a Boulevard / Orval collaboration beer .
Personally , I 'm hoping for an Oud Bruin sour brown ale and I 'm dubbing this Project Boulorvald .
Catchy is n't it ?
Anyway , mark your calendar for October , 26th - that 's when part three of Barley 's Beer School will be held .
Hopefully there will be more info in the meantime .
Self - identified " atheist rapper " Charlie Check ’m is relatively new on the scene .
I was first introduced to him through a few self - promoting e-mails he sent in February announcing a " Hot New Atheist Performer " :
Hi , I ’m informing you about a hot new Atheist rapper who has music that has the potential to crossover to the mainstream media …
This is a Good way to turn Atheists views into " cool " views .
I ’m informing you because if you know of any Atheist friendly radio shows , tv shows , magazines , newsletters , or ect .
I would like to be a guess and tell a story and have a few songs played or even perform if it ’s a tv show or if it ’s magazines or newletters , I would like an article about the music .
… I need as much as support I can get from Atheist organizations .
The purpose of my music is to promote Atheist views and improve the image of Atheists
I did a quick YouTube search and found the song " Roll with an Atheist " — it sounded like interesting stuff , not as skilled as some music out there , but decent nonetheless .
I sent a friend request on Facebook to stay on top of news .
That ’s all I thought about it , until last week .
At some point I saw an update from Charlie on my Facebook wall that said ,
Advantages of being homophobic : Befriending faggots is possibly inviting uninvited come ons .
Homophobia scares off dykes and faggots .
Some dykes and faggots prey on straight people .
Gay friendly straight people are homos main targets .
Why invite uninvited come ons ?
Huh , I thought .
Maybe I read that wrong .
But a couple of days later , I saw another status update from Charlie : " new song " NO GAY MARRIAGE " " .
That ’s when I decided a little more investigation might prove worthwhile .
Well , I checked out his main website and listened to a few song snippets .
Besides the aforementioned song titled " No Gay Marriage " ( which begins with the lines " Something ’s wrong with your brain , why wo n’t you just admit that something ’s wrong with your brain … " ) , there are songs called " Christian and a Homo " and " Dyke Chick " .
I wo n’t go into detail at the moment about my opinion of the viewpoint expressed in these songs .
Let ’s say for now that I strongly disagree with the message .
But now I was faced with a dilemma .
Should I defriend Charlie on Facebook , since I did n’t want it to be implied that I support his views in any way , or should I maintain the weak Facebook relationship we have because it ’s at least worthwhile to keep tabs on his postings ?
I decided to throw the question out publicly to my Facebook friends along with a link to Charlie ’s site .
The response was quick and passionate .
This one sums up the views pretty well : " Wow .
I would drop - kick this clown off my list so fast ….. "
One person alerted me to the fact that Charlie Check ’m had already been banned from the social networking site Atheist Nexus , " [ not ] for his views ( as atrocious as they are ) but rather for the hateful way in which they were expressed and related troll - like behavior . "
( More on this below . )
That could ’ve been the end of it , but I had n’t yet defriended Charlie on Facebook .
And at some point he decided to chime in with a response to the comments :
I ’m bored so I think Ill just fuck with you faggots for a while .
Homophobia scares off faggots and dykes which is a good thing .
It doesnt matter if I ’m really a homophobe or not .
What ’s important is that faggots and dykes think I am .
I do n’t want to worry about a faggot pretending to be my friend when he secretely just wants to suck my dick .
I want to make sure my friends are TRUE friends and not horney ass faggots .
It ’s simply inappropriate … I just do n’t have much in common with faggots .
Faggots think about sticking their dicks in men shit holes and I think about sexy women .
I talk about women a lot and I know faggots would n’t be interested in that .
A later comment :
but I can appeal to lots of Christians who are smart enough to know a MALE IS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A MALE’S BRAIN .
So you faggot and dyke atheists are suppose to be smart but you do n’t even know that penises and shit holes do n’t go together …
Now that ’s some nasty ass shit .
So Pro-faggot Atheists can see that God believers are delusional but they ca n’t see a dyke bitch is crazy when a dyke bitch claims to not like men but finds a woman who DRESSES LIKE A MAN , TALKS LIKE A MAN , WALKS LIKE A MAN , EVEN WEARS A FUCKIN STRAPPED ON FAKE DICK TO TRY AND TO BE A MAN .
I ’m a strong Atheist and dykes and faggots are crazier than God believers .
I ’ll spare you the further comments .
I mentioned that Charlie had been banned from Atheist Nexus already .
According to an article on examiner.com , he had also been invited to perform at an Atheist Nexus - sponsored " Live Dance Party " at the Atheist Alliance International convention in October , but the invitation to perform was revoked .
The article reports Brother Richard of Atheist Nexus saying , " While he is free to hold whatever views he chooses , he cannot represent Nexus in any form … While most of his statements were simply ignorant and prejudiced , there were a few that were clearly bigoted and hateful .
Even when others tried to show him the error of his ways , he ignored their points and became even more repugnant . "
That same article says that Charlie responded on MySpace with the following :
I ’m an Atheist rapper / activist .
The pro-gay Atheist members at Atheist Nexus know this and they KNOW my music is good for Atheists and they KNOW I fight for Atheist BUT THEY DON ’T CARE .
If they do n’t care about the fight for Atheists , they do n’t care about atheism .
They only care about their gay agenda .
Which brings me to the question I asked at the start : Should atheists , and those involved in the " atheist movement " ( which overlaps the humanist , skeptic , freethought , etc. movements ) , be concerned if an avowed advocate for atheism expresses such views ?
Should atheist organizations withhold support , and individual atheists who disagree turn their backs ?
Another question :
If someone does not rely on tradition or religious authority to form ethical views , are there any good reasons ( besides " I find it yucky " ) to be so virulently homophobic ?
I will also follow up on these issues in a future post .
I have pretty strong opinions on this , but I am also curious to see what the readers of this blog think .

I have came across quite many 365 projects and some are really impressive .
There is one more in my favourite list now .
Arielle Nadel is a teenage photographer , and she is trying to use her camera to tell stories of her little Danboard .
Instead of just putting Danboard in front of a background and call it a shot , Arielle manages to present Danboard as a real person who has real emotion .
Follow us and see if Arielle has more stories to tell about herself and the little guy !
Q1 .
Thank you first for taking up the interview .
Could you first introduce yourself a bit to our readers ?
My name is Arielle Nadel and I ’m a teenage photographer .
Currently I am working on my 365 project which is all about Danboard .
Q2 . How did you come up with the idea of making the 365 Days of Danboard ?
I was inspired by other toy 365 series on Flickr and when I ordered my Danbo , I knew I wanted to do a project on it .
Q3 .
How do you manage to make your every picture of Danbo different and creative ?
Do you have a idea in your head of what to do next or just let it be and make use of whatever you come across ?
For my Danbo pictures , I try to make Danbo look alive .
I try to avoid just putting Danbo with an object and call it a picture .
I always want to bring emotion and character to my pictures .
Occasionally I have an idea in my mind , but mostly I just make use of what I have .
Q4 .
What do you think is the hardest part in the whole process ?
And the most interesting part ?
The hardest part is getting Danbo in the right position and make my photos look like I caught Danbo in action .
The most interesting part is working with one expression .
I love the challenge of having this simple blank face and I know it can be transformed into something more .
Q5 .
What camera do you use ?
Great composition and nice use of light we can see in your shots .
Do you have any tips for our readers on photography skills ?
I use a Canon Rebel XSi .
Always be happy with your photograph .
Never base it on the viewer and be proud that you took that photo .
Q6 .
Do you have any other future project plan want to share with our reader ?
I ’m thinking of doing another 365 series of self portraits a month or two after my Danbo series .
I ’m not in front of the camera a lot and I want to do something new for myself .
For now it ’s just an idea and I know my thought on it will change in the future .
( Natural News )
More than 2 percent of all hospital patients are victims of a medical error , according to a study conducted by the health care ratings organization HealthGrades .
Researchers reviewed a Medicare database to evaluate almost 5,000 hospitals across the United States for their performance on 12 different measures of patient safety between the years of 2005 and 2007 .
They found records of a total of 913,000 " patient safety events , " meaning errors that led to medical problems .
This came out to 2.3 percent of Medicare admissions at those hospitals .
Put another way , it translates to an error once every 1.7 minutes among Medicare patients alone .
Patients who were victims of a medical error had a 10 percent chance of dying , the researchers found .
According to lead researcher and orthopedic surgeon Rick May , the actual prevalence of errors is probably twice as high , since roughly half of medical errors go unreported .
The most common errors were bed sores , postoperative respiratory failure or serious infection , and death from serious but treatable complications among surgical inpatients .
" The good news is that there are hospitals that are doing an amazing job when it comes to patient safety , " May said .
" Patients need to know that they have a substantially lower risk of experiencing a medical error and therefore a lower risk of death or complications when they are admitted to one of these exceptional top - performing hospitals .
"
The study found that the risk of medical error was 43 percent lower at award - winning hospitals than at bottom - ranked hospitals .
" This finding of better performance was consistent across all 12 patient safety indicators studied , " the researchers wrote .
According to May , the administrators of many hospitals have no idea where their institutions rank , because error rates are never reported to them .
" For decades , their system has been set up not to report medical mistakes , " he said , " so you really have to dig .

Ayn Rand wrote , " when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self - sacrifice - you may know that your society is doomed . "
America is not doomed , but the fellows in Washington are pushing for that outcome .
It seems that all the characters that encouraged this financial crisis are being rewarded , and Ben Bernanke 's re-nomination is no exception to this rule .
He was on the Board of Governors when Alan Greenspan grew our bubble economy .
Known as ' Helicopter Ben , ' Bernanke was the most vocal supporter of low interest rates to combat the bogus threat of deflation , even if it meant dropping cash from helicopters .
He succeeded in his aim � as it is hard for prices to decline while the money supply is growing by double digits .
Of course , much of that new money went into speculative bubbles , first in tech and then real estate .
When the misallocation became too great to ignore , the credit markets froze and leveraged institutions started failing .
Now , Bernanke says that he does n't want to preside over another Great Depression .
That does n't mean he does n't want another Great Depression ; he just does n't want to preside over it .
His plan seems to be continuing to print money so that the depression is n't apparent until after he leaves office .
However , while Greenspan was able to get out of Dodge , Bernanke will probably not be so lucky , as his reappointment virtually guarantees that he will be in the middle of the action when the bullets start to fly .
Left to clean up his own mess , Bernanke will soon regret not quitting while the going was good .
Bernanke is being praised for avoiding a collapse in the financial system .
While he has forestalled some short - term pain , he has in turn forsaken long - term gain .
The ' green shoots ' that set the pundits alight are nothing more than the direct effects of massive monetary expansion .
What we have is nominal growth in the unproductive service and consumption sectors .
In short , Bernanke is being praised by the drug addicts for not cutting them off .
But the thing about addiction is that the longer you stay hooked , the more deadly the withdrawal .
What this country needs is a Fed Chairman that is immensely unpopular , backed by a courageous President .
Under Paul Volcker and Ronald Reagan , this model proved effective at avoiding a complete economic collapse in the early 1980's .
In case posterity 's resounding approval has clouded anyone 's memory , Volcker was vilified and threatened with impeachment at the height of that crisis .
Reagan 's decision to stand behind Volcker allowed the Chairman to persevere .
It has never been popular to be responsible .
Only after the markets settled and the country experienced twenty years of prosperity was history 's final judgment made about Volcker .
Greenspan undid the painful sacrifice we made in 1981 .
He grew a bubble in tech stocks and then refused to allow the economy to restructure after it burst , instead inflating a real estate bubble in its stead .
Meanwhile , federal spending ballooned , along with unfunded liabilities and guarantees that distorted the capital markets .
The Fed created moral hazard because the government assumed that any excessive debt would be monetized .
When push came to shove , Bernanke did exactly that , perhaps even hiding his intervention by buying Treasuries through intermediaries .
In doing so , he allowed our elected officials to avoid making the politically costly decisions that would have prepared the country for future growth .
To get a sense of Bernanke 's ultimate legacy , look no further than Argentina .
Though many of the rich and powerful had moved their savings abroad , a currency collapse wiped out the middle class in that historically prosperous country .
Is such an outcome worth the short - term comfort of avoiding the severe but temporary pain of unemployment and mortgage defaults ?
Bernanke 's re-nomination is a politically safe decision for President Obama , and at least Bernanke is a devil we know .
However , this lack of a ' change ' for the better should squash any ' hope ' for a genuine recovery .
If the Bush years were as bad as the Democrats claim , then it is curious that they are mimicking and magnifying the same mistakes .
No one has been held accountable for a financial crisis that the professors , pundits , and politicians told us would not come .
All the same players are running the game , always changing the rules so they stay on top .
Real ' change we can believe in ' would be a return to our roots in the rule of law and a system of sound money � but it's hard to stay grounded when you 're throwing money from helicopters .

A team of academic , government and industry researchers has completed a first draft of the cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) genome .
The project is an important first step in accelerating the pace of research on this subsistence crop and addressing some of the many limitations that face cassava farmers around the world .
Cassava is a root crop that serves as the primary food source for more than 750 million people each day .
Although it has many properties that make it an important food across much of Africa and Asia , it also has many limitations .
Cassava has poor nutritional content and is susceptible to many pathogens , particularly in Africa , where one third of the continental harvest is lost each year to viral diseases .
One of these , Cassava Brown Streak Disease , or CBSD , is currently the major threat to food security in some parts of Eastern Africa .
In response to the urgency of this threat , and building upon the newly available cassava genome sequence , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded a $ 1.3 million grant to University of Arizona researchers who will lead an international consortium to develop a genome variation database that will provide breeding tools to aid farmers in improving cassava , with a special focus on increased resistance to the CBSD virus .
Steve Rounsley , associate professor in the School of Plant Sciences at the UA and a member of the BIO5 Institute , will coordinate the project that includes partners at the Institute for Genome Sciences , University of Maryland , Baltimore , the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( DOE JGI ) , and 454 Life Sciences , a Roche Company .
The impetus for the genome sequence began in 2003 with the formation of The Global Cassava Partnership ( GCP - 21 ) , co-chaired by Dr. Claude Fauquet , director of the International Laboratory for Tropical Agriculture Biology ( ILTAB ) at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center ( DDPSC ) in St. Louis , and Dr. Joe Tohme of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture ( CIAT ) in Cali , Colombia .
This , in turn , led to a 2006 proposal by Fauquet , Tohme and 12 other international scientists to DOE JGI 's Community Sequencing Program , which was selected for a pilot project .
The full genome project gathered momentum in early 2009 when 454 Life Sciences and DOE JGI each pledged the resources to use 454's Genome Sequencer FLX platform with long - read GS FLX Titanium chemistry to rapidly generate the DNA sequence data needed for the project .
" This is a perfect example of how quickly things can happen when everyone is aligned behind an important cause .
Most of the data for the genome were generated within 8 weeks of getting DOE JGI and 454 Life Sciences on board , " said the UA 's Rounsley , who led the collaboration .
More than 61 million sequencing reads were generated and assembled into a draft genome that contains an estimated 95 percent of cassava genes .
It is one of the first large genome projects to primarily use 454 Life Sciences ' long - read sequencing platform , which enabled both improved quality of the draft , and its rapid generation .
" We are pleased to contribute our sequencing technology to this important global initiative , " explained Michael Egholm , Chief Technology Officer and Vice President of Research and Development at 454 Life Sciences .
" This project , along with other recently completed complex plant genome projects , demonstrates that 454 Sequencing systems are rapidly becoming the standard for de novo sequencing and assembly . "
The availability of the genome sequence enables the newly - funded project to study how cassava varieties differ from each other .
" The contributions of 454 Life Sciences and DOE JGI in making the cassava genome a reality have opened a new chapter in cassava research worldwide .
We 're excited about the opportunity for cassava breeders to access new tools for improving a staple African crop , " said Katherine Kahn , program officer with the Agricultural Development initiative at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
Researchers will use next - generation technologies to sample many varieties of cassava and develop a large database of markers that can be used to identify genes involved in many important traits .
The team will collaborate with researchers in Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania in applying these genetic markers toward identifying resistance to Cassava Brown Streak Disease .
All of the information and tools the project develops will be freely available worldwide .
Traditional cassava improvement is slow and difficult .
The availability of large numbers of markers will help make breeding schemes more efficient .
For instance , traits that may only show up in mature plants can be identified in seedlings with a cheap DNA test .
Since cassava is used for industrial starch production , and has potential as a biofuel source , there are commercial applications of these breeding tools .
However , the most important applications will be those that improve the lives of those who depend upon cassava for their daily calorie intake .
" With the first cassava genome in hand , we can cheaply and quickly sequence other varieties that will give us thousands of little signposts - mile markers if you like - that will help us identify key genes for increasing the plant 's resistance to the virus , " Rounsley said .
" By 2050 , 90 percent of humankind will live in developing countries where agriculture is the most important economic activity .
Crops grown by small farmers are central to international food security , health , economic growth , energy needs , poverty reduction and social stability , " Fauquet said .
" The information contained in the cassava genome will provide tremendous opportunities to improve this important crop , bringing it into the mainstream of plant research thereby reducing the time and cost of delivering improved cultivars to farmers who need it most . "
This grant is part of the foundation 's Agricultural Development initiative , which is working with a wide range of partners to provide millions of small farmers in the developing world with tools and opportunities to boost their yields , increase their incomes and build better lives for themselves and their families .
The foundation is working to strengthen the entire agricultural value chain - from seeds and soil to farm management and market access — so that progress against hunger and poverty is sustainable over the long term .
The annotated draft genome sequence is available at DOE JGI 's Phytozome Web site , www.phytozome.net/cassava .

A Florida man has been apprehended by authorities after they say he possessed more than 1,000 images on his computer of children engaged in sexual activity Keith Riley Griffin , 48 , of Jensen Beach , told detectives that his cat was actually the main culprit of the situation .
You see , every time he would leave the room where the computer was his pervy - feline would jump on the keyboard thus creating the disgusting mess .
Upon arriving back to his computer , he would then notice " strange material " , according to a release .
Of course , if this were true , Mr. Griffin has a really smart ( albeit a troubling sick ) cat .
Perhaps the furry demon was just attempting to look for kitty porn instead , something I 'm sure that might sound quite plausible in Mr. Griffin 's weird head .
I actually had a hell of a time confirming the above MySpace profile of Keith Griffin .
I got on his MySpace in seconds , but the pictures he placed in his profile looked quite a lot different from the one provided by the Martin County Sheriff 's Office .
I thought it was the same man , but I most definitely could n't put him up here unless I was certain .
So from going to his MySpace , I jumped on his personal ( kinda ) websites , found here here and here , which lead me to his favorite username , " krg366 " , @ various addresses .
He sometimes uses " keith366 " , but that 's neither here nor there .
That took me nowhere other than a few post he made on several now dead message boards and a few half - filled out profiles scattered about like ghost across the web .
An hour of useless searching later , I came across his profile on match.com .
That set me back even more because his picture also looked nothing like the aforementioned mugshot .
But that also had to have been Mr. Griffin .
I was n't wrong ...
Then it occured me to that the picture on match looked nothing like the one on his MySpace .
The picture on match is a pretty good one , so if it were him ( and it probably was at some point ) why would n't he just stick in on his MySpace ?
Do you see how my mind works people ?
Paranoid , yes ... but at the same time cautious .
get rich selling juice scheme just frustrated the hell out of me even more .
Anyway , reading more and more about his onlinescheme just frustrated the hell out of me even more .
I did come across something completely random though , apparently Mr. Griffin was nearly stabbed to death with a screwdriver in a restroom at a Jensen City Taco Bell earlier in April .
He claims it was him anyway , in the forum portion of the article .
He writes the following :
" I'm the guy he was tring to stab ......!
Whats is ironic about this whole thing is , I work for sears and I was wearing my shirt that says sears on it . "
The Sears part helped a bit , because Keith Riley Griffin was arrested by an officer at his place of employment ( Sears ) on August 5th .
Why be so ashamed to admit being employed by that company just to pass yourself off as " rich " to total strangers though ?
A thought troubling to me .
Of course had my brain been functioning normally at the time , the answer would have been an obvious one :
How could someone who allegedly possessed naked pictures of little kids be honest about anything in the first place ?
I mean really , the guy told an officer that his cat found the images and proceeded to download all 1,000 + pictures individually named I 'm sure too .
Anyway , searching a bit further I found his WAYN here , but that also lead me to nothing of any importance , just more bs .
What I needed was a birthdate , October 2nd 1960 and it was nowhere to be found .
I already had his name , age , location and a picture ( the one 's on his MySpace apparently were taken in 2006 ) .
And then it hit me ... Facebook .
That should have been the second place I could have searched and I usually do .
I guess if you pile yourself up with garbage after garbage kids , it 's really hard to get out without getting lost .
I do it all the time , so I should have known better .
Regardless , using one of his many e-mail addresses , I came up with the username , " Tracker Gryphon " which ultimately led me to Keith Griffin , born October 2nd.
1960 .
So why am I writing all this ?
I have no idea ...
Bond was set at $ 250,000 .
A Soba Noodles Class in Tokyo

My private lesson at the Soba Academy in Tokyo to make these Japanese buckwheat noodles from scratch .
My private lesson at the Soba Academy in Tokyo to make these Japanese buckwheat noodles from scratch .
There is little doubt in my mind that making soba noodles by hand like Japanese chefs is one of the most spectacular cooking skills one can hope to learn in Japan .
Not that I am so fond of these buckwheat noodles myself , I guess one needs to eat them a couple dozen times to start enjoying their delicate taste and brittle texture .
But working with only 20 % wheat content is like a culinary highwire act - there is almost no gluten to save you if you move the dough the wrong way .
We are really dealing with the aristocracy of the noodles here .
Another obvious perk is to work with the beautiful meter - long wooden rolling pin and to be allowed to touch the giant , guillotine - like soba knife .
The technique used by Japanese chefs can be used , with some modifications , to make regular wheat - and - eggs pasta entirely by hand .
As you see , it is much superior than the traditional Italian way .
We arranged for a private class at the Tsukiji Soba Academy , a cookery school not far from Tokyo's wholesale fish market which trains Japanese soba chefs .
The cursus lasts about 30 days and after that alumni go open their own soba - noodles restaurants .
Only about 20 % of soba restaurants make their noodles entirely by hand like you will see here .
Even I could taste the difference with machine made or even , God forbids , bought soba noodles .
The owner is Akila Inouye , a Japanese chef who glows with love of cooking and food .
A very nice man , in 3 hours he demonstrated how to make soba by hand and had us make a complete batch each .
Mr Inouye 's English was terrific and very precise with some deliberate neologisms such as ' You are very good sobatician ' .
Mixing
The traditional Tokyo - style soba noodles have a ratio of 8 parts buckwheat to 2 parts wheat flour , called Nihachi Soba ( 2 - to - 8 soba ) .
You start with the flours in two bowls and three bowls of water for a total of 50 % of the flour 's weight .
We asked chef Inouye what he thought of the beautiful traditional wooden mixing bowl , which I saw in a soba chef shop for 300 a piece .
He just made a sign with his head and one of his two helpers literally jumped in the back to bring him a wooden bowl .
He really commands much respect with his pupils - very impressive !
He thinks stainless steel bowls are just as good and much less costly .
Both flours are sifted in the mixing bowl .
Then you pass your hands on the surface to break it and make it more welcoming to the water .
You would n't want a pool forming in there .
You add the water gradually until the right consistence is achieved .
Unlike what , buckwheat is very fond of water and drinks it readily .
The flour is worked into a ball using highly codified , super efficient gestures .
Then the ball 's creases are all brought on the top and it is flattened until the entire surface is smooth .
This is much smarter and efficient than the way pasta is done in Italy .
Flattening
The dough is gradually flattened with the long rolling pin , rotating it by 30° each time for two complete circles .
The dough needs to be exactly 5 mm thick , which the chef checks with a special plastic gauge ( you bet I bought him a set ! ) .
This part is where the Japanese beat the Italian when it comes to pasta technique ( the Italians catch back later with the sauces ) .
Using a precise technique , the chef transforms a wide circle into a clean rectangle in a series of smooth gestures condoned by tradition .
Now the circle looks like an oval .
It is turned 90° and again rolled around a longer rolling pin , then extended with pressure applied with both hands in the center to stretch the dough diagonally .
Using the short rolling pin , the dough undergoes further flattening until it is nicely rectangular in shape .
I cannot stress enough how superior a rectangular shape is when making most pasta .
You reduce your waste by at least 20 % .
Chef Inuye continues to work his dough until it is 1.5 mm thick ( check the yellow gauge on the left ) .
The dough is so large now that he needs to roll half of it around one of the two long sticks while he works on the other half .

Filmmaker Michael Moore accused American newspapers of “ slitting their own throats ” in a news conference in Toronto on Monday where he was promoting his new film , “ Capitalism : A Love Story . ”
It ’s not the Internet that has killed newspapers , the gadfly documentarian said in a four - minute detour from talking about his film , which rejects capitalism as “ undemocratic . ”
Instead , he said , it ’s corporate greed .
“ These newspapers have slit their own throats , ” he said .
“ Good riddance . ”
Moore said that newspapers , bought up by corporations in the last generation , have pursued profits at the expense of news gathering .
By basing their businesses on advertising over circulation , newspaper owners have neglected their true economic base and core constituency , he said .
He also accused those corporations of supporting Republican candidates , which have discouraged reading and education in measures such as supporting the elimination of the Education Department at the federal level .
And Moore cited newspapers like those in Baltimore or Detroit , his home town , with firing reporters that cover subjects that affect the community .
Ultimately , he said , this was self - defeating .
It would be like GM deciding to discourage people from learning how to drive , he said .
“ It ’s their own greed , their own stupidity , ” he said .
“ It ’s capitalism that taken ( newspapers ) from us . ”
Moore said he tried to include the subject in his new film , but it became too large a topic and instead he may make an entire film about the fall of newspapers .
“ One year or two years from now , ” he predicted , “ we are not going to have daily newspapers . ”

BANGOR , Me. 
For years , the location of this city ’s needle exchange program , in a nondescript strip mall close to highways and bus lines , was seen as a major asset .
But now , AIDS activists say , that very location could undermine what happens inside the exchange .
A bill working its way through Congress would lift a ban of more than 20 years on using federal money for needle exchange programs .
But the bill would also ban federally financed exchanges from being within 1,000 feet of a school , park , library , college , video arcade or any place children might gather  a provision that would apply to a majority of the country ’s approximately 200 exchanges .
“ This 1,000 - foot rule is simply instituting the ban in a different form , ” said Rebecca Haag , executive director of the AIDS Action Council , an advocacy group based in Washington .
“ Clearly the intent of this rule is to nullify the lifting of the ban . ”
Under a separate bill , all exchanges in Washington within the 1,000 - foot perimeter would be barred from receiving city money as well as federal money .
The chief executive of Tesco , Britain 's largest private employer , has issued a warning : are kids dont no nuffink .
Terry Leahy said this week that our educational standards are " woefully low " , and that young recruits to Tesco often have to be taught basic literacy , numeracy and communication skills before they can be unleashed on the aisles or stockrooms .
He 's not alone .
This warning rumbles across the country .
A friend of mine is an academic at a middle - ranking university , and she recently showed me some of her students ' essays .
" It 's quite normal for them not to know how to use paragraphs , or commas , or to be able to spell , " she said , shaking her head .
Some are barely literate , despite a clutch of A - levels .
She found the same at two other universities .
It 's not enough to glibly announce that there 's no problem , as the Government did this week .
Yes , a Chicken Little cry that educational standards are plummeting echoes across every age : one of the oldest tablets ever discovered in an archaeological dig warns that the kids of today are n't what they use to be .
Yes , there are still a lot of good schools .
Yet there are more children getting into Oxbridge every year from the pool of 300 kids at Eton than from the 300,000 kids on free school meals .
Either you believe those Etonians are born smarter – an absurd proposition – or our school system is failing poor children on a vast scale .
How many great minds are we allowing to atrophy just because they were n't born to wealth ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It does n't have to be like this .
A far better system is possible ; we just need to follow the evidence .
And the road - map runs through – of all places – North Carolina .
Something extraordinary has been happening in the state 's schools over the past few decades , and the best guide to this experiment is an important new book by Professor Gerald Grant called Hope and Despair in the American City : Why There Are No Bad Schools in Raleigh .
He looks at two very similar cities – Syracuse in New York State , and Raleigh in North Carolina .
They are both 1950s boomtowns turned to 1980s ghost towns .
It 's the same - old , sad - old story : industry shrivelled and the white middle classes stampeded to the suburbs , leaving behind shell - cities scarred by poverty .
Yet there is today an extraordinary gap between these cities .
In Syracuse , only 25 per cent of 12 - year - olds can read , write or do arithmetic to the appropriate basic level – while in Raleigh , it is 91 per cent .
Almost all of the schools in Syracuse fail ; none of the schools in Raleigh do .
What are they doing differently ?
Raleigh 's governors decided to do something bold and unconventional : they looked to the scientific evidence .
In 1966 , Professor James Coleman was commissioned by the White House to conduct the largest study , to that time , of what makes good pupils succeed and bad pupils fail .
After years of on - the - ground analysis , he came up with something nobody expected .
He found that the single biggest factor determining whether you do well at school or not is n't your parents , your teachers , your school buildings or your genes .
It was , overwhelmingly , the other kids sitting in the classroom with you .
If a critical mass of them are demotivated , pissed off and disobedient , you wo n't learn much .
But if a critical mass of them are hard - working , keen and stick to the rules , you will probably learn .
Watch any 10 - year - old : they are little machines for snuffling out the sensitivities of their peer group , and conforming to them .
Facing their schools ' failure in the 1980s , the Raleigh school board returned to this evidence and tried to puzzle out : how should it change the way we run our schools ?
Touring the schools , they could see why the research was right .
Children from poor families need more help than kids from rich families .
They are more likely to have chaotic home lives , less likely to have the importance of education drilled into them from birth , and they have lower expectations for themselves .
In small numbers , in an ordered environment , these poor children can quickly be brought up to the level of the rest , and indeed exceed them in many cases .
But when they form the majority of a school 's pupils , the teachers can't cope , discipline breaks down , and learning stops .
A school for poor children soon becomes a poor school .
So they formulated a bold – and strikingly simple – solution .
They would n't allow any school , by law , to have more than 40 per cent of its children on free school meals , or more than 25 per cent of children who were a grade below their expected level in reading or maths .
Suddenly , the children who needed the most help would n't be lumped together where their problems would become insurmountable ; they would be broken up and fanned out across the educational system .
Raleigh merged its school system with white suburban Wake County , so they became one entity , sharing pupils .
In order to soothe suburban suspicion at this change , Raleigh turned a third of its inner-city schools into specialist academies , offering excellent music or drama or language specialisms .
Soon , children were bussing in both directions every morning , in and out of the suburbs .
Many conservatives savaged the plan as " social engineering " and said it was doomed to fail .
Some parents were angry , and a few decamped for the private school system – until the results came in .
Within a decade , Raleigh went from one of the worst - performing districts in America to one of the best .
The test scores of poor kids doubled , while those of wealthier children also saw a slight increase .
Teenage pregnancies , crime and high school drop - out rates fell substantially .
It 's not hard to see why .
Each school had a core majority who respected the rules and valued education – and the other kids normalised to their standards .
Those who found it tough could now be given special attention , because they were n't any longer surrounded by a mass of equally troubled kids .
Today , 94 per cent of parents in Raleigh say they are happy with their child 's education .
School boards supporting this integration keep getting re-elected .
Raleigh succeeded because it built genuinely comprehensive schools : in which rich , middle - class and poor kids learned together .
In Britain , we tell ourselves we have built " comprehensives " – but , except in a few enclaves , we have done nothing of the sort .
We allocate school places according to how close you live to a school .
This immediately creates a social apartheid where middle - class children have successful schools in leafy suburbs , while poorer children are ring - fenced in sink schools and end up at Tesco at 16 with few useable skills .
( Rich children are creamed off entirely into private schools . )
Comprehensivisation did n't fail ; it did n't happen .
There are only a few areas in Britain with genuinely mixed schools , like Grampian – and they get the best overall results .
At the opposite end of the spectrum is Kent , where children from the middle and the rich are creamed off into grammar schools in which just one per cent of kids are on free school meals .
They have the worst overall results in the country .
So we know how to make schools work : integrate them .
Occasionally , our politicians take a tiny step that brings us closer to this .
The Labour council in Brighton allocates school places by lottery ; the Tories say they will abandon catchment areas , letting a few poor kids slip through .
But both only tinker at the extreme social segregation that crowbars apart the educational system .
Integration is a good policy for bleak recession times since it delivers dramatic improvements at little extra cost .
Raleigh actually spends less than the US national average on its schools , and 25 per cent less per pupil than failing Syracuse .
In the long term , integration actually saves us a fortune in welfare payments and prevented crime .
Yes , the right will scream at first that it is " an attack on the middle class " .
In fact , it is a great compliment to the middle class : it wants to use their children and their values as the sun around which every child 's education revolves .
Yes , some parents will scream that they do n't want their kids being taught alongside " chavs " and " pikeys " .
This should be called out bluntly – it is bigotry .
A democracy is based on a bargain : every child gets a chance to succeed , whatever their background .
Today , we are breaking our deal .
We are leaving millions of children to fail , just because their parents did n't have money .
Do we want to be a country where our children are sorted at five into different playgrounds according to Daddy 's bank account ?
Do we want to be an place where rich children only glimpse poor children from the car window as they are driven to their better , plusher school , and their better , plusher lives ?
Or do we want something better for our kids ?
Our politicians insist that " we 're all in this together " .
This will only be true if – at last , and at least – our children go to school together .

A Test for Exotic Propulsion ?
Can we calculate the gravitational field of a mass moving close to the speed of light ?
Franklin Felber ( Starmark Inc ) believes he can , with implications for propulsion .
Back in 2006 we looked briefly at Felber ’s work , describing what the physicist believes to be a repulsive gravitational field that emerges from his results .
Felber discussed the matter at the Space Technology and Applications International meeting that year , where he presented his calculations of the ‘ relativistically exact motion of a payload in the gravitational field of a source moving with constant velocity . ’
Above a certain critical velocity , Felber believes , any mass will gravitationally repel other masses , an effect that is twice as strong in the forward direction of motion , but also works in the backward direction .
An object lying in the narrow beam thus produced could be accelerated quickly and with little stress .
He described the effect in a paper he submitted in 2005 to the arXiv site :
At radial approach or recession speeds faster than 3 - 1/ 2 times the speed of light , even a small mass gravitationally repels a payload .
At relativistic speeds , a suitable mass can quickly propel a heavy payload from rest nearly to the speed of light with negligible stresses on the payload .
In other words , a mass moving faster than roughly 57.7 percent of the speed of light will repel other masses that are placed within what we could call an ‘ antigravity beam ’ in front or in back of it .
If true , the effect would provide the energy source needed to produce accelerations otherwise impossible .
In Felber ’s studies , the supposed ‘ antigravity ’ effect becomes stronger as the mass approaches the speed of light more and more closely .
The advantages are listed in Felber ’s recent 2009 paper :
This new means of ‘ antigravity ’ propulsion addresses the major engineering challenges for near - light - speed space travel of providing enormous propulsion energy quickly without undue stresses on a spacecraft .
By conventional propulsion , acceleration of a 1 - ton payload to 0.9 c requires imparting a kinetic energy equivalent to about 30 billion tons of TNT .
In the ‘ antigravity beam ’ of a speeding star or compact object , however , a payload would draw its energy for propulsion from the repulsive force of the much more massive driver .
Moreover , since it would be moving along a geodesic , a payload would ‘ float weightlessly ’ in the ‘ antigravity beam ’ even as it was accelerated close to the speed of light .
The effect would take place within a narrow cone , but would be extraordinarily useful , in Felber ’s view , if we could find a way to tap it , for the energy needs to reach these high velocities would be available naturally , and the stresses of acceleration would be manageable tidal forces in free - fall motion along a geodesic .
The result is what Felber calls ‘ hypervelocity propulsion . ’
To say this is problematic is to state the obvious .
How to tap into these energies ?
Here ’s Felber ’s thought on that , from the 2006 paper :
Whether the payload is accelerated by a strong or a weak field , the payload travels along a geodesic .
The only stresses on the payload , therefore , are the result of tidal forces in the accelerated frame of the payload .
These stresses can be arranged by choice of the trajectory to be kept within acceptable limits .
Greater practical problems for gravitational propulsion are finding a suitable and accessible driver mass at relativistic velocities , and maneuvering the payload in and out of the driver trajectory .
The italics are mine , highlighting a key issue — if Felber ’s work ( which draws on a 1924 David Hilbert paper that discussed the repulsion of relativistic particles by a static Schwarzschild field ) is correct , then we still have the problem of arranging our payload in relation to the driver mass .
In other words , taking advantage of these effects would itself require breakthroughs in space propulsion that would render the advantage of using the effect minimal .
It would assume a highly advanced space infrastructure , one capable of ranging freely through deep space , and apparently a lot of luck .
But let ’s put aside practicality and look at the effect itself .
Theories abound and what we need are workable ways of testing them , which is why so many people are dissatisfied with the various string theory formulations — how do we confirm what seem to be purely mathematical constructs ?
Felber ’s new paper argues that the Large Hadron Collider will be capable of testing his ideas by measuring the forces on a test mass .
The physicist believes such a test could be performed without interfering with normal LHC operations , assuming we get the LHC to ‘ normal ’ operations any time soon .
Felber ’s experiment would measure “ … the repulsive gravitational impulses of proton bunches delivered in their forward direction to resonant detectors just outside the beam pipe .
This test could provide accurate measurements of post - Newtonian parameters and the first observation of ‘ antigravity ’ , as well as validating the potential utility of relativistic gravity for spacecraft propulsion in the distant future . ”
He believes such a test could be performed for less than one percent of the cost of NASA ’s Gravity Probe B , whose total tariff may well have reached $ 1 billion .
Lab tests can be cheaper than space tests , but will Felber ’s ideas attact the needed funding even at these levels ?
The 2009 paper is Felber , “ Test of relativistic gravity for propulsion at the Large Hadron Collider ” ( abstract ) , while the 2006 paper is “ Exact Relativistic ‘ Antigravity ’ Propulsion ” ( abstract ) .
Technology Review looks at Felber here .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Hydrogen researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Idaho National Laboratory have reached a milestone on the road to reducing carbon emissions and protecting the nation against the effects of peaking world oil production .
Stephen Herring , laboratory fellow and technical director of the INL High Temperature Electrolysis team , today announced that the latest fuel cell modification has set a new mark in endurance .
The group 's Integrated Laboratory Scale experiment has now operated continuously for 2,583 hours at higher efficiencies than previously attained .
" I 'm very much encouraged that it will be able to operate for longer periods of time , " said Herring .
" It means that this research is closer to commercial viability . "
The commercial viability that Herring spoke about is likely different than what many may think of when they hear about hydrogen and fuel cells .
Instead of working to create vehicles that use pure hydrogen as fuel , Herring and his team are focused on another application .
Currently , " gasoline and diesel fuel actually have a lot of hydrogen that has been added to them , and that 's one thing many people do n't recognize , " said Herring .
" Next to a refinery , there 's often a plant that 's making hydrogen used for upgrading . "
If that hydrogen can be produced more efficiently , by decreasing the amount of electricity required by the electrolysis process that separates hydrogen from oxygen in water , there 's the potential for large savings .
Perhaps even more motivating is that multiple government , corporate and other organizations have published reports pointing to severe world economic consequences when world oil production peaks sometime in the near future .
Those same reports identify that one of the key parts of a solution is being able to upgrade lower quality petroleum , from sources like oil sands in Canada , into transportation - grade fuels .
" The production of liquid fuels , such as gasoline or diesel , is the primary use of this hydrogen .
Refining poor - quality crude oils , upgrading the tar - like Canadian oil sands and removing sulfur from petroleum already require large amounts of hydrogen , " said Herring .
By adding a special coating to the cells used in the latest test , the team achieved more than double the lifetime of previous cells and will immediately begin analysis of the experiment to try to improve the design further .
" It has been a lot of work by a number of people here , particularly Lisa Moore - McAteer , Keith Condie , Carl Stoots and Jim O'Brien , " said Herring .
" They 've really worked hard in putting this all together over the last five or six years and then keeping it running , that 's always a real challenge . "

The Sunday Times has a fairly detailed article on Sir John Sawers , including criticisms of his appointment by retired incumbents and contenders for the post of Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS / MI6 ) .
There are named quotations from Sir Richard Dearlove ( Chief of SIS from 1999 to 2004 ) and Sir Francis Richard ( Director of GCHQ from 1998 to 2003 ) , as well as from another , anonymous , former Chief of SIS .

When he takes up his job on November 1 in the postmodernist building ( known as " Legoland " to its occupants ) in Vauxhall Cross on the Thames , he 'll be the first C since Sir John Rennie , in 1968 , to come from outside its ranks .
As one senior source puts it , " His life will change immediately .
It wo n't be possible for friends to write to or phone him at home .
He will disappear from normal life .
He will not live at his home , but at a place in central London whose location will be kept secret .
His security will be reviewed weekly .
His driver will use different routes to take him from there to the office . " [...]
One recently retired C has taken the unusual step of speaking out to The Sunday Times Magazine about the appointment .
Is this code for Sir John Scarlett , the outgoing Chief ?
Sir John Scarlett 's immediate predecessor was Sir Richard Dearlove ( Chief of SIS from 199 to 2004 ) , who is quoted directly , but his predecessor Sir David Spedding died in 2001 .
Surely Sir Colin McColl ( Chief of SIS from 1989 to 1994 ) does not count as " recently retired " ?
Which really only leaves the outgoing Sir John Scarlett as the unnamed " recently retired C " .
" It 's a dreadful mistake , " he says flatly .
" The problem will be operational credibility with the troops .
What kind of signal does it send if someone who was barely in the service before he left it is appointed as its head ?
He is dealing with people who have devoted their lives to SIS , as MI6 is formerly known .
Perhaps " formerly " should read " formally " ?
" I know what the case in favour is : good Whitehall style , wide contacts and so on .
But those should n't be the main criteria for this post .
The main job is to lead the Secret Intelligence Service , and I am not convinced John Sawers , whatever his many talents , is at all qualified for that . "
The retired C goes on to lambast David Miliband , seen as the prime mover behind the appointment : " It 's the move of a very inexperienced foreign secretary .
Sawers is an able , likable policy wonk .
But the needs of the service have not been taken into account . " [...]
A typical day for Sawers will start with the morning meeting at Vauxhall Cross .
This will be attended by the eight senior officers who make up the service 's board of top personnel .
It discusses big operations and priorities .
The rest of the day is often spent in one - to - one meetings with senior officers and , says one who has attended the meetings , " an awful lot of time is spent liaising with Whitehall " .
He meets the prime minister or foreign secretary frequently and has management meetings and updates from other secret - service chiefs .
Dealings with the CIA and other key allied services are also conducted directly through his office , so he will travel frequently -- but his name does not appear on passenger flight lists , and great efforts are made to ensure that his whereabouts remain unknown at any time . [...]
The retired C I spoke to is n't convinced : " The service is loyal and cohesive and it can survive one bad chief .
But it is n't encouraging for those within the service that an impulsive and immature foreign secretary should have made the wrong choice at such an important time . " [... ]
We agree that the Labour apparatchik David Miliband is a national embarrassment as Foreign Secretary , but it is impossible to predict how well Sir John Sawers will turn out as the new Chief of SIS - we pray that he will be a resounding success .
However , given the lack of effective public oversight of " British Intelligence " , how can we ever be sure that any disasters will not simply be covered up ?

A Note on Primate Imagery in the History of Racism
This blog and blogger are not insensitive to the historic use of primate imagery by delusional racists .
However , the path to sustainable living may require us to get this " monkey " off of our backs .
I apologize for being blunt , but " Black " people are no closer to non-human primates than are " White " people .
In fact , many apes and monkeys far more closely resemble " White " people than " Black " people .
In general , the hair of nonhuman primates is far , far closer to that of " White " people than it is to that of " Black " people , for example .
So , we all need to get beyond the perception of monkey and ape as racist code words .
We need those words and concepts in our language because they help us to understand human nature and origins .
The delusional racist imagery of African people somehow being closer to apes or monkeys may have entered our culture , but it is false , pernicious and must be exposed and replaced by rational imagery .
While it may thus be uncomfortable at first , for some people of various ancestries to work with the Divine Primates imagery , it may be vital to our survival .
This may be a necessary step in the process of reclaiming human nature from the history of ignorance and ego that has led us to believe that humans are divided into races , and that any humans could be so superior to other humans or other species that they no longer need to respect the planet we live on , and to work to live sustainably within the ecosystem constraints of planet earth .
Indeed , racism may be one of the major reasons our culture has spun out of control .
The discomfort with our primate nature , from the days of Darwin to the present time , may have caused human culture to deny evolution and to collude in attitudes indicating that humans are not really even animals .
As comforting as these attitudes may be for some , we are seeing their disastrous impacts in our culture today .
Once upon a time , the world of gaming was so dreary that a yellow circle blew people 's minds .
In 1980 , Pac - Man became a star almost by default , towering over such gaming " heroes " as the missile pod from Centipede the guns from Missile Command and the cannon from Space Invaders .
Apparently , the gaming public did n't find turrets all that relatable .
Many games followed Pac - Man 's character - centric lead soon after .
It 's hard to say which era of mascots has proven most fruitful - the ' 80s arcade , the Sonic vs. Mario years or modern stars like Pikachu and Master Chief .
They each have unique designs and personalities that have captured gamers ' imaginations .
But none of those were as revolutionary as the most important gaming mascot of all time - and certainly the most unique .
After all , only one mascot was your Buddy .
You know , your Robotic Operating Buddy .
R.O.B. debuted with the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 as part of the console 's deluxe package , tapping into its release year 's ethos by combining the living - robot design of Short Circuit 's Johnny Five with the squat , bug - eyed appeal of E.T .
The result , at nearly a foot tall , was cute , iconic and hitherto unheard of in the world of videogames .
Forget Pac - Man - this plastic contraption promised games that played with you in your living room .
Trouble was , it kinda , sorta , completely sucked .
Annoying to set up , annoying to use and supported by a whopping two games , R.O.B. 's rank as Nintendo 's most disappointing hardware release has stood the test of time .
Not even the Virtual Boy could dethrone this disaster .
So why is it important ?
R.O.B. , unlike every gaming device before it , delivered a control experience beyond basic directing , aiming and shooting .
The cute little bugger typically gets credited as a mascot for the rebirth of home gaming , but more importantly , it blazed the trail as both the first major gaming peripheral and the first artificial gaming " buddy . "
When you wail on a Guitar Hero guitar , bounce on a DDR pad or chat up Seaman , know that R.O.B. 's red eyes are watching you .
The Trojan Robot
Among the many reasons we are n't playing the Coleco Supernova or the Atari Jaguar - 128X , the Great Videogame Crash of the early ' 80s is the biggest .
Before home gaming could get a foothold in American living rooms , those companies , among others , just about killed the hobby through oversaturation .
They released too many games , most of which were at best bland and downright unplayable at worst .
Furthermore , each company released incremental upgrades to their hardware , confusing a young market .
Those factors combined to flood toy store shelves with unsold product .
Atari has its famous story of burying thousands of unsold E.T. cartridges in a desert landfill , but let 's not kid ourselves :
Plenty of other lame games landed in that trash heap , too .

The women had been made to sign a contract before entering the villa Nine women in Turkey have been freed from a villa they entered two months ago thinking they were taking part in a Big Brother - style reality TV show .
Police stormed the building in Riva , reportedly after family members became concerned they were being prevented from contacting the women .
According to local media , naked images of the women were sold on the internet .
They were also told to fight each other , wear bikinis and dance by the pool , HaberTurk newspaper reports .
The mother of one of the women told the newspaper they were not abused or sexually harassed .
Cries for help
The duped contestants are said to be aged between 16 and 24 .
The women had responded to an advert seeking contestants for a reality show that would be aired on a major Turkish television station , Dogan news agency reports .
They were reportedly made to sign a contract that banned them from any outside contact and ordered them to pay a 50,000 Lira ( $ 33,000 , £ 20,000 ) fine if they left the show before two months .
The women are said to have realised they were being duped soon after moving into the villa , in the summer resort of Riva on Istanbul 's outskirts .
But they were told they would have to pay the fine if they wanted to leave , Dogan reports .
When the police arrived at the villa to free the women , they reportedly heard cries for help from inside the building .
HaberTurk newspaper says four people who lived at the villa with the women were detained .
Police are still searching for the gang 's leader who sold images of the women on the internet , the newspaper adds .

Enzo Micheletti's body was found in woodland
The nephew of the interim President of Honduras Roberto Micheletti has been found dead in what the police are calling an execution - style killing .
Enzo Micheletti's body was discovered on Sunday in woodland near Choloma , 250 km north of the capital , Tegucigalpa .
Police say his hands were tied behind his back and his body was riddled with bullets .
There is no indication that his death is connected to the coup that brought his uncle to power at the end of June .
The 24 - year - old 's body was discovered on Sunday two days after he had been reported missing .
The body of another unidentified man was found nearby .
Roberto Micheletti came to power in June
Mr Micheletti came to power after President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in June after trying to hold a vote on whether a constituent assembly should be set up to look at rewriting the constitution .
He wants to be reinstated before 29 November elections , but the interim leaders have resisted his demands .
They say Mr Zelaya was legally removed from office as he had violated the Honduran constitution .
It is not thought that the interim leader 's nephew was involved in politics , but Honduras has the highest murder rate in Central America - much of it drug related .
Last year more than 7,000 people were killed .

As the number of problem U.S. banks swells to the hundreds , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is increasingly hard - pressed to fill in the gaps where institutions have put depositor ’s funds at risk .
Unfortunately , a dire prediction made by government officials in early 2009 has come true : the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund is now broke , according to published reports .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The deposit insurance fund dropped by $ 18.6 billion during the third quarter of 2009 to negative $ 8.2 billion , as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . set aside $ 21.7 billion in provisions for additional bank failures , ” The Wall Street Journal reported .
“ This is the second time in the agency ’s history that the balance has fallen into negative territory . ”
In March the FDIC took steps to stave off the possibility that its insurance fund would run dry , instituting new fees on banks , forcing them to pay to protect consumers .
The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , Sheila Bair , wrote to bank leaders declaring that “ without these assessments , the deposit insurance fund could become insolvent this year . ”
According to the FDIC ’s most recent quarterly report , there were 552 “ problem ” banking institutions in the U.S. , the most since the end of 1993 .
“ In its state of the industry report , the F.D.I.C. reported that banks posted a $ 2.8 billion gain in the third quarter , after a $ 4.3 billion loss in the previous period , ” The New York Times reported .
“ The number of bad loans of nearly every stripe — credit cards , mortgages , small business and commercial real estate — continue to grow , albeit at a slower pace . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
BizJournals added : “ Fifty institutions failed during the third quarter , bringing the total number of failures in the first nine months of 2009 to 95 .
As of Nov. 21 , 124 banks have failed nationwide . ”
“ The FDIC has not yet accessed a temporary $ 500 billion fund of capital it has available to it from Treasury for the insurance fund , ” Marketwatch notd .
“ The FDIC estimates that bank failures will cost the agency as much as $ 100 billion over the next five years , with the majority of the losses taking place in 2009 and 2010 .
The agency may require banks to pay additional assessments to cover losses to the fund if bank failures expand in greater numbers than anticipated by the agency . ”
When banks insured by the FDIC are seized or declare bankruptcy , the agency returns depositors ’ funds up to $ 250,000 .

An earlier version of this report said the FDIC insures depositors ’ funds up to $ 100,000 .
The government - run agency expanded its coverage for consumers from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 in 2008 .
President Obama further extended the additional cushion until the end of 2013 .
In what should be no surprise to anyone , car sales crashed after the cash - for - clunkers program ended .
Nonetheless , economists and analysts once again managed to be surprised by the rate of decline .
Please consider GM , Toyota , Ford Say U.S. Sales Fell After ‘ Clunkers ’ Aid Ended .
General Motors Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. said sales fell in September as waning demand after the “ cash for clunkers ” rebates may have cut industry deliveries to the second - slowest rate this year .
The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate slid to 9.3 million vehicles , based on the average of 8 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg .
Analysts ’ sales estimates are adjusted for one more sales day this month than in September 2008 .
Adjusted Sales vs. Estimates
GM sales fell 47 percent compared to the 44 percent decline projected by analysts .
Ford sales fell 8.9 percent compared to the 5 percent decline projected by analysts .
Chrysler sales fell 8.9 percent , matching the average analyst estimates .
Nissan sales fell 11 percent compared to the 7.1 percent decline projected by analysts .
Honda sales fell 23 percent , compared to the 13 percent decline projected by analysts .
Toyota sales fell 16 percent compared to the 13 percent decline projected by analysts .
Hyundai bucked the industry slide with a 27 percent increase .
Chicago Surprise
“ A lot of people would be looking for a pullback , but we ’re going to see improving fundamentals in the base economy , and with that higher earnings , ” said William Dwyer , chief investment officer at MTB Investment Advisors , which manages $ 13 billion in Baltimore .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index lost 0.7 percent to 9,678.27 at 9:47 a.m. in New York after the Institute for Supply Management ’s gauge of business activity slipped to 46.1 in September , lower than the reading of 52 estimated by economists in a Bloomberg survey .
It 's not a recession , just a " dramatic slowing of growth "
Bill Dwyer , chief investment officer at MTB Investment Advisors in Baltimore , said Wall Street found some relief from word of the economic stimulus plan as well as the efforts of regulators to help bond insurers .
He said the Federal Reserve 's decision to lower interest rate this week could also help some struggling homeowners hold onto their properties .
The efforts , he said , could ultimately help stave off recession .
" People have that ' R ' word stuck on the front of their forehead .
It 's really just a dramatic slowing of growth .
We may not have a recession , " he said .
Manufacturing Expands Less Than Economists Expect , Jobless Claim More
Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded less than anticipated by economists and more Americans filed claims for unemployment benefits , pointing to a recovery that will be slow to generate jobs .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s factory gauge decreased to 52.6 in September from 52.9 in August , the Tempe , Arizona - based group said today .
Fifty is the dividing line between expansion and contraction .
The number of jobless claims climbed to 551,000 last week , more than economists forecast , figures from the Labor Department showed .
The ISM index , which dropped for the first time this year , was forecast to rise to 54 , according to the median of 80 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists .
Bernanke Out Of magic Magic Bullets
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said U.S. economic growth next year probably wo n’t be strong enough to “ substantially ” bring down the jobless rate , which may remain above 9 percent at the end of 2010 .
“ Most forecasters including the Fed are currently looking at growth in 2010 , but not growth so rapid as to substantially lower the unemployment rate , ” Bernanke said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing today in Washington .
Growth of 3 percent means the rate would “ still probably be above 9 percent by the end of 2010 , ” Bernanke said .
“ Is there anything else we should be doing to make sure that we bring the unemployment rate more quickly ? ” asked Representative Leonard Lance , a Republican from New Jersey .
Bernanke replied , “ I do n’t have any magic bullets to offer .
If I did , I would have offered them by now . ”
In an interview today , Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said the central bank will need to raise interest rates when the economic recovery is “ firmly ” in place , even if unemployment lingers near 10 percent .
“ I think the growth outlook , particularly the consumer spending outlook , are more fundamental than labor - market conditions , ” he said .
Asked in the hearing to comment on remarks this week by World Bank President Robert Zoellick , Bernanke said he also agrees with the official that “ if we do n’t get our macro house in order , that that will put the dollar in danger and that the most critical element there is long - term fiscal stability . ”
Bernanke
Hides Behind Words
Bernanke said at the hearing that the commercial real estate market , while posing “ a very serious problem , ” is unlikely to cause another financial crisis .
“ We are concerned both because the fundamentals are weakening , and because the financing situation is bad , ” Bernanke said .
Loans may cause “ a lot of stress ” for “ small and regional banks , ” he said .
Asked by Representative Gregory Meeks , a Democrat from New York , if there ’s a “ crisis brewing , ” Bernanke said , “ I do n’t think so , but we ’ll have to watch it carefully . ”
Bernanke :
Why are we still listening to this guy ?
Another Crisis is Brewing
Much has been said on Zero Hedge about the Fed 's monetization of Treasuries , usually via the NY Fed 's POMO activities , which on occasion buys back Treasuries as promptly as 5 days after any one given auction .
Yet we were dumbfounded by this piece of information , presented to us by Jim Bianco , which demonstrates that the Fed 's monetization of Agencies is far more blatant than anything even encountred in Treasuries .
Below is the 10:00 am announcement of a new $ 5 billion auction of 2 Year Fannie Agencies :
A mere half hour later , the NY Fed announced that as part of tomorrow 's " Outright Agency Coupon Purchase " precisely this CUSIP would be one of the securities repurchased :
These shell games are getting tiresome .
A half an hour turnaround time between issuance and buyback ?
Really Ben ?
As Jim Bianco comments , some answers are far overdue , when trying to explain this most blatant example of monetization to date .
1 . Who bought these securities at auction ?
The potential for foul play here is high if the news of such a buyback accidentally leaked to a few individuals in the market 2 .
Who does the Federal Reserve think it is fooling by monetizing in such a roundabout way ?
Perhaps it is time for another probing interview by administration darling Steve Liesman of Tim Geithner .
Hopefully this time he wo n't lie as blatantly as he did last time when he claimed : " The Fed is absolutely not monetizing debt " ( 9 mins , 9 seconds into the clip )
Number of known examples to date : 97
Harvard University Researcher Says Coffee Was Poisoned on Purpose A researcher who fell ill after just one sip says , this was no accident .
Oct. 26 , 2009  --
A Harvard University researcher whose coffee was spiked with a dangerous chemical said he believes the staff was intentionally poisoned with a toxic preservative used widely in the medical school 's laboratory .
" I can not think it would be an accident , " Matteo Iannacone told ABCNews.com today .
" Fortunately , I drank just a sip . "
Despite drinking just a sip Iannacone , 33 , was one of six people who became ill on Aug. 26 after drinking coffee from a communal espresso machine on the eighth floor of Harvard Medical School 's New Research building .
Toxicology results , he said , showed the coffee contained a " very high concentration " of sodium azide , a powerful chemical preservative that can be fatal in high doses , causing respiratory failure .
" All the research labs have it , " Iannacone said .
" It 's very common . "
Iannacone said he and two students from the pathology department had gone over to the single - serve coffee machine , a daily ritual , around and he noticed right away that there was something off .
" As soon as we tasted a sip of the coffee , we noticed the taste was strange , " he said .
Within seconds , they experienced tachycardia , or a rapid heartbeat , and an increase in blood pressure .
" We were sweating and we had to sit down , almost like we were fainting , " he said .
Iannacone said that because he takes his coffee black -- " I'm Italian , " he explained -- he was able to notice the chemical right away .
But they later learned that some of the other coffee drinkers had put sugar and milk in their cups , masking the altered taste , and drank the entire thing .
Two people fainted , he said , and one of those people was hospitalized overnight .
For Iannacone and the two students he was with , the symptoms began to disappear after about 10 minutes .
Cameron said all six involved with the poisoning were back at work within a day or two .
Iannacone said he was n't particularly nervous about someone within the school trying to harm the students and employees , but that he found it " disturbing . "
Others , he said , are worried something might happen again .
David Cameron , spokesman for Harvard Medical School , said the coffee machine is not connected to the water supply .
The water reserve tank is filled periodically by anyone who notices the water level getting low .
Each re-fill can make several cups of coffee , he said , though it is unclear whether all six people got coffee from the same water supply .
The eighth floor coffee machine also served researchers and students on the 9th floor , he said , about 200 people total .
The machine has since been removed .
" We are now going to the Starbucks downstairs , " Iannacone said , adding that the medical school is also installing new security cameras .
The university and it's police department have remained tight - lipped about the poisonings .
Cameron told ABCNews.com today that the university has contracted with an independent toxicologist as part of the Harvard University Police Department 's investigation .
No students or employees have been disciplined , he said , and no arrests have been made .
" The bottom line is they are looking very carefully and exhaustively at every single cause , " Cameron said .
Chemical Caused Illness Within Seconds
According to the Centers for Disease Control that in addition to the chemical 's common use in medical laboratories , sodium azide is used as the explosive agent in automobile airbags .
Although Grayson is the 12th - wealthiest member of Congress , with an estimated net worth of $ 31 million , he grew up dirt poor .
The Times describes his upbringing as having all the " makings of a Horatio Alger novel . "
And it quickly becomes clear why health care is a fighting issue for him .
He grew up in a cramped Bronx tenement , the asthma - inflicted son of public school educators .
Sickness and death are common themes .
As a boy , a bully threw him under a moving bus but he pulled himself free just in time .
In Sri Lanka in 1984 , he sat under a 2,200 - year - old tree , a sacred Buddhist site , where guerrillas later slaughtered 200 people .
He used to wake up in the middle of the night covered in his own blood , for no apparent reason .
He was nearly killed in a car accident .
Grayson got into Harvard , and in order to cover expenses worked as a night watchman and cleaned toilets .
After earning a law degree and a master 's in public policy , he went on to work for legal titans with names like Ginsberg , Bork and Scalia .
But he made his money when he and a college friend rented space over a funeral home in the Bronx and founded IDT Corp. , a telecommunications company .
He did n't stay with the company long and went back to law , where he gained the reputation of fighting for the little guy - just as he 's doing today in DC .
Grayson made a name filing whistle­blower lawsuits on contractor fraud and war profiteering in Iraq .
The cases , involving big names like Halliburton and Custer Battles , were met with resistance from the Bush administration .
Grayson said he was subjected to gag orders and stalling tactics .
His quest garnered national attention , including a profile in the Wall Street Journal , which said he was waging a " one-man crusade , " and an extensive piece in Vanity Fair , where Grayson disclosed he liked to dress flamboyantly to hold a jury 's attention .
His experience fighting all the Bush - led corruption and greed in the Iraq war has helped fuel his strong anti-war stance .
He was one of only 32 Democrats , and the only one from Florida , to vote against recent funding for the wars .
" Nobody can say you volunteered to be disabled the rest of your life .
Nobody can say you volunteered to die and leave behind your wife and children .
It 's wrong .
It 's colonialism , " he said , starting to cry .
Grayson has a talent for making short , razor - sharp commentaries and observations that cut through all the Beltway BS and play well in today 's soundbite - driven , ADD world .
Some faves :
" When did Uncle Sam become Uncle Sap ? "
( His comment upon discovering that taxpayers have been paying legal bills for three former Fannie Mae executives accused of manipulating the books . )
Dick Cheney likes to " shoot old men in the face . "
( Said at an August fundraiser )
The campaign staff of Ric Keller ( the four - term Repug he defeated in Nov. ) " spent all their time flying paper clips at each other and watching porn on their computers . "
Rush Limbaugh is a " has - been hypocrite loser . "
I especially like that last one .
Grayson offers blunt and honest assessments that most Democrats are fearful of uttering .
Many people first took note of him when the Financial Services Committee heard from Federal Reserve officials and financial executives on federal bailouts and the economic downturn .
In a memorable exchange , Grayson laughs at Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke as he tries to explain why the government would loan $ 500 billion to foreign banks .
The performances have made Grayson an Internet sensation , a champion for a public buried under credit card debt and foreclosures .
" Alan Grayson .
Wow , " wrote a commenter on a YouTube video of him questioning Bernanke .
" The only thing that would make this video better is if Grayson body - slammed Bernanke through a hardwood table . "
Grayson seems to elicit such favorable reactions from lots of folks .
I usually do n't read the reader comments on the St. Pete Times ' website , because they mostly seem to come from wingnut loonies who are sitting at home flinging paper clips and watching porn on the computer .
But the comments to the Times ' article on Grayson are quite different .
Here 's a sampling :
AT LAST !!!
Finally there is intelligent life in Florida !!
Thought I was the only one tired of the Republican BS !
Still , the local half wits will find reason to rant and screech that he 's being unfair .
Nope , he 's telling the TRUTH .
Get used to it .
Alan Grayson is my hero !!!!
I love this guy .
I wish we had someone like him in Tampa .
As a Democrat I have been ashamed at my party 's unwillingness to defend itself against the lies from the right .
It makes liberals look weak when we are perceived as less than passionate .
Rep Grayson is a breath of Fresh Air .
He is exactly the necessary " kick in the butt " response to the Republican 's " do nothing " politics who only want to defeat Obama and the Democrats agenda to help the middle and lower income citizens .
Why is it when the rethugs say the Democrats are gonna kill your grandma , it 's okay ?
And now they demand an apology ?
The hypocrisy is staggering .
The Times notes that Grayson is a top target for the GOP in 2010 .
You could describe Grayon 's central Florida district ( it includes Orlando ) as " swing " territory , although Obama took it 53 - 47 .
However , no serious Repug contender has yet emerged .
And Grayson is always up for a good fight .
Grayson 's wealth gives him plenty of resources to defend himself ( he spent $ 2 million of his own money on his 2008 campaign ) , and that wealth also keeps him from being beholden to special interests that tend to contribute to politicians losing their backbones .
" I do n't owe anything to anyone here .
I do n't owe anything to lobbyists .
I do n't owe anything to leadership .
The only thing I owe to anybody is the well - being of 800,000 people who depend on me . "
The Times notes that the GOP now have " trackers " following Grayson to catch him in a gaffe , a sign that they view him as a top target .
But the Rethugs are going to have to come up with some new tactics to take down Grayson , I think .
He understands better than they do how to be a successful politician in the 21st century .
But arguably , the trackers are wasting their energy .
Grayson does not need provocation to say exactly what he thinks .
And , in effect , he tracks himself .
Shortly after his CNN appearance ( where he offered strident anti-Republican attacks ) , Grayson posted the clip on his YouTube page .
As of Friday afternoon , it had been viewed 73,821 times .
UPDATE :
For your video enjoyment , here 's a little sample of why we like Alan Grayson so much ( H/T tazzz ) :
UPDATE 2 :
Here 's some cool video of Grayson grilling some seemingly worthless government bureaucrats over Fed spending ( H/T mahakali overdrive ) .

if you believe in science , you ’re doing it wrong
Questions like " do you believe in evolution " fundamentally misunderstand what science is and how it works .
I have a confession to make .
Despite writing hundreds of blog posts that tear into creationist arguments and show the hypocrisy of many verbal attacks on atheists , I ’ve never read any of the awareness - raising books by Sam Harris , Christopher Hitchens or even Richard Dawkins ’ blockbuster The God Delusion .
Sure , I did pick up copies at the local bookstore and leafed through them to see if anything jumped out at me and caught my eye and what I noticed were either primarily philosophical arguments or conclusions to which I came to as a teenager .
This is not to say that the books in question do n’t have their merits , but for me , they were preaching to the choir .
It ’s nice to know you ’re not alone in your ideas but that assurance does n’t need to be constant .
Another problem with a number of popular atheist books is their constant ventures into philosophy , the tired , old stomping ground of anyone who thinks he has a profound idea and wants to discuss it without having to base the case on real world evidence and observations .
But why should the people who understand that we ’re not as knowledgeable as any human could be after reading a book or two and look for tangible evidence as a means to understand the world around them have to plunge into this rhetorical morass ?
Why not just stick to science and the facts ?
Why not just let the Chris Mooneys , the Terry Eagletons , the Nicholas Wades and the Karen Armstrongs of the world waft in the clouds while staying planted on terra firma to deal with the tangibles and observables ?
It ’s fun to dream and ask what if , but you also need evidence to go with your big ideas .
And it ’s at this point when post - modernists perk up and bring forth their epistemological noise .
How could you know anything for sure ?
Do n’t you know that everyone ’s opinions are valid ?
Science is just a belief too and all the conclusions you get from your evidence are just your dogmas .
It ’s as if with each quote they ’re trying to be as obtuse and metaphysical as possible , crafting shallow arguments and infusing them with enough rhetoric and high brow terminology to make them sound profound and insightful .
I wonder how they could function in the real world if they really thought this way all the time .
Did they wake up or do they believe they just woke up ?
Did they drink a cup of coffee or do they simply believe they drank something and it ’s their belief that courses through their bloodstream to make them more alert ?
Did they go to work or do they just do something which may look like work to an outside observer ?
It ’s this level of ridiculous , over the top doubt in everything that led Descrates to come up with his infamous brain in a jar conjecture best summarized in the Matrix trilogy .
When we step down from their mental ivory towers and really think about it , the assertion that science is just a belief or another way of creating dogmas is monstrously stupid .
Simply put , if you believe in science , you have no idea what science is .
You do n’t believe that that there ’s a couch in a coffee shop .
You see it there .
You can touch it , move it , smell it and it wo n’t suddenly vanish into thin air when you look away .
You do n’t believe in the sky being blue on a sunny day , you just look up and see it .
And when was the last time that you believed in the existence of cars and planes ?
Looking at what ’s out there , taking note of it , studying its properties based on what you can see , touch and smell is science .
I never say that I believe in evolution because it ’s a ridiculous thing to say .
Instead , I looked at the available evidence on the subject and agreed that yes , this is the best way to explain how life came to be the way it is on this planet based on the available data .
The post - modernists can complain about the limitations of our senses and our technology but what seems to be lost on them is the cardinal rule of the scientific thought process .
If you have no proof for it , you ca n’t insist that it ’s real or objective .
Because we do n’t know something , we ca n’t randomly jam anything we want in there and pretend it ’s a good idea .
And this is exactly what we do when we involve deities for which we do n’t have a shred of proof into processes we otherwise understand and want to explore in farther depth .
To equate a way to describe the natural world through objective means with simply inserting one ’s own opinion in the gaps of our knowledge and chalk both up to belief is an absurd assertion that can only be made by people who do n’t understand the nature of science and can’t wrap their minds around the fact that it ’s simply a methodology by which people accumulate and connect facts , not a set of answers to questions or ready made opinions .
BAGHDAD 
After weeks of political stalemate , Iraq approved a law on Sunday to administer a critical national election in January , a significant milestone for its fragile democracy and a step that will allow the rapid withdrawal of American combat forces early next year .
The election , only the second national vote since the fall of Saddam Hussein , will be a crucial step toward popular sovereignty and stability in Iraq .
But the election law had been stymied by a political battle over the northern province of Kirkuk , claimed by Kurds , Arabs and Turkmens , each of whom hoped electoral power would give them control of the region ’s oil wealth .
The compromise reached Sunday , which satisfied all three groups , was hailed by Iraqi and American leaders as a triumph for Iraq ’s emerging democracy and a demonstration of Parliament ’s ability to resolve sticky sectarian disputes for the national benefit .
“ Accomplishing this law is not a victory for anyone in particular , but a victory for the entire Iraqi people , ” said Faryad Raundozi , a member of Parliament ’s Kurdish Alliance .
No men OR women needed : Scientists create sperm and eggs from stem cells
Human eggs and sperm have been grown in the laboratory in research which could change the face of parenthood .
It paves the way for a cure for infertility and could help those left sterile by cancer treatment to have children who are biologically their own .
But it raises a number of moral and ethical concerns .
These include the possibility of children being born through entirely artificial means , and men and women being sidelined from the process of making babies .
Forever fertile ?
Infertile men and women could have their own biological children using the breakthrough sperm and eggs
Opponents argue that it is wrong to meddle with the building blocks of life and warn that the advances taking place to tackle infertility risk distorting and damaging relations between family members .
The U.S. government - funded research also offers the prospect of a ' miracle pill ' which staves off the menopause , allowing women to wait longer to have a child .
It centres on stem cells , widely seen as a repair kit for the body .
Scientists at Stanford University in California found the right cocktail of chemicals and vitamins to coax the cells into becoming eggs and sperm .
Controversial : Britain 's oldest mother Elizabeth Adeney , 67 , who went abroad for IVF , is pictured here with her newborn son in June this year
The sperm had heads and short tails and are thought to have been mature enough to fertilise an egg .
The eggs were at a much earlier stage but were still much more developed than any created so far by other scientists .
The double success , published in the journal Nature , raises the prospect of men and women one day ' growing ' their own sperm and eggs for use in IVF treatments .
The American team used stem cells taken from embryos in the first days of life but
hope to repeat the process with slivers of skin .
The skin cells would first be exposed to a mixture which wound back their biological clocks to embryonic stem cell state , before being transformed into sperm or eggs .
Starting with a person's own skin would also mean the lab - grown sperm or eggs would not be rejected by the body .
The science also raises the possibility of ' male eggs ' made from men's skin and ' female sperm ' from women 's skin .
This would allow gay couples to have children genetically their own , although many scientists are sceptical about whether it is possible to create sperm from female cells , which lack the male Y chromosome .
The U.S. breakthrough could unlock many of the secrets of egg and sperm production , leading to new drug treatments for infertility .
Defects in sperm and egg development are the biggest cause of infertility but , because many of the key stages occur in the womb , scientists have struggled to study the process in detail .
Researcher Rita Reijo Pera , of Stanford 's Centre for Human Embryonic Stem Cell
Research , believes new fertility drugs are just five years away .
However , safety and ethical concerns mean that artificial sperm and eggs are much further away from use .
Dr Reijo Pera said any future use of artificial eggs and sperm would have to be subject to guidelines .
' Whether one builds the boundaries on religion or just on an internal sense or of right and wrong , these are important .
In this field , it is not " anything goes " . '
Scientists at Newcastle University claimed to have made sperm from embryonic stem cells earlier this year but the research paper has been retracted .
Dr Allan Pacey , a Sheffield University expert in male fertility said : ' Ultimately this may help us find a cure for male infertility .
Not necessarily by making sperm in the laboratory , I personally think that is unlikely , but by identifying new targets for drugs or genes that may stimulate sperm production to occur naturally .
' This is a long way off , but it is a laudable dream . '
Dr Peter Saunders , of the Christian Medical Fellowship , said that IVF should be the preserve of married couples .
' The question is , why are we creating artificial gametes ( eggs and sperm ) and aborting 200,000 babies a year when there are many , many couples willing to adopt ? '

Now share your opinion
Josephine Quintavalle , of the campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics , warned that any flaws in the artificial sperm or eggs could be passed on to future generations .
Anthony Ozimic , of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children , said : ' The use of artificial gametes in reproduction would distort and damage relations between family members .
' There are no instances of any major medical advance achieved by abandoning basic ethical principles such as safeguarding the right to life . '
Electric
Wheelchair traveling can be a hassle for the consumers but if they ’re well prepared , there ’s absolutely no place in the world that ’s out of bounds for supper users .
For most wheelchair users while traveling , availability is obviously a problem , make sure it boarding the airplane or cruise to moving across the narrow aisle to board them .
This report discusses about travel on various modes of transportation for wheelchair users moving overseas and also the things to watch out for when traveling .
Electric wheelchair Users need to be certain his wheelchair or disability scooter is in great condition prior to leaving home .
Time may be much better sightseeing than finding a mechanic and awaiting repair .
Write your own name , contact number , return address and destination on labels which may be attached to a electric wheelchair and some other removable components .
A few of the components are costly and hard to replace so it ’s strongly suggested that you take good care of them also .
The repair kit may be little palm sized box but sufficient to keep the significant parts that are modest .
The more troublesome areas of the journey .
Essentially , there are just three ways that a wheelchair user may disembark from the cruise boat :
The very first way applies to consumers that have the ability to walk down the gangway and the bus is going to be managed individually by the boat assistants .
For people with problems walking , I recommend you remain on the wheelchair and permit the strong sailors to take the wheelchair and yourself down the gangway .
Electric scooter and wheelchair users need to take note they ’re not able to use the past two methods of disembarkation since the burden of the electrical wheelchair is just too heavy to be transported and also risk damaging the digital parts with too much vibrations .
Ship assistants will counsel you to move to a manual wheelchair and moved off the ship individually .
You are able to come back to your electric scooter or wheelchair in the pier .
The Most frequent type of transportation is by air and the various airlines really perform differently if wheelchair travelers are involved .
It requires additional efforts to supply satisfied support for wheelchair travelers and suitable instruction ought to be left into the airline staffs .
Back to the auto users , phone to verify your flight details as they ’re exposed to change .
Electric wheelchair users will devote far more time moving between airport terminals should they arrive in the incorrect one .
You want to also notify beforehand the airline that you ’ll be traveling at a electric wheelchair , manual wheelchair or disability scooter .
Ask for extra assistance when you get to the airline counter .
Electric wheelchair users need to ask for “ gate check ” since it lets you move directly on the airplane .
The airline staff will aid you in putting the wheelchair in a corner once you move to the chair , usually from the aisle .
You ’re reminded to take out the leg and seat cushions and proceed from the own side since these loose parts may go lost while in storage .
This will avoid damage from demanding airport handlers .
The very best sort of batteries to use for travel would be the gel mobile and dry cell phones .
Refrain from utilizing wet cell batteries since there ’s a chance of leakage and airways usually prohibit them from being accepted on board .
If your electrical wheelchairs must be kept from the merchandise compartment of the plane , you should take precautions to prevent using your electrical wheelchairs from the handlers .
Set the electrical wheelchair transmission to neutral equipment such that it can be manually pushed into its storage place .
Remove the battery links involving the two seat and battery and utilize a duct tape on the two ends .
Never abandon a open cable dangling .
Keep the power cord on your side in any way times .
You also need to eliminate the joystick and continue beside you or if it ’s fixed into the electric wheelchair , then loosen the joystick and tip it downwards .
This is to reduce damage to the joystick because of additional weights being stacked on top of it .
For electrical wheelchair travelers who frequently Need to Move across the aisle of the transportation vehicle i.e. airplane or cruise , the electrical wheelchairs need to be left behind as they ’re too broad for the narrow aisle .
In such scenarios , the transportation operators need to offer aisle chairs that are skinny enough to maneuver down the aisle and deliver the wheelchair user to their chair .
This helps to appeal to the growing amount of educated wheelchair travelers globally and airlines also have gained in their picture since all surrounding partnerships with no discrimination .
As a Last bit of information for wheelchair travelers , do n’t assume the maintenance
Of your electrical wheelchairs are the prerogative of the transportation operators .
Wheelchair travel and collaborate with the normal operating procedures
Of the operators so much as you can .
Being polite is the secret here ,
It is going to also be the deciding factor if the you will like your Vacation or totally spoil it .
Pack up and revel in electrical wheelchair Users around !

The time has come for me to level my Final Judgment on VGXpo 2009 !
Another day of Philly kicking us in the nuts equaled us not being able to make is downtown for Day 3 .
The story is quite a long , complicated one that intertwines many smaller storied , but you ’ll need to listen to the podcast this week to hear the true hilarity .
Text can not do our weird night and morning justice .
For the purposes of this write - up , long story short style , after a four mile walk to find a car battery and some nipple clamps …
Just kidding , no nipple clamps .
But we did get a car battery .
And some live crabs .
We did n’t make it to the Expo today , though I do feel I garnered enough from Days 1 and 2 to render a verdict on this con .
Mediocre .
Unimpressive .
Sparse .
Lacking .
All of these words come to mind when I am asked to describe VGXpo 2009 .
Let me clarify .
None of those words mean the con was outright BAD .
It just was n’t in any way good .
A quick rundown of my reasoning is in order .
I ’ll start with the positives .
Or should I say positive ?
The Retro Gaming area was the shit .
Truely , I enjoyed the hell out of browsing a massive well priced selection of classic games and game systems .
Even bought a few .
Played a ton of arcade games .
It was great .
But the negatives are indeed plural .
They even get their own paragraph !
As I said , the con was very sparse .
At any given point in the exhibit hall , I felt I could have swung a guitar hero controller by the cord and not hit anyone or anything .
The booths were far apart , and really lent to the feeling of empty that overwhelmed VGXpo .
As far as apparel content , there was one excellent t- shirt booth , but that was it .
No hats , no patches , no bags or totes .
Where has that shit gone ?
I remember loving to buy that stuff at comicons and anime cons as a young kid .
The cosplay contest , while fun and overall pleasing , was more than a little disorganized .
Snapping a decent photo due to the setup was damn near impossible and the whole event just felt unpolished .
And VGXpo , you might want to take note of this .
The press passes that we got ?
Fucking USELESS .
We had NO abilities or access that the average con-goer did n’t have as well .
Hell , I think I saw more press pass armbands than non this weekend .
It seemed , overall , like a very disorganized con .
Even though the staff was very friendly , I have to give their knowledge of what the fuck was going on a 1/10 .
Sorry guys .
Very unimpressed .
I ’m not much of an anime fan these days due to the teenage fuckwits who have infiltrated the fan base , but I still attend Otakon each year due to it being a well run , smooth , fun , huge con .
I ’d like to take a quick moment to highlight a few products , vendors and developers I thought were either excellent or at least interesting .
I ’ll simply be proving links to THEIR content , because I ’m trying to be a sign to point our good readers to these people , rather than some kind of herald .
Also , they tend to explain their products much better than a giant wall of text can .
The best for last .
Garrison Carida .
A troop of Star Wars types , not sure whether to call them cosplayers , or professionals .
These guys are top notch in all ways .
Costume Quality , niceness , professionalism and just fun to be around .
Check out their site .
They ’re good people .
Now , a quick list of things to avoid !
The Philadelphia Airport Econolodge .
Again , please listen to the podcast to hear funny and exact reasons why .
Philadelphia Starbucks ’ WiFi .
Flyers fans while wearing a Penguins jersey <~~~ Me
VGXpo 2010 unless you ’re already in Philly .
Judging from this year alone , I cannot recommend anyone travel to or spend major funds on this thing .
Sorry guys .
Maybe next year I can change my tune , but the ball is in your court .
Thanks for sticking with us through the VGXpo 2009 coverage readers !
Be sure to check out Dave ’s photo albums from the con .
This was our first convention for pixelatedgeek.com , and it will only get better with time .
We ’re hoping to be at Game X Games & Media Expo on October 23 - 25 at the Philadelphia Expo Center .

Bird flu may be a sexually transmitted infection – at least in ducks .
That ’s the suggestion of an analysis of flu prevalence and mating behaviour that also proposes an easy way to spot duck populations most at risk of harbouring avian flu .
Surprisingly , the more rampant the sex a particular duck species indulges in , the lower the chance of spreading the virus .
It ’s all to do with penis size and the complexity of the females ’ vagina .
Lethal strains of avian flu virus can evolve from harmless versions and then jump to other species , so it is important to also monitor less dangerous strains in wild birds .
Ducks are the main wild hosts of bird flu , but surveillance is difficult without easy markers of infection risk .
Now Gergely Hegyi at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest , Hungary , and colleagues think they may have found just such a marker : the “ covert ” wing patches that ducks display during mating .
This finding builds on the previous work by the team , in which they found that species with large penises tend to have smaller wing patches , which are also more likely to be a single colour .

Sexual arms race
Most ducks form monogamous pairs but the males also often force sex on females because , unlike most birds , they have a phallus .
This has led to an evolutionary “ arms race ” between the sexes , with males evolving longer penises the better to inseminate the female , and females responding by evolving more complex vaginal anatomy to make insemination by unwelcome partners less likely .
When the researchers compared data on the prevalence of low - pathogenic bird flu strains in different duck species with what is known about the anatomy of duck reproductive parts and mating behaviour , they found that ducks with the smallest penises and tamest sex lives had the highest flu levels .
“ This is intriguing and a bit counter - intuitive because a long phallus prolongs copulation , and forced copulations characteristic to species with a large phallus should further promote virus transfer , ” says Hegyi .
The explanation may lie in the counter - adaptation of the female ducks .
“ Long and elaborate vaginas may hinder unwanted fertilisation but may also make it difficult for viruses acquired during copulation to reach the site of egg formation , ” Hegyi says .
Infection peak
This idea might help to explain why infections often peak during the breeding season .
The researchers think that mating may spread flu by pushing water contaminated with the virus onto developing eggs and so infect chicks before or during hatching – and that this will happen more readily in ducks with less complex vaginas .
Bird flu specialist John McCauley at the National Institute for Medical Research in London says that the idea of sexual flu transmission and its dependence on reproductive anatomy and copulation habits is interesting .
“ It ’s quite feasible that they are right , but it will be important to make sure that the epidemiological evidence is robust and not biased by differences in sampling methods . ”
Because duck species with small penises have larger and more colourful wing patches , Hegyi hopes that confirmation of the link between sex and flu might help to identify which wild populations are most likely to spread bird flu .
Monitoring effort can then be concentrated on these populations .
In addition , recognition of sexual transmission “ may require different biosafety measures in captive birds than those currently implemented , ” he says .

SAN JOSE , Costa Rica ( CNN ) -- Former Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of corruption during his term .
Former Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon , right , listens to his sentence on Monday in a San Jose court .
It was the first time in Costa Rica 's history that a former president had been tried for corruption .
Calderon had previously stated his intention to run for the presidency again in 2010 .
Calderon , who was president from 1990 to 1994 , was accused of embezzling government funds from the state 's social security system .
The former president fidgeted and darted his eyes back and forth , as Judge Alejandro Lopez McAdam read the five - year sentence on Monday after the conviction was handed down .
Prosecutors had asked for a 24 - year sentence .
Seven other people also were sentenced to prison terms for taking kickbacks from millions of dollars of purchases made through the state 's social security system .
Eliseo Vargas , the head of the social security program during Calderon 's term , also was sentenced to five years in prison .
Calderon will not be imprisoned immediately , pending the outcome of an appeal .
CNN 's Djenane Villanueva contributed to this report .

Dell has been teasing its ultrathin Adamo XPS for weeks now , but all that goofing off will come to a solemn end next Thursday .
On the same day that we sit down with Microsoft 's CEO Steve Ballmer ( and a little OS by the name of Windows 7 hits store shelves ) , Dell will also fully reveal the planet 's slimmest laptop .
The 0.39 - inch Adamo XPS will cost $ 2,000 , and while the nitty - gritty details are still under wraps , a new Business Week article notes that it 'll boast a " heat - sensing strip on the lip that , when swiped with a finger , glows white and automatically opens the aluminum lid . "
The glamorous machine is part of a larger effort within the Round Rock powerhouse to revitalize itself and get people talking once again , and while this particular slab will obviously not be a high volume product , it could very well get a few more eyes pointed in its direction .
Call us crazy , but we 're guessing next week is going to be a wee bit zany .

Sponsors of a bill to revoke the antitrust exemption of the health insurance industry will try to add it to the House healthcare overhaul when it comes before the Rules Committee .
Rep. Diana DeGette ( D - Colo. ) , a lead co-sponsor of the bill , said Tuesday she would like to see the measure wrapped into the healthcare legislation by the committee , or seek to have Rules allow a floor vote on the amendment .
The House Judiciary Committee is to vote on the bill Wednesday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Supporters of the legislation say that while lawmakers try to instill competition in healthcare markets , they should also make price - fixing illegal .
“ Why are our insurance companies exempt from antitrust laws ? ” DeGette said .
“ There are only two industries with that exemption : insurance and Major League Baseball .
If it ever had a rationale , it ’s no longer operative . ”
DeGette said she has heard very little opposition to the bill .
In the Senate , Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyBipartisan representatives demand answers on expired surveillance programs Democrats shoot down talk of expanding Supreme Court Battle over timing complicates Democratic shutdown strategy MORE ( D - Vt. ) and other Democrats have introduced a similar bill .
The health insurance industry angered many Democrats earlier this month when its trade group , America ’s Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) , issued a report saying some provisions of the Senate Finance Committee ’s healthcare bill would raise premiums .
Critics said the study excluded provisions that would lower premiums .
But supporters say the antitrust push has nothing to do with anger at the report or the industry .
AHIP has told lawmakers that the exemption is misunderstood and does not prevent the application of antitrust laws .
Instead , AHIP President Karen Ignani wrote to lawmakers that it simply recognizes that states play a central role in regulating insurance .
“ Health insurance is one of the most significantly regulated areas of the economy , ” Ignani wrote .
The anti-gun campaign lost supporters in the last few weeks
Sixty - four percent of those who voted rejected the proposed ban , which was backed by the government , the Catholic Church and the United Nations .
The gun ownership lobby successfully argued that guns were needed for personal security .
Guns kill one person in Brazil every 15 minutes , giving it the world 's highest death toll from firearms .
Last year , there were 36,000 shooting deaths .
The UN says guns are the biggest cause of death among young people in Brazil .
The immediate consequence of the referendum is that gun shops will remain open .
Individual rights
The BBC's Steve Kingstone in Sao Paulo says that the result may surprise outsiders , given the horrific scale of gun violence in Brazil .
The defeated " Yes " campaign had enjoyed an early lead in the opinion polls , but it was quickly outmanoeuvred .
The " No " campaign convinced voters that the proposed ban would have no effect on criminals , on the grounds that criminals do not buy guns legally in shops .
AGAINST THE BAN
If I had the money , I would have a weapon to try to protect myself and my family ...
The police are never going to arrive in time
Maria
Shantytown resident
Gun crime blights Rio slums
Beni Barbosa , the " No " campaign spokesman , said : " We managed to get our message across that Brazilians have individual rights which the state cannot take away . "
" Here , people were not choosing whether to have a gun or not .
They were voting for their rights to choose . "
Anti-gun campaigners said the swing away from a " Yes " vote was the result of people 's desire to protest against the government 's security policy .
" We did n't lose because Brazilians like guns .
We lost because people do n't have confidence in the government or the police , " said Denis Mizne , of anti-violence group Sou da Paz .
" The ' No ' campaign was much more effective .
They are talking about a right to have a gun - it is a totally American debate . "
Anti-gun campaigners also accused gun makers and lobby groups such as the US National Rifle Association ( NRA ) of manipulating people 's fears .
Millions of guns
The referendum has been watched closely by other countries where gun-ownership is under debate .
In Washington , an NRA spokesman called the result " a victory for freedom " .
Some opposition came from favelas , often the scene of turf wars
The referendum rounded off a series of campaigns run by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to cut down on gun crime .
Penalties for unlawfully carrying a gun have been increased , and money has been offered to people who surrender their weapons in amnesties .
The proposal to ban firearms initially had strong public support .
But opinion polls in recent days showed this backing had weakened dramatically as campaigns against the ban got off the ground .
Some opposition to the ban also came from shanty towns , or favelas , the scene of vicious turf wars between drug gangs .
Maria , a shantytown resident whose sister was gunned down by an ex-boyfriend , said disarmament would make little difference .
" If I had the money , I would have a weapon to try to protect myself and my family , " she told the BBC .
" The police are never going to arrive in time and if they do , they may kill you . "
There are estimated to be more than 17 million guns in Brazil , nine million of which are not registered , according to a survey by non-governmental groups .
