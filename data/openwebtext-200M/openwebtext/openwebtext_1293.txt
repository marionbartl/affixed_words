The US has 50 to 60 detainees whom it has been unable to repatriate Six Chinese Uighur prisoners from the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay have been transferred to the Pacific island nation of Palau , officials say .
Lawyers for three of them said they had " arrived to freedom " early on Sunday .
Palau agreed in June to take up to a dozen Uighurs who were captured during the US - led war in Afghanistan but not later classified as " enemy combatants " .
China wants them to be returned there , but the US says it cannot repatriate them due to the risk of mistreatment .
Beijing has frequently cracked down on Uighur dissidents , who it accuses of seeking an independent homeland in the western province of Xinjiang .
Four other Uighur detainees were resettled in Bermuda earlier this year , and another five went to Albania in 2006 .
' Safe from oppression ' A law firm representing three of the six Uighurs released from Guantanamo on Saturday confirmed that they had arrived safely at their new home in the main town of Koror .
The men are happy at long last to be free
Eric Tirschwell
Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel
" These men want nothing more than to live peaceful , productive lives in a free , democratic nation safe from oppression by the Chinese , " Eric Tirschwell of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel told the Associated Press .
" Thanks to Palau , which has graciously offered them a temporary home , they now have that chance , " he added .
Mr Tirschwell said the men had already begun learning English and looked forward to become productive members of the community .
The men will live in a three - storey building which is a five - minute walk from Koror 's only mosque , one of two on the island .
The President of Palau , Johnson Toribiong , told the BBC that the Uighers would be given a temporary home for as long as two years .
" Initially , they will be attending a crash course in the English language and of our culture and history for a couple of months .
We 'll interview them to find out about their skills , and then try to place them where they 'll be gainfully employed , " he said .
Palau has a Muslim population of about 500 , mostly migrant workers from Bangladesh .
Many face being deported due to lapsed work permits .
In addition to the six Uighurs who arrived on Sunday , the island nation has offered to take six of the seven others still being held at Guantanamo .
One did not receive an invitation because of concerns about his mental health .
The American defence department decided last year that the Uighur detainees were not enemy combatants , but they were refused the right to settle in the US .
China has demanded that the men be extradited but the US says they would face persecution .
Palau , a former US trust territory , is an archipelago of eight main islands plus more than 250 islets that is best known for diving and tourism and is located some 800 km ( 500 miles ) east of the Philippines .
The tiny nation has retained close ties with Washington since independence in 1994 when it signed a Compact of Free Association with the US .
It relies heavily on the US for aid and defence , and does not have diplomatic relations with China .
The latest departures from Guantanamo occurred after the US Supreme Court , rejecting the government 's position , said it would hear an appeal by the Uighurs , who have argued that they should be released onto US soil .
There are now 215 detainees remaining at the prison camp , which President Barack Obama has pledged to close by 22 January .

The Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Thailand is famous for their unique attractions , fun shows , and the ability for tourists to get close to ( and often touch ) the tigers .
However , the most famous attraction is the couplings of pigs and tigers :
These pictures show two year old Saimai , a Royal Bengal tigress , with the six piglets she is raising .
The tiger does n’t seem to mind the unclothed piglets , so I ’m guessing the costumes were just meant to put on a cute show for the tourists .
Either that or she ate the first set of tiger - clad piglets and the zoo has n’t had time to create new outfits .
While the zoo and all press materials claim the pairings are completely benevolent , I personally wonder if Saimai just views her pig-raising duties as a long “ getting ready for dinner ” ritual .
Fittingly , Saimai herself was cared for and nursed by a pig :
Thanks Renee !

The president ’s new mosque shimmers over this ancient city like an illusion of stability against images of MIG fighter jets screeching overhead toward rebellion in the north or the latest news of pirates seizing ships in the treacherous Gulf of Aden .
In Sana ’s snug alleys , men speak of war , secession and Al Qaeda , which is busy scouring schoolyards and mosques for new recruits while much of the population spends hours each day getting a mellow buzz from chewing khat leaves .
If Yemen were a theater , which sometimes it appears to be , it would be an unnerving place of trapdoors and shifting facades .
This is the poorest nation in the Arab world and one of the most strategically located , with 3 million barrels of oil sailing daily past its shores , tucked between Saudi Arabia and Somalia .
And it is a teetering mess that some in Washington fear could draw the U.S. into a conflict with extremists at the intersection of the Middle East and the lawless Horn of Africa .
“ We are a failed state , ” said Abubakr A. Badeeb , a leading member of the opposition Socialist Party .
“ Yemen can no longer protect the rights of its citizens . ”
Others regard the country as a “ failing ” state , and the tricky thing about Yemen is parsing fact from fiction .
Every scenario has a counter - narrative ; every surface pulses with a beguiling underside .
Is Al Qaeda a grave threat , or is its strength exaggerated by a government that needs U.S. attention and billions of dollars in aid from Persian Gulf nations ?
Is the war in the north a rebellion by a disaffected sect , or is it turning into a perilous proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran , with the Saudis already launching military strikes across the border ?
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh for almost 20 years has balanced conflicting tribal and sectarian voices , but his government ’s grip is slipping .
FOR THE RECORD :
An earlier version of the online headline for this article referred to Yemen as “ tiny , ” which is an incorrect characterization of the nation .
Al Qaeda ’s aim is to exploit the economic crisis and domestic turmoil , overthrow the government and build a base for attacks across the region , Western and Yemeni intelligence officials say .
Worried about terrorism and protecting oil supplies , the U.S. is working on a military cooperation pact with Yemen that includes training Yemeni special forces .
“ Al Qaeda in the past focused on bombings and suicide attacks , but now it is also able to target security forces , ” said Saeed Ali O. Jemhi , an expert on terrorist groups in Yemen .
“ They have sympathizers and agents within the Yemeni security and intelligence forces .
Al Qaeda is in a renewing stage , and its aim is to spread an Islamic caliphate across the Arabian Peninsula . ”
Washington ’s concern about Yemen has intensified since 2000 , when militants slammed a motorboat packed with explosives into the U.S. destroyer Cole in the port of Aden , killing 17 sailors .
The U.S. Embassy here in Sana , the capital , was attacked in 2008 , leaving 19 dead , including a U.S. citizen .
But non-military U.S. aid to Yemen has remained modest ; this year totaling $ 24 million , up from $ 9.3 million the previous year .
The Obama administration has requested about $ 65 million in counter - terrorism and military assistance .
It ’s a discomfiting task to choose Yemen ’s most pressing problem .
Corruption is rampant , unemployment is 35 % , child malnutrition is rising , water shortages are severe and oil reserves are shrinking .
It says something about a country ’s priorities that most of its dwindling water supply goes to irrigating khat , whose bitter - tasting leaves have for generations kept Yemenis in a sedated haze .
“ Owing to the central government ’s historically weak control , the country has often been on the brink of chaos , ” said Christopher Boucek , an analyst with the Carnegie Center for International Peace .
“ Yemen has survived individual challenges in the past , but what differentiates the situation today is that multiple interconnected challenges are poised to converge at the same time . ”
The secessionist movement in the south threatens to split the country , but bombs and a surge of more than 175,000 people fleeing the war in the northwest is the consuming topic these days .
There , Houthi rebels , Shiites of the Zaidi sect that had ruled for centuries , are battling Yemeni and Saudi forces along a border that stretches to the shipping lanes of the Red Sea .
The fighting , which began in August when the government launched Operation Scorched Earth , is the latest in a sporadic five - year insurgency .
The Houthis say they are persecuted and marginalized , and they condemn Saleh , who is also a Zaidi , for being influenced by Sunni Wahhabi ideology from Saudi Arabia .
The conflict , however , is rooted less in religion than in government failures and historical animosities in a mountainous region controlled by clans and tribes .
“ The government has n’t offered jobs , education or development , ” said Mohammed Sabri , a political analyst .
“ The government thinks the war is a way to keep it in power .
But they ’ve chosen the wrong time and wrong place , and given the nation ’s circumstances , the war is spinning out of their control and they ’re trying to turn this businessmen ’s war into a proxy war . ”
The Shiite and Sunni sectarian overtones have given the hostilities wider regional implications .
The government says the Houthis are supported by Shiite - majority Iran .
Tehran has denied the charges and the Yemeni regime has offered no credible evidence to back its assertions .
Saudi Arabia joined the war in early November after cross - border raids by Houthis .
Riyadh fears two scenarios :
The uprising will inspire unrest among the country ’s persecuted Shiite minority near its eastern oil fields , and that it will create a porous border for Al Qaeda militants to enter the kingdom to attack oil depots and government institutions .
A Saudi militant based in Yemen slipped into the kingdom in August and blew himself up at a palace reception .
Saudia Arabia ’s top counter - terrorism official , Muhammad bin Nayef , a member of the royal family , was injured .
The attack reaffirmed to the kingdom , Yemen ’s biggest aid donor , that its southern neighbor was too strategically important to let it spiral into anarchy .
Politicians and clerics in Saudi Arabia and Iran have traded scathing rhetoric over Yemen , but so far the countries have avoided increasing military tensions .
The kingdom is suspicious of Iran ’s ambitions , nuclear program and connections to the militant groups Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki recently issued a veiled warning over the Saudi intervention in Yemen , saying that “ those who pour oil on the fire must know that they will not be spared from the smoke that billows . ”
What ’s perhaps more troubling in the prospect of a failed Yemen is the effect it would have on the unstable Horn of Africa , where pirates roam and Al Qaeda cells hunker beneath U.S. predator drones .
Recent reports suggest that Houthi rebels may be training in camps in Somalia and that African refugees and mercenaries have joined Houthi ranks .
This raises questions about the ability of Yemeni security forces to deal with multiple threats from sea and land .
“ With the modest navy we have we ’re trying , but we need international help .
Piracy is a serious problem for everyone , ” said Mohammed Abulahoum , a member of the ruling General People ’s Congress party .
“ The U.S. needs a success story in the region .
Yemen is important and Washington could have that success with a lower price tag than you would think . ”
The Saudi navy is patrolling the Red Sea to prevent arms and fighters from reaching the rebels .
Iran has warships off the southern coast to protect shipping lanes , it says , from pirates .
The confluence of so many competing and dangerous agendas , Yemen is small but too big to ignore .
“ Somalia and the Horn of Africa , ” Jemhi said , “ are to Yemen what Afghanistan is to Pakistan . ”

Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach , it is desirable , in order to break through that tyranny , that people should be eccentric .
Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded ; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius , mental vigor , and moral courage it contained .
That so few dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time .
John Stuart Mill
The millions are awake enough for physical labor ; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion , only one in a hundred million to a poetic or divine life .
To be awake is to be alive ...
We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake , not by mechanical aids , but by an infinite expectation of the dawn .
Thoreau
Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth - more than ruin - more even than death ...
Thought is subversive and revolutionary , destructive and terrible , thought is merciless to privilege , established institutions , and comfortable habit .
Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid .
Thought is great and swift and free , the light of the world , and the chief glory of man .
Bertrand Russell
He is a man of capacity who possesses considerable intellectual riches : while he is a man of genius who finds out a vein of new ore .
Originality is the seeing nature differently from others , and yet as it is in itself .
It is not singularity or affectation , but the discovery of new and valuable truth .
All the world do not see the whole meaning of any object they have been looking at .
Habit blinds them to some things : shortsightedness to others .
Every mind is not a gauge and measure of truth .
Nature has her surface and her dark recesses .
She is deep , obscure , and infinite .
It is only minds on whom she makes her fullest impressions that can penetrate her shrine or unveil her Holy of Holies .
It is only those whom she has filled with her spirit that have the boldness or the power to reveal her mysteries to others .
William Hazlitt
The moment one definitely commits oneself , then providence moves too .
All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred .
A whole stream of events issues from the decisions , raising in one 's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way .
Whatever you can do or dream you can , begin it .
Boldness has genius , power and magic in it .
Begin it now .
Goethe
Action , so to speak , is the genius of nature .

When a true genius appears in this world , you may know him by this sign , that the dunces are all in confederacy against him .
Jonathan Swift
Society is a republic .
When an individual endeavors to lift himself above his fellows , he is dragged down by the mass , either by means of ridicule or of calumny .
No one shall be more virtuous or more intellectually gifted than others .
Whoever , by the irresistable force of genius , rises above the common herd is certain to be ostracized by society , which will pursue him with such merciless derision and detraction that at last he will be compelled to retreat into the solitude of his thoughts .
Heinrich Heine
Genius is its own reward ; for the best that one is , one must necessarily be for oneself ...
Further , genius consists in the working of the free intellect . , and as a consequence the productions of genius serve no useful purpose .
The work of genius may be music , philosophy , painting , or poetry ; it is nothing for use or profit .
To be useless and unprofitable is one of the characteristics of genius ; it is their patent of nobility .
Schopenhauer
Genius does not herd with genius .
OW Holmes
This is the test and triumph of originality , not to show us what has never been , and what we may therefore very easily never have dreamt of , but to point out to us what is before our eyes and under our feet , though we have had no suspicion of its existence , for want of sufficient strength of intuition , of determined grasp of mind to seize and retain it .
William Hazlitt
The only difference between a genius and one of common capacity is that the former anticipates and explores what the latter accidentally hits upon ; but even the man of genius himself more frequently employs the advantages that chance presents him ; it is the lapidary who gives value to the diamond which the peasant has dug up without knowing its value .
Abbe Guillaume Raynal
What makes men of genius , or rather , what they make , is not new ideas , it is that idea - possessing them - that what has been said has still not been said enough .

Genius never desires what does not exist .
Kierkegaard
The great things in life are what they seem to be .
And for that reason , strange as it may sound to you , often are very difficult to interpret ( understand ) .
Great passions are for the great of souls .
Great events can only be seen by people who are on a level with them .
We think we can have our visions for nothing .
We cannot .
Even the finest and most self - sacrificing visions have to paid for .
Strangely enough , that is what makes them fine .
Oscar Wilde
Fortunately for us , there have been traitors and there have been heretics , blasphemers , thinkers , investigators , lovers of liberty , men of genius who have given their lives to better the condition of their fellow - men .
It may be well enough here to ask the question :
What is greatness ?
A great man adds to the sum of knowledge , extends the horizon of thought , releases souls from the Bastille of fear , crosses unknown and mysterious seas , gives new islands and new continents to the domain of thought , new constellations to the firmament of mind .
A great man does not seek applause or place ; he seeks for truth ; he seeks the road to happiness , and what he ascertains he gives to others .
A great man throws pearls before swine , and the swine are sometimes changed to men .
If the great had always kept their pearls , vast multitudes would be barbarians now .
A great man is a torch in the darkness , a beacon : in superstition 's night , an inspiration and a prophecy .
Greatness is not the gift of majorities ; it can not be thrust upon any man ; men cannot give it to another ; they can give place and power , but not greatness .
The place does not make the man , nor the scepter the king .
Greatness is from within .
Robert Ingersoll
Some superior minds are unrecognized because there is no standard by which to weigh them .
Joseph Joubert
It is impossible that a genius - at least a literary genius - can ever be discovered by his intimates ; they are so close to him that he is out of focus to them and they can't get at his proportions ; they can't perceive that there is any considerable difference between his bulk and their own .

Otto Weininger on Genius
The man of genius is he who understands incomparably more other beings than the average man .
Goethe is said to have said of himself that there was no vice or crime of which he could not trace the tendency in himself , and that at some period of his life he could not have understood fully .
The genius , therefore , is a more complicated , more richly endowed , more varied man ; and a man is the closer to being a genius the more men he has in his personality , and the more really and strongly he has these others within him .
If comprehension of those about him only flickers in him like a poor candle , then he is unable , like the great poet , to kindle a mighty flame in his heroes , to give distinction and character to his creations .
The ideal of an artistic genius is to live in all men , to lose himself in all men , to reveal himself in multitudes ; and so also the aim of the philosopher is to discover all others in himself , to fuse them into a unit which is his own unit .
Otto Weininger
The ideal genius , who has all men within him , has also all their preferences and all their dislikes .
There is in him not only the universality of men , but of all nature .
He is the man to whom all things tell their secrets , to whom most happens , and whom least escapes .
He understands most things , and those most deeply , because he has the greatest number of things to contrast and compare them with .
The genius is he who is conscious of most , and of that most acutely .
And so without doubt his sensations must be most acute ; but this must not be understood as implying , say , in the artist the keenest power of vision , in the composer the most acute hearing ; the measure of genius is not to be taken from the acuteness of the sense organ but from that of the perceiving brain .
Otto Weininger
Universality is the distinguishing mark of genius .
There is no such thing as a special genius , a genius for mathematics , or for music , or even for chess , but only a universal genius .
The genius is a man who knows everything without having learned it .
Otto Weininger
I regret that I must so continually use the word genius , as if that should apply only to a caste as well defined from those below as income - tax payers are from the untaxed .
The word genius was very probably invented by a man who had small claims on it himself ; greater men would have understood better what to be a genius really was , and probably they would have come to see that the word could be applied to most people .
Goethe said that perhaps only a genius is able to understand a genius . -
Otto Weininger
The reason why madness overtakes so many men of genius - fools believe it comes from the influence of Venus , or the spinal degeneration of neurasthenics - is that for many the burden becomes too heavy , the task of bearing the whole world on the shoulders , like Atlas , intolerable for the smaller , but never for the really mighty minds .
But the higher a man mounts , the greater may be his fall ; all genius is a conquering of chaos , mystery , and darkness , and if it degenerates and goes to pieces , the ruin is greater in proportion to the success .
The genius which runs to madness is no longer genius ; it has chosen happiness instead of morality .
All madness is the outcome of the insupportability of suffering attached to all consciousness .
Otto Weininger
No one suffers so much as he [ the genius ] with the people , and , therefore , for the people , with whom he lives .
For , in a certain sense , it is certainly only " by suffering " that a man knows .
If compassion is not itself clear , abstractly conceivable or visibly symbolic knowledge , it is , at any rate , the strongest impulse for the acquisition of knowledge .
It is only by suffering that the genius understands men .
And the genius suffers most because he suffers with and in each and all ; but he suffers most through his understanding .
. . .
Otto Weininger
It results from their periodicity that , in men of genius , sterile years precede productive years , these again to be followed by sterility , the barren periods being marked by psychological self - depreciation , by the feeling that they are less than other men ; times in which the remembrance of the creative periods is a torment , and when they envy those who go about undisturbed by such penalties .
Just as his moments of ecstasy are more poignant , so are the periods of depression of a man of genius more intense than those of other men .
Every great man has such periods , of longer or shorter duration , times in which he loses self - confidence , in which he thinks of suicide ; times in which , indeed , he may be sowing the seeds of a future harvest , but which are devoid of the stimulus to production ; times which call forth the blind criticisms ' How such a genius is degenerating ! '
' How he has played himself out ! '
' How he repeates himself ! ' and so forth .
Otto Weininger
Talent is hereditary ; it may be the common possession of a whole family ( eg , the Bach family ) ; genius is not transmitted ; it is never diffused , but is strictly individual .
Otto Weininger
The age does not create the genius it requires .
The genius is not the product of his age , is not to be explained by it , and we do him no honour if we attempt to account for him by it . . .
And as the causes of its appearance do not lie in any one age , so also the consequences are not limited by time .
The achievements of genius live for ever , and time cannot change them .
By his works a man of genius is granted immortality on the earth , and thus in a threefold manner he has transcended time .
His universal comprehension and memory forbid the annihilation of his experiences with the passing of the moment in which each occurred ; his birth is independent of his age , and his work never dies .
Otto Weininger
Genius is , in its essence , nothing but the full completion of the idea of a man , and , therefore , every man ought to have some quality of it , and it should be regarded as a possible principle for every one .
Genius is the highest morality , and , therefore , it is every one 's duty .
Genius is to be attained by a supreme act of the will , in which the whole universe is affirmed in the individual .
Genius is something which ' men of genius ' take upon themselves ; it is the greatest exertion and the greatest pride , the greatest misery and the greatest ecstasy to a man .
A man may become a genius if he wishes to .
But at once it will certainly be said : " Very many men would like very much to be ' original geniuses , ' " and their wish has no effect .
But if these men who " would like very much " had a livelier sense of what is signified by their wish , if they were aware that genius is identical with universal responsibility - and until that is grasped it will only be a wish and not a determination - it is highly probable that a very large number of these men would cease to wish to become geniuses .
Otto Weininger
The most powerful musical motifs of world - music are those in which the representation of the breaking - through of time within time , the breaking out of time , is attempted , in which an ictus falls upon the tonic such that it reabsorbs the other parts of the melody ( which as a whole represents time ; separate points unified by the I ) and in this manner sublimates the melody .
The end of the Grail - motif in ' Parsifal , ' the Siegfried - motif , are such melodies .
There is , however , an act that , so to speak , reabsorbs the future in itself , experiences in advance all future falling back into immorality already as guilt , no less than all the immoral past , and by this means grows out over and beyond both : A timeless setting of the character , rebirth .
It is the act by which genius comes to be .
Otto Weininger
Since the soul of man is the microcosm , and great men are those who live entirely in and through their souls , the whole universe thus having its being in them , the female must be described as absolutely without the quality of genius .
. . .
There is no female genius , and there never has been one . . . and there never can be one .
Those who are in favour of laxity in these matters , and are anxious to extend and enlarge the idea of genius in order to make it possible to include women , would simply by such action destroy the concept of genius .
. . .
How could a soulless being possess genius ?
The possession of genius is identical with profundity ; and if any one were to try to combine woman and profundity as subject and predicate , he would be contradicted on all sides .
A female genius is a contradiction in terms , for genius is simply intensified , perfectly developed , universally conscious maleness .
Otto Weininger
Mankind occurs as male or female , as something or nothing .
Woman has no share in ontological reality , no relation to the thing - in - itself , which , in the deepest interpretation , is the absolute , is God .
Man in his highest form , the genius , has such a relation , and for him the absolute is either the conception of the highest worth of existence , in which case he is a philosopher ; or it is the wonderful fairyland of dreams , the kingdom of absolute beauty , and then he is an artist .
Otto Weininger
In those rare individual cases where women approach genius they also approach masculinity .
Otto Weininger
The man of genius possesses , like everything else , the complete female in himself ; but woman herself is only a part of the Universe , and the part can never be the whole ; femaleness can never include genius .
This lack of genius on the part of woman is inevitable because woman is not a monad , and cannot reflect the Universe .
Otto Weininger
There are probably very few people who have not at some time of their lives had some quality of genius .
If they have not had such , it is probable that they have also been without great sorrow or great pain .
They would have needed only to live sufficiently intently for a time for some quality to reveal itself .
The poems of first love are a case in point , and certainly such love is a sufficient stimulus .
Otto Weininger
A nation orients itself by its own geniuses , and derives from them its ideas of its own ideals , but the guiding star serves also as a light to other nations .
As speech has been created by a few great men , the most extraordinary wisdom lies concealed in it , a wisdom which reveals itself to a few ardent explorers but which is usually overlooked by the stupid professional philologists .
Otto Weininger
The genius is not a critic of language , but its creator , as he is the creator of all the mental achievements which are the material of culture and which make up the objective mind , the spirit of the peoples .
The " timeless " men are those who make history , for history can be made only by those who are not floating with the stream .
It is only those who are unconditioned by time who have real value , and whose productions have an enduring force .
And the events that become forces of culture become so only because they have an enduring value . -
Otto Weininger
It is the genius in reality and not the other who is the creator of history , for it is only the genius who is outside and unconditioned by history .
The great man has a history , the emperor is only a part of history .
The great man transcends time ; time creates and time destroys the emperor .
Otto Weininger
It is certainly true that most men need some kind of a God .
A few , and they are the men of genius , do not bow to an alien law .
The rest try to justify their doings and misdoings , their thinking and existence ( at least the menial side of it ) , to some one else , whether it be the personal God of the Jews , or a beloved , respected , and revered human being .
It is only in this way that they can bring their lives under the social law .
. . .
Otto Weininger
The ego of the genius accordingly is simply itself universal comprehension , the centre of infinite space ; the great man contains the whole universe within himself ; genius is the living microcosm .
He is not an intricate mosaic , a chemical combination of an infinite number of elements ; the argument in chap .
iv. as to his relation to other men and things must not be taken in that sense ; he is everything .
In him and through him all psychical manifestations cohere and are real experiences , not an elaborate piece - work , a whole put together from parts in the fashion of science .
For the genius the ego is the all , lives as the all ; the genius sees nature and all existences as whole ; the relations of things flash on him intuitively ; he has not to build bridges of stones between them .
Otto Weininger
The man of genius is he whose ego has acquired consciousness .
He is enabled by it to distinguish the fact that others are different , to perceive the " ego " of other men , even when it is not pronounced enough for them to be conscious of it themselves .
But it is only he who feels that every other man is also an ego , a monad , an individual centre of the universe , with specific manner of feeling and thinking and a distinct past , he alone is in a position to avoid making use of his neighbours as means to an end .
Otto Weininger
The history of the human race ( naturally I mean the history of its mind and not merely its wars ) is readily intelligible on the theory of the appearance of genius , and of the imitation by the more monkey - like individuals of the conduct of those with genius .
The chief stages , no doubt , were house - building , agriculture , and above all , speech .
Every single word has been the invention of a single man , as , indeed , we still see , if we leave out of consideration the merely technical terms .
How else could language have arisen ?
The earliest words were " onomatopoetic " ; a sound similar to the exciting cause was evolved almost without the will of the speaker , in direct response to the sensuous stimulation .
All the other words were originally metaphors , or comparisons , a kind of primitive poetry , for all prose has come from poetry .
Many , perhaps the majority of the greatest geniuses , have remained unknown .
Think of the proverbs , now almost commonplaces , such as " one good turn deserves another . "
These were said for the first time by some great man .
How many quotations from the classics , or sayings of Christ , have passed into the common language , so that we have to think twice before we can remember who were the authors of them .
Language is as little the work of the multitude as our ballads .
Every form of speech owes much that is not acknowledged to individuals of another language .
Because of the universality of genius , the words and phrases that he invents are useful not only to those who use the language in which he wrote them .
A nation orients itself by its own geniuses , and derives from them its ideas of its own ideals , but the guiding star serves also as a light to other nations .
As speech has been created by a few great men , the most extraordinary wisdom lies concealed in it , a wisdom which reveals itself to a few ardent explorers but which is usually overlooked by the stupid professional philologists .

With five weeks remaining in the aughts , pre-teens , double zeroes or whatever we end up calling the 2000s , the title for " Biggest Sports Story of the Decade " was up for grabs .
Michael Vick ?
Tim Donaghy ?
The Mitchell report ?
The Artest melee ?
Barry Bonds ?
Pat Tillman ?
Eagle , Colo .?
Roger Clemens ?
Andre Agassi's admission that he won Wimbledon with a weave ?
You could have made a case for any of them .
And then ... Tiger happened .
Game over .
I 'm calling it the " Tiger Zoo " instead of " TigerGate , " only because we have to break the habit of slapping " gate " at the end of everything .
But the Tiger Zoo nailed every gotta - have - it component for a big - time story with legs .
First , it involved one of the most famous living athletes .
Second , it started definitively with a specific incident -- and not just any incident , but something that made us say , " Wait , this seems fishy , I wonder what really happened here ... , " and quickly became more complex than we imagined .
Third , it built steam over the next week , crossed into the mainstream and dominated conversations , e-mails and tweets .
Fourth , it transformed our collective perception of a famous person and made us re-evaluate every opinion we had about him .
Fifth , it grew so enormous so quickly that everyone with a forum ( radio show , column , blog , whatever ) felt obligated to come up with an angle on it .
Sixth , it does n't show any signs of slowing down ; if anything , it 's gaining steam like a hurricane plowing toward Florida .
Seventh , it involves three of the gotta - have - it basics in any gigantic story : sex , ( possible ) violence and a ( possible ) cover -up .
Eighth , there 's an unanswerable question looming over everything : Even if Tiger did cheat on his wife , should it matter to anyone other than them ?
( My answer : It should n't .
But that 's the rub of being a public figure .
If you do n't want to be a public figure , do n't do commercials , do n't cover yourself in Nike logos and do n't sell a video game with your name on it . )
And ninth , it 's a conspiracy - friendly saga that lends itself to all kinds of inventive angles , an absolute must for any story to maintain dominance .
That last point cemented the Tiger Zoo as an iconic story .
Maybe Michael
Vick 's fall from grace was mildly incredible on paper , but there were no real layers to it .
The facts came out , Vick 's reputation was tarnished , he paid a price , and that was that .
People across America were n't having arguments at cocktail parties about Vick , nor were they spending dinners breaking down facts and spouting opinions like Mel Kiper and Todd McShay debating the NFL draft .
But Tiger ?
Put it this way ...
You will attend a holiday party this weekend .
You will start talking about Tiger with one or two other people .
A few others will drift over saying , " Are you talking about Tiger ? "
Within a few minutes , the circle will be eight - deep .
Conspiracy theories will be flying as Elvis ' " Blue Christmas " plays in the background .
Somebody 's girlfriend or wife will say , " If that ever happened with [ my man ] , I 'd go after him with a golf club . "
Everyone will laugh .
Eventually , you will start talking about Obama or the Saints or something .
And then an hour later ?
The same conversation will happen in another part of the room .
In a way , that 's been the most unfathomable part of this story .
Tiger Woods dominating the conversation at a holiday party ???
For years , nobody had an interesting take on him other than , " Wow , that guy 's great . "
I even wrote an entire column in 2002 titled , " Tiger : What Can You Say ? "
He designed it that way , avoiding the media other than generic news conferences and cream - puff interviews designed to promote himself or a product .
( Like this " 10 minutes with Tiger " piece I wrote in 2006 . )
We knew little about his personal life beyond " married a Swedish nanny , lives in Orlando , has two kids . "
Not since DiMaggio had an athlete managed to stay this famous and this private at the same time .
Hell , he named his yacht " Privacy . "
He relished it .

Presswire A few weeks ago , what did we really know about Tiger ?
Not much other than his skills on the golf course .
Of course , he also relished the spoils that came with his immense fame ... and that 's where it became a problem .
On Thanksgiving night , the superstar who controlled everything suddenly had something he could n't control .
The subsequent two weeks illustrated , in ugly detail , every problem with journalism right now .
There are no lines anymore .
There is no middleman or filter .
Stories change constantly , sometimes four or five times per day , and the accuracy of those stories does n't totally matter as long as there 's a story in the first place .
On Thursday , three different friends forwarded me a clip of a porn actress bragging for 90 seconds about an alleged tryst with Tiger six months ago .
Not exactly the most credible source .
Did I watch the clip ?
Of course .
I could n't help it .
The source of information no longer matters , just the information itself .
We all do it .
We all send the e-mails and texts , and we all read them .
Watch this , this is probably not true but still crazy .
Read this , might be a kernel of truth in here .
This would be so funny if it 's actually true .
In the pre-teen double - zero aughts , these mega-stories are like Maximus in " Gladiator , " covered in blood after a fresh kill and screaming at everyone sitting in the Colosseum , " Are you not entertained ?
Are you not entertained ?
Is that not why you are here ? "
We do n't want to be crammed into the Colosseum , but we can't help ourselves .
We also never imagined that Tiger would be wearing the Maximus outfit , and maybe that 's the bigger issue here .
See , we spent 12 years following a guy we did n't know at all .
We had little to no connection to someone who was better at golf than we were at anything .
We checked tournaments on Saturdays and Sundays thinking one thing : " How is Tiger doing ? "
We invested an inordinate amount of time supporting someone who made it clear that he did n't care about us unless we were buying one of the products he endorsed .
He was fine with the arrangement , and so were we .
We got to watch him play golf .
He got the trophies , the trophy wife and the spoils .
Everyone was happy .
And yet ... we wondered about him .
Little stuff .
Why could n't he learn how to successfully high - five his caddie ?
How did he end up with a Swedish nanny ?
What did they have in common ?
What were his hobbies ?
How did he spend his time while recovering from knee surgery ?
Why did his temper keep bubbling to the surface this year ?
Who were his friends ?
Could he hold a conversation during dinner ?
What mattered to him ?
You wonder these things when someone you do n't know -- someone you can't even get a feel for -- keeps popping into your life for big chunks of time .
By shutting himself off and stripping himself of anything that could be perceived as interesting , Tiger inadvertently made himself interesting .
He also opened the door for a feeding frenzy if anything ever went wrong .
Something went wrong .
The feeding frenzy happened .
And I was one of the feeders .
I digested this story whole , every morsel -- true , untrue or half true .
I discussed it with my friends more than anything happening with my four Boston teams combined .
I tossed out as many conspiracy theories as anyone .
I found myself fascinated not by his alleged cheating , but by his arrogance that none of his misdeeds would ever surface ... because , after all , I am Tiger Woods .
I could n't believe how badly his " team " handled things these past two weeks .
I got a kick out of talking heads and writers arrogantly dispensing life advice like Dr. Phil wannabes .
I practically drowned in all the perspectives being fed to me from different people " in the know . "
Like this exchange from three days ago ...
Guy In The Know : " Tiger 's biggest mistake was not having a cleaner . "
Me : " A cleaner ? "
Guy In The Know : " Yeah , someone who cleans up messes . "
Me : " Like the Wolf in ' Pulp Fiction ' ? "
Guy In The Know : " Kind of .
Like , he should n't have been the one making that call to Jaimee Grubbs .
It should have been made for him . "
It 's right out of a movie .
Literally .
A cleaner .
That 's just one of the reasons why this story wo n't stop being interesting any time soon .
It 's the biggest sports story , but also the weirdest , and the one that makes me feel the worst about myself .
I wish I did n't care .
I wish I was n't gossiping about it like a 10th - grade girl .
I wish I could say , " You know what ?
It 's between his wife and him , we need to stay out of it . "
But there are just too many wrinkles to this baby .
The biggest star of this decade ended up in the biggest sports story of the pre-teen double - zero aughts .
Are you not entertained ?
Sadly , I am .
And so are you .
Sounds like the perfect time to break open a special two - part mailbag .
As always , these are actual e-mails from actual readers .
Q : In 2059 , do you think Discovery or the History Channel will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Tiger 's car crash with Tiger Week ?
It could be all documentaries about his rise and fall , including a new special called " The Dawn Of Black Friday " that uses new - wave forms of CGI , satellite equipment and forensic evidence to figure out exactly what happened with the car crash .
Which reminds me :
What do you think happened that night ?
-- Bill S. , Los Angeles
SG : OK , I cheated and wrote that question myself .
Could n't help it .
Everyone has their own theory about the night of Nov. 26 at Tiger 's house , splintering us into various camps like a modern version of JFK 's assassination .
We will never know what happened .
And that 's what bothers us .
We can all agree on the following things ...
1 . The combination of the National Enquirer 's story about Hookup No. 1 ( Rachel Uchitel , revealed on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving ) and US Weekly 's story about Tiger 's voice mail to Hookup No. 2 ( Grubbs , revealed eight days later , that asked her to change her greeting because his wife found her number in his cell phone ) would indicate tension in Tiger 's house .
To say the least .
( Note : In my house , my car " accident " would have happened the same night as the Enquirer story .
And also , I would 've had to explain to police why I tried to jam my BlackBerry down my throat . )
2 . It 's impossible to crash your own car leaving your own driveway that you 've left a million times unless ( A ) you were drunk or zonked out on painkillers , ( B ) you were asleep in the car and sleep - drove it , like a form of sleepwalking , ( C ) you were fleeing for your life as your furious wife clubbed the back of a car with a golf club , or ( D ) you have no hand - eye coordination at all .
We can rule out only D .
3 . Tiger 's wife broke the rear windows on his Cadillac Escalade with a golf club .
We do n't know if this happened before or after the crash , and we do n't know why she was holding a golf club in the first place , or even if she was screaming , " YOU DESERVED IT , YOU [ EXPLETIVE ] ! " while triumphantly waving the 9 - iron , but she definitely did break the windows .
Tiger even admitted this and she told the police she did it to pull him from the vehicle .
Although he called her " courageous " within that admission .
Which seems like a stretch .
The neighbors were much more courageous .
If my next - door neighbor crashed into a tree , and I looked out my window and noticed his wife standing over him and holding a golf club , I would double lock my doors and not leave my house .
( One wrinkle here that has n't been mentioned enough :
It makes sense that she did n't break the driver 's window or passenger 's window to free him .
She would have shattered glass all over him .
By shattering the rear windows , she prevented any glass ( or less glass ) from hitting him .
You know , assuming she did this after the crash , and not as he was driving away and she was chasing the car while swearing at him in Swedish . )
4. Neighbors found a shoeless
Tiger lying next to his crashed vehicle , with his wife hovering over him ... and he was snoring .
That 's what they told police .
TMZ ( and other outlets ) also reported that Tiger was in and out of consciousness for six minutes .
That 's a long time when you think about it .
( On the other hand , it 's TMZ .
With all due respect , TMZ is n't exactly operating under the same rules as Woodward and Bernstein in the mid-'70s . )
5 . In Florida , if police suspect even a whiff of domestic violence , the law reads " the decision to arrest and charge shall not require the consent of the victim or consideration of the relationship of the parties . "
For three days following the crash , the Florida Highway Patrol tried to interview Tiger about the crash .
Each time , he refused to allow them in the house .
( Note : That smacks of either " I'm Tiger Woods and I do n't need to explain myself " or " I need to wait for these scratches on my face to heal before anyone sees me , " with no in - between .
So it 's either incredibly arrogant or incredibly revealing .
I am leaning toward arrogant .
As always with these things , the cover - up ends up being more dangerous than the incident itself .
Unless you killed your ex-wife and a waiter .
Then it 's a tie . )
6 . The accident happened around 2:30 a.m. and did n't leak to the media for more than 12 hours .
( Also incredible .
How does this not leak right away ?
You can go to TMZ on any Friday or Saturday night and see live footage of Lindsay Lohan taking a leak in the plants in front of STK .
This story took almost 13 hours to come out ???
Really ?
We need an Orlando branch of TMZ , apparently . )
7 . Tiger 's wife gave birth to a daughter ( now 2 years old ) and a son ( 10 months ) .
You 're reading the same guy who once premiered my buddy Sully 's " Twelve Percent Theory " in this same space : that every childbirth makes a woman 12 percent less sane until the kids can fully function on their own .
So if you have two kids , you 're batting at about 76 percent sane .
Anyone married with two young children can back me up :
You do n't mess with your wife , in any way , shape or form , during the 12 months after that second kid is born .
Her hormones have gone haywire .
She is n't sleeping enough .
She 's dealing with the new baby , the suddenly wounded ego of the first kid who does n't feel special anymore , and whether she can handle two kids at all .
She 's trying to lose the weight from Baby No. 2 , but she does n't have enough time to work out yet .
So she hates herself and hates you for doing this to her .
You are n't walking on eggshells around your wife during this stretch ; you 're walking on razor blades .
Every comment has to be carefully considered before being spoken .
For instance , here 's a typical exchange with a mother of two young kids who has a baby 10 months or younger :
Husband : " You look really nice today . "
Wife : " Why today ?
Why did you have to say today ? "
Husband : " I just meant ... "
Wife : " So I do n't look nice on any other day ? "
That 's the Twelve Percent Theory in action .
Again , you can't anger your wife during this time under any circumstances .
There 's a chance that Tiger has a fleet of nannies who deal with his kids , nullifying the Twelve Percent Theory to some degree .
I do n't think this is true for a simple reason :
Tiger 's wife was a nanny .
Former nannies are less prone to hire a fleet of nannies because they know firsthand how attached a baby can get to a nanny .
I think his wife carried much of the load herself .
That would also explain why Tiger 's mother was reportedly there on Thanksgiving .
Not just for the holidays , but to help out .
Right ?
( I know , I know .
I am throwing crap against the wall and hoping it sticks .
On the other hand , you found yourself nodding the whole time .
I 'd bet anything .
So let 's say that Mrs .
Tiger is hands - on with the kids .
Fine . )
Anyway , the mix of " facts we know " and " things we perceive from those facts " left a little wiggle room and led to four accepted explanations emerging after the accident .
I am leaving out any far - fetched explanation along the lines of " Tiger was going out to buy crack " and " Tiger had been furious at that fire hydrant for months and it was only a matter of time before he went after it . "
Camp No. 1 : " The Argument Gone Wrong " Theory
The story : Either Mrs. Tiger stews about the Enquirer story and whatever she found on his cell phone , but she can't react for two days because family is visiting ...
OR , she reacts on that Tuesday , and then something else happens Thanksgiving night ( maybe a holiday text from one of Tiger 's harem that she sees ) that causes her to flip out .
Either way , she 's ticked off .
She sulks through dinner , then they put the kids down , and it 's just her and Tiger .
She confronts him .
He storms off and texts someone as he 's driving , forgets to look up and crashes the car ...
OR , he 's driving away , she runs out after him , he gets distracted and crashes the Escalade .
She sees / hears the crash , runs down to make sure he 's OK , can't open the door , runs back to the house , grabs a 9 - iron , runs back down the driveway , breaks the windows and pulls him out .
You know the rest .
The issues : Tiger 's mother was in the house and would have heard them fighting had it escalated to that degree .
Also , why would a mom with two kids be awake at 2:30 in the morning , much less arguing ?
Which leads us to ...
Camp No. 2 : " The Feeding Gone Wrong " Theory
The story : Dinner , bed .
Everything is fine .
Around 2 a.m. , the baby starts crying .
She brings him downstairs for milk .
Tiger 's cell phone is sitting on the table .
Because he's an idiot and one of the five dumbest adulterers of all time , he still does n't have password protection on it ...
OR , he does have a password , only she hacked it .
Either way , she sees a text she should n't see .
( One other variable here :
One of his bimbettes may have just called his house and hung up . )
Either way , it leads to the same argument and same results .
The issues : Same as in Camp No. 1 . Slightly more plausible to me , though .
Camp No. 3 : The " She Tried To Kick His Butt " Theory
The story : Everything unfolds as in Camp No. 1 or Camp No. 2 , but much more heated -- and maybe even with some scratching -- and ends with her chasing him out of the house and breaking the windows ( followed by him crashing ) .
This was my initial reaction , and yours , and just about everyone's .
The issues : Too easy .
It 's like saying Oswald killed JFK .
Ties everything together a little too easily and conveniently .
And as I mentioned earlier , the benevolently broken rear windshield makes more sense than you 'd think .
Camp No. 4 : The Painkiller / Ambien Theory
The story : Two pieces to this puzzle remain unexplained .
First , how could Tiger crash his car without the air bags deploying ?
And second , why was he snoring after the accident ?
Consider how hard it would be to crash your car , do significant damage to the car AND knock yourself out without the air bags going off .
You 'd have to crash without ever touching the brakes .
Which makes me think he was asleep when the accident happened .
The snoring would certainly back this up .
Tell me if this scenario sounds plausible ...
Tiger and his wife go to bed .
He takes Ambien to fall asleep .
Maybe he took more than that .
After all , the guy had major knee surgery and might still be popping painkillers for all we know .
( An admittedly reckless Daily Beast story speculated on this very topic . )
The baby wakes up , leading to " The Feeding Goes Wrong " theory and Tiger 's 76 percent sane wife going bonkers on him .
She kicks him out of the house ... OR , he storms out .
He gets into his car , but again , he 's half - asleep and zoned out on Ambien .
While debating where to drive , he falls back asleep , then in some sort of sleepwalking - type moment , starts the car and starts driving it ...
OR , simply knocks it out of gear so it starts rolling .
That would explain how the car crashed without going that fast , as well as his injuries ( he would have hit his head ) , the snoring afterward , then his wife 's reaction .
I vote for Camp No. 4 .
Then again , I 'm the same person who believes that Oswald was firing at JFK while , at the exact same time , someone else Oswald did n't know ( working for the CIA or the mafia ) was also trying to shoot JFK from the grassy knoll .
We will never know the truth .
Ever .
Just one of the things that make it the biggest sports story of the pre-teen double - zero aughts .
Part 2 : The All - Tiger Mailbag
Bill Simmons is a columnist for ESPN.com .

His new book , " The Book of Basketball " , is now available .
Some thinking on terrorism that may be of interest :
The recent al Qaeda sponsored attempt to blow up an Northwest Airways flight is an example of an interesting , but likely inadvertent strategy : failure .
Given the earlier example of 9/11 , even failed attacks provide the following benefits :
New and sweeping rules on airline passengers ( most inane ) and beefed up security .
New military / intelligence efforts launched against Yemen .
A potential substantive review and expansion of the broken no - fly lists and other substantial / expensive " systemic " overhauls .
In sum , the attack generated more expense ( a nice return in red ink for a relatively small effort ) even though it failed .
NOTE : This is hilarious given the only thing that did work to stop the attack was ( again ) quick thinking / heroism on the part of the passengers on the flight .
This implies that the real reason for all this ' action ' is more about bolstering nation - state legitimacy ( why do we spend all this money in taxes on these massive bureaucracies ) than preventing attacks .
Failure is interesting , as a strategy , because it does n't require the necessary planning , funding , and training required for a potentially successful attack .
As a result , attacks can be made quickly across a broad spectrum of targets .
If al Qaeda did embrace failure as a strategy , we could expect them to :
I can nearly guarantee that this will never apply to anyone shipping to Alaska ( or Hawaii ) , as usual .
Vendors act as if we 're on the moon and that it costs exorbitant amounts of money to ship anything here .
( To all twelve customers they have in these states . )
I also love when they claim Alaska is not part of the continental US .
AK & HI customers may not know of forwarding services such as Aloha Forwarding ( in CO ) and ShipToHawaii .
They forward packages via USPS Priority Mail , which can be far cheaper than what vendors charge otherwise .
Aloha Forwarding ships to your chosen address whereas ShipToHawaii makes you pick up your package at their facility by default ( perhaps at all ) .
Un día hace no mucho , llegó un hombre desesperado ante la policía en el Distrito Federal .
Hacía un mes que habían secuestrado a sus tres hijas , por las que pedían 30 millones de pesos ( 1.550.000 euros ) .
Sólo había logrado reunir 230 mil pesos ( 12.000 euros ) , le dijo a los policías .
" Hagan lo que tengan que hacer " , dijo entre súplica y exigencia , totalmente impotente , " porque ya no puedo estar recibiendo dedos de mis hijas " .
Esa noche las menores , a quienes ya habían amputado un dedo a cada una , iban a ser ejecutadas .
Un investigador que no tenía el caso realizó un trabajo que hasta hoy no se sabe cómo hizo , y ese mismo día , las rescató con vida .
Tiempo antes , un niño de 12 años salió temprano con su chofer rumbo a la escuela , pero a unas cuantas calles de su casa , fue detenido en un retén donde había dos patrullas de la policía del Distrito Federal , una de la Policía Federal y dos automóviles sin identificación de ninguna especie .
Hacía dos semanas apenas que su padre le había quitado la escolta porque " no quería que viviera en ese tipo de entorno " .
En el retén , que resultó falso pero con policías de verdad , lo secuestraron .
A su chofer lo golpearon y lo ahorcaron , tirándolo en una calle pensando que estaba muerto .
Los dos sobrevivieron ; el niño tras el pago del rescate .
Todavía hoy el menor , cada vez que escucha la sirena de un vehículo oficial , se esconde ; cuando ve a un policía , huye .
Las historias sobre secuestros pueblan el imaginario mexicano .
Hay quienes como en estos dos casos , salvaron la vida después de haber sido torturados y humillados , sicológicamente agredidos .
Hay quienes mueren por diferentes razones .
Una , porque le colgaron violentamente el teléfono al secuestrador .
Otra , porque el padre , que llevaba la negociación - como marca el manual - , se quebró y al tomar un familiar su lugar , asesinaron a la secuestrada .
En algunos casos presionan a los padres enviando dedos y orejas .
Hubo casos tan sádicos , que enviaron a unos padres el vídeo de su hija mientras la golpeaban , violaban y sodomizaban .
La situación ha llegado a extremos tales que cuando las víctimas mueren en cautiverio , los padres descansan cuando se enteran que la muerte fue temprana en el periodo del secuestro .
La realidad mexicana es frustrante y llena de angustias , y el secuestro se ha convertido en parte del paisaje nacional .
La sociedad pareciera resignada a vivir bajo ese riesgo cotidiano , agradeciendo cada vez que se es víctima de que " cuando menos no murió " .
No es un fenómeno nuevo , pero el problema creció este año .
Desde 1997 , cuando se detuvo al secuestrador más famoso , Daniel Arizmendi , al que le decían El Mochaorejas porque enviaba orejas de las víctimas para presionar a las familias , el fenómeno toca a todos , y todos se sienten víctimas en potencia .
En aquel año la cifra de secuestros llegó a 1.045 ; en los once meses de este año , ese tope se rebasó por 176 casos , para sumar un total sin precedente : 1.221 secuestros .
Pese a todo , el gobierno federal anunció la semana pasada que la tendencia del secuestro viene a la baja .
De 138 casos en julio pasado , en noviembre hubo 56 .
¿ Hay motivos para celebrar ?
El procurador general , Arturo Chávez , anunció hace unos días que se han creado unidades antisecuestros en 29 de las 32 entidades del país , que fue un compromiso adquirido por el gobierno federal hace un año .
Pero el problema es cómo van a operar , pues el 60 % de las personas que presentaron su solicitud para integrarse a esas unidades , fueron rechazadas al no pasar las pruebas de control de confianza y las toxicológicas , o porque reprobaron las pruebas poligráficas .
Este es el fondo del problema , los policías y los encargados del combate a la delincuencia .
¿ Cómo se puede vivir tranquilo en México cuando se asume que el crimen en las calles de la nación está controlado o protegido por aquellos que se supone deben protegernos de los criminales ?
Si uno toma los dos primeros casos mencionados , puede preguntarse con sentido común básico ¿cómo fue posible que un investigador , sin información previa de un secuestro , pudiera rescatar en cuestión de horas a tres jovencitas ?
O ¿cómo es posible que se pudiera instalar un retén falso en una hora de tráfico intensa por la entrada de los niños a las escuelas sin que nadie se diera cuenta ?
Si en el primero fue la fortuna de un policía tan desesperado como el padre que suplicaba por ayuda , y si en el segundo se trató de un descuido , la apelación a que se crea que esa es la verdad toca los linderos de un acto de fe .
En un gran número de casos de secuestros , hay policías involucrados .
No son todos , pero da igual en términos políticos y sociales .
La percepción es más fuerte que la realidad , acentuada porque esa idea tiene ataduras objetivas .
El Mochaorejas había sido policía .
Varios de los jefes del narcotráfico también fueron policías .
Todas las semanas los diarios publican la detención de policías vinculados a delincuentes , y en ocasiones , agrupaciones completas son descabezadas por operar del lado del mal .
Altos mandos policiales que combatían la criminalidad están hoy en la cárcel por haber sido cómplices de esa criminalidad .
Entre los secuestros y las policías - como en prácticamente todas las áreas de la delincuencia en México - , hay fuertes vasos comunicantes .
Los gobiernos federal y estatal dicen luchar contra este cáncer , pero no parecen tener muchos avances .
En los secuestros de más alto impacto en el último año , siempre aparecieron policías federales y locales involucrados .
De hecho - sin que esto sea una actitud cínica- , en el caso de secuestros -y en general de todos los delitos - , lo más sorprendente es descubrir que no hubo policías involucrados .
Que sean parte de la delincuencia ya es inherente en el imaginario colectivo mexicano que cree , que sabe , que el enemigo está en casa .
Scientists say they 've made a breakthrough in their pursuit of computers that " think " like a living thing 's brain - an effort that tests the limits of technology .
Even the world 's most powerful supercomputers can't replicate basic aspects of the human mind .
The machines can't imagine a wall painted a different colour , for instance , or picture a person 's face and connect that to an emotion .

If researchers can make computers operate more like a brain thinks - by reasoning and dealing with abstractions , among other things - they could unleash tremendous insights in such diverse fields as medicine and economics .
A computer with the power of a human brain is not yet near .
But this week researchers from IBM are reporting that they 've simulated a cat 's cerebral cortex , the thinking part of the brain , using a massive supercomputer .
The computer has 147,456 processors ( most modern PCs have just one or two processors ) and 144 terabytes of main memory - 100,000 times as much as your computer has .
The scientists had previously simulated 40 per cent of a mouse 's brain in 2006 , a rat 's full brain in 2007 , and 1 per cent of a human 's cerebral cortex this year , using progressively bigger supercomputers .
The latest feat , being presented at a supercomputing conference in Portland , Oregon , does n't mean the computer thinks like a cat , or that it is the progenitor of a race of robo -cats .
The simulation , which runs 100 times slower than an actual cat 's brain , is more about watching how thoughts are formed in the brain and how the roughly one billion neurons and 10 trillion synapses in a cat 's brain work together .
The researchers created a program that told the supercomputer , which is in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , to behave how a brain is believed to behave .
The computer was shown images of corporate logos , including IBM's , and scientists watched as different parts of the simulated brain worked together to figure out what the image was .
Dharmendra Modha , manager of cognitive computing for IBM Research and senior author of the paper , called it a " truly unprecedented scale of simulation . "
Researchers at Stanford University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory were also part of the project .
Modha says the research could lead to computers that rely less on " structured " data , such the input 2 plus 2 equals 4 , and can handle ambiguity better , like identifying the corporate logo even if the image is blurry .
Or such computers could incorporate senses like sight , touch and hearing into the decisions they make .
One reason that development would be significant to IBM :
The company is selling " smarter planet " services that use digital sensors to monitor things like weather and traffic and feed that data into computers that are asked to do something with the information , like predicting a tsunami or detecting freeway accidents .
Other companies could use " cognitive computing " to make better sense of large volumes of information .
Jim Olds , a neuroscientist and director of the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University , called the new research a " tremendous step . "
Olds , who was not involved in IBM 's work , said neuroscientists have been amassing data about how the brain works much like " stamp collectors , " without a way to tie it together .
" We 've made tremendous advances in collecting data , but we do n't have a collective theory yet for how this complex organ called the brain produces things like Shakespeare 's sonnets and Mozart 's symphonies , " he said .
" The holy grail for neuroscientists is to map activity from single nerve cells , which they know about , into how billions of nerve cells act in concert . "
Modha says a simulation of a human cortex could come within the next decade if Moore 's Law holds .
That 's the rule of thumb that the number of transistors on a computer chip tends to double every two years .
Yet Olds cautioned that simulating the human brain is " such a complex problem that we may not be able to get to an answer , even with supercomputing . "
" There are no guarantees in this game because the sheer complexity of the problem really dwarfs anything we 've tried to do , " he said .

Two years ago , Evelyn Garcia was shot to death .
Police arrested her husband -- a twice convicted felon -- but when they tried to trace the murder weapon , the manufacturer said the gun had never been made .
How could a gun that kills not exist ?
FRONTLINE and the Center for Investigative Reporting take viewers inside the illegal handgun market and follow federal agents as they investigate one of their biggest cases ever into stolen guns and the illicit gun market .
Well , maybe not my top 10 … but the first ten that I thought of .
1 . The term “ climate change ” itself .
Thirty years ago , the term “ climate change ” would have meant natural climate change , which is what climate scientists mostly studied before that time .
Today , it has come to mean human - caused climate change .
The public , and especially the media , now think that “ climate change ” implies WE are responsible for it .
Mother Nature , not Al Gore , invented real climate change .
2. “ Climate change denier ” .
A first cousin to the first annoyance .
Again , thirty years ago , “ climate change denier ” would have meant someone who denied that the Medieval Warm Period ever happened .
Or that the Little Ice Age ever happened .
What a kook fringe thing to believe that would have been !
And now , those of us who still believe in natural climate change are called “ climate change deniers ” ??
ARGHH .
3 . The appeal to peer - reviewed and published research .
I could go on about this for pages .
Yes , it is important to have scientific research peer - reviewed and published .
But as the Climategate e-mails have now exposed ( and what many scientists already knew ) , we skeptics of human - caused climate change have “ peers ” out there who have taken it upon themselves to block our research from being published whenever possible .
We know there are editors of scientific journals who assist in this by sending our papers to these gatekeepers for the purpose of killing the paper .
We try not to complain too much when it happens because it is difficult to prove motivation .
I believe the day is approaching when it will be time to make public the evidence of biased peer review .
4. Appeal to authority .
This is the last refuge of IPCC scientists .
Even when we skeptics get research published , it is claimed that our research is contradicted by other research the IPCC has encouraged , helped to get funded , and cherry - picked to support its case .
This is dangerous for the progress of science .
If the majority opinion of scientists was always assumed to be correct , then most major scientific advances would not have occurred .
The appeal to authority is also a standard propaganda technique .
5. Unwillingness to debate .
I have lectured to many groups where the organizers could not find anyone from the IPCC side who would present the IPCC ’s side of the story .
I would be happy to debate any of the IPCC experts on the central issues of human - caused versus natural climate change , and feedbacks in the climate system .
They know where to find me .
( For the most common tactic used by the IPCC in a debate , see annoyance # 4 . )
6 . A lack of common sense .
Common sense can be misleading , of course .
But when there is considerable uncertainty , sometimes it is helpful to go ahead and use a little anyway .
Example :
It is well known that the net effect of clouds is to cool the Earth in response to radiant heating by the sun .
But when it comes to global warming , all climate models do just the opposite … change clouds in ways that amplify radiative warming .
While this is theoretically possible , it is critical to future projections of global warming that the reasons why models do this be thoroughly understood .
Do n’t believe it just because group think within the climate modeling community has decided it should be so .
7 . Use of climate models as truth .
Because there are not sufficient high - quality , globally - distributed , and long term observations of climate fluctuations to study and better understand the climate system with , computerized climate models are now regarded as truth .
The modelers ’ belief that climate models represent truth is evident from the language they use : climate models are not “ tested ” with real data , but instead “ validated ” .
The implication is clear : if the data do not agree with the models , it must be the data ’s fault .
8. Claims that climate models have been tested .
A hallmark of a good theory is that it should predict something which , upon further investigation , turns out to be correct .
To my knowledge , climate models have not yet forecasted anything of significance .
And even if they did , models are ultimately being relied upon to forecast global warming ( aka ‘ climate change ’ ) .
As far as I can tell , there is no good way to test them in this regard .
And please do n’t tell me they can now replicate the seasons quite well .
Even the public could predict the seasons before there were climate models .
Predicting future warming ( or cooling ) is slightly more difficult , but not by much : a flip a coin will be correct 50 % of the time .
9 . The claim that the IPCC is unbiased .
The IPCC was formed for the explicit purpose of building the case for global warming being our fault , not for investigating the possibility that it is just part of a natural cycle in the climate system .
Their accomplices in government have bought off the scientific community for the purpose of achieving specific policy goals .
10 .
The claim that reducing CO2 emissions is the right thing to do anyway .
Oh , really ?
What if life on Earth ( which requires CO2 for its existence ) is actually benefiting from more CO2 ?
Nature is always changing anyway … why must we always assume that every single change that humans cause is necessarily a bad thing ?
Even though virtually all Earth scientists believe this , too , it is not science , but religion .
I ’m all for religion … but not when it masquerades as science .

In my 10 + years of teaching , " school sucks " is perhaps the most common phrase I 've heard students use to describe their feelings about public education .
But this seemingly bitter and reductive slogan is actually quite clever .
When taken literally , " school sucks " is perhaps the most accurate and astute synopsis of the system I 've ever heard .
Here 's why ...
1 . The twelve - year process of an American public education has a dramatic effect on the mind of a child .
When we first enter school at age six , many of our best personal attributes are already in place .
We are curious , innovative , unique , creative and hopeful in ways that we will rarely be able to replicate throughout the rest of our lives .
But over time , school sucks those essential attributes out of too many of us ... and replaces them with predictability , obedience and apathy .
2 . The public school system sucks off the productive capacity of hard - working people .
The system is coercively funded through taxation .
In other words , whether public education succeeds or fails ( spoiler alert : it fails ) at providing real education to the public , the cost goes up every year .
There are no refunds .
The END of Public Education ?
1. END : It 's over , irrelevant , useless , needs to be done away with .
Does more harm than good .
2. END : ( As in means to an end ) We 'll also explore the true intentions behind the system , which have very little to do with real education .
There is substantial evidence that its failure to educate is no accident .
Above all , this is a show about what one might do about these problems ...

Federal Law
On January 16 , 1919 , the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified , banning the manufacture , sale and transportation of alcohol ( Prohibition ) , including beer made at home .
The 21st Amendment repealed Prohibition in 1933 , however , the repeal ’s legislation mistakenly left out the legalization of home beer making ( home wine making was legalized at that time ) .
On October 14 , 1978 , President Jimmy Carter signed H.R. 1337 , which contained an amendment sponsored by Senator Alan Cranston ( D - CA ) creating an exemption from taxation of beer brewed at home for personal or family use .
This exemption went into effect on February 1 , 1979 , making homebrewing legal on a federal level in the U.S .
State Laws
Although homebrewing is legal on both the federal and state levels in the U.S. , the 21st Amendment predominantly leaves regulation of alcohol to the individual states .
Thus each states ’ laws regarding homebrewing vary widely .
Some states have very specific laws that outline exactly what can and cannot be done with homebrew , while others are vague .
Some states limit consumption of homebrew solely to the residence where it was brewed , while others allow for transportation of homebrew to events such as competitions and club meetings .
Legalization
Mississippi and Alabama were the last two states to legalize homebrewing .
Alabama law went into effect on May 9 , 2013 , and the Mississippi law went into effect on July 1 , 2013 .
Lobbying
The American Homebrewers Association ( AHA ) does not have the resources to maintain a lobbyist in each state , however the AHA can assist homebrewing communities organize effective grassroots campaigns to enact new laws or update existing laws .
When acting as a community , homebrewers have strength in numbers to enact change .
If there is homebrew legislation or regulation taking place in your state , please let AHA know by emailing John Moorhead , AHA Competition Organizer
How to Initiate a Lobbying Campaign
Use the AHA database to check current laws for homebrewing in your state .
Identify the legislative issue to be address ( e.g. homebrew can not be served outside the home where it was brewed ) .
Determine if pursuing legislative change is worth the inherent risk and scrutiny that attempting the change the law will bring .
For example , if it is technically not legal to share homebrew at a club meeting in your state , but there has been no enforcement of that law , it may not be worth pursuing as there ’s no guarantee of the outcome and could take years to accomplish .
Contact the AHA for information on any past or current legislative efforts in your state .
Contact homebrewers and homebrew clubs in your state to let them know your intensions , and request their support in the effort .
Form an email distribution list ( free from Google or Yahoo ) for representatives from your state ’s homebrew clubs and homebrew shops to facilitate communication and develop a consensus on strategy and tactics .
Find a sympathetic legislator who will sponsor your bill ( it is preferable to have sponsors in both the House and Senate if possible ) .
Lining up a sponsor prior to the start of the next legislative session will give you the best chance of getting legislation through the often frustratingly slow legislative process .
The AHA can help with drafting language for a bill .
Once the bill is registered , the AHA can help mobilize AHA members , BA brewery members and the Support Your Local Brewery network to contact legislators urging support for the bill .
AHA staff is available to testify on behalf of the bill during legislative committee hearings .
The AHA can help generate media attention for the bill .

Yahoo has apologized for paying lap - dancers ( " Hack Girls " ) to grind against attendees at its Hack Day Taiwan open event .
For the second year running .
Because , you know , it 's the kind of thing that you can just accidentally do , hiring sex workers to come to your everyone 's invited , inclusive Hack Day event .
Two years in a row .
What a blot on technology culture this is .
As a father of a young daughter whom I hope will be excited about technology , hacking , and making stuff , Yahoo's vile behavior makes me want to puke purple exclamation points .
For shame .
I wanted to acknowledge the public reaction generated by the images of female dancers at our Taiwan Open Hack Day this past weekend .
Our hack events are designed to give developers an opportunity to learn about our APIs and technologies .
As many folks have rightly pointed out , the " Hack Girls " aspect of our Taiwan Hack Day is not reflective of that spirit or purpose .
And it 's certainly not the message we want to send about our values here at Yahoo !.
Hack Days are about making everyone feel welcome , including women coders and technologists .
This incident is regrettable and we apologize to anyone that we have offended .
Rest assured , it wo n't happen again .
Regrettable ?
I can think of some choice words to describe this , and regrettable is so far down the list that you 'd need to scroll for a week to reach it .
Love how this is all in the passive voice — " the incident " is regrettable .
As though it occurred in a vacuum , untouched by human hands .
A kind of lightning strike of ghastly , stupid , boorish thoughtlessness .
An act of God , perhaps .
Sorry
This should n't be the image of Hack Day
A feature branch is a source code branching pattern where a developer opens a branch when she starts working on a new feature .
She does all the work on the feature on this branch and integrates the changes with the rest of the team when the feature is done .
During the work , she may merge in changes confirmed by the rest of the team into her branch , in order to reduce her integration once the feature is complete , but she does n't put her changes into the common codebase until that point .
This has the consequence that two people , working on different feature branches , do not integrate their work until the second one merges their work into the common codebase .
Feature branches are a popular technique , particularly well - suited to open - source development .
They allow all the work done on a feature to kept away from a teams common codebase until completion , which allows all the risk involved in a merge to be deferred until that point .
However this isolation does prevent early detection of problems .
More seriously , it also discourages refactoring - and a lack of refactoring often leads to serious deterioration in the health of a codebase .
The consequences of using feature branch depend greatly on how long it takes to complete features .
A team that typically completes features in a day or two are able to integrate frequently enough to avoid the problems of delayed integration .
Teams that take weeks , or months , to complete a feature will run into more of these difficulties .
Further Reading
For more details on feature branching , see my long form article on Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches .
This sets the feature branching pattern into the broader picture of using branching in software development , breaks down the workflow of working on a feature branch , discusses the trade - offs involved with the frequency of integration , and explores the alternative of Continuous Integration .
When we hear " climate change " , we think of melting polar ice , raising sea levels .
At best , we might imagine violent hurricanes in South Asia .
We do n't often consider how changing weather patterns affect the poorest first .
We , the lucky ones , have a buffer .
We are more resilient , have alternative livelihoods .
The majority of people on this planet do n't .
For over one billion people , a few degrees more will mean the difference between life or death .
Survival of a tribe or starvation .
I was looking for a first hand recount , and asked Jane Barrett to write up something from her last visit to Somalia .
Jane is a press officer at Oxfam Novib for Somalia , Niger and Burundi .
During a recent field visit in Somaliland , she was met warm and generously by the communities .
People were clearly eager to tell their stories to someone who wanted to listen .
Here is a story Jane wrote after meeting SalebanYussuf Noor , a grandfather and probably the last of his pastoral generation :
Somalia : A way of life lost
In Burcao , Somaliland we visited a village called Ununley .
Here , in houses spread on either side of the road , live pastoralist families .
When the village gathers to meet us , providing an occasion to drink tea and chew khaat , there is a distinct majority of elderly and women .
Indeed , many men have gone with their sheep and goats to search for water .
The latest information , a village elder tells us , is that it has rained by the Ethiopian border .
It will be busy , as many herders have heard the same .
Having missed several seasonal rains , the herders have to go further and further in search of water and vegetation for their animals .
Along the way , many livestock will be lost to the drought .
SalebanYussuf Noor is 75 .
He is one of the oldest in the village and was one of its founding members at age ten .
In his younger years , his family was wealthy .
“ When I was young , my family was most generous .
I ran a tea shop and to feed people I slaughtered my goats , ” he says .
Then , the village was growing .
Saleban himself owned 500 sheep and goats .
Now his family of 11 own just 30 .
In the last ten years , climate change has endangered the pastoralist way of life that has existed for centuries in Somalia .
The last four years the drought has intensified , with the most recent summer the worst .
“ Every place they , the herders , go they lose some cattle . ”
Saleban is very concerned about what the future holds for the younger generation of the village : “ The young people who are supposed to continue to build the village are leaving to places such as Lybia , the Sahara and Europe to find work and build a family .
This changing weather is very bad .
The people living here used to be wealthy , now they are very poor . ”
He does n’t quite know how to deal with the impact it has had on himself and his village .
“ We are proud .
We used to live lavishly , we do n’t know how to help , it sounds like begging , ” Saleban said .
Saleban ’s grandson has been sitting nearby throughout our conversation , drawing patterns in the sand .
I ask him what he wants to be when he grows up .
“ Teacher ” he says shyly .
Then I ask his friends who are sitting around us , “ Teacher . ” “ Doctor . ” “ Teacher . ” “ Teacher . ” “ Big man who can work in the factory . ”
Not one of them wants to be a herder like their fathers .
That outlook is too bleak .

All foreigners are fingerprinted when they arrive in Japan
A Chinese woman managed to enter Japan illegally by having plastic surgery to alter her fingerprints , thus fooling immigration controls , police claim .
Lin Rong , 27 , had previously been deported from Japan for overstaying her visa .
She was only discovered when she was arrested on separate charges .
Tokyo police said she had paid $ 15,000 ( £ 9,000 ) to have the surgery in China .
It is Japan 's first case of alleged biometric fraud , but police believe the practice may be widespread .
Japanese police suspect Chinese brokers of taking huge sums to modify fingerprints surgically .
Local media reports said Ms Lin had undergone surgery to swap the fingerprints from her right and left hands .
Skin patches on her thumbs and index fingers were removed and then re-grafted on to the matching digits of the opposite hand .
Japanese newspapers said police had noticed that Ms Lin 's fingers had unnatural scars when she was arrested last month for allegedly faking a marriage to a Japanese man .
The apparent ability of illegal migration networks to break through hi-tech controls suggests that other countries who fingerprint visitors could be equally vulnerable - not least the United States , according to BBC Asia analyst Andre Vornic .
An Economic Answer to the Fermi Paradox ?
Those who ponder the Fermi Paradox might want to consider Myrhaf ’s solution , one based on economics .
If advanced technolgical civilizations really are out there , maybe they simply can’t afford to build interstellar spacecraft .
Myrhaf assumes that the only realistic way to travel between the stars is via a slow generation ship , what Isaac Asimov once called a ‘ spome ’ or ‘ space home . ’
And he doubts anyone would attempt it .
Expensive ?
You bet .
And maybe there ’s no one with the deep pockets to build it .
Governments are too inefficient , while capital investment is unlikely because interstellar travel has such a long timeline .
Corporate heads looking for return on their investments are n’t likely to have enough patience for a slow boat to Centauri .
Charity ?
Perhaps there ’s a hope through what Myrhaf calls ‘ committed visionaries , ’ but we ’re talking investment over the course of generations .
Does any culture have that kind of long - term vision once it develops the technologies that could build a generation ship ?
There ’s a case to be made that by the time the tools are available , the will wo n’t be there , and thus the solution to the paradox is what Myrhaf says : “ Where are the aliens ?
They ’re at home watching TV .
When their visionaries knock on the door , they say , ‘ I gave at the office , ’ then resume watching ‘ Alien Idol . ' ”
Or maybe not .
Posit this scenario :
A culture at the end of its star ’s life must make a decision about how to save itself .
Its G - type star , much like our Sun , will swell into a red giant , destroying all life on the inner worlds of its system .
But in the process , that star becomes the perfect launching pad for solar sail missions of enormous scope , the kind that could get a generation ship on its way .
Would government , private industry and charity all contribute toward a starship not for exploratory purposes but for survival ?
The betting here is yes , and in a galaxy filled not with Sagan ’s million technological civilizations but perhaps five or ten , star - crossing expeditions like these would hardly be visible to astronomers on Earth .
Myrhaf may be right about the cost and the political will , but sheer self - preservation may eventually get at least a few societies to other stars .
One other thought : never rule out the power of compound interest .
Couple it with a truly long - term perspective — think centuries instead of single lifetimes — and philanthropy properly applied can work wonders .
When Richard Dawkins published The God Delusion in 2006 , he was at the forefront of a movement some have retroactively dubbed “ the new atheism , ” which also includes bestselling authors Christopher Hitchens ( God Is Not Great ) and Sam Harris ( Letter To A Christian Nation ) .
Though The God Delusion became the British scientist ’s most famous work , Dawkins had already written more than half a dozen books about evolution and genetics , beginning with The Selfish Gene in 1976 .

In his most recent book , The Greatest Show On Earth : The Evidence For Evolution , Dawkins makes his case for evolutionary theory .
With the increasing prominence of creationists claiming intelligent design should be taught alongside evolution in public schools , Dawkins realized that for years he had been writing about evolution , but always with the assumption that readers accepted it as fact .
To coincide with the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin ’s On The Origin Of Species , Dawkins wrote the new book to get that point across .
In a recent visit with The A.V. Club , Dawkins discussed the deception of Ben Stein , the “ Sarah Palin constituency , ” and why he will never participate in a formal debate with a creationist .
The A.V. Club : Some creationists are using the upcoming 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin ’s book On The Origin Of Species to get their views heard , mostly in opposition to his theories that seem to threaten their religious beliefs .
As a starting point , can you maybe summarize what it is about Darwin ’s discovery that still causes such a rift between people ?

Richard Dawkins :
He showed how you can get things which look overwhelmingly as though they ’ve been designed , because they are so complex and they work so well , they function so well at doing whatever it is that they do , like wings that fly , eyes that see , ears that hear …
They work in a detailed , complicated way , and he showed that the illusion of design — that immensely powerful illusion of design — can be put together by the blind forces of physics working through this very special mechanism called “ natural selection , ” so that in the end , they almost precisely mimic what a designer might have produced .
That is a staggering overthrow of what appeared to be common sense right up until the middle of the 19th century .
AVC : Creationists will often concede that they are not against having evolution taught in public school , they just think it should be “ balanced ” with a teaching of intelligent design .
If evolution is a fact , how does intelligent design qualify as the only counterargument ?

RD : Yeah , you ’re right .
On the one hand , there could be an infinite number of opposite views .
It could be that it was all done by Zeus , or Mithras , or Wotan , but I suppose you could roll all that up into some sort of intelligent designer .
The problem is , it ’s not really a scientific idea at all , because they do not provide any positive scientific evidence for design .
All they do is point to what they see as shortcomings in the evolutionary view , and say “ Therefore God did it . ”
It ’s a bit like saying we have two theories : Theory A and Theory B . Theory A , which is evolution , has masses of evidence going for it .
Theory B has no evidence going for it at all .
You find a little lacuna , a little gap in Theory A — which we would say is just temporary — and you say “ Therefore , Theory B must be right . ”
You can immediately see , when you put it like that , how illogical that is .
AVC : There was a lot of hostility directed at you with your last book , The God Delusion , because you were taking direct aim at beliefs people hold sacred .
But with this book , you ’re using scientific evidence to show that something is true , you ’re not trying to debunk anything else .
Advertisement
RD : That is correct .
And what ’s more , not only is it not debunking , but also , I ’d like to think , it ’s kind of enthralling in its own right .
It should be really exciting to see this evidence laid out .
It is a very beautiful story .
So you do n’t have to think of it as debunking anything at all .
The other thing is that it should give no problems to any churchman worth his salt .
Any bishop or archbishop would have no trouble with the book , because they all accept evolution , they just think that maybe God started it off or something of that sort .
AVC : You were recently invited to debate Dr. Stephen C. Meyer , an advocate of intelligent design , and you turned him down —
Advertisement
RD : Well , yeah , and “ doctor ” is probably a bit exaggerated .
[ Laughs . ]
These people tend to have doctorates in odd subjects , like Marine Engineering .
I do n’t do formal debates , because formal debates where you have two people up on a stage in equal status , and each of them is given 20 minutes to give their point of view , and then 10 minutes for a rebuttal , or whatever , that creates the illusion that you really do have here two equal points of view of equal scientific standing .
And so I took the advice of [ evolutionary biologist ]
Stephen Jay Gould , when he was still alive , who would never debate creationists , for exactly that reason .
I actually telephoned him and we talked about it for quite a while , and agreed that that should be the best policy .
AVC : So how did you end up in Ben Stein ’s creationist documentary Expelled ?
RD : Oh , that was pure deception !
They deceived me , they deceived [ biologist ] P.Z. Myers , and they deceived [ anthropologist ]
Eugenie Scott into thinking this was a balanced treatment of the issues .
We had no idea that it was a creationist front .

AVC : You mention in the book that you were at least partially motivated by a poll of Americans taken in 2008 that revealed 44 percent of us believe that God created man in his present form 10,000 years ago .
Did you have any sort of a social or ethical motivation in writing this book ?
What would American society look like if that percentage was drastically reduced ?
RD : I do n’t want to produce a sort of utilitarian thing saying , “ If the United States is poorly educated scientifically , it will fall behind in technology ” or something .
That is of course true , and that would be the dominant motivation of many people , congressmen and so on .
For me , the dominant motivation is that the truth is beautiful .
And it ’s tragic for children to grow up being actively deceived as to the real nature of their own existence and why they ’re here , where they come from , and the history of the world .
It is such an enthralling and exciting and elegant story that it is a cruel deprivation of children not to tell them the truth now that the truth is known .
In former times , before Darwin came along , the truth was not known .
Now it is , and it is such a beautiful truth that everybody ought to be allowed the opportunity to know it .
Advertisement
AVC : The closest you ’ve probably ever felt to blasphemy is when some creationists go through Darwin ’s writings to find evidence of his racism and misogyny , claiming his ideas are dangerous if misinterpreted .
RD : Oh , well , yes , that ’s really appalling .
It is of course true that any mid-Victorian writer like Darwin is going to appear racist by modern standards .
Everybody was racist in Victorian times .
[ Laughs . ]
And Darwin was certainly no exception .
But you cannot , in good conscience , use Darwinian theory to justify racism .
It ’s actually quite the contrary .
What Darwinian theory shows us is that all human races are extremely close to each other , none of them is in any sense ancestral to any other , none of them is more primitive than any other .
We are all modern races of exactly equal status , evolutionary speaking .
Advertisement
AVC : So even if some people are capable of interpreting natural selection to justify their own bad actions , that does n’t make the idea any less true .
RD : That ’s exactly right .
There are certain aspects of the Darwinian idea which are very unpleasant .
Darwin himself recognized that there ’s a kind of ruthless , callous cruelty about it , but that does n’t make it any less true .
Advertisement
AVC : People like to point to things like DNA or the complexity of the eyeball and argue that these things had to have been designed .
How can you ever convince someone who has taken that leap and wo n’t even look at the science showing the exact opposite ?
Is there anything in nature that seems even remotely designed , that has n’t been explained by this process ?
RD : It ’s never happened yet , but even if one came across something so complex that one felt it could n’t have evolved by natural selection , to say it ’s designed still does n’t explain it , because you ’ve then got to explain the existence of the designer .
But in any case , no such organ , no such complexity has ever come to my notice .
It usually turns out to be a failure of the imagination when somebody says , “ Oh , this is too complicated to have evolved . ”
You just have n’t worked hard enough on it , you have n’t thought hard enough .
I ’ve called it “ the argument from personal incredulity , ” and it ’s a lazy argument .
Advertisement
AVC : Is it baffling to you that you even have to spend time in your book addressing attitudes like “ I ’ll believe in evolution when a monkey gives birth to a human baby ” ?
RD : Well , yes , because that just betrays such a misunderstanding , and it ’s sad .
What that shows is poor education , and this is not specifically an American problem — it ’s just as true in Britain as well .
We are not well educated on the whole in this subject , so people have this vague idea that evolution means that we ’re descended from chimpanzees , or from monkeys .
Of course it does n’t .
It means that chimpanzees , and thus all modern species , are descended from a common ancestor .
In some cases , it is a very recent common ancestor .
Like ourselves and chimpanzees , our common ancestor lived about 6 million years ago .
In other cases , it ’s a more distant common ancestor .
A common ancestor with monkeys might have lived about 25 million years ago .
But we all have a common ancestor — we are not descended from any other modern species .
That should be so obvious , but unfortunately , our education has let us down .

AVC : Do you think your education feeds some of the hostility you ’ve received , that people feel you ’re talking down to them , when really you just know about something they do n’t know anything about ?
RD : [ Laughs . ]
I fear there is something of that .
It is interesting — you find in the United States , there is a kind of anti-education hostility .
It ’s the sort of Sarah Palin constituency which does seem to actually be hostile to the New York , Boston , San Francisco educated elite .
You know , “ We good plain folks from the middle of the country are just as good as you pointy - headed intellectuals . ”
I ’m afraid there is a certain amount of that .
Advertisement
AVC : You may not debate creationists , but you do spend a lot of time giving interviews and lectures and appearing on talk shows .
Does it ever get tiresome roaming the world and having to make the same argument again and again ?
RD : Well , it can , but it is also immensely rewarding .
I do these big events , and I have large book - signing lines at the end , and people talk to me when I ’m signing their book , and it ’s really immensely gratifying , the sheer number of people who say , “ You have changed my life . ”
Particularly with respect to The God Delusion , so many people have said that they were in effect trapped in a religious backwater , and they do really talk as though they ’ve seen the light .
You can imagine what a rewarding sensation that is , to hear somebody say that , and I hear it over and over again .
Charles Diez Gets 120 Days for Shooting Cyclist in the Head
Charles Alexander Diez , the former North Carolina firefighter who shot cyclist Alan Simons in the head , has been sentenced to four months in jail .
Diez
In an Asheville courtroom last week , Diez pled guilty to shooting Simons during a July 26 roadside confrontation .
Said to be upset that Simons was riding his bike with his 3 - year - old child , Diez fired his .38 caliber pistol as Simons walked away after the two exchanged words .
The bullet struck Simons ’ bike helmet , narrowly missing his skull .
In August , a grand jury reduced charges against Diez from attempted first degree murder to felony assault .
While assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill certainly sounds like an offense worthy of a lengthy prison term , the presiding judge apparently agreed that this was a case of a stand - up guy having a bad day .
Mountain Xpress reports :
Convictions on such a charge result in an average 20 - 39 months in
prison for the defendant .
But in the sentencing , Superior Court Judge James Downs found that Diez ’s military service , along with testimony from former
colleagues about his good character , were mitigating factors , and chose
to sentence him to 15 - 27 months instead .
Downs suspended all but four
months of that sentence unless Diez breaks the law again in the next 30
months .
Diez must also undergo anger management counseling and pay Simons $ 1,200 " for damage to his eardrum . "
The slap on the wrist issued to Diez has some worried that authorities have pretty much declared open season on area cyclists .
Asked Brian Jones , who along with his wife is a regular victim of harassment and worse at the hands of local motorists : " If a cyclist shot a fireman , judge or prosecuting attorney in his
head , in front of his family , what sentence do you think he / she would
receive . "
The travesty in Asheville comes amid continuing reports of driver - on - cyclist violence , with , as Sarah noted this morning , recent incidents in Austin and Miami .
A former BBC employee has blown the whistle on cocaine use among the corporation ’s TV and radio producers and star performers .
Sarah Graham told a Home Affairs Select Committee hearing into the cocaine trade , that it is seen as “ part of your creative genius or part of your extraordinary personality ” .
She says that instead of being reprimanded , those who take the drug are praised for their “ off - the - wall ” brilliance .
Miss Graham has worked for BBC Radio 5 , Children ’s BBC and Channel 4 ’s The Big Breakfast , and says she was offered the drug by a presenter and producer on her first day at work .
She says : “ Behaviours that would not be tolerated in a normal job can actually be spun to be part of your creative genius .
“ Some of those people are still in place , some are behaving in off - the - wall ways … and people bow down to them .
“ There is a culture within the media and within the celebrity world that is very relaxed around the use of cocaine .
It ’s seen as something that is socially acceptable in industries where this ‘ work hard , party hard ’ ethos exists . ”
Sun 's VirtualBox got a big boost on Monday with the release of version 3.1 .
It introduced a number of significant new features , including support for live migration and vastly improved snapshot capabilities .
The open source virtualization tool is improving at a rapid pace .
VirtualBox was created by Innotek , a German software company that was acquired last year by Sun.
Although VirtualBox is primarily intended for conventional desktop virtualization scenarios , its developers are adding enterprise features that reflect a growing potential for viability in the server space .
The newly - added support for live migration — called " Teleportation " in the VirtualBox documentation — is an impressive example of this trend in the program 's development .
Live migration allows users to move virtualized guest environments from one physical computer to another while the guest environment is still running .
Although this has somewhat limited value for desktop virtualization , it 's a critical feature in data centers where administrators want to be able to seamlessly move workloads between their servers in order to maximize utilization of their hardware resources while minimizing the disruption to ongoing operations .
Live migration is already available in enterprise - centric virtualization solutions and some open source alternatives , including the Linux kernel 's KVM virtualization framework .
The feature will make VirtualBox more competitive in a number of markets where it was previously not viable for adoption .
The implementation is still a bit rough , however , and it will need a lot more polish and integration in the user interface before it will deliver VirtualBox 's signature ease of use .
Teleportation can only be invoked from the command line in VirtualBox 3.1 .
It also requires the user to manually set up identical VM configurations on the physical computers where the feature will be used .
The disk image file for the virtualized environment that you want to teleport will have to be on a shared storage medium that is accessible on both computers .
The documentation warns that moving a guest environment between computers with Intel and AMD CPUs is likely to result in failure .
In future versions , we 'd really like to see the developers simplify the teleportation setup by using something like ZeroConf for auto - discovery of VirtualBox - enabled computers on the local network .
It would also be nice if there was a way to automatically propagate VM configuration data .
When we reviewed VirtualBox 3 earlier this year , we pointed out that advanced snapshotting was one of the few areas where VMWare Workstation was still far ahead of VirtualBox .
That gap has closed a lot in version 3.1 with the introduction of support for branched snapshots .
You can now run any previous snapshot and create branches from previous snapshots .
This is a huge win , because we do n't have to make a new VM anymore every time we want to virtualize another fresh Ubuntu environment .
We can just keep around a single snapshot of a clean install and branch it as needed .
There are a number of other new features that might interest users , including 2D video acceleration for Windows guest environments and improved performance for 64 - bit guests .
For more details , you can refer to the official changelog .
The software is available for download from the project 's website .
For the Ga tribe in coastal Republic of Ghana , funerals are a time of mourning , but also of celebration .
The Ga citizenry believe that when their loved ones die , they move on into some other life — and the Ga make sure they do so in style .
They honor their dead with brightly colored coffins that celebrate the way they lived .
The coffins are designed to represent an aspect of the dead person ’s life — such as a car if they were a driver , a fish if their livelihood was the sea — or a sewing machine for a seamstress .
They might also represent a vice — such as a bottle of beer or a cigaret .

A camera on the probe shows the ejecta plume about 20 seconds after impact
Nasa 's experiment last month to find water on the Moon was a major success , US scientists have announced .
The space agency smashed a rocket and a probe into a large crater at the lunar south pole , hoping to kick up ice .
Scientists who have studied the data now say instruments trained on the impact plume saw copious quantities of water - ice and water vapour .
One researcher described this as the equivalent of " a dozen two - gallon buckets " of water .
" We did n't just find a little bit ; we found a significant amount , " said Anthony Colaprete , chief scientist for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) mission .
No doubt October 's experiment involved driving a 2,200kg Centaur rocket stage into the 100 km - wide Cabeus Crater , a permanently shadowed depression at the Moon 's far south .
At the time , scientists were hoping for a big plume of debris some 10 km high which could be seen by Earth telescopes .
The following probe was designed to analyse the debris plume
The actual debris cloud was much smaller , about 2 km high , but sufficiently large to betray the evidence researchers were seeking .
The near - infrared spectrometer on the LCROSS probe that followed the rocket into the crater detected water - ice and water vapour .
The ultraviolet - visible spectrometer provided additional confirmation by identifying the hydroxyl ( OH ) molecule , which arises when water is broken apart in sunlight .
" We were able to match the spectra from LCROSS data only when we inserted the spectra for water , " Dr Colaprete said .
" No other reasonable combination of other compounds that we tried matched the observations .
The possibility of contamination from the Centaur also was ruled out . "
Useful resource
The total quantity of H2O spied by the instruments was more than 100kg .
It came out of a 20 m - 30 m wide hole dug up by the impacting Centaur rocket .
The LCROSS scientists stressed that the results presented on Friday were preliminary findings only , and further analysis could raise the final assessment of the amount of water in Cabeus .
Peter Schultz , from Brown University and a co-investigator on the LCROSS mission , said : " What 's really exciting is we 've only hit one spot .
It 's kind of like when you 're drilling for oil .
Once you find it in one place , there 's a greater chance you 'll find more nearby . "
The regular surface of the Moon as seen from Earth is drier than any desert on our planet .
But researchers have long speculated that some permanently shadowed places might harbour considerable stores of water , perhaps delivered by impacting comets billions of years ago .
If future investigations find the quantities to be particularly large , this water could become a useful resource for any astronauts who might base themselves at the lunar poles .
" It can be used for drinking water , " said Mike Wargo , Nasa 's chief lunar scientist for exploration systems .
" You can break it down and have breathable air for crews .
But also , if you have significant quantities of this stuff , you have the constituents of one of the most potent rocket fuels - oxygen and hydrogen . "
The Centaur dug out a hole 20 m - 30 m wide
In September , data from three spacecraft , including India 's Chandrayaan probe , showed that very fine films of H2O coat the particles that make up lunar soil .
Scientists behind that finding speculated that this water might migrate to the even cooler poles , much as water vapour on Earth will condense on a cold surface .
This cold sink effect could be supplementing any water delivered by comets , they said .
If cometary material did reside in places like Cabeus Crater it would be fascinating to examine it , commented Greg Delory , from the University of California , Berkeley .
" The surfaces in these permanently shadowed areas , such as the one LCROSS impacted , are very cold , " he told reporters .
" That means that they tend to trap and keep things that encounter them - compounds , atoms and so forth .
And so they act as record keepers over periods as long as several billion years .
They have a story to tell about the history of the Moon and the Solar System . "
LCROSS was launched by Nasa on 18 June as part of a double mission which included the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) .
The latter , which continues to circle the Moon , measured a temperature of minus 230 Celsius at the base of Cabeus Crater .

Top Gear TV received a special delivery yesterday in the form of the only Lexus LFA in the UK , thankfully they returned it in the same condition as it was received – minus a few millimetres of rubber .
It was at the Top Gear studio for The Stig to set a lap time around the Dunsfold test track , but you ’ll just have to wait until the program is broadcast to find out how it managed .
The episode will be broadcast on the BBC2 on January 3rd 2010 , so put that in your diaries .
Meanwhile , what better excuse than to show you a video of the LFA sounding suitably exotic .

Volkswagen is seriously evaluating a move into Formula 1 as an engine supplier from 2012 , when new power unit regulations due to be introduced could make the sport attractive enough for the German car maker to get involved .
Although F1 has been rocked by the withdrawal of three manufacturers in the last 12 months - with Honda , BMW and Toyota all quitting the sport - the Volkswagen Group believes that the sport is actually becoming more attractive with the way rules are heading .
The German car manufacturer 's representative Hans - Joachim Stuck says his company would not be interested in becoming a partner with a team - as was rumoured several years ago when it was linked with a deal to buy into Red Bull Racing - but would be up for supplying engines .
However , Stuck has made it clear that the possibility to supply power units to a number of outfits , especially if there was a ' world engine ' , would be enough to attract Volkswagen into F1 .
" If you 're the world 's largest manufacturer is natural that we 're thinking about [ Formula 1 ] , but not before 2012 , " Stuck told AUTOSPORT about Volkswagen 's F1 ambitions .
" We 're looking for innovative things , and Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport .
Two years ago there was some talk that Volkswagen is going to buy the Red Bull F1 team , which we did n't need to buy .
Why should we stick with one team if we can give our engines to more teams ?
" If you buy Red Bull and Adrian Newey wants to go flying or fishing , the team is not successful any more .
Look at BMW .
They bought this multi-million dollar wind tunnel and a supercomputer and they now close the doors .
Building an engine and providing it to a team is the best way . "
Stuck claims Formula 1's return to expanded grids , and low - cost regulations , has put the sport firmly on Volkswagen 's radar .
" Now it 's amazing ; Formula 1 goes the right way , " said Stuck .
" Many manufacturers have pulled out , which I think is a great deal , because we have manufacturers that we do n't know for how long they will do it .
" They should become engine manufacturers and then lease the engine , sell the engine or give it to somebody .
Then you lose all the hassle with teams , wind tunnels , engineers , you know .
" It 's like Formula 1 in my days .
We had March , we had Lotus , and we had Ford engines .
Then Renault came in as engine manufacturer , with a formidable engine .
This was perfect .
" I followed Formula 1 for the last seven years with BMW and I always asked myself on the grid , with only 20 cars , what if we could have 30 cars ?
Now we 're getting back to this .
" We have three more teams next year , 26 cars , and by having a global engine , which is good in cost and reliable , we can have 30 cars on the grid . "
The Volkswagen Group has recently enjoyed great success in racing with its different brands .
Besides its multiple Le Mans wins with Audi , its WTCC titles with Seat in the past two years and its Dakar victory this year , Volkswagen also powered drivers with VW engines to the British and German F3 titles this , rounding out the season with victory in last weekend 's Macau Grand Prix .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - People of Japanese and European descent who have mutant versions of five genes may be at higher risk of developing Parkinson ’s disease , two large teams of researchers have found .
The two independent studies , published in the latest issue of Nature Genetics , involved more than 25,000 participants in total and are the largest studies to date to try to uncover genetic associations behind Parkinson ’s disease .
A study in Japan looked only at ethnic Japanese while a second study , in the United States , focused only on people of European heritage .
In the first study , Tatsushi Toda of Japan ’s Kobe University and colleagues sequenced the genes of 2,011 participants with the disease and 18,381 others without the disease .
They found that those with the disease had variants of the genes PARK16 , BST1 , SNCA and LRRK2 .
In the second study , researchers led by Andrew Singleton at the National Institutes of Health ’s ( NIH ) laboratory of neurogenetics in the United States analyzed the genes of more than 5,000 patients of European ancestry who suffer from the disease and detected strong links between Parkinson ’s and variants of the genes SNCA and MAPT .
The two teams later compared their data and found that variants of PARK16 , SNCA and LRRK2 carry risk of Parkinson ’s in both Japanese and European populations , while variants of BST1 and MAPT were population - specific .
“ Because previous Parkinson ’s genome - wide association studies were too small and lacked power , we worked together to compile and analyze the large data sets needed to identify the elusive genetic variations that play a role in this complex disease , ” Singleton said in a statement .
“ With this better understanding of the underlying genetic variants involved in the progress of this disorder , we have more insight into the causes and underlying biology of this disease .
“ We hope this new understanding will one day provide us with strategies to delay , or even prevent , the development of Parkinson ’s disease . ”
Parkinson ’s is a neurodegenerative disease that affects one to two percent of people over the age of 65 .
It is characterized by tremors , sluggish movement , muscle stiffness , and difficulty with balance .
Although medical treatments may improve symptoms , there are none that can slow down or halt the progression of the disease .
The idea is based on the ' wisdom of crowds ' theory The Conservatives say they would offer a £ 1 m prize in a competition to develop a website that would allow large groups of people to help develop new policies .
Tory frontbencher Jeremy Hunt told the BBC the idea was to tap into the " huge amount of expertise " among the British people to avoid policy " howlers " .
The prize would be public money - from the Cabinet Office budget - but he said it could offer taxpayers good value .
Labour and the Lib Dems dismissed it as a " gimmick " and a publicity stunt .
The plan - to be introduced if the Conservatives win the next general election - appears to be based on the so - called " wisdom of crowds " theory written about by author James Surowiecki .
He argued that large groups of people are smarter than the elite few at coming to wise decisions .
' Huge knowledge ' Mr Hunt , the shadow culture secretary , said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " Look at the U - turns over child care vouchers , over the 10 p tax , over the NHS IT system .
We think it could be a lot better value for the taxpayer than the £ 12bn spent on the NHS IT system
Jeremy Hunt
" It is crazy that these things have gone wrong when you 've got lots and lots of , for example , retired health professionals , retired policemen , people in the teaching profession , who have huge knowledge and expertise ...
" Is there a way that we can use the internet ... to try and avoid some of these howlers so a future Conservative government can not just have good policy ideas but execute policy in a much more considered and thought - through way ? "
' Public relation stunts '
Mr Hunt said they wanted to look at ways of prioritising ideas from people who might have greater expertise in certain areas , or a good track record on offering ideas .
And he said the £ 1 m would only be given away if a solution was found and a functioning website delivered .
He said : " We think £ 1 m is about the right amount if we are going to get some serious IT development done and if we do that we think it could be a lot better value for the taxpayer than the £ 12bn spent on the NHS IT system . "
For the government , Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell said the Conservatives were " opting for a PR gimmick over policy substance " and predicted the idea would be " quietly dropped " .
" Families want serious , thought - through policies that meet their aspirations , not short - term public relations stunts , " she said .
For the Liberal Democrats , Work and Pensions spokesperson Jenny Willott MP said : " This prize is clearly a publicity stunt and a total waste of taxpayers ' money .
" There are already a multitude of ways to communicate with large numbers of people online , from Facebook to discussion groups .
" Maybe the Tories are so out of touch they do n't know what 's out there , but they should n't waste £ 1 m of public money reinventing the wheel . "

In a well - worn phrase , Marx wrote that history repeated itself , first as tragedy and then as farce .
What we are witnessing at present , in the form of the Government and the Prime Minister , is both at once : a political farce , and a human tragedy .
The farcical collapse of our government can be contemplated with detached amusement , but the personal disintegration of Gordon Brown is awful to behold .
Early yesterday morning Labour won Glasgow North East , in what one headline bizarrely called a " landslide " , the word normally used for when a governing party is routed .
What had actually happened ?
The Government had held one of the safest seats in the country , a rotten borough in a Third World region which Labour has dominated for generations by patronage , in a very low turnout after a campaign fought entirely on parochial issues .
It 's a mark of Brown 's plight that this should be regarded as a triumph .
And anyone who thought that he was back in command had only to wait for the Prime Minister to be interviewed on Today .
He was very weakly interviewed , as it happens , by Evan Davis , a first - class radio journalist in his proper métier of economics but badly miscast in this role .
As Brown was allowed to prattle on , he must have given thanks that he was n't being cross-examined by the ruthlessly forensic John Humphrys .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Even so , what the Prime Minister said was embarrassing .
The mood of the country is swinging strongly against the war in Afghanistan , and this is going to be a grave problem for the Tories when they take office .
David Cameron should take heed , and try to avoid an argument – that the Grenadier Guards in Helmand are making British streets safer – so obviously fatuous as to discredit anyone who makes it .
But then it's of a piece with the whole story of this Government , under Tony Blair and then Brown , which increasingly appears a chronicle of missed opportunity and downright failure .
A needless and illegal war in Iraq – in which Brown was closely complicit – is only part of it .
Every day we are reminded that the economic miracle of which Brown once boasted so repetitiously was fraudulent .
As a result , Brown is now more enfeebled than any prime minister within living memory , or maybe in our history .
Although John Major was said to be " in office but not in power " , he seems in hindsight a towering figure compared with Brown , whose government is disintegrating around him , and who to a unique degree totally lacks authority .
For some time past the parliamentary Labour Party has been contemptuous and disobedient .
The latest demonstration of this comes over the expenses scandal .
Brown tells his MPs to accept their punishment , and they – contemptibly , but tellingly – tell him to get lost .
His own ministers openly dissociate themselves from his policies , such as they are , in complete defiance of the fundamental principle of collective cabinet responsibility .
Not only do former heads of the army publicly criticise the Prime Minister , so does General Sir Richard Dannatt while still chief of defence staff .
This has been quite rightly condemned as outraging an even more important principle , that of military subservience to the constitutional civilian government , but the political significance was missed : like MPs and ministers , generals feel no need to show any respect at all for Brown 's authority .
It was always easy to foresee why Gordon Brown would be such a failure as prime minister ; if anything , what 's curious is that so many people were unable to do so , and persuaded themselves for so long that he would provide a quite different and more inspiring kind of leadership after the discredited Blair .
The key is something Felix Frankfurter , the Supreme Court justice , said of the newly elected President Franklin Roosevelt after meeting him in 1933 .
He had , said Frankfurter , " a second - class intellect but first - class temperament " .
Many years after FDR , the late Roy Jenkins borrowed those words and applied them to Tony Blair , whom he much admired at first ( though not for good ) .
And Jenkins added that this was n't an insult , since that was a better combination for political leadership than the other way round .
Since then his point has been given far greater emphasis .
Brown is precisely that , but the other way round .
Even if his reputation as an intellectual in politics was at one time greatly exaggerated by his sycophantic claque , there 's no doubt that in an academic , exam - passing way he is a cleverer man than Blair .
But Brown utterly lacks the temperament for high office .
If he is n't taking uppers , downers or any other psychotropic drugs , as he assured Andrew Marr , perhaps he ought to be .
He is not quite a nervous wreck as yet , but he too often looks and sounds like a man on the verge of cracking up .
His public decline – and his ritual humiliation – has been a horrible sight : humiliating for us who witness it as well as for him .
Brown won some sympathy last week thanks to the disgusting way he was stitched up by The Sun .
( Connoisseurs of that newspaper will have enjoyed its saying that , when Brown rang Jacqui Janes to apologise for the mistake in his letter of condolence for her son's death , she did what any normal mum would do , and began recording the conversation . )
But even then , it was excruciating to hear him call himself " shy " , and gauchely allude to his daughter 's death .
After that , back to business as usual .
Shortly after his completely implausible defence of the war , we were told that " Gordon Brown will try to persuade other European leaders to commit more troops to Afghanistan " .
Do n't hold your breath – but do wonder what on earth the purpose of this Government is , and how much longer we can bear to watch this self - destruction of a creature of flesh and blood .
A book has been published in America called The Bush Tragedy , and I myself wrote an essay for The Atlantic Monthly five years ago called The Tragedy of Tony Blair .
In truth , neither of those begins to match the tragedy of Gordon Brown .

Pennsylvania Walmart Sued for Videotaping Employees , Customers in Bathroom A Pennsylvania Walmart is being sued for putting a video camera in a bathroom .
Dec. 25 , 2009  --
A Pennsylvania Walmart Supercenter videotaped employees and customers in a unisex bathroom , several former and current Walmart employees alleged in a lawsuit filed this week .
Seven former and current employees from the Tire and Lube department at the Walmart in Easton , Pa. , filed a lawsuit in county court against the Arkansas - based corporation and four local managers Dec. 21 .
Several employees discovered an " off - the - shelf " video camera in a store bathroom March 31 , 2008 , according to the court filing .
The unisex bathroom , which also served as a changing room , was used by employees and customers .
Customers and employees were not notifed of the surveillance , according to the court filing .
" I am incredulous that anyone would think that it 's appropriate conduct for any reason to photograph people in a changing room and bathroom , " said Erv McLain , the plaintiffs ' attorney .
Walmart said two workers were responsible for the camera .
" Two associates were terminated for placing a camera in an associate dressing room bathroom , " Walmart spokesman Greg Rossiter said .
" When store management learned of the camera , it was immediately removed . "
The company declined further comment .
According to the court filing , the camera was installed by Walmart 's loss - prevention unit .
The camera was used to monitor employees for possible theft and it is unclear how long the surveillance took place , McLain said .
None of the plaintiffs , however , were accused of stealing from the store .
A store manager acknowledged the existence of the surveillance camera only after employees produced a photo of the camera , McLain said .
" The filming of anyone , including employees , is not something that is unheard of in the industry , " McLain said .
" But to do it in a changing room and bathroom is totally unprecedented and it could border on criminal activity . "
The retailer 's " Security and Privacy " policy states that at " some stores and clubs [ Walmart ] may record your presence on security monitors for safety and security purposes , " according to court documents .
Fired After Complaining ?
McLain said some of his clients are " still clearly shaken by what occurred . "
Three of the plaintiffs were terminated after complaining to store management about video surveillance , McLain said .
Of the remaining plaintiffs , one worker has quit and three men continue to work at the store .
Walmart declined to comment on the three terminations .
The lawsuit , which is seeking more than $ 50,000 in damages , was filed after the parties failed to reach an out - of - court agreement , McLain said .
Among its allegations , the suit claims violations of federal and state wiretapping laws , invasion of employees ' and customers ' privacy , wrongful discharge and violation of worker and civil rights practices .
Paul Allen , a private investor and co-founder of Microsoft , has been told he has non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma , according to an e-mail message sent to employees of his investment firm , Vulcan .
This month , Mr. Allen , 56 , received the diagnosis of diffuse large B - cell lymphoma , a relatively common form of lymphoma , according to the message , sent by Jody Allen , Vulcan ’s chief executive and Mr. Allen ’s sister .
Mr. Allen received a diagnosis of Hodgkin ’s disease in 1983 , and left Microsoft for radiation therapy and a bone marrow transplant .
He never returned to the company ’s day - to - day operations , but his stock in the rapidly growing software firm made him the 17th richest man in the United States , according to Forbes magazine ’s annual list .
“ This is tough news for Paul and the family , ” wrote Ms. Allen .
“ Paul is feeling O.K. and remains upbeat .
He continues to work and he has no plans to change his role at Vulcan .
His health comes first , though , and we ’ll be sure that nothing intrudes on that . ”
As a Labour loyalist I seldom vote against the government – in fact there are three occasions when my conscience has led me to rebel since my election to Westminster .
I am often asked about my position on the Iraq war , and my view on that remains unchanged .
The other issue is cannabis and my opposition to the reclassification of the drug from a class B to a class C drug is on record , as are my reasons .
I was therefore delighted that this government has been brave enough to reverse that decision .
For the same reason I voted against the government the first time , I support its policy now .
One of the main reasons I believe we should n't alter the present classification of drugs is the danger of misuse among young people .
We would not be sending out the right message that drugs are dangerous , and there is no way any responsible body should suggest otherwise .
Medically , the earlier people take up smoking and drinking , the more vulnerable their brains are to the long - term effects of the substances .
In regards to cannabis , there is also strong evidence of a link between the adverse effects it has on long - term mental health and the fact that most young people attending psychiatric clinics are regular or occasional cannabis users .
When you combine this with the massive growth in the availability of the form of cannabis known as skunk in the last few years , then the government decision becomes a no - brainer .
According to the Home Office , skunk accounts for 70 - 80 % of the cannabis sold on the streets of Britain , compared with just 15 % in 2002 .
Skunk contains three times the levels of THC of regular cannabis , which has levels of only 2 % , according to the charity Drugscope .
This stronger version of the drug can also bring about psychotic attacks , even in those with no previous psychiatric history .
This different form of cannabis is not only stronger but also more damaging to the developing brains of our children .
Especially considering that the average age at which users first try skunk is now only 13 .
The National Treatment Agency ( NTA ) , a special health authority within the NHS established by the government , has monitored the drug use of under - 18s since before and after the first reclassification .
Its 2003 - 04 report shows that 61 % of those aged under 18 claimed cannabis to be their main problem drug .
In its latest figures , from 2008 - 09 , the NTA says 78 % of its clients claim that cannabis was their main drug of misuse .
The more traditional versions of cannabis are not much better .
A puff of smoke from a joint of cannabis contains the same components as that of tobacco , and the concentration of carcinogens in cannabis smoke is actually higher than in cigarettes .
In fact , smoking 20 cigarettes is the equivalent to smoking three joints a day .
If you examine so - called factual scientific evidence over many years , you will find on many occasions conflicting evidence and often different conclusions reached .
Long - term examination of scientific evidence often changes previous conclusions , and while scientists have a right to express their view based on their assessment of the evidence they believe is sound , they are not infallible .
I have a simple view – reclassification of cannabis sent out the wrong message , it caused considerable confusion and a belief among young people that it was safe , that smoking it was no longer a criminal act and that it was not dangerous .
We must err on the side of caution when we legislate , especially when we are dealing with the health and welfare of our future generations .
If Prof David Nutt is happy to allow his children to use drugs such as cannabis so be it , I fundamentally disagree with his position as a father and as a politician .
Nutt has the right to form his conclusions on drugs , he had the right to voice his disagreement , but the honourable option he should have taken , if he fundamentally disagreed with the political decision , would have been to resign , and be free to argue his own position .
The Nutts of this world are so far removed from the tertiary impact that such drugs have on constituencies like mine that their outlook towards cannabis on a social level resembles Woodstock rather than Whiteinch .
Therefore , I agree with Alan Johnson – horse riding will not affect my constituents either , as there are more " cannabis farms " in my constituency than stables .
So until equestrianism outranks drug - taking in the poorest parts of this country , it should be higher up the government 's agenda on dangers that we should be protecting our children from .
New Delhi , India ( CNN ) --
The Indian capital has launched a campaign to discourage urinating in public places -- a common sight across the country .
The city of New Delhi , which is preparing to host the Commonwealth Games in October of next year , will soon be displaying large billboards along its gridlocked roads and on buses in a bid to embarrass those who urinate in public to end the practice , said Mayor Kanwar Sain .
The signs will feature three characters : Mr. Thu - Thu Kumar ( the spitter ) , Mr. Kuda Kumar ( the litterbug ) and Mr. Su - Su Kumar ( the person who pees in public ) .
" The capital of India must be clean .
We see how clean are places like Singapore .
Then , why not Delhi ? "
Sain said .
Authorities will launch a similar campaign on television and radio , he said .
Urinating , spitting and littering in public are acts punishable with a fine of $ 10 or more in New Delhi .
Deep Mathur , the spokesman for the city 's municipal corporation , said offenders had been prosecuted .
He could not provide immediate figures about prosecutions aimed at sanitation control .
Bindeshwar Pathak , India 's winner of the Stockholm Water Prize , which is awarded to those who contribute to the conservation and protection of water resources , welcomed the new campaign as a motivation for a cleaner Delhi .
Nonetheless , he said India 's capital needed at least 40,000 more well - maintained urinals and bathrooms .
Countrywide , India must build 112,000 toilets every day if it wants to meet its sanitation goal by 2012 , according to the ministry of rural development .
Even as the South Asian nation emerges as a global economic power , millions of its citizens still live in poverty .
The government estimates that less than 30 percent of villagers have access to latrines , which poses serious health risks .
" Indians are clean individually , but community - wise their habits have not been very encouraging , " said Pathak , who is credited with improving sanitation across cities , villages and slums .
" Things , however , are changing now . "
Fresh data on the market share of BitTorrent clients shows that uTorrent remains the client of choice for over 60 % of all BitTorrent users .
Vuze is in second place , but its market share has dropped to 14 % .
Transmission , on the other hand , continues to gain ground , with the client ’s market share increasing by 23 % in the last two months .
BitTorrent is by far the leading file - sharing technology , with millions of people using the protocol every day .
Every two months we take a look at the market share of various BitTorrent clients to see if there are interesting trends emerging .
Today ’s report is based on data from over 17,221 unique users in a few dozen public BitTorrent swarms , collected by the Tribler P2P research team at Delft University of Technology .
The results in the table below show the market share for each individual client .
In common with our previous reports , only 5 clients reached the 1 % threshold , the remaining 14 that were encountered are grouped in the ‘ other ’ category .
Some clients were not identified by libTorrent ( rakshasa ) and those ended up in the unknown ‘ category ’ .
The changes in market share compared to our September report are also included , and these show some interesting trends .
First of all , uTorrent extended its user base and now has a massive 60 percent market share .
Vuze , BitComet and BitTorrent ’s Mainline client all lost market share .
Transmission , on the other hand , keeps on growing .
Its market share increased 23 percent and might take over BitComet ’s fourth place soon .
More on this in our December report .
SARATOGA SPRINGS , N.Y . 
Fat , cold droplets splashed from the sky as the students struggled into their uniforms : rain pants , boots , mittens and hats .
Once buttoned and bundled , they scattered toward favorite spaces : a crab apple tree made for climbing , a cluster of bushes forming a secret nook under a willow tree , a sandbox growing muddier by the minute .
They planted garlic bulbs , discovered a worm .
The rain continued to fall .
It was 8:30 a.m. on a recent Wednesday , and the Waldorf School ’s “ forest kindergarten ” was officially in session .
Schools around the country have been planting gardens and planning ever more elaborate field trips in hopes of reconnecting children with nature .
The forest kindergarten at the Waldorf School of Saratoga Springs is one of a handful in the United States that are taking that concept to another level : its 23 pupils , ages 3 ½ to 6 , spend three hours each day outside regardless of the weather .
This in a place where winter is marked by snowdrifts and temperatures that regularly dip below freezing .
The new forest kindergarten , which opened here in September , is an extreme version of the outdoor learning taught at more than 100 Waldorf schools , all but a handful of them private , scattered throughout the United States .
They are based on the teachings of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner and emphasize the arts and the natural world , with no formal academic curriculum until first grade .
Hospitals around the city , indeed all over the country , are adopting similar measures .
But the requirement at CHOP exceeds the guidelines offered by the Centers for Disease Control and is far more harsh than policies at other area hospitals .
Sometimes , when we become particularly stressed by the insanity and disfunctionality we see and experience daily throughout our society , my wife and I wonder why we chose to come to this life in the first place .
We both believe that all of us are here because we chose to be here , but we also believe that most of the people who live on this planet today are so dysfunctional , so corrupt , so messed - in - the - head , that it becomes almost impossible to imagine why she and I decided to come here in the first place .
We usually end up saying that we came here to meet each other , to be with and live with each other .
That 's true , but sometimes , in my more perceptive moments , I realize how thin such a reason is in comparison to all the rest of it .
There are some signs of improvement , though .
When I was in my 20s , if I talked with someone about my vision for humanity and America , I was generally dismissed as simplistic , idealistic , or just plain full of it .
If I pointed out to someone how dysfunctional , twisted , and corrupt our political system was , I was usually ignored .
If I pointed to unhealthy behavior among individual people , the reply was usually a shrug of the shoulders , and that ended the discussion .
Today , though , I find that the number of people who recognize the craziness of this world for what it is has increased .
The sad part is that none of the craziness is necessary or even desirable .
Nearly all of it is driven by fear .
All of it is counterproductive .
I realize that I 'm writing rather vaguely today , and only those who share my perception will really “ get ” what I 'm saying .
That 's fine .
I spend most of my “ writing time ” being specific , factual , and detailed .
Today , I 'm giving myself the day off .
Snow is piling up on the day of the biggest snowstorm of December 2009 ( so far … I hear there 's another storm lining up for Christmas ) .
The cars are snowed in , and there 's nowhere to go and nothing else to do today except to just kick back and relax .
So why not ?
As I look forward to the coming year , I see more of the same coming : more tribulation , more craziness , more dysfunctionality , more of the world being run by the craziest people among us , and they come from across the political spectrum .
So what possible reason do I see to make me hopeful that change is coming ?
( I do n't mean Obama change .
I mean real change . )
It 's hard to pinpoint , but I see signs of it , little signs , hardly noticeable to most people .
I see a weariness in peoples eyes .
I hear it in their voices .
It 's almost as if people are reaching their limits , are finally getting close to being ready to say , “ enough ” !
Enough of the insanity .
Enough of the dysfunctionality .
Enough of the corruption .
Enough , already !
I believe a day is coming very soon when the vast majority of Americans , as well as people around the world , are going to turn on their political , economic , and cultural leaders .
From left to right , the mood is going to be the same : throw the bums out .
It wo n't be pretty , and it very well might end up being violent .
I certainly hope it 's non-violent , but one way or another it 's coming , and I think it 's coming soon .
In this schematic illustration of the material ejected from SN 2007bi , the radioactive nickel core ( white ) decays to cobalt , emitting gamma rays and positrons that excite surrounding layers ( textured yellow ) rich in heavy elements like iron .
The outer layers ( dark shadow ) are lighter elements such as oxygen and carbon , where any helium must reside , which remain unilluminated and do not contribute to the visible spectrum .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
An extraordinarily bright , extraordinarily long - lasting supernova named SN 2007bi , snagged in a search by a robotic telescope , turns out to be the first example of the kind of stars that first populated the Universe .
The superbright supernova occurred in a nearby dwarf galaxy , a kind of galaxy that 's common but has been little studied until now , and the unusual supernova could be the first of many such events soon to be discovered .
SN 2007 bi was found early in 2007 by the international Nearby Supernova Factory ( SNfactory ) based at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory .
The supernova 's spectrum was unusual , and astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley subsequently obtained a more detailed spectrum .
Over the next year and a half the Berkeley scientists participated in a collaboration led by Avishay Gal - Yam of Israel 's Weizmann Institute of Science to collect and analyze much more data as the supernova slowly faded away .
The analysis indicated that the supernova 's precursor star could only have been a giant weighing at least 200 times the mass of our Sun and initially containing few elements besides hydrogen and helium - a star like the very first stars in the early Universe .
" Because the core alone was some 100 solar masses , the long - hypothesized phenomenon called pair instability must have occurred , " says astrophysicist Peter Nugent .
A member of the SNfactory , Nugent is the co-leader of the Computational Cosmology Center ( C3 ) , a collaboration between Berkeley Lab's Physics Division and Computational Research Division ( CRD ) , where Nugent is a staff scientist .
" In the extreme heat of the star 's interior , energetic gamma rays created pairs of electrons and positrons , which bled off the pressure that sustained the core against collapse . "
" SN 2007 bi was the explosion of an exceedingly massive star , " says Alex Filippenko , a professor in the Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley whose team helped obtain , analyze , and interpret the data .
" But instead of turning into a black hole like many other heavyweight stars , its core went through a nuclear runaway that blew it to shreds .
This type of behavior was predicted several decades ago by theorists , but never convincingly observed until now . "
SN 2007bi is the first confirmed observation of a pair - instability supernova .
The researchers describe their results in the 3 December 2009 issue of Nature .
On the trail of a strange beast
SN 2007bi was recorded on images taken as part of the Palomar - QUEST Survey , an automated search with the wide - field Oschin Telescope at the California Institute of Technology 's Palomar Observatory , and was quickly detected and categorized as an unusual supernova by the SNfactory .
The SNfactory has so far discovered nearly a thousand supernovae of all types and amassed thousands of spectra , but has focused on those designated Type Ia , the " standard candles " used to study the expansion history of the Universe .
SN 2007bi , however , turned out not to be a Type Ia .
For one thing , it was at least ten times as bright .
" The thermonuclear runaway experienced by the core of SN 2007 bi is reminiscent of that seen in the explosions of white dwarfs as Type Ia supernovae , " says Filippenko , " but on a much larger scale and with a far greater amount of power . "
" The discovery is a great example of how we can get all the science , in addition to cosmology , out of the SNfactory search , " says Greg Aldering , SNfactory project leader , who was not an author of the Nature paper .
" Berkeley Lab and Caltech 's Astronomy Department agreed that we would split the work , the Lab handling the Type Ia 's and Caltech all the other types . "
Nugent contacted Gal - Yam , then a Caltech postdoctoral fellow , the lead investigator for the all - other category .
" I asked , are you interested ?
He said , sure ! "
Nugent then contacted Filippenko , who was about to conduct a night of observation with the 10 - meter Keck I telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
Filippenko immediately set out to obtain an optical spectrum of the unusual supernova .
Caltech researchers subsequently acquired additional spectra with the Keck telescope , as did Paolo Mazzali 's team from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching , Germany , using the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) in Chile .
Says Mazzali , " The Keck and VLT spectra clearly indicated that an extremely large amount of material was ejected by the explosion , including a record amount of radioactive nickel , which caused the expanding gases to glow very brightly . "
Rollin Thomas of CRD , a member of C3 and the SNfactory , aided the early analysis , using the Franklin supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center ( NERSC ) to run a code he developed to generate numerous synthetic spectra for comparison with the real spectrum .
" The code uses hundreds of cores to systematically test a large number of simplified model supernovae , searching through the candidates by adjusting parameters until it finds a good fit , " says Thomas .
" This kind of data - driven approach is key to helping us understand new types of transients for which no reliable theoretical predictions yet exist . "
The model fit was unambiguous : SN 2007 bi was a pair - instability supernova .
" The central part of the huge star had fused to oxygen near the end of its life , and was very hot , " Filippenko explains .
" Then the most energetic photons of light turned into electron - positron pairs , robbing the core of pressure and causing it to collapse .
This led to a nuclear runaway explosion that created a large amount of radioactive nickel , whose decay energized the ejected gas and kept the supernova visible for a long time . "
Gal - Yam organized a team of collaborators from many institutions to continue to observe SN 2007 bi and obtain data as it slowly faded over a span of 555 days .
Says Gal - Yam , " As our follow - up observations started to roll in , I immediately realized this must be something new .
And indeed it turned out to be a fantastic example of how we are finding new types of stellar explosions . "
Because it had no hydrogen or helium lines , the usual classification scheme would have labeled the supernova a Type Ic .
But it was so much brighter than an ordinary Type Ic that it reminded Nugent of only one prior event , a supernova designated SN 1999as , found by the international Supernova Cosmology Project but unfortunately three weeks after its peak brightness .
Understanding a supernova requires a good record of its rise and fall in brightness , or light curve .
Although SN 2007 bi was detected more than a week after its peak , Nugent delved into years of data compiled by NERSC from the SNfactory and other surveys .
He found that the Catalina Sky Survey had recorded SN 2007 bi before its peak brightness and could provide enough data to calculate the duration of the rising curve , an extraordinarily long 70 days - more evidence for the pair - instability identification .
A fossil laboratory of the early Universe
" It 's significant that the first unambiguous example of a pair - instability supernova was found in a dwarf galaxy , " says Nugent .
" These are incredibly small , very dim galaxies that contain few elements heavier than hydrogen and helium , so they are models of the early Universe . "
Dwarf galaxies are ubiquitous but so faint and dim - " they take only a few pixels on a camera , " says Nugent , " and until recently , with the development of wide - field projects like the SNfactory , astronomers had wanted to fill the chip with galaxies " - that they 've rarely been studied .
SN 2007bi is expected to focus attention on what Gal - Yam and his collaborators call " fossil laboratories to study the early Universe . "
Says Filippenko , " In the future , we might end up detecting the very first generation of stars , early in the history of the Universe , through explosions such as that of SN 2007 bi - long before we have the capability of directly seeing the pre-explosion stars . "
With the advent of the multi-institutional Palomar Transient Factory , a fully automated , wide - field survey to find transients , led by Caltech 's Shri Kulkarni , and with the aid of the Deep Sky Survey established by Nugent at NERSC to compile historical data from Palomar - QUEST , the SNfactory , the Near Earth Asteroid Team , and other surveys , the collaborators expect they will soon find many more ultrabright , ultramassive supernovae , revealing the role of these supernovae in creating the Universe as we know it today .

Blockbuster is piloting a new movie - rental program that allows customers to load movies onto SD cards and play them back on mobile phones and TVs equipped with SD readers .
The rentals cost $ 1.99 .
Perhaps conceived as a one - up response to the unexpectedly popular RedBox movie kiosks , the SD - card rental stations are meant to address some of the age - old problems with DVD rentals–namely that they ’re easily damaged , and must be returned .
With an SD rental , the user keeps the SD card , though the content contains DRM which sets a date of expiration .
( Above , the taxonomy of SD cards ; below , a Blockbuster SD kiosk . )
The SD rentals are also meant to target online streaming , which is growing in popularity thanks largely to Netflix ’s Watch Instantly feature .
Blockbuster is hoping that the better quality video contained on their SD cards will win streaming video customers back , but of course , you still have the inconvenience of traveling to a Blockbuster SD kiosk .
Blockbuster also offers “ on demand ” viewing via its
Web site , letting you download DRM ’d movie rentals as opposed to streaming them .
Still , renting even the crappiest of movies will cost you nearly the same as a whole month of movies on Netflix ; this downloadable copy of Cranked High Voltage is $ 4 .
Other obstacles remain .
Many phones use micro or mini SD cardslots , and do n’t take full - sized SD cards .
Many
TVs still are n’t built to play video of SD media , and most laptops do n’t have them either , meaning that watching an SD video on the road means taking a long a USB card reader .
Another problem : not everyone will enjoy the irony of driving somewhere to pick up a data - card the size of a postage stamp .
Still , SD cards do represent a marked improvement over DVDs in durability and re-usability , so if they caught on it ’d hardly be a step backwards for movie buffs .
President Obama touted the underlying numbers in today 's unemployment report , noting that the rate of lost jobs is slowing considerably , but adding that " we still have a long way to go . "
Speaking at a community college in Allentown , Pa. , Obama stressed that while the nation lost 11,000 jobs in November , that was about 115,000 fewer than forecast .
And the actual unemployment rate dropped , from 10.2 percent to 10 percent .
( USA TODAY 's Paul Davidson summarizes the report here . )
" Overall , this is the best jobs report we 've seen since 2007 , " Obama said , though he added he wants to keep things " in perspective . "
Joking that " good trends do n't pay the rent , " Obama said the nation still needs to figure out new ways to generate jobs .
" The direction is clear , " Obama said .
" When you think about how this year began ... today 's report is a welcome sign that there are better days ahead . "
Of course , the Republicans have a different take on the report that continued to put unemployment in double digits .
House Republican Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said anyone who celebrates today 's report " is out of touch with the American people . "
" I am confident our economy will ultimately recover , " Boehner added , " but it will do so because of the hard work and entrepreneurship of the American people , not wasteful Washington spending . "
During his appearance in Allentown , Obama also touted next Tuesday 's big speech on the economy .
" I 'm going to speak in greater detail about the ideas I 'll be sending to Congress to help jump start private sector hiring and get Americans back to work , " he said .

Natsuo Kirino , author of the novels “ Out , ” “ Grotesque ” and “ Real World , ” believes that cellphone novels have hardly killed off traditional literature .
“ I think there is a split in the reading styles among young people , ” she wrote in an e-mail message .
“ On one hand , there are those who love keitai novels — they feel comfortable with the flat and simple language and expressions .
I also feel there are a lot of young people who are not satisfied with simplicity , who read complex and advanced novels , and even wish to write their own . ”
Nor does it seem that cellphone novels have permanently shortened attention spans .
Murakami ’s latest novel , “ 1Q84 , ” which weighs in at over 1,000 pages , had huge print runs when it came out in Japan this year .
Even as some see new technology as a threat to literacy , surveys suggest that Japanese are reading more than before .
According to an article in the newspaper Sankei Shimbun , middle - school students read an average of four books a month in 2008 , the most ever in the 30 - year history of the survey .
( The article did note that the reading material was not always sophisticated . )
A separate national survey published last year in Yomiuri Shimbun found that 54 percent of people were reading more than one book a month , compared with 48 percent in the year before .
Japanese people also seem to be writing more .
Motoyuki Shibata , who teaches literature and translation at the University of Tokyo , noticed that new technology makes his students more willing to write Japanese , even if it is on their computers or cellphones .
“ Some people say the tradition of letter writing has come back , ” Shibata says .
Thanks to e-mail , he adds , “ I get more messages and feedback from students than I used to 20 years ago . ”
People may also be using and recognizing more kanji .
Instead of having to write every stroke from memory , people can type words phonetically into a computer and a list of characters to choose from pops up on the screen .
( This wondrous phenomenon allows me to quickly dash off e-mail messages filled with complex characters .
As a result , I am much more inclined to send messages to Japan . )
Critics may protest that Japanese is defined by its formal expressions , polite openers and roundabout way of getting to the point .
In an age of cellphone novels and rapid text messaging , wo n’t some of this be lost ?
Maybe .
But Japanese might also become less intimidating , allowing a wider range of people to enjoy the pleasures of reading and writing .
Will technology cause Japanese to lose its reputation as a uniquely difficult language ?
That ’s possible , too .
But it could be a good thing .
Japan , a rapidly aging society , may well have to face an influx of immigration in the not too distant future .
A more accessible language could accelerate the country ’s process of internationalization .
Who knows , we might even one day find that , as Shibata put it , “ this idea of Japanese being a very difficult , esoteric language may have been a myth all the time . ”
In 1997 , as a result of his tireless efforts to entertain American troops and campaign on their behalf , an act of congress was signed which resulted in Bob Hope becoming the world ’s ‘ first and only honorary veteran of the U.S. armed forces ’ .
Nothing illustrates the effect of Hope ’s humanitarian work more than the following letter , written in 1973 by a U.S. pilot named Frederic Flom .
When he wrote the letter , Flom was days away from being released as a prisoner of war , an unimaginable 6 ½ years after being captured in Vietnam .
After hearing of Hope ’s POW - related work from another captured pilot , Flom felt the need to write Bob a letter of thanks .

24 Feb , ’ 73 Dear Mr. Hope , Just another fan letter from a different address .
I am an F - 105 pilot , shot down over North Vietnam on 8 August , 1966 .
I have been held captive since that time , but will finally be released in three days .
We have almost no contact with the outside world here , however , some word has gotten in , via POWs shot down in ’ 72 , concerning some of the activities of the American people , & you in particular , on behalf of the POWs .
That is what prompted this note .
I want to thank you for all you have done or attempted to do on our behalf .
You are truly a POW ’s friend , & are deserving of more than just a letter from each of us .
There have been many a dark & lonesome night when we have felt all but forgotten .
It thrills our hearts & makes us glow with pride to learn that the American people have not forgotten us , & that a celebrity such as yourself has active concern .
I extend to you & all of America my deep appreciation & I know I speak for all of us .
There is something great about our nation & its people .
A celebrity can have a large effect in influencing its thinking & attitude .
This effect can be positive or negative , good or bad .
Thank you Bob , for being such a large part of America & our wonderful way of life .
Best of luck to you , Fred Flom

Tonight on the Best Persons segment of MSNBC program Countdown host Keith Olbermann took a little time to compliment the American people for not buying tickets to Glenn Beck ’s half live half movie performance of his book The Christmas Sweater .
Olbermann pointed out that only 64 people combined bought tickets in New York , Boston , and Washington , D.C .
Here is the video :

Olbermann said , “ Number one best taste , the people of the United States of America .
Remember the big Lonesome Rhodes / Beck extravaganza last week , a half live a half movie version of simulcast of his book The Christmas Sweater that rip off of The Gift of the Magi that was shown in theaters nationwide ? ”
He continued , “ It sold 30 tickets .
In Washington , D.C. , 30 people bought tickets to see Glenn Beck cry .
In New York and Boston it was 34 , but that was combined .
But of course you say , New York ’s all socialists , fascists , communists , what about where the real people live , like in Rockwall , TX ?
Ninety four tickets in Texas , 94 in a theater holding 193 .
On top of which , Beck ’s ratings among younger viewers down 30 % for the first week of this month down 30 % from the first week of last month .
The next time he cries it will be for an entirely different reason . ”
There have been signs around the edges of Beck ’s numbers that his popularity is starting to drop a little .
His ratings were in a strong upward trend that was boosted from the right after he called President Obama a racist , and the Color of Change boycott proved to be effective .
Beck ’s numbers still dominate his time slot , but at his peak he was coming close to , if not passing , the 3 million viewer mark .
Since then he has settled into drawing 2 million or so viewers a day .
He has the second highest rated program in cable news , and his time slot is up 101 % over last year .
While Beck remains a ratings force , he has had quite a few failures , the tea parties , his 9/11 protest , and now the Christmas special that attracted indifference .
Glenn
Beck can sell truckloads of books , attract television ratings , but he is not quite the force that he seems to believe he is .
Keith Olbermann painted a picture of Beck as a star on the decline .
I do n’t think that I would go that far , but in an effort to cash in while he is a hot property , Glenn Beck is overexposing himself , and I think Beck ’s movement into politics , especially if he turns his back on the GOP , will end his popularity .
Do not disturb eggs : MP reveals Britain 's oddest laws

LONDON – Britons are forbidden from disturbing packs of eggs and from selling game killed on a Sunday , it was revealed Thursday by an opposition MP who condemned ministers for introducing ridiculous laws .

Britons are forbidden from disturbing packs of eggs and from selling game killed on a Sunday , it was revealed Thursday by an opposition MP who condemned ministers for introducing ridiculous laws .
[ Agencies ]
The day after Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's government laid out its legislative agenda for the coming year , Liberal Democrat lawmaker Chris Huhne noted the stream of sometimes " completely bizarre " new offences it had created .
Since the Labour party took power in 1997 under then prime minister Tony Blair , it has created 3,600 new criminal offences , Huhne said - adding this was " massively complicating " the job of police and the criminal justice system .
" Some of these offences are completely bizarre - for example , the offence of causing a nuclear explosion , " he told members of parliament ( MPs ) .
" The idea that anyone might cause a nuclear explosion without killing anybody , and therefore being subject to a possible charge of murder , is extremely far - fetched . "
Other new offences include " wilfully pretending to be a barrister " , " disturbing a pack of eggs when instructed not to by an authorised officer " and " offering for sale a game bird killed on a Sunday or Christmas day " , he said .
Huhne accused the government of doing nothing to repeal these laws .
Justice minister Jack Straw asked for a full list of the ones the MP wanted removed from the statute books so that he could review them .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp has had talks with News Corp about a tie up , which would involve News Corp getting paid to take its news websites off Google Inc , a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday .
News Corp , which owns such papers as the Wall Street Journal and the Sun , started the discussions , which were at an early stage , the source said .
News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has said he wants to make people pay for access to his news websites .
Other publishers including The New York Times are also searching for ways to charge for news online , convinced that they must not give news through search engines such as Google and Yahoo Inc .
Microsoft has also talked with other online publishers about removing their sites from Google , according to the Financial Times , which first reported the development .
“ This is all about Microsoft hurting Google ’s margins , ” the FT quoted a website publisher , who had been approached by Microsoft .
Microsoft , which relaunched its search engine as Bing this year , has been looking for ways to challenge market leader Google .
Earlier this year , it signed a 10 - year global web search partnership with Yahoo , a deal that U.S. and European antitrust regulators are evaluating .
Microsoft could not reached for comment late on Sunday .
News Corp declined to comment .
The source is anonymous because the talks are not public .
Atheism itself , atheism as such , is n't and can't be a movement , because atheism is , at a minimum , simply non-theism : non-belief in any god .
Mere non-belief in any X can't by itself constitute a movement , because it 's merely an absence ( or at most a refusal ) of belief .
If every absence of belief in [ your chosen belief - object here ] amounted to a movement , the traffic jam would be a nightmare .
A belief about the world should n't necessarily commit us to political action – we have to be able to say " No " to affirmative beliefs about the world without thereby signing up to a campaign .
We need to be able to make such choices more freely than such a requirement would allow .
Atheism can however include something like a movement , of course , as can other beliefs and non-beliefs .
Some of the disagreement among atheists is around this issue .
Many atheists want to be able to be atheists without being dragooned into some boring noisy unsubtle bad - tempered " movement " .
Many other atheists want to be able to be overt explicit unbashful atheists without constantly being told to be more euphemistic or evasive or respectful or just plain silent by other atheists , who surely ought to know better .
This " who surely ought to know better " is one place where the disagreement really grips .
To the first group – let 's call them plain atheists – this idea looks like typical political hegemonising , like ideological policing , like the demand for uniformity and agreement and loyalty that always goes with a " movement " .
It looks like groupthink .
To the second group – call them movement atheists – that 's not it , it 's just that other atheists should understand that euphemism and respect have been the norm for a long time and we really ought to be allowed to talk freely .
I 'm in the second group , but when I try hard enough , I can see why people in the first group want to be able to be atheists without taking on a whole lot of extra baggage .
The problem , of course , is that what each group wants is incompatible with what the other group wants .
In a perfect world , plain atheists could just ignore movement atheists , and movement atheists could mutter away without disturbing their quieter friends .
But in the real world , many plain atheists feel that movement atheists bring the whole notion of atheism into disrepute .
We make it more difficult for plain atheists to be just that , because the world at large now thinks of atheists in general as movement atheists .
I see the difficulty , and like the walrus , I deeply sympathise , but I also think that plain atheists should to some extent put up with it .
We do n't actually want to dragoon them into " the movement " but we would like to be able to talk freely without even other atheists telling us to pipe down .
To put it another way , we 're not telling them to be noisier , but we do n't much like it when they tell us to be quieter .
That seems reasonably fair , I think .
Yes , granted , we 've made it somewhat harder to be a plain atheist ( though they could always just closet themselves completely , by pretending to be theists ) – we seem to be jumping up and down on the parapet yelling " over here , we 're over here ! " while everyone else is trying to avoid enemy fire .
But that 's life .
The pope is always making life difficult for liberal Catholics , too ; so it goes .
Where one locates oneself on this map depends partly on whether one thinks religion is mostly benign , or mostly harmful , or a difficult - to - unravel mix of the two .
It 's not a neat mapping though – I 'm a committed " movement " atheist in the sense that I really do think taboos on open discussion of religion should go away , but I also think religion is a difficult - to - unravel mix of the benign and the harmful .
But then I would n't be surprised to learn that all " new " or movement atheists match that description too .
I provide commentary on political economy , police and prosecutorial abuse , and whatever else might come to mind .
Let justice roll down like waters , and righteousness like an ever - flowing stream .

Here 's essentially what caused Dubai 's debt extravaganza to finally come to an end .
Far too much easy money flowed into Dubai during previous years , fueling a massive construction boom financed with debt .
For awhile this debt looked sustainable to those involved because it was ostensibly backed by valuable property .
Yet when the global financial crisis hit , property prices fell in many parts of the world .
Dubai property prices were hit especially hard .
As shown below by the skiing Emirati , Dubai property rates per square foot fell 45 % from Q3 2008 to Q3 2009 according to Colliers International .
Thus just as many American 's went underwater on their mortgages due to the American property crisis , owing more to the bank than their house was worth , the same thing basically happened to the Nakheel property business of the Dubai state - owned conglomerate Dubai World .
Combined with near - term cash flow constraints , this finally forced Dubai World to admit to its creditors that it would not be able to meet all of its debt obligations .

SHENANDOAH , Pa. ( AP ) 
A police chief charged with trying to cover up the fatal beating of a Mexican immigrant by white teenagers was named in a 2006 civil suit that made a startling claim : Borough police beat to death a Hispanic teenager , then hung him from the bars of his holding cell to make it appear a suicide .
Police Chief Matthew Nestor was never charged , but the allegations contained in the lawsuit , in Tuesday 's indictment and in other civil claims depict a police department with pervasive hostility to minorities and a penchant for using excessive force .
Police " acted as feudal warlords in this coal town community that people were afraid of , " said attorney John Karoly , who represents the parents of 18 - year - old David Vega in their federal lawsuit against the borough .
" I would not suggest they were not abusive to everyone and anyone , but I would say the pattern certainly starts to appear that minorities took the thrust of their abuse . "
The suit names Nestor and Capt. Jamie Gennarini as defendants , as well as the borough of Shenandoah .
The officers have denied wrongdoing .
A civil trial is scheduled for next summer .
Nestor and two other officers were charged Tuesday with orchestrating a coverup as the FBI investigated the fatal attack on Luis Ramirez by a group of high school football players .
Gennarini and Nestor were indicted separately in a scheme to extort money from illegal gambling operations .
The officers pleaded not guilty before a federal magistrate in Wilkes - Barre and were being held until a bail hearing Wednesday afternoon .
A third federal indictment charges teenagers Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak with a hate crime in connection with the July 2008 attack on Ramirez , 25 , an illegal immigrant from Mexico .
Donchak and Piekarsky have an initial court appearance scheduled for Tuesday .
Their lawyers did not return phone messages Wednesday .
Donchak and Piekarsky were previously charged in state court with Ramirez 's death .
Piekarsky was acquitted in May by an all - white jury of third - degree murder and ethnic intimidation ; Donchak was acquitted of aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation .
Both were convicted of simple assault .
Piekarsky is scheduled to be released from jail Thursday .
Donchak remains locked up .
Early in the Ramirez investigation , Schuylkill County prosecutors determined that they had a serious problem with the Shenandoah police , District Attorney James Goodman said Wednesday .
No Shenandoah officers were called to testify at the trial .
" We determined the police did not do their job and they were partly involved with this coverup , " said Goodman , adding that he asked the Justice Department to investigate the force .
" It was pretty troubling and it obviously caused problems with the prosecution in the case and made the case more difficult , " Goodman said .
Police in this blue - collar town of 5,000 , about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia , face other accusations of wrongdoing .
Gennarini and Capt. Raymond Nestor — the father of the police chief — arrested David Vega at his home shortly before 8:55 p.m. on Nov. 28 , 2004 , while responding to a report of a domestic dispute , according to court documents .
" While in police custody ... Vega was beaten to death and then hung from the bars of a holding cell to make it appear as if he had committed suicide , " the lawsuit said .
Vega was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m .
His father , Carlos Vega , said Wednesday that he had no doubt what happened to his son .
Vega , a retired chef who moved to Shenandoah 19 years ago , said he 's afraid to leave his own house for fear of the police .
" A big group of Spanish people moved into Shenandoah , and they did n't know how to react to that , " said Vega , who was born in New York and is of Puerto Rican descent .
" Were they fair to us ?
No .
They 're fair to their own kind .
The outsider always had to pay . "
An autopsy conducted by the county coroner determined Vega 's son committed suicide , but Karoly said the coroner accepted Nestor 's explanation that Vega 's bruises had come earlier as he resisted arrest .
A second autopsy arranged by the family confirmed Vega " suffered extensive , massive injuries consistent with a profound beating .
...
The defendant did not die of hanging , " the suit said .
Vega had a new girlfriend and was meeting with military recruiters about earning money for college , Karoly said .
" He had everything to live for , " he said .
" The kid was on top of the world and had no reason to commit suicide . "
Nestor 's attorney insists otherwise , writing in court papers : " The only credible independent evidence to date establishes that David Vega committed suicide . "
Nestor faces yet another lawsuit , this one filed by a Shenandoah man arrested by the chief and another officer on a drug charge March 11 .
David Murphy Sr. , who is also represented by Karoly , claims Nestor and another officer made him turn over his prescription blood thinner at the police station , then refused to allow him to take his evening dose .
Nestor also punched Murphy in the back , where he had recently undergone spinal fusion surgery , the lawsuit said .
The officers left Murphy in a holding cell overnight .
He " started to experience severe pain in his chest and arm ... but there was no one in the station to hear his cries for help , " the suit said .
He passed out ; Karoly said he suffered a heart attack .
He spent four days in a hospital .
Murphy , who is black , claims Nestor threatened to kill him if he filed suit .
The chief told Murphy he would not " make it out of the Shenandoah jail alive ... that ( he ) would end up like that Mexican who ' hung ' himself , " the suit said .

Specialists from New Zealand plan to recover two crates of Scotch whisky left more than 100 years ago by the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and trapped deep in Antarctic ice .
A spokesman for the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust said the whisky trove had been found under a hut built at Cape Royds , a promontory on McMurdo Sound , during Mr. Shackleton ’s first South Pole expedition of 1907 - 9 .
The expedition ended in failure when the explorer was forced to turn back about 100 miles from the pole .
A trust spokesman said the crates and the bottles would undergo conservation work in New Zealand before being returned to the hut , which is being restored as a museum .
The spokesman , Al Fastier , said there were no plans to sample the McKinlay & Co. whisky , but the distiller Whyte & Mackay , owner of the brand , said it hoped to acquire a bottle with a view to recreating the century - old blend .
I regret what happened , I should n't have gone along with it :
The 15 - year - old pupil seduced by his RE teacher reveals how it 's ruined his life
Shamed : Teacher Madeleine Martin arriving at court where she was jailed for having sex with a pupil
One of the worst aspects of prison life is the time it affords its inhabitants to think .
Since being locked up last week , Madeleine Martin has had more time than she would like to reflect on the events that led her to such a place .
In the cold light of day , does she feel shame and humiliation , or is she still trying to excuse her outrageous behaviour ?
Mrs Martin , a 39 - year - old religious education teacher with a previously exemplary record , has just begun a 32 - month jail sentence for having sex with a 15 - year - old boy who was a pupil in her class .
She had been assigned as ' mentor ' to the boy to encourage him with his studies , but unfortunately chose to interpret the word in an entirely inappropriate fashion .
Mrs Martin , who had separated from her husband before she became involved with the boy , is the mother of two teenage daughters .
Their devastation and humiliation at their mother 's actions is all too easy to imagine .
This is the latest in a disturbing number of cases where women teachers have been jailed after entering into relationships with pupils - and raises serious questions about collapsing moral boundaries in our schools .
In his first interview today , the boy and his father tell their story .
For legal reasons they cannot be named , so we shall call the pupil Robert and his father Chris .
It 's a fairly graphic story of a series of sexual encounters conducted largely inside Madeleine Martin 's Alfa Romeo 147 .
Robert presents a rather tragic picture of a wildly infatuated woman who had convinced herself of the possibility of a serious relationship with a pupil a year younger than her eldest daughter ; a woman who risked sex in public places with her young pupil ; a woman who had clearly taken leave of her senses .
Robert is an ordinary teenager .
His parents are divorced , he lives with his property developer father in the Greater Manchester area and sees his mother most evenings .
At school , he admits he has not applied himself as much as he could have and has got into trouble from time to time for playing up in class .
He has had girlfriends , but looks and acts exactly as you would expect a 15 - year - old boy might .
During our interview he thinks carefully about each question before he answers , and is open and honest .
' She made all the running and I just went along with it ...
It 's not the sort of thing you do with your teacher , is it ? '
He does not speak in a boastful manner .
It will pain Mrs Martin and her family to read his assessment of their relationship , delivered with the brutal honesty that is the preserve of the young .
' I liked her as a teacher , but I was n't really that attracted to her , ' he says .
' She made all the running and I just went along with it .
' It was one of those situations you find yourself in without really knowing how it 's happened , and as soon as we were in it , I was thinking to myself : " How do I get out of this ? "
' It was weird .
It 's not the sort of thing you do with your teacher , is it ?'
No , it is n't .
The pair met when she joined the comprehensive in Greater Manchester in September last year .
Then , that December , she took on the role of Robert 's mentor .
This involved regular hour - long one - to - one teaching sessions in her classroom after school .
' At first , during lessons I had no sense of her being attracted to me , ' recalls Robert .
' But when the mentoring started she offered to give me a lift home afterwards , and by January she was taking me home practically every day .
' Sometimes she would say to me : " Feel my hands - how cold they are , " which I found odd , and I would quickly touch them and pull my hand away . '
Around this time , Robert and his father , Chris , saw Mrs Martin together at a parents ' meeting at the school .
Chris recalls there was something ' not quite right ' about the meeting .
Regrets : Mrs Martin's teenage victim whose identity has been obscured for legal reasons
' She was perfectly nice but she was very on edge , ' he says .
' I could n't put my finger on what was wrong , but , of course , I would never have guessed why . '
Clearly , by this juncture , she had resolved upon seducing Chris 's 15 - year - old son .
Robert says : ' One Friday when she took me home , she stopped the car near the house and asked me for a hug , ' says Robert .
' It felt a bit weird , but I just hugged her quickly to get it over and done with so I could get out of the car .
' On the Monday , when I saw her again , she asked me if I 'd felt uncomfortable hugging her and I said I did n't because I did n't want her to feel bad .
' She told me she had family problems , that her sister was ill with cancer . '
Four days later , Mrs Martin asked for Robert 's phone number .
She did not call but sent him a message on Facebook , the social networking site , to which he replied that he did n't have time to respond properly .
' When I went to bed that night she started texting me at 11.30 pm saying she really wished I had n't had to go [ off Facebook ] , and I replied I was sorry , too , as I did n't know what else to say .
' She said she 'd been drinking quite a few glasses of wine , and said there was someone she liked , but that it was wrong .
I could see by now where this was leading , but I asked her several times who it was and she eventually said it was me .
' I remember thinking : " This is all a bit mad . "
I was a bit attracted to her , but not much , really . '
The mentoring meeting the following Monday was rather awkward but Martin offered to drop Robert home .
On the way she stopped the car and hugged him again , then began kissing his neck .
' I liked her but it was n't as though she was dead good - looking .
I was thinking : " Oh my God !
This is really weird , how is it going to end ? " '
' We started kissing , and after a while I asked if she was going to take me home and she said she really did n't want to go . '
Given the highly illicit nature of what was happening , one might have at least expected Martin to conduct herself with some discretion .
Not so .
She drove her young charge to a cinema and restaurant complex with a busy car park : in short , about as public a place as you are going to find .
' We climbed in the back of the car and had sex , ' says Robert .
The encounter was cut short after they heard a voice on a loudspeaker - presumably someone working at the cinema or one of the restaurants who was stunned at what they were seeing - reading out their number plate and ordering the car to leave immediately .
' When we heard the loudspeaker telling us to move , Madeleine panicked .
She said she thought it was the police and quickly drove off . '
But she did not come to her senses .
Later that night , Robert received a text from her saying she had ' really liked ' the sex .
Over a nine - day period , there were to be ten sexual encounters in total .
' The first time we had sex we had no protection and she said she was on the Pill , ' says Robert .
' This time she said she 'd forgotten to take it , though I found out later she was n't on the Pill at all .
' As far as I 'm aware , she did not become pregnant . '
Already Robert had misgivings about the sexual adventure he had embarked on with his teacher .
' I liked her of course , but it was n't as though she was dead good - looking .
I was thinking : " Oh my God !
This is really weird , how is it going to end ? "
' But Madeleine was very happy and even phoned Robert 's father while she was with him at a ' mentoring ' class to say how well Robert was doing .
Which you might call brazen cheek .
Around this time , Madeleine had asked her RE class to produce an essay on the ethics of abortion .
' I had n't got round to doing it , so she said she 'd do it for me , ' says Robert .
She was obviously pleased with it , for he received top marks .
After several more sexual encounters in her car , Martin attempted to elevate this sordid arrangement into something resembling a normal relationship .
She invited Robert over to dinner at the house she shared with her children .
' She said one of her daughters was on a school trip and she 'd told the other she had a man coming round and to stay with a friend , ' says Robert .
' I told Dad I was staying at Mum 's house .
She was away at the time , but I told my brother who was staying there that I was staying with a mate .
' If other boys were there , she would send them off on various errands so she could be alone with me '
' Madeleine cooked some Chinese food and I helped her .
She offered me some wine but I refused .
We watched The Deer Hunter then went to bed . '
The next day , however , Robert had an overwhelming sense of wishing to avoid his teacher .
Over the next week , Mrs Martin sent a number of text messages which Robert either ignored or replied to telling her he could n't talk as he was tired and was going to bed .
After a week , an increasingly desperate Martin texted to say she had to see him .
' I had to get it over with so she picked me up in the car and we went to the dirt path we had been to before , ' says Robert .
' She said she could n't carry on like this because she did n't want to get hurt .
I was very relieved .'
But Madeleine Martin was obsessed .
According to Robert , she would find a pretext to give him detention .
' I was n't behaving any differently than before , but she would put me in detention .
If other boys were there , she would send them off on various errands so she could be alone with me .
Then she would ask me why I was behaving the way I was , and I would say it was no different to the way I usually was with her .
' Then , one time , she asked me to give her a hug and I started laughing and refused .
When she asked why not , I said : " Because you 're the teacher . " '
How crushed Martin must have been when Robert laughed at her , and how ironic that it was he who had to point out to her the blindingly obvious fact that what had happened was wrong .
' It was starting to do my head in , ' he says .
' I was thinking about it constantly . '
Robert confided in his elder brother in April , and together they told their mother and then their father .
' I do feel upset and angry about how all this has affected my schooling .
I can't see what future I have now '
' I had n't told anyone up till then but I had to confide in someone , offload it , ' adds Robert
His mother immediately called the police and Robert gave them a statement .
Martin was arrested the next day at the school , and was later bailed on condition she lived at an address in Nottingham .
Robert 's involvement with Martin has had serious ramifications for him .
He says he still feels angry , and his father says that at times Robert is more quiet than he used to be .
It 's a lot for a 15 - year - old to have to cope with .
After the scandal broke , Robert felt too embarrassed to return to school .
He has been attending a local college two days a week , studying for GCSEs in English and maths .
' I applied to go to another local school where I spent my first couple of years in senior school , but they said they had no places available .
I did n't want to start afresh somewhere new where I would n't know anyone , so at the moment I 'm at this college .
' It 's full of people who have been expelled from other schools and some of them can barely write their names .
' I do feel upset and angry about how all this has affected my schooling .
I can't see what future I have now , and I do n't know if I 'll even be able to get a job because of all this . '
At her trial at Manchester Crown Court , Martin 's defence team said she had been upset by the news that her sister was gravely ill with cancer .
Does Robert 's father believe this is any sort of excuse ?
' I 'm afraid not .
I 'm very sorry to hear about her sister , but using it as a defence sounds like clutching at straws to me .
' This was a clear abuse of the position of trust in which she had been placed .
She took advantage of the situation .
She crossed the line .
' It 's extremely shocking and has been devastating for our family .
And it is n't just us .
I feel for her daughters , I really do .
What they must be going through right now must be terrible . '
His son adds : ' I was n't glad she was sent to jail but I think it is right .
She has done wrong .
I just wanted it to be over and I am relieved that it is .
I do n't feel anything about her but I regret what happened .
But I should n't have gone along with it .
It 's my own fault . '
Robert is being rather harsh on himself .
Yes , he did go along with it , but he is a 15 - year - old boy who had no idea how to handle his teacher 's advances .
And in her heart Madeleine Martin must know that she , and she alone , must be blamed both for Robert 's plight and for her own .
Last month , I wrote about thousands of people at the Knock shrine in Ireland who stared at the Sun because they thought they were seeing visions of the Virgin Mary .
I specifically said , " That ’s a bad idea : it can cause temporary blindness , and permanent damage to the retina ... "
Guess what ?
Yup .
A doctor in Ireland says he is seeing an unprecedented rise in the number of cases of solar retinopathy , damage to the eye from staring at the Sun .
Moreover , those cases are directly linked to the Knock " visions " :
Dr Eamonn O’Donoghue , a consultant ophthalmologist surgeon in University Hospital Galway , says the hospital would usually see one case of solar retinopathy “ at most ” per year .
However , this year there have been five such cases , all of which have been linked to events at Knock .
Dr O’Donoghue said people needed to be warned of the condition as it was “ potentially very , very dangerous ” and could cause long - term damage to the most vulnerable part of the eye .
“ These people came in because they have had a significant reduction in their vision and they could very well be a smaller representative sample , ” Dr O’Donoghue said , adding that two of those who had presented to the hospital had also reported that other members of their families had suffered visual damage .
As I wrote before , if people want to believe in something , that 's their right .
But when it causes physical damage , including potentially permanent diminution of eyesight , where do we draw the line ?
I imagine parents at Knock were telling their children to look at the Sun , too .
Realistically , trying to stop this sort of thing is extremely difficult .
It 's obvious that staring at the Sun is dangerous , but because the people involved were having a religious experience they tend to get a pass in the media ( in the original news article , an unnamed skeptic got one line , but believers got far more attention ) .
If this happened in America I would think that it would be covered very delicately by the press .
But imagine if this happened at some cult compound in a rural part of a state , and children were involved .
There 'd be a public outcry , and it's not too much to expect that the government would take action .
This is a real problem .
When I write an article about a person who sees Jesus on a burnt iron or the Virgin Mary in a wood grain pattern , no matter how polite I am someone always accuses me of being arrogant , and asking how dare I make fun of someone 's belief ?
This is why I dare do it .
Belief is one thing , but when it leads to obvious physical or mental harm then we are obligated to speak up .
I have no problem with respecting people 's feelings , or the fact that their beliefs are an important part of their own identities -- even if I do n't necessarily respect the belief itself -- but when that leads to something like staring at the Sun , or not protecting your children from disease , then we cannot give people a free pass just because they are acting on their religious beliefs .
Tip o' the sun filter to Cian Finnerty and Len Feehan .
The Mismeasures of Gould By J. Philippe Rushton
( Originally published in The National Review , September 15 , 1997 )
Mr. Rushton is professor of psychology at the University of Western Ontario in London .
This article is adapted from his review in the referred academic journal Personality and Individual Differences , Vol. 23 , pp. 169-180 .

`` [ Steven Jay ]
Gould occupies a rather curious position , particularly on his side of the Atlantic .
Because of the excellence of his essays , he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the pre-eminent evolutionary theorist .
In contrast , the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with , but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists . ''
YEP , that 's the Steven Jay Gould -- Harvard paleontologist , best - selling science popularizer , Natural History magazine columnist , and media superstar -- in the opinion of John Maynard Smith , one of the founders of modern evolutionary theory .
Smith 's skepticism about Gould is pervasive among his peers .
Daniel Dennett 's brilliant 1995 book , Darwin's Dangerous Idea , was largely devoted to dispelling Gouldian misinformation .
John Alcock , author of standard animal - behavior textbooks , recently described Gould as ``consistently employing the same limited set of debating techniques and stylistic devices . . . while simply ignoring evidence to the contrary . ''
This civil war among evolutionists has now burst into the open .
Gould struck back , with his trademark deceptive elegance , in The New York Review of Books ( June 12 , June 26 , August 14 ) , house organ of the New York intelligentsia that has long been his real constituency .
The point at issue between the evolutionists and Gould seems arcane .
Does evolution proceed gradually or through ``punctuated equilibrium '' -- immobility interrupted by transforming upheaval ?
Gould 's preference for the latter reflects his left - wing politics -- for evolutionary upheavals , read social revolutions .
Yet it may also be traced to his refusal to admit that systematic differences , probably evolutionary in origin , exist among human beings .
That same refusal regularly distorts Gould 's 1981 The Mismeasure of Man , now reissued in a ``revised and expanded '' edition ( Norton , $ 13.95 ) .
The Mismeasure of Man ( which in its first version sold 250,000 copies , was translated into ten languages , and became required reading for undergraduate and even graduate classes ) dealt with questions that are delicate , controversial , and ( to the scientific layman ) even discomfiting : IQ , brain size , sex , and race .
It did so by unscrupulously mishandling the evidence .
The new version -- described by the publisher as ``an acclaimed classic that refutes the conclusions of The Bell Curve ' ' -- is expanded but hardly revised .
It regurgitates character assassinations of deceased scientists , misrepresents their work despite published refutation , and studiously withholds 15 years of new research that contradicts every major scientific argument Gould puts forth .
Perhaps the single most devastating development for Gould : new research on brain size .
Was he asleep throughout the 1990s -- called , with good reason , `` The Decade of the Brain ' ' ?
Gould originally charged nineteenth - century scientists with ``juggling '' and ``finagling '' brain - size data in order to place Northern Europeans at the apex of civilization .
Implausibly , he argued that Paul Broca , Francis Galton , and Samuel George Morton , all ``finagled '' in the same direction and by similar magnitudes using different methods .
Gould asks us to believe that Broca ``leaned '' on his autopsy scales when measuring wet brains by just enough to produce the same differences that Morton caused by ``over - packing '' empty skulls and that Galton caused with his ``extra loose '' grip on calipers while measuring heads !
Yet even before Mismeasure 's first edition , new research was confirming the work of nineteenth - century pioneers .
Gould neglected to mention that Leigh Van Valen had already established a positive correlation between brain size and intelligence in 1974 .
Subsequently , of course , discoveries using Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , which creates a three - dimensional image of the living brain , have shown a strong positive correlation ( 0.44 ) between brain size and intelligence .
And there is more .
The National Collaborative Perinatal Study , as reported by Sarah Broman and her colleagues , showed that head perimeter measured at birth significantly predicts head perim - eter at 7 years -- and head perimeter at both ages predicts IQ .
Recent studies also show that head size and IQ vary with social class .
It is now clear that the nineteenth - century pioneers were right .
The first of the MRI studies were published in the late 1980s / early 1990s in leading , mainstream refereed journals like Intelligence and the American Journal of Psychiatry .
My colleagues and I routinely sent Gould copies and asked him what he thought .
He never replied .
Now he has chosen to withhold all these data from his readers .
Indeed , in the 1996 edition he deletes the very section of his own 1981 book that discussed the brain - size / IQ relation .
In 1981 , he had pooh - poohed Arthur Jensen 's report ( in Bias in Mental Testing ) of a 0.30 correlation between brain - size and IQ -- but he omits this dismissal , without explanation , from the revised version .
I can only infer that when Gould read Jensen 's review of his book ( which he mentions ) , he realized that Jensen 's correlation was based on Van Valen 's 1974 review and so could no longer be dismissed as ``just Jensen . ''
And , given the weight of the new evidence , simply repeating this section verbatim would have destroyed his entire thesis .
He therefore left it out .
Is it reasonable , however , to expect brain size and cognitive ability to be related ?
Yes .
H. Haug in 1987 found a correlation of 0.479 between the number of cortical neurons and brain size in humans .
Gould dismisses differences in brain size as ``trivial . ''
But a difference of one cubic inch in brain size translates into a very nontrivial millions of cortical neurons and hundreds of millions of synapses -- a significant difference in mental activity and potential .
It is , of course , relationships between brain size / IQ and sex and race which , understandably , arouse the most anxiety .
Some critics have even suggested a social taboo on discussion and research in these fields .
That would run counter to the entire tradition of scientific inquiry .
Be that as it may , it is surely indisputable that if such research is to be conducted , it must be done accurately and scrupulously .
And here Gould fails again .
An absolute difference in brain size between men and women has not been disputed since at least the time of Broca ( 1861 ) .
Gould , however , claims that the sex difference disappears when appropriate statistical corrections are made for body size or age of people sampled .
But when he used multiple regression to remove the simultaneous influence of height and age , he succeeded in reducing the sex difference by only one - third .
He then invoked additional unspecified age and body parameters , claiming that if these could be controlled the entire difference would disappear .
David Ankney in 1992 questioned Gould 's methodology .
He re-examined autopsy data on 1,261 American adults and found that at any given body surface area or height , men 's brains are heavier than women's .
His research -- since confirmed by my own 1992 survey of 6,325 U.S.
Army personnel -- attributes only about 30 per cent of the sex difference in brain size to differences in body size .
Admittedly , the brain - size studies present a paradox .
Women have proportionately smaller brains than men but , apparently , the same intelligence scores .
Ankney suggests that the difference in brain size may relate to those intellectual abilities at which men excel -- namely , spatial and mathematical ability -- which may require more ``brain power '' than do verbal abilities .
Other theories are that men average slightly higher in general intelligence than do women , and finally that these particular differences in brain size have nothing to do with cognitive ability at all , but reflect greater male muscle mass and physical coordination in tasks like throwing and catching .
Similarly , Gould denies that brain weight varies with race .
He repeats verbatim his 1981 claim that Samuel George Morton -- a giant of nineteenth - century American science -- ``unconsciously '' doctored his results on cranial capacity to prove Caucasian racial superiority .
Yet he must know that John S. Michael reported in Current Anthropology in 1988 that he had checked Morton 's work and found very few errors -- and these not in the direction that Gould asserted .
Instead , Michael found errors in Gould 's work .
In my own published work , uncited by Gould , I have shown that brain sizes vary systematically by race -- but not to the benefit of Caucasians .
For what it is worth , Mongoloids average about a cubic inch more than Caucasoids and over three cubic inches more than Negroids .
This result has been corroborated many times since 1980 , and by every available technique .
And these findings are in line with the ( by now ) accepted IQ results : the average IQ scores for ``African , '' ``Latino , '' ``White , '' ``Asian , '' and ``Jewish '' Americans are 85 , 89 , 103 , 106 , and 115 , respectively .
Of course , whether these differences are the result of genetic or environmental influences , and whether ( or to what extent ) they are remediable by purposeful action -- these remain matters of dispute .
GOULD'S faults extend well beyond sins of omission to include sins of commission .
His ``new '' edition repeats the same false accusations about individuals that have been thoroughly refuted since 1981 .
Thus , Gould leaves unmodified his denigration of Sir Francis Galton as ``a dotty Victorian eccentric . ''
This was rightly described by Cambridge statistician A. W. F. Edwards in the London Review of Books ( 1983 ) , as ``a thoroughly tendentious portrait . ''
Edwards pointed out that Gould , in a book full of references to correlation , multiple regression , principal - components analysis , and factor analysis , totally failed to inform his students that this whole statistical methodology was pioneered by Galton -- and to measure human intelligence .
He also repeats his trashing of Sir Cyril Burt , the eminent British educational psychologist , who reported a heritability for IQ of 77 per cent for identical twins reared apart .
After his death in 1971 , Burt was widely accused of fabricating his data .
However , five separate studies of identical twins raised apart have now corroborated his findings .
Two meticulously researched books , by Robert B. Joynson and Ronald Fletcher , have vindicated Burt , describing how he was railroaded by anti-hereditarian zealots .
Gould ignores them .
Gould 's most inflammatory allegation is to blame IQ testers for increasing the toll of the Holocaust .
His thesis is that early IQ testers claimed Jews as a group scored low on their tests .
This finding was then allegedly used to support passage of the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924 , under which Jewish refugees were denied entry in the 1930s .
Gould even claims that Henry H. Goddard in 1917 and Carl C. Brigham in 1923 labeled four - fifths of Jewish immigrants as ``feeble - minded . . . morons .''
In both cases , this has repeatedly been shown to be untrue .
For example , Goddard was testing to see if the standard Binet test identified what were then called ``high - grade defectives ' ' as well among immigrants as it did among native - born Americans .
( It did . )
He explicitly did not assert that 80 per cent of Russians , Jews , or any immigrant group in general were feeble - minded .
Gould repeats his account despite widely disseminated refutations .
Historian of psychology Franz Samelson began setting the record straight in the journal Social Forces as early as 1975 .
Mark Snyderman and the late Richard Herrnstein , writing in The American Psychologist in 1983 , corroborated Samelson 's conclusions and showed that the testing community in general did not view its findings as favoring immigration restriction , and that Congress took virtually no notice of intelligence testing in framing the legislation .
The eminent historian Carl N. Degler , in his 1991 book In Search of Human Nature , took Gould to task for ignoring contradictory information .
He points out , for example , that the high scores of Orientals did not prevent them from being excluded from immigrating -- and that their scores would have embarrassed any attempt to make IQ the basis of immigration policy .
Daniel Seligman debunked Gould 's anti-testing propaganda in his book A Question of Intelligence .
Herrnstein and Charles Murray , in their book , The Bell Curve , also highlighted the issue in a special boxed section .
Gould reviewed The Bell Curve ( twice ! ) .
Yet he ignores all these counter - arguments in his ``revision . ''
Indeed , in his account of The Bell Curve , Gould charges Herrnstein and Murray with ``disingenuousness . ''
He then withholds from readers the fact that their book was principally an empirical analysis of social stratification drawn from the 12 - year National Longitudinal Survey of Youth .
Most high - IQ 17 - year - olds , blacks as well as whites , went on to occupational success in their late twenties and early thirties .
Many of those with low IQs , both black and white , went on to welfare dependency .
Thus IQ tests are predictive .
Gould 's attack on The Bell Curve focuses on its use of the ``general factor of intelligence , '' or g , which psychometricians hypothesize underlies tests of mental ability .
Gould likes to leave his readers chanting the mantra , ``g is nothing more than an artifact of the mathematical procedure used to calculate it . ''
But every major study shows that different IQ tests tend to be significantly intercorrelated , suggesting an underlying commonality .
Thus Nathan Brody , Arthur Jensen , and John Carroll have all provided detailed empirical and analytical demonstrations of the reality of g ( including , incidentally , a strong correlation with brain size ) .
Gould ignores them all .
Gould employs another technical trick as well as attacking g : he continues to argue that findings about IQ differences within groups cannot be applied to differences between groups .
( Curiously , he does not object when environmentalists use nutrition as an explanation of both within - group and between - group differences . )
Research has found that racial differences are more pronounced on subtests that are highly heritable than on less heritable tests .
This clearly supports the genetic hypothesis .
Gould ignores it .
And most transracial adoption studies provide evidence for the heritability of racial differences in IQ .
For instance , Korean and Vietnamese children adopted into white American and white Belgian homes were examined by E. A. Clark and J. Hanisee , by M. Frydman and R. Lynn , and by M. Winck et al .
Many had been hospitalized for malnutrition .
But they went on to develop IQs ten or more points higher than their adoptive national norms .
Gould does refer to adoption studies -- but only to a German finding of ``no difference '' between pre-puberty mixed - race children fathered by black soldiers and those fathered by white soldiers .
He also mentions a similar result in Minnesota which seems to refer to an early report of the famous Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study .
That study has subsequently found , however , that marked black / white differences emerged by age 17 .
( Environmental influences typically wash out by adolescence . )
FINALLY , Gould continues to ridicule the ``ape in some of us '' hypothesis proposed by Cesare Lombroso ( 1836 - 1909 ) , the founder of criminology .
Lombroso argued that many criminals were throwbacks to man 's ancestral past , and that ``natural - born criminals ' ' could be identified by anatomical signs of primitiveness .
( Contrary to Gould , however , Lombroso also believed that criminal behavior could arise in ``normal '' men . )
The reader of Mismeasure will search in vain , however , for even a dismissive reference to recent evidence that criminal behavior does indeed have a biological basis .
Adrian Raine has reviewed several studies using MRI , Computerized Tomography , and Positron Emission Tomography to inspect the brains of violent and sexual offenders .
He tentatively concluded that frontal - lobe dysfunction was associated with violent behavior , including rape .
Further , it has been long established that criminals tend to have lower IQs than non-criminals .
So , given the relation between brain size and IQ , Lombroso 's finding of a smaller brain in criminals is probably correct .
Nor does Gould feel compelled to let his readers know that Lombroso 's ideas have now received considerable support from behavioral genetics .
Studies reported by Raine , David Rowe , and myself show that criminality is substantially more likely to be shared by identical twins than by fraternal twins .
This clearly suggests a genetic factor , since both sets of twins share environments , but only identical twins have identical genes .
Similarly , American , Danish , and Swedish studies of children adopted in infancy show that adopted children were more likely to be criminals if their biological parents -- rather than their adoptive parents -- were also criminals .
Even Lombroso's theory of bodily markers is not as far out as Gould would have you believe .
It is now understood that drugs in pregnancy or other ``insults '' to the fetus may disturb its brain development and simultaneously produce a minor physical anomaly ( MPA ) .
For example , fetal ears start low on the neck and gradually drift upward .
An insult to development can stop this and result in low - set ears -- an observable MPA .
Thus , the number of MPAs is a rough index of ( perhaps hidden ) central - nervous - system anomalies .
For children raised in unstable families , Raine found that the number of MPAs at age 12 was related to violent behaviors at age 21 .
More generally , Raine even found that antisocial children often had more facial deformities , as judged by expert plastic surgeons .
In suppressing the hypothesis that genetics matter in crime by sneering at the long - dead Lombroso and ignoring the latest research , Gould is actively obstructing scientists from finding ways to spare both future victims and delinquents -- who , in their own fashion , are also victims .
It is thus Gould who is -- in Lombroso 's words -- the delinquent man .
Gould tells us that he originally considered titling his book Great Is Our Sin , from Charles Darwin 's remark : `` If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature , but by our institutions , great is our sin . ''
He avers that the scientific study of human differences in mental ability is nothing but an apology for elitist European enslavement and oppression of the rest of the world .
This has become the apostle 's creed of the adversary culture .
However , even the most deeply held views cannot justify withholding evidence , engaging in character assassination , and repeating unfounded charges despite refutations .
`` May I end up next to Judas Iscariot , Brutus , and Cassius in the devil 's mouth at the center of hell if I ever fail to present my most honest assessment and best judgment of evidence for empirical truth , '' swears Gould on page 39 of his new introduction .
By his own standard , Gould has consigned himself to the innermost circle of hell .
But science , fortunately , is neither religion nor politics .
Gould can save himself by owning up to the facts and ending his career of relentless special pleading .

Amazing news folks , Gaming Dead recently had the opportunity to pull away Chris Park–head honcho of Arcen Games –from his work long enough to pick his brain on a few topics .
Even better , he was kind enough to provide plenty to snack on , including new info on his ever evolving space strategy game AI War : Fleet Command , its upcoming expansion The Zenith Remnant , and a pair of new games the developer is working on for 2010 .
For those who do n’t know , Park has created an indie RTS game that brings many times the amount of content than that of several retail titles combined .
The game has been given a free monthly DLC update since it launched earlier this year , and the dev has no plans to stop that pattern anytime soon .
The philosophy Park brings to game development is a fresh one , and one I ’d love to see more in his line of work adopt .
Read about it and a bunch more in the monster interview after the break .
Gaming Dead :
We ’re joined by Chris Park , CEO of Arcen Games , developer of the constantly evolving mass - scale space RTS title AI War : Fleet Command .
The eight player co-op title has been provided with fantastic post - release support , receiving standard updates based significantly on community feedback since its release earlier this year .
Chris , thanks for taking some time out of your busy schedule to chat .
Chris Park :
My pleasure !
Thanks for having me .
GD : We certainly welcome your kind !
Your title AI War ’s full release came all the way back in May , but just this past month its seen a Steam release , reached v2.0 and had a full fledged expansion announced .
We ’ll get to the expansion more extensively in a bit , but first we ’d love to hear a short address on the state of the game .
Park :
As always seems to be the case with AI War , there is a ton going on at the moment .
The expansion is in the full swing of development at the moment , but there ’s also a large amount of DLC content that will hit sometime in December .
Normally our plan is to have monthly free DLC , but in this case some of the changes ( mainly the new unified command queue , but also the new , more efficient autoattack simulation logic ) simply need more time in the prerelease testing cycle .
So instead of having a November free DLC release , we ’re having a December free DLC release that is twice as large .
Even for those players who are n’t interested in purchasing the expansion , there ’s a lot of great stuff in the works — from a number of new mechanics , to an online game - finding service , to a number of smaller new units .
After the expansion is released in January we ’ll be moving on to other projects for the bulk of 2010 , but a second expansion is planned for late 2010 and we ’ll be doing monthly free DLC during that entire period with balance updates , bugfixes , AI tweaks , and a new unit or similar in every one .
At present our plan for AI War is to never do a sequel , but instead to keep building it through monthly free DLC and yearly - ish paid expansions for another 2 - 5 years or however long there is player interest .
We ’re quite pleased that AI War is still seeing excellent growth in its playerbase , with over 15 % growth in November , so hopefully that means we ’ll continue growing the game for a long , long time .
My view is that , in the strategy genre , expansions are preferable for players because they are additive with existing content .
And of course everyone loves free DLC !
GD : Absolutely no argument there .
The observation has been made before that developers who support titles after release have a better chance of seeing significant sales further down the road than those games that see the end of development at launch .
As someone who has first hand knowledge on the subject , do you feel this is valid and has it played a part with AI War ’s cycle ?
Park :
Well , for indies who are just starting out , I can say that it is true that strong post - release support is almost definitely critical .
For the big publishers , I ’d like to believe the same thing holds for them as well , but I do n’t have the data to make any meaningful conclusions on that .
I mean , I have a strong hunch they would see a good return from that sort of practice , and it ’s certainly better for longer - term player communities in general , but the entire model of the AAA retail game is fundamentally different from the indie market .
They rely heavily on advance PR and marketing , and then see a huge number of sales in their first few months followed by a steady drop over time .
A few indie titles see a lot of advance PR and marketing , but most of them seem to start out small and then see a steady build .
In that sort of model , the best way to keep players engaged and excited and talking about the game is to keep adding little things to it , making little improvements that sweeten / ease the experience in general .
It ’s the same sort of thing that MMOs have to do , in their case because they are dependent on keeping players subscribed and sending in monthly fees , but in our case to keep the good buzz about our game and keep expanding the playerbase through word of mouth .
I certainly prefer the indie model to the “ finish it and largely forget it ” model of many AAA titles , but at the same time I do n’t think there is any one right way to make games .
For certain styles of game there certainly are best practices , though — for strategy games or MMOs , ongoing updates are required in order to keep those balanced properly and the players interested .
For RPGs like Square - Enix puts out , those tell a finite story and so unless some bugs slip through or some other problem is discovered , I do n’t see any reason to have much in the way of post - release support for those .
I strongly believe that developers should take responsibility for their products and fix whatever is wrong with them , but I ’m not sure that every game needs the sort of post - release content that AI War has seen .
A lot of the upcoming Arcen titles are not strategy games , and so I imagine they will have very different development - to - post - release arcs , as appropriate for their design and genre .
For those not too familiar with AI War , let me just be clear about the scale we ’re talking about here : our post - release release notes so far are over 40,000 words in length between 1.0 and 2.0 .
We revamped the art completely , we improved performance so much that we lowered the minimum system requirements by 33 % , we introduced a dozen or more major new mechanics based on player suggestions , and we added more than 50 new units to the game in a six month period .
This is the sort of post - release support I ’m referring to above , and I do n’t think it is universally needed although it is great for certain types of games .
It ’s been the foundation of a lot of AI War ’s success , but I think that effect has been amplified by the genre .
I do feel that community involvement is very important in any case , and to that end we are going to be having demos of our beta versions , as well as full access to our betas for players who preorder , with our upcoming products .
That way instead of focusing on all that improvement based on player feedback after release , we can wrap that right into our development cycle .
The goal is to get better games out at initial release , rather than having to develop it in isolation with a few teasers for players , then release and see what they think .
By the time we release any product , I want to already have detailed knowledge about what players think and like , and to have tuned the experience heavily so that it is as fun and as optimized as possible .
For me personally , I ’d feel absolutely blind trying to release a future product that was n’t thoroughly vetted by players before release .
GD : Let ’s talk about The Zenith Remnant , the recently announced expansion for AI War coming in January .
How was the add - on conceived and what made you decide that what you had was an expansion versus just a standard content update ?
Park : I knew from the start that I wanted to make AI War larger than just the base game , even though that was already huge .
I like big strategy games , what can I say ?
Empire Earth was absolutely massive for its time , but I absolutely loved the expansion for that as well .
I would have bought more expansions if they had made them .
Same for Supreme Commander and the Age of Empires series , I love them and all of their expansions , also .
No matter how huge an RTS / 4X game is , at some point eventually you are going to come to the end of its life with any given group of players if it does n’t get updated in some way .
With the best strategy games , and so far AI War as well , hardcore players can get hundreds and hundreds of hours out of each title , but there ’s still a limit out there somewhere if the game does n’t grow with the players .
Generally my complaint about expansions with strategy games is that they feel a bit smaller than I would like , just adding maybe one or two significant mechanics and otherwise just a large amount of ancillary or slightly - different content .
The Zenith Remnant is focused on adding an absolutely massive amount of new content , to address that pet peeve of mine .
With the free DLC , we give new ships here and there , but they are typically support ships or something specialized ( like the mercenaries , warheads , and a few starship lines ) .
They are n’t the core ship classes that make up the bulk of most fleets , in other words .
Those are reserved for expansions only , along with new map styles ( 2 billion individual maps per style ) , and new AI personalities .
AI War expansions are always going to be about about taking the game in a bit of a new direction .
The new Golems and all the new capturable ships and superweapons that are in the expansion really change the feel of the game , adding more options and excitement to the grand strategy side of it .
There are a lot more hard choices about which planets to take , because more planets have stuff on them that you might like to have .
The addition of the new NPC faction , the Zenith aliens , should also really shake things up to a heavy degree .
By contrast , free DLC is more about augmenting and refining the base game experience , even if it does introduce major new mechanics every few months .
It ’s in general not about huge scope and focus shifts .
A lot of expansions to other games do what we do in our free DLC , so I can very much see why you ’d ask the question .
By comparison , I guess our expansions do what a lot of sequels do , except that our expansions are additive in their content instead of mutually - exclusive separate products .
GD : With all the recent announcements and expansion work , I imagine it ’s been pretty busy at the office .
Are you balancing everything out and still putting the time into supporting the core game ?
Or is that on hold at 2.0 for now with all the expansion work to be done ?
Park : Absolutely , it has been a really busy time .
The players of the base game have nothing to fear , though , there are a ton of free updates currently in public beta , which will have an official release as free DLC in December .
Part of our secret as to how we can accomplish that much with one programmer is that we use a “ unified binary ” system , which means that there is only one current version of the game code for all the expansions and the base game itself .
By contrast , many other developers have a separate copy of the code for the expansions , so that means that many of the changes for the expansion are not retroactive with the base game — the more expansions you have , the more the project forks , and that can lead to a number of unpleasant situations for players .
For my own part , I never want to force players to buy more content in order to get fixes or improvements to the base game , and the unified binary approach addresses that .
All of the bugfixes , internal improvements and performance tweaks , plus any interface tweaks and other similar player - requested changes , are going into both the base game and the expansion simultanously because it ’s all one codebase .
When reviewers start looking at the expansion in January , I ’m sure they will also notice all the various improvements aside from all the new content — but what they might not realize is that while a lot of that was developed concurrently with the expansion - only features , those non-content - related improvements are also available for free to existing customers of the base game .
It ’s an unusual model , to be sure , but it ’s one that I hope other developers will pick up as it is both easier to code and friendlier to players .
Players should only need to buy expansions if they want more content , not if they want to fix or improve the content they already have , ideally .
GD : What ’s the future look like for Arcen and AI War ?
Any new Arcen Games titles you ’d care to mention ?
Park : AI War : The Zenith Remnant will release in January , and then for AI War it will just be the monthly free DLC until later in 2010 , when we ’ll see another expansion .
Expect that cycle to continue for at least 2 - 5 years , or as long as there is player interest — AI War already has more scope than a great many strategy games , but I ’m interested in seeing it becoming the largest one around by several orders of magnitude over the years .
We ’ll see what happens as our playerbase continues to grow !
We also have more digital distribution partners who will be making AI War available to new audiences , as well as a number of regional retail deals in various stages of finalization ; hopefully this will be an evolving and expanding project for a long time to come .
Our next game after The Zenith Remnant is a casual puzzle game that is currently untitled .
That will be out sometime in Q2 of next year , and is basically a fresh new mechanic ( not another match 3 clone ) that is shaping up to be really fun and addictive , with a beautiful painterly art style that we ’ll be previewing later in December .
After the puzzle game will come A Valley Without Wind , a tower - defense - style game that is a unique new take on that fairly overcrowded genre .
My goal as a game developer is to bring a fresh cross - genre spin to a lot of various existing genres , and so we ’re hopping all over the place with our projects .
I enjoy games in a lot of genres , but all my life I ’ve found myself thinking “ this would be so much better if only . ”
So now I ’m going back through all those genres and making the games I always wanted ; AI War is the first example of that , and hopefully people will enjoy our future titles to the same degree .
GD : It sounds like an all around really great approach to making games .
We look forward to what Arcen Games will offer in the future .
Care to add anything else ?

Interview by Erik Johnson
On December 7 , 1941 — which President Franklin D. Roosevelt would memorably name
“ a date which will live in infamy ”
on the following day — hundreds of Japanese warplanes made a deadly surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii .
When the crew of the heavy cruiser USS New Orleans rushed on deck they saw devastation all around them .
Not far away , a huge cloud of smoke was rising from the battleship USS Arizona and it was sinking .
Beyond the Arizona , the USS Oklahoma was rolling over .
Sailors were jumping from its sides .
Another nearby battleship , the USS West Virginia , was badly damaged and sagging amidships .
The New Orleans was docked for repairs when the attack occurred .
As usual during repairs , the ship ’s electricity was temporarily coming through a power cable from the shore .
Soon after they came on deck , the crew began firing the cruiser ’s guns at Japanese planes .
But when they needed more ammunition they discovered that the power cable to shore had been cut , making the electric ammunition hoist inoperable .
Undeterred , the men formed lines and began carrying the heavy shells to the guns by hand .
As they did , ship chaplain Lieutenant Howell M. Forgy walked along the deck encouraging them , shouting “ Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition ! ”
The Japanese pilots eventually flew away after sinking nine U.S. ships and damaging 21 others .
Their attack killed 2,350 Americans , including 1,177 sailors on the USS Arizona .
The next day , America officially entered World War II .
In the months that followed , word spread about the memorable line shouted by a chaplain during the Pearl Harbor attack .
In some stories about the quote , the chaplain was unnamed .
In others , including a widely - read article in the
November 2 , 1942 issue of LIFE magazine
, he was identified as
Captain W.A. Maguire
— a senior Navy chaplain who outranked Forgy and was on a dock in Pearl Harbor that day .
Stories about the incident inspired American songwriter Frank Loesser to write a patriotic song that used “ Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition ! ” as the title and chorus .
Loesser ’s song was published in 1942 , recorded by several artists and quickly became popular .
The version by Kay Kyser and his band reached # 1 on the pop singles chart in January 1943 .
The LIFE article and the popularity of the song led the crew of the USS New Orleans to urge Chaplain Forgy to come forward and set the record straight about the fact that it was he — not Maguire — who said the now famous words .
At first , Forgy demurred , but eventually his shipmates persuaded him .
The officers of the USS New Orleans arranged a meeting with the press and the real story of this famous World War II quotation was finally revealed .
Chaplain Forgy made it through the war , returned to a civilian ministry and died in Glendora , California , in January 1972 .
His famous quote lives on .
In case you ’ve never seen them , here are the lyrics of the song Forgy ’s quote inspired , which opens with the chorus :
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
And we 'll all stay free
Praise the Lord and swing into position
Ca n't afford to be a politician
Praise the Lord , we 're all between perdition
And the deep blue sea
Yes , the sky pilot said it , you gotta give him credit
For a son of a gun of a gunner was he
Shouting , ' Praise the Lord , we 're on a mighty mission
All aboard , we ain't a - goin ' fishin '
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
And we 'll all stay free '
[ CHORUS REPEATS ]

The absurd procedural chokepoints in the US Senate are what is really killing climate legislation .
From Grist , part of the Guardian Environment Network
A couple weeks ago I wrote a piece on what 's really killing climate legislation : the absurd procedural chokepoints in the U.S. Senate , coupled with an unprincipled minority devoted to obstruction .
I 'm happy to report there 's been an uptick lately in people trying to draw attention to this problem .
From the last week or two :
Here 's one thing to add to the discussion .
The Copenhagen climate talks are coming up .
The Obama administration has been scrupulously careful not to promise anything in international negotiations that it can't deliver — i.e. , that it can't get past the U.S. Senate .
Senate ratification of an international treaty requires not just 60 but 67 votes .
Say 34 senators rally to block such a treaty — senators from , oh , Wyoming , Vermont , North Dakota , Alaska , South Dakota , Delaware , Montana , Rhode Island , Hawaii , New Hampshire , Maine , Idaho , Nebraska , West Virginia , New Mexico , Nevada , and Utah .
Thus can representatives for 22,540,352 people — 7.4 % of the population — block the will of the other 281,519,372 .
Indeed , senators representing 7.4 % of Americans can thwart the entire world 's efforts to address the climate crisis .
Killing a treaty is easier than killing a clean energy bill .
Why , killing a clean energy bill requires representatives for 25,289,049 people — fully 8.3 % of the population !— to thwart the will of the remaining 278,770,675 .
( If you 're keeping score , the guilty parties here would be : Wyoming , Vermont , North Dakota , Alaska , South Dakota , Delaware , Montana , Rhode Island , Hawaii , New Hampshire , Maine , Idaho , Nebraska , West Virginia , New Mexico , Nevada , Utah , Kansas , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Iowa . )
For the record , 15 of those 21 states ( 71 % ) voted for Bush in 2004 .
Now of course it wo n't be these precise coalitions of senators that kill the COP15 treaty and the clean energy bill .
They 'll snag high - population senators like Cornyn and Hutchison from Texas .
But the point remains : the Senate , already unrepresentative thanks to the disproportionate influence of rural , low - population states , has become , thanks to the routine use of filibusters and holds , grotesquely undemocratic .
The country just can't be governed this way .
And consequently , the world community cannot coordinate to effectively meet the climate threat .

The bishop of Limerick Dr Dónal Murray is in Rome today to discuss his future and it is expected he will offer his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI over the coming days .
With tomorrow a public holiday in Italy it now appears more likely that he will resign on Wednesday .
In a brief statement today Pope Benedict XVI said he has invited Cardinal Sean Brady and Diarmuid Martin , Archbishop of Dublin , to a meeting on Friday to provide “ information and an evaluation ” following the publication of the Murphy report .
The men are also due to have a meeting with the Vatican ’s Congregation of Bishops , which oversees the appointment or resignation of bishops .
Calls have been made for Bishop Murray ’s resignation since the publication of the Dublin diocesan report which criticised his handling of complaints against clergymen who were later found to have been involved in the sexual abuse of children .
The pressure increased on Bishop Murray on Saturday when Catholic primate Cardinal Seán Brady said he was confident Bishop Murray “ would do the right thing ” .
He went on to say that he would resign himself if a child had been abused as a result of a failure on his part .
“ I would remember that child sex abuse is a very serious crime and very grave and if I found myself in a situation where I was aware that my failure to act had allowed or meant that other children were abused , well then , I think I would resign , ” he told RTÉ .
On RTÉ’s The Week in Politicslast night , Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin expressed his “ deep disappointment ” at the lack of a response by Pope Benedict to the Dublin diocesan report .
“ The pope has not responded yet to the appalling revelations of the Murphy inquiry . ”
The papal nuncio , Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza , has been asked to visit the department this week to explain why there had been no response from the nunciature to correspondence from the commission
“ I think we will be pointing out that we need such a substantive response , ” Mr Martin added , “ and it is the view of the Irish Government that there has to be co-operation . . . not just with the investigation into Dublin but also the Cloyne diocese , ” which is ongoing .
Unexpectedly Intriguing !
We could n't help notice an unusual coincidence yesterday .
First , the Economic Freedom of the World 2009 Annual Report has just been released by the Fraser Institute ( HT : DoL ) , which is itself a pretty momentous event .
Then we found that Will Franklin has tapped the Fraser Institute 's 2008 Economic Freedom of North America to create a chart that ranks individual U.S. states and Canadian provinces according to their relative levels of economic freedom .
We thought we'd mark the occasion by taking the figures we already had for each U.S. state and Canadian province 's GDP per Capita adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity for 2004 and correlate that data with their respective Economic Freedom Index score from 2008 .
The chart below reveals what we found :
It would appear that there 's a pretty strong correlation between how much economic output a state or province generates per person and the level of economic freedom that exists in each .
Will Franklin comments on the Economic Freedom Index and the general correlation he observes between it and how a state or province performs economically :
The index is based on 10 components in three categories : 1 ) Size of Government ;
2 ) Takings and Discriminatory Taxation ; and
3 ) Labour Market Freedom .
Interesting is how many of the most free states and provinces in the study are performing better economically than the states and provinces in the bottom half of the study .
Indeed .

Bozell Defends Networks ' Silence on ClimateGate :
" Maybe They Just Don't Know "
" Ignorance is no excuse under the law , but maybe we should stop criticizing and start showing compassion for NBC , ABC and CBS and their neglect of the huge ClimateGate story .
We are more than happy to help rectify their knowledge deficit - via a network - friendly source and in an as environmentally - friendly a way as possible .
" We think that once the networks read the story of ClimateGate in their vaunted New York Times , they 'll feel compelled to report it themselves .
" We very much look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor . "
For the fourteenth straight day , the three broadcast networks have failed to report on the great and growing ClimateGate scandal on their weekday morning or evening news programs .
How to explain this ?
Perhaps it is that ABC , NBC and CBS have not yet heard of the story , despite two weeks of non-stop reporting on and discussion of ClimateGate in a whole host of media outlets .
Perhaps the broadcast networks only trust their fellow liberal press outlets , like the .
Perhaps they do n't realize theexhibited journalistic diligence on ClimateGate , with a front page story the day the story broke .
In the event that ABC News , NBC News and CBS News missed the news , the Media Research Center ( MRC ) is today rushing each of them a copy of thestory , in the hopes that armed with this new information , they will finally report a story that has been roiling nearly everywhere else for a fortnight .
So as not to offend the networks ' pro-global warming sensibilities , MRC President Brent Bozell is looking to have the stories delivered by bicycle messenger .
Bozell : , Dec 5 : Friday evening , NBC Nightly News finally mentions ClimateGate , but frets it could " delay taking action . "
ABC and CBS remain silent .

Huq takes part in the polio immunisation drive in India Uttar Pradesh in northern India has a population of more than 190 million and the world 's highest concentration of polio infection .
This is one of the final frontiers where the war against polio is being fought .
This crippling disease is now endemic in just four countries - India , Pakistan , Afghanistan and Nigeria .
In 1985 Rotary International spearheaded the campaign to eradicate polio and pledged to make sure all the world 's children would be immunised against the disease .
This has meant cases have been cut by a staggering 99 % since then .
But there is still 1 % to go and so a huge army of volunteers have been mobilised to help and take part in the final push to rid the world of Polio .
I joined 86 British Rotarians on a trip to India to see Rotary 's Thanks for Life / End Polio Now campaign in action as more than 65 million children in two northern Indian states under the age of five were to be targeted for immunisation against polio in just two days .
' Still endemic '
The campaign was to be focused in Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) and Bihar - the only two states left in India where the disease is still endemic .
Two million children in the Indian capital , Delhi , were also to be immunised , a process which has to be repeated every few weeks to ensure infallibility .
One problem with polio is that , although crippling and debilitating , the disease is not life threatening
I started my two day polio immunisation drive in the capital of Uttar Pradesh , Lucknow , at a particularly significant place - the Islamic Centre .
Until recently , 70 % of the cases of polio were found to be affecting this minority community in UP because of unsubstantiated fears that the drops were part of a Western plot to make Muslims infertile in an attempt to control the Islamic population .
One rumour even says that this conspiracy theory was started because the medical supplies boxes had been covered in the word STERILE !
Rotarian Ajay Saxena , member of Rotary International 's India National Polio Plus Committee , was instrumental in getting Muslim leaders together and as a result , the immunisation campaign has been backed by the clerics and the rates of polio among the Muslim community have dropped to 30 % .

While sitting down for a cup of tea at the Islamic Centre , with Maulana Khalid Rasheed , general secretary of the Islamic Centre of India , he told me : " The thing is that about five years ago there were a number of misconceptions prevailing in the Muslim community that the polio vaccination was a conspiracy of the foreign powers to make the Muslims infertile or impotent so that the numbers of Muslims in India could not be increased .
" We have been able to tell the Muslim community that the polio immunisation has nothing to do with any type of conspiracy .
It is only to bring an end to polio in India .
" And that there is no such thing as a conspiracy as far as this vaccination is concerned and we have been successful in removing that misconception . "
Administering vaccine
Soon the time came for me to administer the drops to children myself .
A potentially life - saving experience - just two drops can help stop a child being crippled by polio .
Some 2,700 booths had been situated in and around the streets of Lucknow giving out the vaccine .
The British Rotarians also played their full part in administering drops and helping to get parents out to the booths with their young ones .
The immunisation drive targeted two northern Indian states
At one polio booth I met Saleem - a 17 - year - old polio sufferer - not lucky enough to receive the polio drops when he was a child .
Saleem is now an orphan as his parents died six months ago .
He is also homeless , living on the streets , existing hand to mouth .
He believes strongly that the immunisation drops are important .
One problem with polio is that , although crippling and debilitating , the disease is not life threatening .
This means that hospitals see it as a low priority and more often than not will not treat it .
Saleem was told when he was younger that he would be treatable and able to walk again , but because of the lack of care on offer , he cannot walk and relies on a pair of old crutches he managed to obtain through a charity .
Disability burden
In a country like India , a disability means that you cannot work to earn money and so have to rely on handouts and begging .
Moreover poor families often can't cope with the financial and physical burden of a crippled child so are sometimes forced to abandon them .
Since Rotary pledged in 1985 to immunise all the world 's children against polio , it has been working with the World Health Organization , United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to do just that .
Thanks to the work of Rotary more than two billion children have been immunised against polio worldwide .
As long as one case of polio remains in the world - no child is safe from this deadly disease
In India , the government has pledged a further $ 657 m to immunise the country 's children against polio over the next three years .
Joining in the campaign now is Microsoft Founder Bill Gates who through his charity , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , has donated $ 355 m to Rotary to help in the battle to eradicate polio .
The immunisation campaign means no child is missed and that includes going to the slums .
Polio victims are often from poorer backgrounds as infection occurs through contact with the faeces of a polio sufferer .
Naturally insanitary conditions and poor hygiene are big contributors to the disease .
In Delhi , I accompanied health visitors and Rotarians to immunise children in an unbelievably cramped slum where 1,000 people live in low level shacks making a living sifting through rubbish to find anything that could be recyclable .
The stench and squalor was like nothing I have seen , although I have visited numerous shanty town and slum areas before .
These people are living , eating and sleeping on a rubbish tip , in and among decay , debris and flies .
Flies everywhere .
Last few miles
For the victims of polio there is some hope here though .
Although public hospitals are reluctant to treat the disease and private hospitals make no money from the poor people affected by the disease , progress is being made in Delhi 's oldest hospital , St Stephen 's , where there is a dedicated polio ward .
Head of the department of orthopaedics , Dr Mathew Varghese , said that improvements in water and sanitation , a key factor , meant the number of child polio cases they were seeing was dropping .
But as long as one case of polio remains in the world - no child is safe from this deadly disease .
There were about 500 new cases a day in India more than 20 years ago - now there are only about 500 a year , so the battle is being won .
So how near is a polio free India and a polio free world ?
Deepak Kapur , chairman of Rotary 's India National Polioplus Committee told me : " At the beginning of the programme , there was no place in India that was polio free .
" Now , more than 99 % of the job has been done but there is still a long way to go because the last few miles are the most difficult .
" And I expect since the virus is hiding in these last bastions , it wo n't be long before we actually win .
" Although I am not a soothsayer , I think that in 2011 , we should be able to do it . "

Floating around the Internet these days , posted and e-mailed back and forth , are a number of writings attributed to me , and I want people to know they 're not mine .
Do n't blame me .
Some are essay - length , some are just short lists of one and two - line jokes , but if they 're flyin ' around the Internet , they 're probably not mine .
Occasionally , a couple of jokes on a long list might have come from me , but not often .
And because most of this stuff is really lame , it 's embarrassing to see my name on it .
And that 's the problem .
I want people to know that I take care with my writing , and try to keep my standards high .
But most of this " humor " on the Internet is just plain stupid .
I guess hard - core fans who follow my stuff closely would be able to spot the fake stuff , because the tone of voice is so different .
But a casual fan has no way of knowing , and it bothers me that some people might believe I 'd actually be capable of writing some of this stuff .
It is making me feel a bit nauseated , but I am multitasking .
I am walking and typing ... make that typin and walking and trying to register the ever changong image on my iPhone , a view of rhe syreet in front of me that is provided courtesy of rhe iPhone app called typing and wdlking .
O.K. , enough of that .
The iPhone application I was trying is called Type n Walk ; it ’s supposed to make it easier to text while strolling by providing a visual , on the phone , of what is happening on the street a few feet ahead .
I gave up after 10 minutes .
I need only one reasonably sane looking person to gesticulate at me wildly for me to get the hint : I am a walking urban menace .
I can barely text and chew gum at the same time , much less text , walk , think and watch the street in front of me , even if that street is visible on the same small screen as my text .
To Type n Walk west on 43rd Street felt not so much efficient as wildly incompetent , which is also how I feel typing and texting without the application .
I feel fairly confident it would take less training to make me proficient in laparoscopic surgery than it would to make me feel safe walking and texting on the streets of New York .
Instead of yapping into the air about whatever medical form did n’t get filed or short sale did n’t happen , now people are tapping those same thoughts furiously into their phones , like mass Morse coders , all while moving at speed down the street .
The new model of communication may be more private , but it ’s certainly just as irritating , and surely not as safe ( so far , unlike texting and driving , it remains legal ) .
Mid-text , I looked up to see a businessman crossing 43rd Street on Madison Avenue nearly bump into a taxi that was farther west of the stoplight than it should have been .
Naturally , the pedestrian ’s thumbs were busy on his BlackBerry at the moment .
If you are to believe the glossy food magazines , the American restaurant of the year is Bazaar , an overdecorated Beverly Hills hotel restaurant that blends avant - garde Spanish cooking , gaudy French design and old - fashioned American showmanship into a kind - of Cirque du Soleil of food -- a place where it is nearly impossible to figure out where the dining room ends and the gift shop begins .
Bazaar is a place where olives are liquid and puffs of cotton candy have fattened goose liver at their core ; it is a screaming , postmodern critique of an overheated consumer moment that at the moment seems very far away .
Yes , the economy tanked .
But there have been more high - profile Los Angeles restaurant openings in the last year or so than we saw in the previous five .
There ’s Rivera , featuring the modern Mexican cuisine of John Sedlar ; the opulent Italian restaurant Drago Centro ; the zillion - dollar bistro Bouchon in Beverly Hills ; the mammoth Bottega Louie in the former Brooks Brothers store downtown ; and the dozen - odd restaurants in the L.A.
Live complex , among others .
Tony cocktail bars like Tar Pit , Copa d’Oro , the Roger Room and the Varnish now seem so well - integrated into the fabric of the city that it is hard to remember that none of them existed a year ago .
Culinary trends are fine .
I ’m as ready as the next food writer to proclaim pig ’s trotter the new pork belly , or to predict the ascendance of vadouvan , fingerling potatoes and violet liqueur .
But in 2009 , something truly new was going on that may fundamentally change the way we look at restaurants .

It could be found in a barren parking lot in Rosemead , where 600 people shivered in the cold , glancing at their iPhones and awaiting the arrival of a food truck bearing Korean tacos and kimchi quesadillas .
Kogi , whose chef came to the universe of food trucks after years leading the kitchens at the Beverly Hilton , broadcasts its location on Twitter , causing immense crowds to materialize in otherwise deserted locations , inspiring dozens of knockoff trucks .
It could be found at a recent gathering of four dozen strangers in a loft for the one - time appearance of an underground vegan chef .
And at the Culver City art gallery that became the white - hot center of haute cuisine for a couple of weeks when Ludovic Lefebvre , a protege of three - star French chefs Pierre Gagnaire and Alain Passard , and former chef at Bastide and l ’Orangerie , opened Ludobites as a pop-up restaurant , also publicized on Twitter .
Lefevbre ’s dishes include foie gras beignets , sashimi with sushi-rice ice cream and cod smeared with a complex mole sauce he was taught to make by a food blogger ’s mom .
An Eastside gathering of street vendors , forced from their spot by the complaints of nearby brick - and - mortar businesses , scattered all over Boyle Heights .
But they ’re still findable .
When you check the Twitter feeds , you learn not only what chalupa masters will be where on a Thursday night , but what kind of tamales might be on the menu and whether they are serving their delicious walnut atole .
They ’re not just tacos -- they ’re tacos that tweet .
In the next few years , the scrawny kid hunched over his Android may become as important to the success of a restaurant as the chef .
While nobody was paying attention , food quietly assumed the place in youth culture that used to be occupied by rock ‘ n ’ roll -- individual , fierce and intensely political , communal yet congenial to aesthetic extremes : embracing veganism or learning to butcher a cow ; eating tofu or head cheese , bean sprouts or pigs ’ ears .
I could happily go the rest of my life without hearing about another celebrity potato farmer or rock - star butcher , about 15 - year - old cheddar or 150 - year - old Madeira .
And I am not alone .

The criticism received by President Obama stands in sharp contrast to the lack of complaints towards President Bush eight years ago regarding the ' shoe bomber ' incident .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Obama takes the heat Bush did not
Eight years ago , a terrorist bomber ’s attempt to blow up a transatlantic airliner was thwarted by a group of passengers , an incident that revealed some gaping holes in airline security just a few months after the attacks of Sept. 11 .
But it was six days before President George W. Bush , then on vacation , made any public remarks about the so - called shoe bomber , Richard Reid , and there were virtually no complaints from the press or any opposition Democrats that his response was sluggish or inadequate .
That stands in sharp contrast to the withering criticism President Barack Obama has received from Republicans and some in the press for his reaction to Friday ’s incident on a Northwest Airlines flight heading for Detroit .

Democrats have seized on the disparity and are making it a centerpiece of their efforts to counter GOP attacks on the White House .
“ This hypocrisy demonstrates Republicans are playing politics with issues of national security and terrorism , ” DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan said .
“ That they would use this incident as an opportunity to fan partisan flames … tells you all you need to know about how far the Republican Party has fallen and how out of step with the American people they have become . ”
The Democrats ’ counterattack is aimed largely at two Republican congressmen who have been particularly critical of Obama , Reps. Pete Hoekstra ( R - Mich . ) and Peter King ( R - N.Y . ) .
But neither GOP lawmaker concedes applying a double standard to Obama .
But the similarities between last Friday ’s incident and the attempted shoe bombing in 2001 are striking .
This year ’s attack came on Christmas .
The attempt eight years ago took place on Dec. 22 .
Obama was on vacation in Hawaii when the suspect , Omar Abdulmutallab , allegedly used plastic explosives in his try to blow up the Amsterdam - to - Detroit flight .
Bush was at Camp David when Reid used similar plastic explosives to try to blow up his Paris - to - Miami flight , which diverted to Boston after the incident .
Like the Obama White House , the Bush White House told reporters the president had been briefed on the incident and was following it closely .
While the Obama White House issued a background statement through a senior administration official calling the incident an “ attempted terrorist attack ” on the same day it took place , the early official statements from Bush aides did not make the same explicit statement .
Bush did not address reporters about the Reid episode until December 28 , after he had traveled from Camp David to his ranch in Texas .
Democrats do not appear to have criticized Bush over the delay .
Many were wary of publicly clashing with the commander in chief , who was getting lofty approval ratings after what appeared to be a successful military campaign in Afghanistan .
The media also seemed to have little interest in pressing Bush about the bombing , or the fact that the incident had revealed a previously unknown vulnerability in airplane security — that shoes could be used to hide chemicals or explosive devices .
An Agence France - Presse story was one of the few to call attention to the silence from Bush and other top officials .
“ Four days after Richard Colvin Reid , 28 , tried to set fire to his explosives - laden shoes on a trans -Atlantic flight , neither the White House nor other authorities had spoken officially on the alleged would - be suicide bombing , ” AFP wrote on Dec. 27 , 2001 .
During a wide - ranging 25 - minute press availability with Bush the next day , reporters asked more than 15 questions , including queries about the president ’s New Year ’s Eve plans and a tree he ’d planted .
Bush was never asked about Reid , but mentioned the attempt in passing .
“ The shoe bomber was a case in point , where the country has been on alert , ” Bush said .
“ A stewardess on an American Airlines flight — or a flight attendant on an American Airlines flight — was vigilant , saw something amiss and responded .
It 's an indication that the culture of America has shifted to one of alertness .
And I 'm grateful for the flight attendant 's response , as I 'm sure the passengers on that airplane .
But we 've got to be aware that there are still enemies to the country .
And our government is responding accordingly . ”
While many congressional Republicans and their supporters have been critical of Obama , Hoekstra and King have been the most ubiquitous , becoming regulars on cable TV , providing details about the case at a time the administration was still tight - lipped .
In an appearance Monday on WCBS - TV in New York , King said , “ I 'm disappointed it 's taken the president 72 hours to even address this issue .
Basically nobody , the president , the vice president , the attorney general , nobody except [ Homeland Security ] Secretary [ Janet ] Napolitano has come out .
And she said yesterday everything worked well .
What I hope the president would do is treat this in a bipartisan way , acknowledge that mistakes were made and promise we 'll do all we can to make sure it does n't happen again . "
And speaking Monday on Fox News , Hoekstra took a similar tack , arguing that the slowness of Obama ’s reaction showed terrorism was n’t high on his agenda .
“ On many other instances and occasions the president is out front .
He ’s out front leading very early on a lot of different issues .
When it comes to terrorism to the threat to the homeland , the president has decided to stay silent for 72 hours .
He needs to explain that , ” said the Michigan Republican , who is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee .
“ Why this is not a priority ?
It should be his No. 1 priority . ”
Asked Tuesday about how Obama ’s response differed from Bush ’s , King said it was his “ recollection ” that senior Bush Administration officials such as Attorney General John Ashcroft did speak out about Reid ’s case soon after he was arrested .
However , POLITICO could not locate any public comment from Ashcroft before he held a press conference when Reid was indicted nearly a month later .
“ My point was there was no word coming from anyone except a press handout , ” King told POLITICO Tuesday .
“ It did n’t have to be the president .
I ’d have been fine if it were Eric Holder or for that matter [ Homeland Security Secretary Janet ] Napolitano . …
There should be a face for the administration .
For the first 48 hours , nobody said a word . ”
Asked about a double standard for Bush ’s actions in 2001 , a spokesman for Hoekstra , John Truscott , said Tuesday the congressman was really objecting more to the administration ’s clamp - down on briefings to Congress than about Obama ’s public silence .
“ I do n’t think that ’s an issue , ” Truscott said .
“ One of the things the congressman has been complaining about following the Fort Hood attack and now this one , as ranking member of the intelligence committee , it ’s very difficult for him to get information .
That lack of transparency has an impact on the Hill . ”
While the White House has dramatically ramped up Obama ’s public profile on the bombing , putting him on camera two days in a row to address the issue , officials insist he was neither reluctant nor slow to react .
“ The president has been very engaged on this , has been leading our response effort , asking agencies to take a variety of steps including all the steps he outlined , ” National Security Council chief of staff Denis McDonough told reporters Monday .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was already booked for several Sunday shows , but McDonough said that in light of Friday ’s incident Obama decided to send Napolitano out as well .
“ We thought it made sense for him to handle it this way , ” McDonough said .
“ We do n’t really have a standard operating procedure for when is best to go out . …
He recognizes that it ’s very important that we communicate to the American people what we know and the steps that we ’re taking . ”
An Obama White House spokesman declined to comment Tuesday on the parallels with the 2001 incident .
While King and Hoekstra have repreatedly criticized Obama for his response , former Bush aides and advisers have sidestepped the issue or endorsed Obama ’s approach .
On CNN ’s " Larry King Live " on Monday night , former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge , who was a White House adviser at the time of Reid ’s attempted bombing , brushed aside a question about whether Obama should have waited three days to speak out .
“ I 'm going to leave that to the White House .
I think he had Secretary Napolitano out there speaking , ” Ridge said .
And over the weekend , former Bush pollster Matthew Dowd was asked if Obama was correct when , like Bush , he held off speaking at the outset .
“ Yes , ” Dowd told Jake Tapper Sunday on ABC ’s " This Week . "
“ Part of the problem here is that all the facts that you think are true at the beginning turn out not to be true as the days go on . "
Meanwhile , Sevugan also criticized Hoekstra for sending out a fundraising e-mail that invoked the Christmas Day bombing attempt .
“ Raising money off it is beyond the pale , ” the DNC spokesman said .
Truscott , Hoekstra ’s spokesman , dismissed criticism of his boss ’s terrorism - related fundraising appeal as part of an effort by Democrats to undercut his gubernatorial bid .
“ This is the hottest issue going right now .
Everybody ’s talking about it ’s the lead story in the news all across the country , ” Truscott said .
“ As a leading national expert on this issue , it ’s certainly appropriate to raise this issue as he talks about the leadership he could bring to Michigan . ”
After years of surprising scientists with their cleverness and smarts , some octopuses appear to also use tools .
Veined octopuses observed off the coast of Indonesia carried coconut shell halves under their bodies , and assembled them as necessary into shelters — something that was n't supposed to be possible in their corner of the animal kingdom .
" To date , invertebrates have generally been regarded as lacking the cognitive abilities to engage in such sophisticated behaviors , " wrote Museum Victoria biologists who described the octopuses in a paper published Monday in Current Biology .
" The discovery of this octopus tiptoeing across the sea ﬂoor with its prized coconut shells suggests that even marine invertebrates engage in behaviors that we once thought the preserve of humans . "
In captivity , some species of octopuses have solved mazes , remembered cues and passed other cognitive tests typically associated with advanced vertebrates .
More anecdotally , they 're known for popping aquarium hoods , raiding other tanks and demonstrating what might be called mischief .
All this has come as a bit of a surprise to scientists .
After all , octopuses are descended from mollusks .
They 're more closely related to clams than to people .
They 're not supposed to be smart .
But it 's hard to argue with the evidence , and in recent years , researchers have grappled with the possibility that octopuses can even use tools .
That debate has focused on octopuses seen barricading their den openings with stones .
In the end , that behavior was n't accepted as genuine tool use , because it seemed more instinctive than calculated .
( Another contested invertebrate behavior is the use of shells as homes by hermit crabs .
According to the conventional wisdom , tools require direct manipulation , so the shells are no more tools than are human houses . )
Such definitions are inevitably ambiguous .
But there 's no ambiguity in the veined octopuses found flushing mud from buried coconut shells , stacking them for transport — an awkward process that required the octopuses to walk on tiptoe with the upturned shells clutched beneath them — and finally turning them into hard - shelled tents .
" The fact that the shell is carried for future use rather than as part of a speciﬁc task differentiates this behavior from other examples of object manipulation by octopuses , " wrote the researchers .
With their tents , the veined octopus has joined chimpanzees , monkeys , dolphins and crows in the ever - expanding menagerie of non-human tool users .
But as significant as the finding may be , the moment of discovery was n't exactly solemn .
“ I could tell that the octopus , busy manipulating coconut shells , was up to something , but I never expected it would pick up the stacked shells and run away .
It was an extremely comical sight , " said Julia Finn , a Museum Victoria biologist , in a press release .
" I have never laughed so hard underwater . ”

I was dismayed when I heard Barack Obama was given the Nobel peace prize .
A shock , really , to think that a president carrying on two wars would be given a peace prize .
Until I recalled that Woodrow Wilson , Theodore Roosevelt , and Henry Kissinger had all received Nobel peace prizes .
The Nobel committee is famous for its superficial estimates , won over by rhetoric and by empty gestures , and ignoring blatant violations of world peace .
Yes , Wilson gets credit for the League of Nations – that ineffectual body which did nothing to prevent war .
But he had bombarded the Mexican coast , sent troops to occupy Haiti and the Dominican Republic and brought the US into the slaughterhouse of Europe in the first World War , surely among stupid and deadly wars at the top of the list .
Sure , Theodore Roosevelt brokered a peace between Japan and Russia .
But he was a lover of war , who participated in the US conquest of Cuba , pretending to liberate it from Spain while fastening US chains on that tiny island .
And as president he presided over the bloody war to subjugate the Filipinos , even congratulating a US general who had just massacred 600 helpless villagers in the Phillipines .
The Committee did not give the Nobel prize to Mark Twain , who denounced Roosevelt and criticised the war , nor to William James , leader of the anti-imperialist league .
Oh yes , the committee saw fit to give a peace prize to Henry Kissinger , because he signed the final peace agreement ending the war in Vietnam , of which he had been one of the architects .
Kissinger , who obsequiously went along with Nixon 's expansion of the war , with the bombing of peasant villages in Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia .
Kissinger , who matches the definition of a war criminal very accurately , is given a peace prize !
People should be given a peace prize not on the basis of promises they have made – as with Obama , an eloquent maker of promises – but on the basis of actual accomplishments towards ending war , and Obama has continued deadly , inhuman military action in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The Nobel peace committee should retire , and turn over its huge funds to some international peace organization which is not awed by stardom and rhetoric , and which has some understanding of history .
Remember the scene in Spiderman 3 when Eddie Brock ( played by Topher Grace ) goes to church and prays that God will kill Peter Parker ?
That probably got a laugh out of most viewers because , well , how over - the - top preposterous is it to pray to God to kill someone you do n’t like ?
Jesus us a god of love , is n’t He ?
But hey , it ’s Hollywood , it ’s a superhero action flick , and villains in these films have to be , you know , a little over - the - top , right ?
Still , if that whole scene set your plausibility alarms to ringing , you might want to brace yourself for this one .
Think Progress makes a great catch on C - SPAN this morning : Someone calls in while Sen. John Barrasso ( R - WY ) is answering the lines , practically in tears because Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R - OK ) missed this morning ’s procedural vote on health care .
He was apparently concerned that — after following Sen .
Tom Coburn ’s ( R - OK ) instructions to pray that someone could n’t make a manager ’s amendment vote Sunday night — his prayers for Sen.
Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) to die struck the wrong senator .
“ Our small tea bag group here in Waycross , we got our vigil together and took Dr. Coburn ’s instructions and prayed real hard that Sen .
Byrd would either die or could n’t show up at the vote the other night , ” the caller said .
Let ’s review .
A teabagger , following the lead of his duly elected Congressfolk , gets together with his fellow Christians and prays that God will kill a political opponent .
WWJW ?
Sen .
Byrd , that ’s who .
There ’s so much wrong here it ’s hard to know where to start .
But suffice it to say that these mouth - breathers worship one more hateful god .
Further , this god is apparently a bad shot – if you ’re aiming for Byrd and only manage to wing Inhofe , well , omnipotence is right out the window , huh ?
Maybe in the next Spidey sequel they can cast Sen. Coburn and his drooling band of lobotomized Christian teabaggers as the villains .
But while we ’re waiting on the fantasy to arrive at a theater near us , is n’t it nice to know that these people are free to roam the streets in reality ?
UPDATE : TPM wonders if the caller was a prankster .
Could be , could be .
Hard to say for sure , but it ’s certainly plausible .
It ’s just a shame that we live in an age where we have things like “ citizens ” carrying assault rifles to political rallies to consider – makes it hard to sort reality from fantasy .

Twenty points of energy equals twenty five points of damage , and
players should survive about twenty seconds of trading punches against
an enemy of approximately equal power .
That 's about it .
Well , okay , there 's a bit more to it than that .
The first step to balancing a game is generating your baselines .
" Baselines " are average , expected values of just about everything .
We
have baselines for expected hit points , attributes , damage done ,
resources gathered , and most every other stat , metric , or value you
could imagine .
Generating these baselines is half art , and half science .
The " art "
part comes from figuring out what kind of game you want to make .
Different genres and play styles lend themselves towards different
target ideals of " good balance , " and hence valid baselines .
A game
that 's supposed to simulate a gritty , street level police drama , where
a gunshot is extremely dangerous , requires very different assumptions
( and different math and systems ) than a game that 's about super heroic
action .
Once you think you have a good grip on the fuzzy " art " part of your
baselines , comes the hard math of making sure they feed into each other
in a way that makes sense .
Putting this into concrete Champions terms , let 's look at attributes ,
life expectancy , and DPS .
So , first , the " art " part .
There 's no hard ,
math - based particular reason why Champions characters at creation have
stats that range from about eight to twenty , or why I set the " target "
peak value of a stat at level 40 to be 200 .
Basically , I thought the
numbers just looked nice .
They 're understandable , they allow sufficient
whole number resolution and sufficient room for growth and variance .
Really , we could have made the range from 1 to 10 , or 73 to 9,436 , and
had everything else in the game could still be made to scale the same
way , and the game could have had exactly the same " feel " that it does
right now .
If it 's not yet clear why that 's true , keep reading , and
I 'll put it all together by the end .
src= " http://www.tentonhammer.com/image/view/76327/preview "
align = " right " >
The next step was working out the rate at which a
player 's expected stat value would grow .
The simplest answer is what 's
called a " linear progression " .
That would be where I take the expected
peak at level one ( about 20 ) , subtract that from the top value ( 200 ) ,
and divide the result by the number of levels over which you can earn
those points ( 39 ) , yielding a stat max growth of about 4.6 .
Well ,
that 's a perfectly valid and satisfactory number , but it does n't quite
hit the right flavor .
The nature of an MMO , particularly a ( super )
heroic MMO , is such that players want to be able to resoundingly defeat
enemies that are lower level than you , but enemies that are just a few
levels higher than you should be significant challenges , and you do n't
really get that with a linear progression .
What we actually want is a system whereby the increase at each
individual level is slightly more than the increase from the level
before .
That kind of behavior is exactly what is modeled by an
" inflationary system . "
An inflationary system is described as : < base
value > + < base increment > * < number of increment steps >
* ( 1 + < inflation rate > ) ^ < number of increment steps >.
That may look kind of long and scary , but it 's actually pretty easy to
work with in Excel .
All I have to do is figure out how much inflation I
want ( and that 's an " art " question ; I used 1 % ) , and it 's easy to plug
it in and work out that with a base increment of just slightly more
than three , I get exactly the kind of curve I want , and the target stat
baseline grows from a 3 point difference between levels 1 and 2 , to
more than a 6 point difference between levels 39 and 40 .
Of course , it 's nowhere near enough to just declare that the target
value for a player 's stats is 76 at level 16 ; other systems have to
support that to make that a reality .
This , really , is why baselines
exist - to inform the systems that generate them .
Now that I know how
much of a given stat I want a player to have , I have the first piece of
information I need to figure out how many stats players can get from
their gear .
So , back to " art . "
Champions is a super - heroic game , and to me , that
meant that most of a player 's potential and power should come from
their own power , their own choice , and their own superhuman abilities .
Of course , as a competing tension , I want gear to be meaningful and
exciting - just not quite as all powerful and influential as it is in
other games .
In the end , I negotiated out with Antiproton ( our items
and rewards lead ) for items to get 42.5 % of the player 's total stat
budget .
Super stats got 40 % , talents get 15 % , and " base " value is 2.5 % .
Those are the proportions that " felt " right after a lot of discussion
and testing , but they 're far from the only valid choices we could have
made .
So , now we have a new baseline value ; a player should be able to get up
to 85 points in a given stat from their gear at level 40 .
This is what
we call a derived baseline , or more properly a one step derived
baseline .
In on other words , unlike the arbitrary choice of " 200 " for
stat peak at level 40 , this value is not arbitrary ; it 's calculated ,
and it can't be changed .
I could go back and change the precedent
factors that generated it , such as changing the stat peak at a given
level , or changing the itemization budget , but if those values do n't
change , I can't change this value without invalidating everything else
that derives from those precedents .
( I 'll show what I mean by that in a
while . )
The next step after generating the item value baseline is to put it to
work , and derive actual values for actual items .
In order to do that ,
we need to have an understanding of what kind of gear , how much gear ,
and what the quality of that gear is at each level .
In Champions , we expect players to make multi-dimensional progress
through their gear .
That is , they not only get higher level gear as
they level up , but they also get higher quality gear .
This idea of
quality is represented by the color bands ; white , yellow , green , blue ,
purple .
At level one , we expect players to be in level one whites .
At
level 21 , however , we expect players to have graduated completely out
of whites , and be in an approximately balanced blend of yellows and
greens .
It 's certainly possible to do better than that .
Even a solo
player that did lots of mission content , did all the open missions ( and
did well at them ) could have more greens than yellows and maybe even a
blue or two .
That 's not , however , who we 're balancing for .
We're
balancing for the " average " player .
Doing so means that we can feel
confident that an " average " player has a good , balanced experience , and
that an exceptional player gets to feel extra strong as a reward for
their hard work .
This table , the " desired build " table , was created by feel ; we
hand - entered values and ratios to make a gear progression that we felt
would give a slow but steady improvement .
The effect of that table ,
however , is dramatic .
Every drop table in the game as well as the
schedule of rewards for missions that our content designers use is
driven by this table , and the rates and values of drops are calculated
with brutal specificity to generate drop rates that actually match what
our " desired build " requests .
Actually , the drop rates are very
slightly rigged in the player 's favor , to allow players with just a
tiny bit of luck or determination to do better than the table mandates .
The point of baselines is n't to limit players or crush their potential ;
it 's to establish the minimum expected values that we eagerly hope
players will work to exceed .
Now that we 've set up the basic expectations , next time I 'll delve more
into combat balancing and how it all ties together .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Five people , including three police officers , have been indicted on charges related to the beating death of a Latino man in rural Pennsylvania in July 2008 , the Justice Department said Tuesday .
Two indictments charge the five with federal hate crimes , obstruction of justice and conspiracy in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack .
The indictments come almost six months after a Schuylkill County jury acquitted two teens of aggravated assault and one of murder in the death of Luis Ramirez .
The undocumented Mexican immigrant was beaten into a coma during a street brawl involving the teens and their friends on a residential street in Shenandoah .
The incident divided the small , rural mining town along racial lines and became a flash point for racial tensions nationwide .
After the verdict , Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell denounced the attack as racially motivated and called on the Justice Department to intervene .
A federal grand jury handed up the indictments last week , and they were unsealed Tuesday .
The two young men , Derrick Donchak and Brandon Piekarsky , are accused of a hate crime for beating Ramirez while shouting racial epithets at him , according to the department .
If convicted of hate crime charges , Donchak and Piekarsky face a maximum penalty of life in prison .
Donchak also faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted of obstruction , and an additional five years on the charge of conspiring to obstruct justice .
Donchak also faces three counts of conspiring to obstruct justice and related offences .
He is accused of attempting to orchestrate a coverup with members of the Shenandoah Police Department , the Justice Department said .
Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and Lt. William Moyer and Officer Jason Hayes are charged with conspiring to obstruct justice in the Ramirez investigation .
Moyer faces additional charges of witness and evidence tampering and making false statements to the FBI .
Nestor , Moyer and Hayes intentionally failed to " memorialize or record " statements made by Piekarsky about the incident , and " wrote false and misleading official reports " that " intentionally omitted information about the true nature of the assault and the investigation , " the indictment said .
Nestor , Moyer and Hayes each face up to 20 years in prison on each of the obstruction charges if convicted , authorities said , along with an additional five years on the charges of conspiring to obstruct justice .
Moyer faces an additional five years if convicted of making false statements to the FBI .
At the time of Ramirez 's death , Hayes was dating Piekarsky 's mother and Moyer 's son was a high school freshman who played football with the youths involved in the attack , according to the indictment .
State prosecutors alleged that a group of teens including Donchak and Piekarsky , then 19 and 17 , baited Ramirez into a confrontation after a night of drinking .
Donchak and Piekarsky were walking home from a local festival when they encountered Ramirez and attacked him , " striking and kicking him while members of the group yelled racial slurs at him , " the Justice Department said .
Prosecutors alleged Piekarsky delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground .
A medical examiner ruled Ramirez died from blunt - force trauma to the head .
In June , an all - white Pennsylvania jury acquitted Piekarsky of third - degree murder and convicted him and Donchak of misdemeanor simple assault .
The two were also found not guilty of aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension .
Donchak was convicted of corrupting minors for providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight .
The two were sentenced to up to 23 months in the county jail .
After the verdict , Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending the Justice Department pursue civil rights charges .
" The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted , beaten and killed because he was Mexican , " Rendell wrote .
" Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack , but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance . "
Gladys Limon , an attorney representing Crystal Dillman , Ramirez 's fiancee , said Dillman welcomes the indictments , but remains fearful for her safety .
Dillman has moved to an undisclosed location outside Shenandoah .
Her truck was vandalized , and some people have yelled racial epithets at her on the streets , the attorney said .
" She is overwhelmed and is feeling a range of emotions , " Limon said .
" His family has suffered a great deal in the past year . "
It has been particularly hard for Ramirez 's family as the holidays approach , she said .
" The children miss their father .
Crystal misses having him around for the holidays , " Limon said .
" Crystal says this is a gift from God , that this will bring justice to Luis . "
A petition calling for federal charges in the case garnered 50,000 signatures , Limon said .
A hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Wilkes - Barre , Pennsylvania .
" The FBI wants to hear from anyone who may have information regarding alleged civil rights violations or public corruption in Schuylkill County , " the Justice Department said Tuesday .
Those with information can contact the Allentown , Pennsylvania , FBI office .

Because of lower enrollment rates , transfer students can stand to benefit from colleges who are eager to hit their yearly enrollment goals .
Schools with a smaller - than - average student body this year may be more receptive to accepting a greater number of transfer students than in previous years .
Deciding to transfer schools is a big decision , but one that can positively impact students who feel they ended up at the wrong college and those who completed their general education courses at a two - year college and are looking to complete their degree at a four - year institution .
However , it can be hard to transfer into highly selective or popular institutions that attract a lot of students during regular admissions and reject a large percentage of applicants .
Transfer students may work hard on a transfer application only to be rejected and have to start again at square one .
But this year , some schools have had falling admissions rates and thus have more room in their classes to admit transfer students .
78 % of colleges said they would “ increase recruitment of transfer students ” to recoup losses from students who deferred , abstained from re-enrolling or who rejected acceptances to attend a different college .
That may include highly - selective dream schools that students were n’t accepted into during their original application period .
Just because a college is recruiting transfer students to meet enrollment ( and tuition ) goals does n’t mean that transfer students should pay full price to attend the school .
Many schools offer scholarships specifically for transfer students looking to make a switch to a new institution .
If you are interested in transferring to a new school , be sure to research what aid they offer to transfer students and whether the aid is the same for transfers who start in the spring semester as it is for those who join up in the fall .
Did you know Scholarships.com has a special category just for scholarships for transfer students ?
Not only that , but we offer scholarship listings for special categories like First in Family , Study Abroad and Tall People .
Be sure to update your scholarship profile with any applicable special criteria , and we ’ll help you find even more specific scholarships that you can apply for and win .

One of Google 's leading marketing secrets is to appeal to power users .
When describing how they designed Gmail , Google 's Todd Jackson stated :
We started with the early - adopter crowd .
That was on purpose .
We wanted to build a product for people who were getting hundreds of e-mails a day , because we believe by focusing on the power user , you 're designing the product the rest of the market will want in a couple years when everyone 's usage habits catch up to the most active users .
We pay most attention to seven - day active users ( those who use Gmail at least once every seven days ) and usage -- the amount of actual engagement with the product .
Something that Larry and Sergey ( Larry Page and Sergey Brin , Google 's co-founders ) are always , always telling us is to focus on usage rather than users .
That 's what matters more .
You get better feedback and you are properly kept more on the leading edge if you 're focusing on the people who are using the product all the time , using the product all day , than just the casual users .
This is why marketing to developers and designers is so important ... they use the web more , and the stamp they leave on it is much deeper than the average user .
But they also tend to be sensitive to marketing messaging , especially when it becomes a bit hypocritical .
Eric Schmidt On YOUR Privacy With Google
Recently in an interview Eric Schmidt made the awesome statement " Judgment is important ...
If you have something that you do n't want anyone to know , maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place . "
That approach to privacy from a search engine intent on personalizing the search experience is horrible for a number of reasons .
It is bad enough that it encouraged reactions from security professionals and open source advocates , who like to remind us that Google is * always * trying to spy on you and collect more data .
" Everyone knows that every site you visit and all address bar searches in Chrome go to Google , right ? " - Christopher Blizzard
Why did Google create an operating system ?
So they can spy on you .
Why does Google care about speed so much that they created a DNS service ?
It was a convenient excuse to use ... so they can spy on you .
Why is Google launching their own cell phone ?
So they can spy on you .
Mozilla makes most of its money from their search syndication partnership with Google , and yet Mozilla 's Asa Dotzler wrote about how to switch your search provider to Bing .
Explaining why he favors Bing , he wrote :
Because search is broken like browsers were broken in 2002 .
No competition means that Google can do what ever it wants and you have to like it .
Bing 's search is pretty good , in the US at least , and their privacy policy is so much better ( they do n't , for example , connect your Microsoft email or office accounts with your search results like Google does so search data they collect is n't personally identifiable . )
Bruce Schneier understands why privacy is important
For if we are observed in all matters , we are constantly under threat of correction , judgment , criticism , even plagiarism of our own uniqueness .
We become children , fettered under watchful eyes , constantly fearful that -- either now or in the uncertain future -- patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us , by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once - private and innocent acts .
We lose our individuality , because everything we do is observable and recordable .
The following comment also reveals how this sort of tracking + philosophy on privacy can go astray
Why does Eric Schmidt dismiss your privacy ?

Exploiting User Flaws for Maximum Profit Potential
Google collects more data than they need to ( putting you at greater risk ) , so they can better exploit your mental weaknesses for profit .
Eric Schmidt is betting big on exploiting YOUR privacy for profit :
Even better , the device knows who I am , what I like , and what I have already read .
...
Some of these stories are part of a monthly subscription package .
Some , where the free preview sucks me in , cost a few pennies billed to my account .
Others are available at no charge , paid for by advertising .
But these ads are not static pitches for products I 'd never use .
Like the news I am reading , the ads are tailored just for me .
Advertisers are willing to shell out a lot of money for this targeting .
But a bet for ads that learn you and profile your faults and weaknesses is not one that Tim Berners - Lee would make .
The creator of the WWW is firmly against it :
In a world where democracy is getting more participatory , it 's very important that people are informed over a neutral medium so they can connect to whoever they want .
Another issue that is very important is snooping .
I do n't want any snooping on my Internet traffic .
You can do things to ensure that my Internet runs smoothly , but when I am doing something which is perhaps very intimate : when someone looks up something to see if they have cancer , or a teenager wonders if they are homosexual or not and wants to go online to find answers , this should be private .
So systems that monitor every click and build a profile of me are very damaging .
The things we do on the Internet are so intimate that they are much more valuable to others and damaging to me than having a permanent TV camera in my living room .
I do n't want my health premiums to go up if I look up health information ; I do n't want to be a suspected terrorist if I do research on chemicals , I do n't want to get leaflets from gay rights groups if I look up something on sexuality .
At least we know why Eric Schmidt says " Advertisers are willing to shell out a lot of money for this targeting " and why he thinks you do n't need to worry about it .
But maybe Mr. Schmidt is right .
Lets look at how Google operates ...
With Nearly Unlimited Privacy & Secrecy
What happens when Google gets search personalization or search suggestion wrong and your spouse wants to divorce you because of a Google error ?
Judgment is important , after all .
Well Google would n't make such errors , they are perfect .
Or are they ?
Google 's Data Privacy Strategy is a Leaky Boat
Google wants you to trust them enough to store your data with them in the cloud .
Eric Schmidt said that the cloud was their most important focus in 2010 .
Well what happens when your internal data is exposed publicly due to a Google bug ?
Could n't happen ?
Well guess again and again .
Is Eric Schmidt suggesting that businesses simply should n't consider using Google Apps because Google has a track record of not caring about user privacy & being sloppy with private data ?
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google Promotes Lambasting Content
A few weeks back while watching CNBC I remember seeing reporters mention that if you want customer service from airlines that you should complain on Twitter .
Google has since integrated such messages directly in their search results .
So now any bad customer experience ( or envious competitor ) becomes part of your brand .
And you can't make money while making everyone happy .
As the web gets more competitive the markets will only get nastier , where more people try to cash in on established brands .
In fact , running AdWords ads asking if ( or exclaiming that ) product or service x is a scam is one of the most popular AdWords affiliate strategies .
Google does n't let brand advertisers opt out of such messaging on their brands , and if you do n't buy your brand they will be glad to sell that ad slot to someone else .
Google AdWords Ads Promote Scams
Sure Google recently sued some scammers who were cashing in on the Google brand directly , but how long was Google running the Obama stimulus and government grants for after they lied and said they were already cleaned up ?
What does it say about the Google brand that their own brand is being tarnished , but will run scam ads on other keywords even after they said the issue has been cleaned up ?
It is so bad that Google has an ad category called " get rich quick " .
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google Recommends Violating Copyright
Most sites violating copyright online which carry ads are wrapped in " Ads from Google " , via Google AdSense & Google DoubleClick .
Further , Google also promotes cracks , warez , and torrent searches on copyright materials .
Sure it is not as bad as when Google ran AdSense ads on the # 1 cracks website , but how hard would it be to sanitize words like warez and cracks from search suggestions ?
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google Uses Limited Ad Disclosure
Google has frequently talked up the importance of publishers disclosing ads .
And yet in some cases Google removed the " Ads by Google " notification with a little " I " button that you have to scroll over to see that it is an ad .
Further sometimes they have shown NO ad notification on some ad units , making some website visitors think certain site owners condoned homosexual activity .
And Google even marketed the fact that their searchers did not realize that paid search AdWords ads were advertisements :
INT [ interviewer ] : “ Why do the results on top have a yellow background , did you notice ? ”
TP [ tester ] : “ I did n’t notice this . ”
INT : “ What does it mean ? ”
TP : “ It definitely means they ’re the most relevant . ”
Google did not use this feedback to beef up their clearly confusing disclosure ... they stuck with what was working well for them .
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google Funds Manual Information Pollution
I was looking through some of the suggested article titles for some of the garbitrage websites , and came across gems like " Miley Cyrus Did What ?
Celebs who Make Bad Decisions and How to Teach our Kids Right "
Could that title be any more leading ?
And Google is funding that sort of garbage - right now .
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google Funds Automated Information Pollution
And there are sites with automated content generation built around arbitraging brands .
A few months ago I saw the following automated crap ranking for some of our branded keywords ... trying to arbitrage our brand & associate it with foreclosure scams
And that was not a 1 off article ... Google is paying to have 10,000's of such gems created , and is indexing them with glee
What does it say about the Google brand that their ads support this automated generation of trash ?
What message does that send to online consumers and business owners ?
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
Google 's Enjoyment of Privacy ( aka Black Box Pricing )
Some advertisers have fallen out of grace with Google over the years and have had no luck getting back in .
Google arbitrarily decides they do n't like them ( or maybe even their business model ) and that the relationship should end .
The game is complicated , but in some cases one strike and you are out .
The same sort of privacy and secrecy is core to Google 's organic search engine ranking algorithms , how they profile and target certain webmasters , the proprietary standards they push onto the web ( like rel=nofollow ) , & almost every other aspect of their business .
Are you a Google cell phone partner who built a phone on Google 's Android OS ?
If so , did they tell you that they were going to thank you for the cross marketing by creating a competing product ?
I doubt it .
Are you a Google partner who syndicates their ads ?
Want to know what percent of the click price you are earning ?
Screw you , you can't .
Go eat crow .
And in the markets where Google is dominant they not only pass arbitrary judgment without care , concern , or explanation ... but they also use their market position to exert monopoly pricing powers .
They frequently state that the market sets the prices on the ads , but for one of our sites we did some brand ads on informational searches where there are no competing sites buying AdWords ads .
Our ad is so relevant that even the broad matched version of the ad is pulling in a 12 % + clickthrough rate ( with phrase match more than doubling that clickthrough rate ) .
Searchers love our ad and website .
But if we bid less than a nickel Google wo n't even display the ad ( in spite of the high relevancy and complete lack of competition in the marketplace ) .
Google sets arbitrary floor prices and shows you that if you want more clicks you need to pay more , even though the only competitor in this auction is Google .
It is no better than the shill bidding SnapNames got in trouble for .
And yet you often hear Google talk about the power of democratic marketplaces .
Something they clearly do n't believe in .
What message does that send to business owners ?
How should we judge Google based on their current business practices ?
Judgment is important .
What is YOUR Judgment on Google ?
Anytime you see Google do something stupid make sure you blog about how stupid Google is , and compare their errors to what sort of results are available on Microsoft Bing .
Feel free to leave your examples in the comments AND blog them .
I 'll share one of my favorite examples from today , showing me New York hotels near San Francisco :D
I still use a lot of Google products and write the above knowing that they have been pretty good to me , but seeing nonsensical garbage absolutist statements from the top of their company scares me .
If Privacy is Unimportant ...
Think I am being hard on Google ?
Well if they think privacy is unimportant , then maybe they can explain why they host a PDF titled Inside the Black Box Technology and Innovation at Google .
Google workers think THEIR own privacy is crucial to their success ( and WILL fire any employees who get it wrong ) , but think YOUR privacy is a commodity they should sell to the highest bidder .
Good to know !
Careful what you enter into a search box .
And be careful when choosing your web browser .
I would rather pay $ 50 more upfront and not get spied on .
How about you ?
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - A Kosovan - born gunman shot dead four people in a Finnish shopping mall on Thursday and killed his ex-girlfriend in an apartment before killing himself in Finland ’s third shooting spree in as many years .
Police said Ibrahim Shkupolli , 43 , killed three men and a woman at the Sello mall in Espoo , a town near Helsinki , as shoppers stocked up for the New Year holiday .
They confirmed that Shkupolli , as well as his ex-girlfriend who had worked at the mall , were among the dead after the five - hour incident .
“ It has been confirmed that the sixth victim is the suspect ( himself ) .
He was found in his home , ” Chief Inspector Jukka Kaski told a news conference .
Police said Shkupolli was already known to them and had a foreign background , but refused to say what nationality he held .
However , a Kosovo police source said the gunman was from Mitrovica in the former Serbian province which declared its independence last year , and had visited the town last month .
Finnish police would not confirm his motive .
However , they said Shkupolli had been under a court order banning him from contacting his ex-girlfriend , who was found dead at an apartment in Espoo , and that the shootings were probably linked to their relationship .
Local media said the gunman had previous convictions for firearms offences .
The New Year ’s
Eve carnage followed shootings at Finnish schools in 2007 and 2008 , after which Helsinki tightened gun control regulations , with further restrictions planned .
A Reuters reporter at the Sello mall , one of Finland ’s largest shopping centres , saw helicopters overhead and fire trucks around the entrances after the shootings .
The mall was shut down as police hunted the gunman .

“ When we were going out I heard sounds like shots from the third floor , and then I left , ” said a mall employee , who declined to give her name .
“ I paid for my groceries and I wanted to go to my car when I was told that you cannot go there , ” shopper Jorma Romo told Reuters outside of the mall .
“ They were hurrying people out and people were asking ( why ) . ”

Someone slipped up and told the unpopular truth :
Blaming the city authorities of the early 90’s , the former finance minister said that Berlin ’s economy had stagnated .
West Berlin ’s isolation during the Cold War meant that it was never able to replace its business and intellectual elite .
On the contrary , skilled workers generally left the city , while drifters and political activists came .
“ People who wanted to work were replaced by people who wanted to live , ” Sarrazin quipped . …
He claimed it was a serious problem that â€ œ40 percent of births happen in the underclass , â€ leaving too many of the city ’s population not contributing to the economy .
â€ œThe media is focused on social problems , â€  he said , â€œbut Turkish homeless shelters wo n’t drive the city forward .
â€ â€ œThere needs to be a complete change of course in family policy , â€ Sarrazin said , â€œaway from cash handouts , particularly to the underclass .â€ â€ œI would strike a completely different tone and say :
Anyone who can do something and strives for something with us is welcome .
The rest should go somewhere else , â€  he told the magazine .
Deutsche Welle
And while these sorts of problems — which are not just economic , but spiritual : we ’re running out of constructive people but have lots of critical , resentful , unspecialized drifters — eat away at us like a cancer , instead we have warm fuzzy feelings we trade with each other , as this brave author points out :
[ Barack Obama ] will be awarded the Nobel Peace prize even though he has just decided to escalate one of the two ineffectual wars he is conducting .
He will be awarded the prize only because he is a Democrat , a liberal and a black man who defeated the Republicans and cast George W. Bush out of the White House .
Oslo has provided us with many amusing jokes in recent decades .
However , the joke of Obama as peace prize laureate is the funniest of all .
It proves the absurdity of the lengths to which the self - righteous European culture of political correctness can go .
… Obama ’s Washington understands the challenge very well .
So do Nicolas Sarkozy ’s Paris , Angela Merkel ’s Berlin and Gordon Brown ’s London .
Even Dmitry Medvedev ’s Moscow is beginning to understand .
But the general public in North America and Europe has not yet internalized what its leaders know .
Haaretz
If you leave it up to people as a whole to decide their future , do you think they ’re going to ( a ) focus on what benefits themselves in the short term or ( b ) sacrifice the short term and personal for the long - term and collective ?
Even this :
When infants 18 months old see an unrelated adult whose hands are full and who needs assistance opening a door or picking up a dropped clothespin , they will immediately help , Michael Tomasello writes in â€ œ
Why We Cooperate , â€ a book published in October .
Dr. Tomasello , a developmental psychologist , is co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
The helping behavior seems to be innate because it appears so early and before many parents start teaching children the rules of polite behavior .
NYT
I think they ’re overlooking something vital : for a tendency to be genetic , it means that individuals with that trait survived and bred at a greater rate than those without it .
This means that this seemingly altruistic act by an infant is an act of self - preservation : somehow , it helps them survive , perhaps by convincing others that they are “ good . ”
This impulse , like our over - eating , our compulsive shopping , our neurotic search for happiness , and our mania for wealth , is an evolutionary urge gone wrong .
No longer constrained by its natural context , which “ pushes back ” and keeps it in check , it becomes a goal in and of itself .
Now the conventional wisdom is the opposite : lots of choice makes people less likely to choose anything , and less happy when they do choose .
The most famous supporting evidence is an experiment conducted by two psychologists , Mark Lepper and Sheena Iyengar .
They set up a jam - tasting stall in a posh supermarket in California .
Sometimes they offered six varieties of jam , at other times 24 ; jam tasters were then offered a voucher to buy jam at a discount .
The bigger display attracted more customers but very few of them actually bought jam .
The display that offered less choice made many more sales â€ “ in fact , only 3 per cent of jam tasters at the 24 - flavour stand used their discount voucher , versus 30 per cent at the six - flavour stand .
This is an astonishingly strong effect â€ “ and utterly counter to mainstream economic theory .
Financial Times
When too many choices exist , the chance of any choice being a real stinker is more likely .
If you have two choices , and pick the wrong one , it was either cryptic or chance .
If you have 30 and pick the wrong one , you had all those options and blew it , and you ’re going to look like an idiot .
Pick the safe choice — altruism .
Originally , altruism was a means of survival for the individual , not necessarily the group .
Your fellow humans are more likely to save you if you ’re altruistic , or feed you , or keep you warm at night .
Being nice has its advantages .
The problem is that , much as eating food is good but if it becomes compulsive it is destructive , our altruism has become compulsive .
We ’re spending too much effort demonstrating goodwill and not enough effort figuring out where it is appropriate to demonstrate goodwill , and where it ’s appropriate to say “ that ’s enough . ”
If we want perfect goodwill , after all , we ’ll never tell anyone that no , they ca n’t do something because it has bad consequences .
Consequences are a long - term problem ; having this person like us because of our goodwill is in the short term , and keeps us out of fights .
What authors Tao Chen , Ajay Kalra , and Baohong Sun found was that people tend to overvalue products that make them happy , they tend to overestimate the likelihood that a product will need repair or replacement , and they are overly thrilled with unexpected price breaks .
Specifically , consumers are more likely to buy extended warranties for pleasurable products ( such as videogame controllers ) than for more utilitarian products ( such as printers ) , theyâ€™re more likely to buy them if theyâ€™ve seen a product get lost or need repairs before , and they are more likely to buy them when they get an unexpected price break .
Smart Money
In other words , people overestimate risk and greatly overestimate it for really important things — sort of a worst case scenario .
What might be most important ?
Survival .
So when we face social fear , like fear of being proven wrong or mocked in public , we do n’t see the small case .
We see a huge failure ending in total alienation and death .
This is how bullies work .
They gain power over us by making us feel that we ’ll be made to look stupid , weak or afraid in public .
The bully on the other hand has no such fear that we can see .
So we buy them off not because they ’re going to necessarily win , but because they ’re not as afraid as we are and so they ’ve got power over us .
Even more :
In the past decade , the neuroscience of social behaviour has blossomed .
A major catalyst for this has been the discovery of what seems to be a physiological mechanism for social interaction , located in the brain ’s “ mirror neurons ” .
These have been seen to fire not only as a monkey , say , grabs a peanut , but also when the monkey sees an experimenter do the same thing .
Imaging experiments in humans have similarly revealed parts of our brains becoming active when we see someone moving , or even when watching a walker hidden among moving dots .
It seems we are not just observers of the social scene but that we automatically share the experiences and emotions of the people we are observing .
This is only half the story , though , as interaction between people extends far beyond this .
When I see you in pain , I feel your pain and my face automatically expresses this pain .
What ’s more , you can see by my expression that I share your pain , and you are comforted by the knowledge someone else shares your pain .
You are responding to my response to you .
…
How can such behaviour be explained in terms of neuroscience ?
We think that two people performing together in this way are best described as a single , complex system rather than as two systems interacting .
We also believe the same kinds of description should be applied generally to the brain activity that occurs when two people interact , because their brains also become a single complex system .
During any kind of social interaction people unconsciously imitate each other , or else show the appropriate complementary action and reaction .
When this happens , the parts of the brain that unconsciously respond to the actions of others create a form of resonance .
We are not usually aware of this , but when it occurs we feel “ on the same wavelength ” as the person with whom we are interacting .
New Scientist
The salient part is here :
These have been seen to fire not only as a monkey , say , grabs a peanut , but also when the monkey sees an experimenter do the same thing .
This means that by the nature of how our minds learn , we project ourselves onto the actor in any situation .
In particular , this explains why reading fiction is so satisfying : we project ourselves into the scenes and onto the characters .
But this introduces a troubling question about our altruism , which can now be seen as not only manipulative , but also , never even involving the other person — except as a figment of our own minds .
Our fear leads to our speech codes because we fear ourselves in others .
We are trying to fool other people as if they were ourselves , which is why the most broken and empty people are the worst manipulators .
But in a group , this fear may seem to become rational , and then we are manipulating merely to stay out of the way of conflict , and so decisions get made by default : avoidance of reality that could force our neurotic minds to observe and respond to reality itself , not figments of themselves .
Things to think about .

Back in the days when I was frequently negotiating legal contracts , I had a trick I sometimes used to gain an unfair advantage .
Most legal documents would be sent back in forth in electronic form , typically using Microsoft Word .
But what most lawyers did n’t realize was that when you deleted something from a document , Word did n’t actually delete it from the document source , it just did n’t display it .
So it was relatively easy to open the document source in a programming editor and see what sections the opposing side had deleted .
Companies often write new contracts by simply copying some other similar contract they had previously negotiated and making changes to it , so we could easily see what terms they had given in other similar deals , which needless to say gave us a negotiating advantage .
Microsoft has long since removed that feature , but I was reminded of it today when I read about a monumental screwup by the Transportation Security Administration , which is part of the Department of Homeland Security .
It seems that the TSA posted their Screening Management Standard Operating Procedure document to the web last March .
This is the document that defines who and what gets screened at airports , so is obviously something that we should n’t let terrorists read .
So what did TSA do ?
On every page , they have a warning notice ( in capital letters , even ) :
SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
WARNING : THIS RECORD CONTAINS SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION THAT IS CONTROLLED UNDER 49 CFR PARTS 15 AND 1520 .
NO PART OF THIS RECORD MAY BE DISCLOSED TO PERSONS WITHOUT A “ NEED TO KNOW ” …
This clearly says that no part can be disclosed , so should n’t they not be posting it to the web ?
But that ’s ok , because they carefully redacted it .
But here is the ironic part .
They did the redaction by drawing black boxes in the document over text they did n’t want people to read .
So the redacted text is still there .
In fact , reading it is simple : all you have to do is select the text containing the redaction using your computer ’s standard cut and paste commands , and then paste it into a different document .
Voila , the black boxes are gone , and you can read the secret message .
Sadly , the government agency that is responsible for our nation ’s security does n’t seem to know the first thing about electronic security .

Update : Chamber responds : ‘ MoveOn versus the truth ’
Liberal activist group MoveOn is furious with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for lobbying against rules which have prevented rape victims from having their day in court .
In a mass e-mail , the group cites the 2005 gang rape of KBR employee Jamie Leigh Jones .
Jones was raped while in Iraq , which barred her complaint to a U.S. court due to her signature on a form agreeing to enter binding arbitration for any disputes .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Why ? ” asked the e-mail .
“ Because big corporations , led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , have worked for years to prevent workers from suing their employers in almost any circumstance , even sexual assault . ”
Jones won the right to sue when the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found in Sept. that her assault was not in any way related to her employment , therefore nullifying restrictions in her employee contract .
Months ago , controversy over victims ’ right to sue while already having agreed to binding arbitration led Republican lawmakers to vote against a provision put forward by Sen .
Al Franken ( D - MN ) that aimed at giving Jamie Leigh and other assaulted women a path to justice .
When MSNBC host Rachel Maddow tried to find out why , the 30 Republican senators who voted against the bill refused to explain .
Most Republicans had characterized the measure as inappropriate , suggesting that Congress would be rewriting employee contracts .
In addition to the senators who fought Franken ’s legislation , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was writing letters to members of Congress protesting the legislation .
The chamber specifically targeted the Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law .
ADVERTISEMENT
In a letter archived by MoveOn [ PDF link ] , the chamber argued that allowing rape victims the right to sue their employers “ would dissolve any realistic chance of the consumer having an effective forum available to them in which to resolve their claim . ”
Because of the chamber ’s resistance , MoveOn is promoting a petition to encourage the business group to stop lobbying against reforms of arbitration rules .
“ Organizations endorsing the petition include the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence , Public Citizen , Consumer Action , Workplace Fairness , National Association of Consumer Advocates , Take Back Your Rights PAC , Alliance for Justice , and the Jamie Leigh Foundation , ” the group noted .

Sen .
Franken ’s amendment passed on Oct. 6 by a vote of 68 - 30 .
“ It means that every tear shed to go public and repeat my story over and over again to make a difference for other women was worth it , ” Jamie Leigh said outside the Senate chamber , after hugging Sen. Franken .

Chamber responds : ‘ MoveOn versus the truth
Tita Freeman , Executive Director for Communications and Strategy for the US Chamber of Commerce , fought back at the organization ’s blog against the MoveOn petition , arguing that the Obama administration shared their concerns .

My letter from David Bowie
Sandra Dodd ( Sandra Adams , back then )
Someone on the AlwaysLearning list wrote in 2001 or so : I had a major crush on David Bowie ( still do as a matter of fact ! ) .
I responded : I was his first American fan .
I wrote him a fan letter , it came back , I researched where to send it , it arrived .
I knew that , because he sent me a long , full page typed letter , signed it cute , sent me photostatic copies ( pre-Xerox ) of his publicity shots , and a full front section of a newspaper he was on / in ( Chelsea news ?
I have it all somewhere , but not all in one place . )
I saved the big envelope , but gave the stamps to a friend .
The orginal letter is in some safe place ( darn me , when we moved ... ) but I definitely have it .
There 's a copy on the wall here in my office .
it starts off " Dear Sandra , When I called in this , my manager 's office , a few moments ago I was handed my very first American fan letter - and it was from you .
I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply ... "
It was 1967 .
My friends would come over and say " Yeah , but who IS he ? "
My uncle was the manager of a C&W station in Amarillo , and they would get promotional albums .
I had a cousin my age , had an old light - up juke box in her bedroom , had music of all sorts , and he would let her go through the non -C&W stuff and keep what she wanted .
She did n't keep this one ( the promo of his first album ) and it came to me .
It was weird , and interesting , and I wrote him a letter .
I had told him I liked his writing , and the songs were good .
I think I 'd told him they were as good as the Beatles , maybe , or some such .
I wish I had kept a copy of what I wrote .
When he came to Santa Fe to film The Man Who Fell to Earth a couple of years later , my friends were saying " GO MEET HIM ! " I did n't .
I was embarrassed or afraid he would n't remember me or something , and I did n't care as much then as I had before .
The letter was sweet .
I had offered to start a fan club .
He said " There is a Fan Club here in England , but if things go well in the States then we 'll have one there I suppose .
It 's a little early to even think about it .
" I hope one day to get to America .
my manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages .
I was watching an old film on TV the other night called " No Down Payment " a great film , but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way of Life .
However , shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet , filmed mainly at his home in Vermont , and that evened the score .
I am sure that that is nearer the real America ... "
He asked me to write and tell him more about myself .
I did .
I always figured I was a reject for being fourteen years old .
But probably he was swept away in being busy getting famous .
And I was getting swept away in my interest in folk music , and my whirlwind of high school stuff , playing guitar , going to all - State , going to college early , and it was okay .
I had thumb - tacked the newspaper to the ceiling of my room ( acoustical tile ) and it was there for two years .
The best thing about the newspaper was I got my first taste of everyday British English , neither literary nor television or movie script .
Advertisements and the everyday descriptions of things .
A truck 's engine had caught fire .
But I had to figure that out , from a short article that said a lorry had had a fire under its bonnet .
I was thrilled .
The letter 's on PITT stationery ( the manager 's stationery , Kenneth Pitt ) and there are very few typos .
Good typist .
That impressed me too !
I did n't buy any more of his albums , anyway — by the time he was openly available I was immersed in folk music .
I bought some current acoustic stuff ( Elton John , Joni Mitchell , Carol King ) , but mostly I was collecting field recordings of traditional ballads and everyday songs .
Then I got involved in Renaissance music , and I had a sexy , funny boyfriend from India and ... one thing lead to another and here I am now hanging out with you guys !

LATER NOTE :
In 2009 , the letter was discovered and launched out and about after its appearance in a blog called Letters of note .
Stories of that are here : David Bowie Letter .
This site got 90,000 hits in one day , one of those early days , when wire services started picking up the story .
There are links to a couple of those articles .

The results of the decade - long Interphone study on cell phone safety are that heavy cell phone use increases the risk of developing brain tumors later in life .
The study , which focused on three types of brain cancer and tumors of the parotid gland , found a significant increase in cancer after a decade or more of cell phone use .
When a cell phone tower connects with a cell phone , electromagnetic radiation is created .
When the cell phone is held against the ear , this radiation penetrates the brain , particularly in children .
According to the Daily Telegraph in London , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) will soon publish the results of the Interphone study , which was conducted in 12 countries by the International Agency for Cancer Research ( IARC ) .
Head researcher Dr. Elisabeth Cardis told the Telegraph , " In the absence of definitive results and in the light of a number of studies which , though limited , suggest a possible effect of radio frequency radiation , precautions are important .
I am therefore globally in agreement with the idea of restricting the use by children , though I would not go as far as banning mobile phones as they can be a very important tool , not only in emergencies , but also maintaining contact between children and their parents and thus playing a reassurance role .
Means to reduce our exposure ( use of hands - free kits and moderating our use of phones ) are also interesting . "
These results from the Interphone study follow closely on research published in the Oct 13 issue of the , which reviewed existing research on the association between cell phones and brain tumors .
It found that when just the well - done studies were included , there was an 18 % increased risk of brain tumors in cell phone users , and that they tended to occur on the side of the head that the cell phone was used most .
In the United States , which did not participate in the Interphone study , there are 270 million cell phones in use .
Senator Tom Harkin , now head of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , has promised to probe more deeply into the question of a link between cell phones and brain cancer .
There 's no argument that cell phones emit an electromagnetic field , a form of microwave radiation , that enters the brain when the cell phone is held against the ear , and there 's good research showing that the field does affect brain function .
Although research has not shown that short term cell phone use causes cancer , a large population study from Sweden has shown that people who use cell phones for more than ten years on the same side of the head have a 40 % higher risk of certain types of brain tumors .
The Interphone study adds to this evidence .
Cell phone users can distance the brain from electromagnetic fields by using the speaker phone function , a headset , or by texting .

Delia shows how to make Perfect Roast Potatoes : the one thing you 're going to need is a very good , very solid oven roasting tray because anything that buckles under a high heat is useless .
First of all add 50g of fat to the tray , the secret is to match the fat to what you 're serving .
This goes into the oven whilst its preheating to 200C , Gas Mark 6 .
Using 900g of Desiree potatoes , the small ones left whole and larger ones cut in half , they have been pre-steamed for 10 minutes and drained .
This amount will serve 4 people .
Replace the lid and using an oven glove to protect you , hold it on firmly and give the potatoes a really vigorous shake .
Delia likes to turn the pan upside down and give another little shake to the ones on top .
Now for the important bit , turn the hob onto a medium heat , then the hot tray is taken from the oven and placed over direct heat which keeps everything smoking hot .
This is why you need a really solid roasting tray .
Add the potatoes to the hot fat as quickly as possible using a long handled spoon .
Then take a fork and quickly turn them over .
Now return the roasting tray to the oven , on a high shelf and leave them for 50 minutes to 1 hour , or until they 're golden brown .
Perfect Roast Potatoes should be very crunchy , crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy within .
When you tap it it should sound crisp and then when you cut it open you can see how soft and fluffy it is .
Never cover them so they stay absolutely crisp and serve them as soon as possible with just a sprinkling of salt .

A photo in this morning ’s paper of Prince Charles and his wife Camilla caught my eye .
The couple are visiting the East coast of Canada at the moment and the photo shows them dressed finely and sporting not one , but two poppies on their left lapels .
I noted , having lived in the UK that one of the poppies was of the paper style worn in England while the other was the plasticized , flocked version common in Canada .
Remembrance Day or Veteran ’s Day is a day designated by Commonwealth nations to show respect for those who died in war .
November 11th is selected in honour of the Armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month to end World War I in 1918 .
This ceremonial day has been in effect since 1919 when those soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War were first honoured .
A number of nations outside the Commonwealth also participate in similarly themed memorial events .
The poppy as a symbol itself was inspired by the Canadian John McCrae ’s poem “ In Flanders Fields ” in which he references the wild poppies growing in the battle fields .
The concept of wearing a poppy was presented by Moina Michael , an American school teacher , in 1921 .
Crepe paper pins were produced in the United States while silk poppy lapel pins began to be produced in France by soldiers ’ widows and orphans .
To this day in England and in the United States , the disabled , war veterans and their dependents work to manufacture the poppies .
Canadian veterans made poppies until 1996 when manufacturing moved to a private contractor .
In all cases , the proceeds from poppy sales are directed to the rehabilitation and support of veterans of not just the First and Second World Wars but of subsequent wars as well .
The most likely explanation for the visiting Royals wearing both English and Canadian poppies ?
A symbolic gesture of support for the communities of veterans in both the UK and Canada and for the disabled veterans still making the poppies in the UK .
The tropical rainforest in the eastern lowlands of Ecuador assaults the senses : the sunlight dazzles the eyes , the heat is so fierce that within seconds one 's clothes are soaked in sweat .
Then there are the sounds : a hypnotic symphony of frogs , crickets and other insects and birds which continues unabated day and night .
There are sudden glimpses of the jungle 's abundant wildlife : a spectacular flash of a blue morpho butterfly at the river 's edge , a flock of green parakeets screeching .
This stunning region , which covers more than a third of Ecuador 's area , almost the size of England , and which is one of the world 's richest biospheres , with a huge diversity of animals and plants , some found nowhere else on Earth , faces a double threat : from the logging industry , which would strip it bare , and from the oil industry , which for nearly 40 years has been exploiting the huge resources of crude beneath the soil .
Now , however , Ecuador is betting it can keep what is left of the oil in the ground and hang onto its biosphere into the bargain .
The South American country has learned the hard way that oil brings human misery and environmental devastation along with billions in export earnings .
Every new oil field is an invasion that brings tens of thousands of outsiders into the forest 's heart , polluting the air , soil and water , destroying wildlife , and assaulting the support systems of indigenous tribes , which can lead to their extermination .
And the damage is not confined to the immediate vicinity of the wells .

The Via Auca is the main highway cutting through the Ecuadorean Amazonia region , and it has been a lifeline of the oil industry for nearly 40 years , slicing through the countryside like a badly healed wound , the roadside lined with hellish flares , murky waste pits and corroded pipelines .
Accidents involving the pipelines are frequent , and their consequences harrowing .
On the far side of the town of Dayuma , which sprang up as an oil workers ' shantytown and is still riddled with crime and prostitution , one of the ageing pipelines has ruptured , sending a jet of oil shooting 30 metres into the air , staining the vegetation black all around .
The sickly stench of crude oil is overwhelming in the midday tropical heat .
A house and a field across the road have also been soaked by the filthy gusher .
Sebastian Ortiz , whose elderly father owns the simple wooden house by the roadside on the edge of the jungle , points out where the oil has drenched the field and seeped into the ground .
Petrobel , one of many oil companies now operating in the region , has said it will pay his father US $ 5,000 ( £ 3,000 ) towards the clean - up costs .
But Ortiz says : " I do n't know when he will be paid , or even if it is still safe for him to carry on living here . "
Pollution is only one of the many ills that the oil business brings with it .
Fernando Moreno , an anthropologist with the Ministry of the Environment , has been monitoring the oil industry 's effect on the local community for years .
" The people have become beggars " he says .
" They have become accustomed to demanding whatever they need and more from the oil companies , just because they are in the same territory .
Weighing up the benefits and drawbacks of the oil companies , I think it would be better not to have them .
They lead to many bad habits , they make people avaricious , they increase the differences between people – and they are a source of contamination : for the land , the water and the people themselves . "
For the last 16 years Ecuador has been embroiled in a bitter battle over a huge $ 27.3 billion environmental damages claim brought against US oil giant Chevron by 30,000 Amazonian inhabitants .
The plaintiffs accuse Texaco ( which Chevron acquired in 1993 ) of dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest between 1964 and 1990 , and claim that 1,400 deaths occurred in the region as a result of the contaminated soil and water , which brought unaccountably high levels of cancer , skin and breathing conditions .
The Amazon Defence Coalition , which represents the plaintiffs , says the scale of the pollution makes it the biggest environmental disaster in the world , dwarfing the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and leading some experts to dub it " South America 's Chernobyl " .
It is certainly shaping up to become the world 's biggest environmental lawsuit .
Chevron robustly refutes the allegations .
It says Texaco spent US $ 40 million on a clean - up before it handed over operations to the state oil company in 1992 .
Ecuador 's government then signed a release freeing Chevron from any liability for subsequent damages from potential oil contamination .
Whatever the outcome of the legal battle Ecuador is now banking on a new idea to help it shed its poisonous dependency on oil .
The Yasuni-ITT Initiative aims to keep the region 's remaining oil reserves untapped and underground , in return for financial compensation from the international community and carbon offsets from the carbon markets .
The crux of the scheme is simple : to keep the oil beneath the Yasuni National Park where it is , in perpetuity .
Covering nearly 2.5 million acres of primary tropical rainforest , Yasuni is the ancestral territory of the Waorani people and two other tribes , the Tagaeri and the Taromenane .
It was named a Unesco biosphere reserve in 1989 , and scientists regard it one of the most biodiverse places on earth .
It is also the home of Ecuador 's largest oil reserve .
But by not extracting the estimated 846 million barrels of oil in the reserve , Ecuador will keep an estimated 410 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere , making a big contribution to the fight against global warming .
It will also pledge to respect the territories of the indigenous cultures living in the national park , as well as protecting its flora and fauna .
In return , the Ecuadorean Government has asked for compensation of $ 350 million a year for 10 years , which would be invested in environmental and social development programmes , helping the country move towards a sustainable economy .
After a slow start the plan has begun to attract serious promises of commitment .
Amazon Watch , an organisation dedicated to protecting the rainforest and its indigenous inhabitants , calls it " a landmark proposal ... a precedent - setting effort by an oil - exporting nation to preserve a global biodiversity hotspot , protect indigenous rights and set the stage for its own economic and energetic shift away from fossil fuels " .
Some big international players agree : Germany has offered $ 50 million on condition that other nations stump up similar sums .
Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa , and Yolanda Kakabadse , a senior member of the Yasuni commission , have been in London and continental European capitals this week spreading the word .
And in December Ecuador 's former chancellor Francisco Carrión , the Government 's envoy on the initiative , will present it at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen .
Among Ecuadoreans themselves , the initiative is welcomed particularly by the flourishing tourist industry .
With a spectacular range of natural attractions , from the Galapagos Islands to the snow - peaked Andes , Ecuador has long been a pioneer in ecotourism .
Fander Falconi the foreign minister and one of the founders of the initiative , says the scheme will work on the basis of shared responsibility , locally and globally .
" What we are aiming for is global sustainability , but with a distinction drawn between those who harm the environment and those who suffer the consequences of this harm . "
Luz Coloma , Yasuni-ITT 's press officer , added , " Ecuador has had sad experiences with the exploitation of oil and no one wants any more environmental disasters like the Chevron - Texaco case . "
On the banks of the Shiripuno river , to the west of the Yasuni National Park , is the Huaorani Ecolodge run and owned by formerly nomadic hunters who only came into contact with the outside world 50 years ago .
Omene Paa , a tour guide at the lodge , tells how oil has been a curse for his people from the time " the path - cutters " first arrived .
The " petrolera " companies brought disease and contaminated the water , he claims .
One of his cousins died of a lung infection .
Now Omene says his people , who first fought off the US oilmen with axes , just want to be allowed to live in peace .
" Our battle should continue ; we the Huaorani must look after our territory . "
Late last night ( CET ) , we reported on the story that the VLC project needed more developers for the Mac version of this popular video player , or else the Mac variant may disappear .
Just about every website out there reported on this issue , but it turns out it all got a bit exaggerated ( on the internet ?
Surely you jest … ) .
We spoke to VLC developer Pierre d’Herbemont to clarify the issue , and they ’ve also put up a wiki page about the so - called demise of the Mac version of VLC .
He also detailed what , exactly , they meant by “ Apple is blocking us ” .
So , how dead is the Mac version of VLC , really ?
Well , they surely do need developers , but the port certainly is n’t near death .
The problem is that while the core of VLC is properly maintained , the old Cocoa graphical interface ( 1 % of VLC ’s code ) for VLC is not .
This is why there were problems in the latest VLC 1.0.x version .
They explain that the reason for this lack of maintenance is that the interface is currently being rewritten , in a project called Lunettes .
This is done because the current interface “ is n’t Mac enough ” .
Lunettes aims to solve this problem by using VLCKit , which is “ pure Cocoa , Objective - C 2.0 with bindings support ” .
They state this will help them concentrate on features .
In addition , the entire graphical appearance of this new UI can be changed using CSS .
Their aim with this is to make altering the UI easier in the future .
Lunettes will also bring a number of other new features , such as the ability to continue a video where you left off when you closed VLC .
It will also come with better media discovery , and you can scroll through your playlists and / or TV channels when in full screen mode .
Last but not least , Lunettes is 64 bits .
Lunettes is currently still under heavy development , and more developers are most certainly welcomed .
You cna take a look at Lunettes here .
So , what about the comment regarding Apple ?
The VLC developers stated that “ Apple does n’t want us on the Mac platform and is blocking us a lot , and refuses to explain why . ”
d’Herbemont clarified this for us .
“ This actually means that Apple does n’t want to list VLC on apple.com / downloads , ” he told us via email , “ We do n’t know why .
That ’s all . ”
I ’m glad this has all been cleared up .
In a recent series of Hubs on LSD and the effects on pregnant women I was challenged to prove my statements that LSD was extremely harmful .
Well ... here we go .

LSD and genetic damage .
Dishotsky NI , Loughman WD , Mogar RE , Lipscomb WR .
Of nine studies in vitro , six have indicated some degree of induced chromosomal breakage after exposure to LSD ; three failed to confirm these results .
The damage , when found , was generally of the chromatid type , arising during or after DNA synthesis .
The results of early chromosome studies suggested that true genetic damage might be a consequence of LSD exposure .
The comprehensive evidence from studies on drosophila indicates no mutagenic effect from 0.28 to 500 microg of LSD per milliliter and a definite mutagenic effect from 2,000 to 10,000 microg / ml ; this is consistent with a threshold response or a sigmoid dose - effect relation .
Circular dichroism experiments suggested that the specific mechanism of action of LSD on DNA may be a direct interaction resulting in conformational changes in the DNA helix .
Early chromosomal studies implicated LSD as a potential cause of congenital malformations , fetal wastage , and germinal chromosome damage .
In a study of human pregnancies , those exposed to illicit LSD had an elevated rate of spontaneous abortions .
This early study gets a little bit wound up in the differences between ingesting pure LSD and illicit LSD and thus obfuscates its own conclusions .
So let 's go onto some more interesting later studies ...

Dynamic changes in prefrontal cortex gene expression following lysergic acid diethylamide administration .
Nichols CD , Garcia EE , Sanders - Bush E .
Department of Pharmacology , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , 8148 Medical Research Building Three , Nashville , TN 37232-8548 , USA .
Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) is a psychoactive drug that transiently alters human perception , behavior , and mood at extremely low doses .
Certain aspects of the behavior elicited by acute doses of LSD closely resemble symptoms of mental disorders such as schizophrenia .
We find that the gene response to LSD is quite dynamic .
The expression of some genes increases rapidly and decreases rapidly , while other genes change more gradually .
Dose - response studies show two classes of expression ; gene expression maximally stimulated at lower doses , versus gene expression that continues to rise at the higher doses .
Here is an instance of a recent study , just a few years old , which clearly states that LSD plays havoc with your genes , and the next study shows how LSD affects the fetal brainstem directly ...

Developmental changes in [ 3 H ] lysergic acid diethylamide ( [ 3H ] LSD ) binding to serotonin receptors in the human brainstem .
Zec N , Filiano JJ , Panigrahy A , White WF , Kinney HC .
Department of Pathology , Children 's Hospital , Boston , MA 02115 , USA .
This study provides baseline information about the quantitative distribution of [ 3H ] LSD binding to serotonergic receptors ( 5 - HT1A - 1D , 5 - HT2 ) in the human brainstem , from midgestation through maturity , with a focus upon early infancy .
Brainstems were analyzed from 5 fetuses ( 19 - 25.5 weeks postconception ) , 5 infants ( 42 - 55.5 weeks postconception ) , and 3 mature individuals ( 4 , 20 , and 52 years ) .
The highest levels of [ 3H ] LSD binding occurred prenatally throughout the brainstem .
At all ages , the highest relative binding localized to the rostral raphe .
A marked decline in [ 3H ] LSD binding occurred between the midgestation and infancy in brainstem regions involved in control of cardiovascular function , respiration , and pain .
It is clear by this study that LSD scrambles all sorts of developing neural functions in the fetal brainstem .
Now let 's look at the effects of LSD on the female reproductive system ...

Lysergic acid diethylamide is a partial agonist at 5 - HT2 receptors in ovine uterine artery of late pregnancy .
Zhang L , Dyer DC .
Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology , College of Veterinary Medicine , Iowa State University , Ames 50011 .
d - Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) produced dose - dependent contractions ( EC50 , 17.9 +/- 2.1 nM ) on isolated ovine uterine artery of late pregnancy , which were competitively antagonized by ketanserin .
The maximal contraction to LSD was 51 % of the 5 - HT response .
LSD competitively antagonized ( pA2 9.21 ) contractions produced to 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT ) .
The results indicate that LSD is a partial agonist at 5 - HT2 receptors in ovine uterine artery .
So now we see that there is a basis to believe that LSD affects the female reproductive system in mammals .
But it gets even more interesting with this study ...

Progesterone enhancement of lysergic acid diethylamide and levo - 5 - hydroxytryptophan stimulation of the copulatory response in the female rat .
Sietnieks A , Meyerson BJ .
Copulatory behavior in the ovariectomized rat , i.e. the lordosis response ( LR ) on being mounted by a male , can be induced by administration of either estrogen alone or estrogen followed by progesterone .
LR has been shown to be inhibited by lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) in certain doses ( greater than or equal to 50 micrograms / kg ) and by Levo - 5 - hydroxytryptophan ( L - 5 - HTP ) ( greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/kg ) .
This effect was recently found to be enhanced by increasing doses of progesterone .
Small doses of L - 5 - HTP ( 0.25 and 0.05 mg/kg ) stimulated the LR and the influence of progesterone was the same as for small doses of LSD .
It 's fairly obvious that even in mammals which have had their ovaries removed , the effect of LSD mimics some hormonal functions .
But the severe physiological effects of LSD do n't stop there ...

Heat shock protein in mammalian brain and other organs after a physiologically relevant increase in body temperature induced by D- lysergic acid diethylamide .
Cosgrove JW , Brown IR .
A physiologically relevant increase in body temperature from 39.7 to 42.5 degrees C , which was generated after the intravenous injection of D- lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , caused the induction of synthesis of a 74,000 - dalton heat shock protein in the brain , heart , and kidney of the young adult rabbit .
LSD drives a mammalian body into an overheated state to such a degree that heat shock can ensue .
I 'm sure that is perfectly healthy for pregnant women !
Again , NOT !
But let 's look at what LSD does to your immune system ...

Immunological consequences of in vitro exposure to lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) .
House RV , Thomas PT , Bhargava HN .
IIT Research Institute , Chicago , IL 60616 .
It was demonstrated that LSD is able to suppress the proliferation of B - lymphocytes ; the production of the cytokines IL - 2 , IL - 4 , and IL - 6 ; and the induction of cytotoxic T - lymphocytes at a concentration of 100 microM .
In vitro exposure to LSD had differential effects on natural killer ( NK ) cell activity , with significant enhancement of both basal and IL - 2 - augmented NK cell function at concentrations between 0.0001 and 0.1 microM , and suppression of NK response at 100 microM .
These results demonstrate that LSD may have a direct effect on components of the immune system at concentrations that may be reached upon human exposure .
OK , so LSD pretty well wipes out your immune system .
Given the correlation between drug users and HIV - positive status , I 'm sure that this is just what the doctor ordered to seropositive individuals .
NOT !
Now let 's look at what LSD does to your brain ...

Lysergic acid diethylamide : morphological study of its effect on synapses .
Kemali M , Kemali D .
A morphometric analysis of the effect of LSD on synapses was performed in the habenulae and the interpeduncular nucleus of the frog .
LSD - treated frogs had a higher total area of synaptic contact than control frogs .
Exocytosis profiles were observed only in LSD - treated frogs .
Other qualitative changes in the ultrastructural characteristic of synapses were appreciable after LSD administration .
So LSD physically changes the way your brain 's synapses connect with each other .
I do n't know about anyone else , but I think that the shape of my synapses is best left the way my maker made 'em ...

Characterization of a translational inhibitor isolated from rabbit brain following intravenous administration of d-lysergic acid diethylamide .
Fleming SW , Brown IR .
Intravenous administration of d-lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) to rabbits results in a transient inhibition of brain protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro .
A translational inhibitor that appears in the postribosomal supernatant fraction of cerebral hemispheres following LSD administration was partially purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G - 150 and precipitation with 60 % ammonium sulfate .
This inhibitor , which was proteinaceous , reduced the translational capacity of an initiating cell - free protein synthesis system derived from brain .
It also inhibited a messenger RNA - dependent reticulocyte lysate programmed with brain polysomes and a globin - synthesizing reticulocyte lysate system .
LSD inhibits the synthesis of protein in your brain , which is an essential brain function .
And let 's look at what a brain on LSD does to the person it inhabits ...

This is only a precursory examination of the medical literature on LSD effects .
There are hundreds more studies to quote and the vast majority of them stand as clear and evident scientific proof that LSD is extremely harmful to almost every single mammalian and human anatomical , physiological , and psychological function .
Even such a very basic overview of the current science is enough to scare the living daylights out of any intelligent person , pregnant woman or not , to not even remotely consider that LSD is in any way safe or beneficial in any way , shape or form .
Now we can start a CIVILIZED debate on the ISSUES .
We 'll talk FACTS .
I wo n't attack anyone personally and no one will attack me personally , or I will simply not publish the comment .
The rules are clear .
Let 's go .
Last week , I talked about the insidious assortment of " Shut up , that 's why " arguments that get made against atheists and atheism .
Today , I want to talk about where I think the " Shut up , that 's why " arguments come from .
There was a story on " This American Life " last week that hit me really strongly .
It was n't about atheism , but I think it cuts to the heart of the " Shut up , that 's why " argument , so I 'm going to sum it up here quickly , to show you what I 'm talking about .
The story was about a family with a family legend .
The grandfather of the family had been lost on a camping trip when he was a child , but was recovered eight months later , from ( the legend said ) the itinerant tinker who had kidnapped him .
One of the granddaughters became intensely curious about this legend , and started doing research to find out more about the story -- a story that had been widely reported in many newspapers , and which even had a folk song written about it .
But the more she dug , the more oddities and inconsistencies she found in the story , as reported by both the papers and the legend .
In particular , there was another woman who had claimed that the kidnapped child was really hers .
Her offspring also had a family legend : the legend of the kidnapped child , who , through a travesty of justice , wound up being given to another family .
Long story short :
The more the granddaughter dug , the more she realized that this other woman 's claims had merit .
Every piece of solid evidence seemed to confirm it .
Eventually she had DNA testing done ... and found that , in fact , this other woman was right .
Whether consciously , or un - , or some combination of the two , her great - grandparents had taken her grandfather from his real mother .
And the granddaughter 's family was furious .
At her .
For digging this story up .
They did n't want to know the truth .
Seriously , passionately , entirely consciously -- they did n't want to know .
They said as much .
Many of them refused to accept it , despite an insurmountable body of evidence .
And it caused a great family schism , with many members of the family barely speaking to the woman who had uncovered the difficult truth .
Do you see where I 'm going with this ?
Here 's what struck me about this story .
When Ingrid and I were talking about it , both of us were utterly baffled at the family members who did n't want to know the truth .
It 's not that we could n't grasp the " not wanting to know " concept .
We 've both had icky " I did n't want to know that " experiences , things we 've learned about friends or colleagues that did n't enrich our lives and that just made things difficult .
We got that .
But we did n't get how , once you knew that there was a mystery , you could just let it go .
We understood how you could fool yourself unconsciously -- that 's just human nature , we all do it -- but we did n't understand how you could fool yourself consciously .
For both of us , knowing that there was a big unanswered question that might have a complex and difficult answer ... that would eat away at us , way , way more than the complex and difficult answer itself .
I think there are two kinds of people .
( Okay , that 's a gross oversimplification .
It 's more like all people have two personality traits , and some of us have more of one , and some have more of the other .
But for simplicity ’s sake , let 's call that " two kinds of people " for now . )
There are people who are content and want to stay that way ; people who do n't want conflict or upset ; people who want a peaceful life in which everybody gets along ... and if that means you do n't talk about certain things or ask certain questions , they consider that a fair price .
People who , like Slartibartfast , would rather be happy than right .
And there are people who , once curiosity bites us , can not shake it .
Now , although it may sound like it , I 'm not actually saying that one type is inherently better than the other .
Obviously , I 'm more the stubbornly curious type , and I 'm strongly biased in that direction .
But I can see the value in both .
It may well be that the human race needs both .
I have a lot of the " diplomat / reconciler / seeing both sides / trying to defuse conflict " personality in me too , and I think that 's important -- without it , we 'd all be at each other 's throats constantly .
And unshakeable curiosity can be a very mixed blessing .
Not just because it can stir shit up and alienate people , either .
It can be a mixed blessing because sometimes it 's a dead end .
Ask any true crime aficionado : detectives or reporters with unsolved cases can be driven mad by them .
So I 'm not trying to say , " Atheists are better than theists . "
What I 'm saying is this :
I think this is one of the reasons that conversations between atheists and theists can get so difficult .
I think that , when we argue with theists , atheists tend to assume that of course theists want to know the truth .
Of course they want to follow the God question to its logical conclusion .
Do n't they ?
The question of whether God does or does not exist is a huge one , with enormous consequences in how we live our lives and how we understand the world .
Who does n't want to understand the world as well and as clearly as they can ?
And I think -- this is more of a stretch , since I do n't quite grasp this mindset or what it feels like -- but I think that theists tend to assume that of course atheists are looking for a worldview that they find appealing and useful , rather than one that they find consistent and plausible .
I think that many theists really do n't get why atheists would rather be right than happy .
( Not that we 're not happy ... but you know what I mean . )
Who does n't want a peaceful life of contentment ?
Look at the " Shut up , that 's why " arguments I talked about last week .
" Atheists are so whiny . "
" Atheists think they 're so smart . "
" Atheists keep talking about atheism and expecting us to care about it , but we do n't , and other things are more important . "
" This is private business , and it's not nice to talk about it or to argue with people about it . "
" This is n't about arguments and evidence , anyway .
" " We 're sick of hearing about it . "
" Why do they care so much what other people believe ? "
" Ca n't we all just get along ? "
What else are these but arguments for getting along , over insatiable curiosity ?
And look at how theists react when they debate atheists .
I can't be the only atheist who 's had this experience : theists start off debating us , all excited and revved up and proud of themselves for their open - minded willingness to engage with the atheists and question their own faith ... and , as the debate wears on , they get increasingly unhappy , and upset , and angry .
Anger that gets aimed at us .
It 's always baffled me .
I 'm like , " But you said you wanted to debate this !
Do n't you ? "
The answer is no .
They do n't .
They want to want to debate it .
They want to be the kind of person who wants to debate it .
They want to be the insatiable curiosity type , the intellectually courageous type who will ask any question and follow the answers wherever they lead .
But they 're not .
Not when it comes to God .
I 'm not saying that all theists are incurious sheep .
Far from it .
But I do think that -- when it comes to the God question , at least -- theists are willing to take their investigations only so far , and no further .
Some wo n't take it more than a step or two , as you see with hardcore young - earth creationist fundies who wo n't even consider the possibility that their 5,000 year old book might be mistaken in one or two places .
Some will take it very far indeed , as you see with some modern theologians who make better arguments for atheism than a lot of atheists ... but then can't quite take that final step .
( And obviously , there are theists who do take that final step , and become atheists . )
But the unwillingness to follow this question to its logical conclusion seems to be a hallmark of religion .
I mean , is n't that the very definition of religious faith -- believing in God , even when all the evidence and arguments are telling you not to believe ?
And I do think that atheists -- at least , the ones who once had religious belief and left it behind -- tend to have that stubbornness , that unwillingness to just let things slide , that dogged determination once we get our minds around a question to take it as far as it goes , wherever it goes , even if it goes somewhere that freaks us the fuck out .
When it comes to the God question , at least .
So I think when atheists and theists debate , we 're often debating at cross purposes .
We 're assuming that we have the same goals .
And often we do n't .
Often in a discussion or a debate , the atheist 's goal is in direct conflict with the believer 's goal .
And I do n't just mean the obvious goal of " persuade this person that religion is right / persuade this person that atheism is right . "
The goal of relentlessly pursuing a difficult question to its logical conclusion is often in direct conflict with the goal of keeping things peaceful , content , and on an even keel .
And I think this explains the " blame the messenger " quality that defines so many theist / atheist debates .
If you think that the goal of a conversation is to pursue the truth as far as you possibly can , then blaming the messenger makes no sense .
But if you think that the goal of a conversation is to resolve conflict and return society to the status quo , then relentlessly curious messengers are to blame .
( It also explains the feeling I 've sometimes had , one that other atheists have said they 've had : the feeling of being a killjoy , the rain god on everybody 's parade . )
I 'm not quite sure where I 'm going with this .
I 'm not sure where the solution might lie ; if anyone has any thoughts on that , I 'd love to hear them .
But two things are coming to mind .
One is that atheists need to be better about making atheism a safe place to land .
We need to make it clear that being an atheist does n't mean being dissatisfied , restless , and constantly at odds with everyone around you .
We need to make it clear that atheists can not only have happy lives , and meaningful lives , but calm and peaceful lives .
The other is that atheists need to keep the conversation going : not just so we can persuade more people , but so the conversation itself can become more normal .
Right now , I think one of the reasons these debates are so fraught and divisive is that , for a lot of people , the ideas in them are so new .
If we keep the conversation going , in both the public sphere and our private lives , I think the flavor of it is likely to shift : from a shocking assault on people 's most fundamental values , to an ongoing family argument that everyone 's a little tired of but that everyone 's familiar with .
The cat will be well and truly out of the bag .
And the attempts to stop the discussion with " Shut up , that 's why " arguments will become increasingly pointless and irrelevant .
Thoughts ?
In character , Colbert created apparent dyspepsia among some portion of his Washington A - list political and media audience .
The dinner draws more than 2,500 and is a very curious function , underscoring the depressingly incestuous relations between the political establishment and a few too many journalists , some of whom so deeply crave the acceptance of whoever 's in power .
It 's morphed from a rather staid gathering into a smoochy celebrity gang bang and sucking up to politicians , with media organizations inviting both people they cover and famous actors and other pop culture stars as guests , and doing so with competitive fervor in their search to look hip .
( Full Disclosure : As Chicago Tribune Washington bureau chief , I finally succumbed to virtual Abu Ghraib - like pressure from colleagues and scraped our traditional resistance to this silliness , inviting " Law And Order " stars Jill Hennessy and S. Epatha Merkerson in consecutive years .
And I had a fine time .
But I did exhibit limits , and Patton - like decisiveness , in telling one famous actor , who can afford to buy much of the construction debt in Dubai , to take a hike after he insisted that I also fly his girlfriend from Seattle and put him up under a pseudonym at the Willard Hotel ) .
That year brought President George W. Bush to the dais , with his discomfort obvious as Colbert 's right - wing character theatrically tried to offer support .
Colbert 's show host said the two of them were n't " brainiacs on the nerd patrol . "
He talked about some Bush White House staff changes as " rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . "
He cited Bush 's declining poll numbers and said , " We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking ' in reality . ' "
The Internet was abuzz for days , with some mainstream media outlets then criticized for catching up with the story very late .
In Chicago three and a half years later , Colbert left no doubt that his recollection of the night is sharp , starting with correcting a questioner about the dinner 's date .
" April 29 , 2006 , " he said at the Second City reunion , eliciting laughs .
" I still wake up with a pain in my shoulder . "
Colbert said he was genuinely surprised that he'd been invited to the affair and , with his colleagues , " worked very hard on it and the actual performance . "
It was an honor , a rare opportunity .
" The actual performance was enjoyable for me .
I really liked the jokes and was eager to do it . "
Tom Purcell , a Second City alum and the television show 's co-executive producer , explained the tactical rationale : Bush , he said , was the typical " Big Man " one might find in innumerable institutional settings .
" We thought it was the Big Man .
He hires somebody to make fun of him , and he chuckles .
You see it at office Christmas parties .
You say the boss is so cheap that .... and he laughs and everybody laughs .
That 's what we thought we were doing .
They would n't have brought us in if they did n't know what jokes we did . "
At a recent wedding , I ran into some family members from Chicago who were crowing about their latest hobby : keeping chickens .
The main advantage , the family members all agreed , is that the fresh eggs they gather are fantastic .
No comparison at all to the store - bought version .
“ You ’ve never had an omelet until you ’ve had one with fresh eggs , ” my nephew told me .
My nephew ’s wife , Carol , writes : “ The yolks are a much darker yellow , almost orange .
The eggs stand up much higher in the pan when you break them open and the white is much more viscous .
As far as texture , when you eat them ( whether in cooking or scrambled or fried ) they are much smoother in the mouth and the flavor is more rich . ”
The health benefits of fresh eggs are pretty dramatic .
They contain , on average , 25 percent more vitamin E than supermarket eggs , 33 percent more vitamin A and 75 percent more beta carotene .
Urban chicken raising , I ’ve since learned , has become downright trendy and fashionable , even in places you ’d never expect , such as New York , Chicago and San Francisco .
Enthusiasts are actively promoting the idea to their city councils , and a lot of them are listening .
Backyard chicken operations usually consist of just a few hens , and no roosters , which can be noisy .
But kept clean and healthy , keeping chickens in your backyard is n’t much different than having a couple of dogs or cats , advocates argue .
Some of the cities that allow backyard chickens include Fort Collins , Colo. , South Portland , Maine , and Madison , Wis .
The issue has grabbed headlines in Sacramento , Calif. , where an underground chicken - keeping movement has been brewing for years .
City Councilman Kevin McCarty would like backyard coops legalized , with a three - hen limit , according to Sunday ’s Sacramento Bee .
“ If you ’re only talking about the ones that do n’t make noise and if you have a limit – they ’d have to be in your own yard , not wandering around and getting out – then I think the upsides are pretty great , ” he told the paper .
Naturally , the urban chicken movement has carved out a place in cyberspace , with several blogs on the topic .
A photographer in Brooklyn , NY writes The New Green Blog with lots of info about urban gardening , as well as her three chickens .
Urban Chickens is a blog that maintains links to backyard chicken news stories , and has a pull - down menu with information about local ordinances in cities and towns across the country .
As for my family ’s ( slightly more elaborate ) backyard chicken “ ranch ” outside Chicago :
They have 13 hens and average about 10 eggs ( brown ) a day .
Chicken feed in the summer runs them about $ 5 a month – it consists of corn and other grains .
Carol reports : “ I feed them this in the morning while I clean the hen house , which takes about 15 minutes a day .
I let them out of their pen ( about 20 x 40 ft ) for the day and they spend the rest of the day eating bugs and vegetation they find on our property .
“ During the rest of the year ( about seven months ) they are penned up to keep them out of the road in their never - ending search for bugs and vegetation that is no longer there .
I spend a little more on feed during this time – around $ 12 a month .
“ Our hen house has electricity .
a few hours of light inside keeps them laying all winter .
( They need 12 - 14 hours of light a day to lay ) .
When it is really cold out I turn on a heat lamp . ”
OK .
I ’ve tried to spare you most of the puns .
But I think it ’s fair to say that this is a trend that ’s definitely sunny - side up .

In its documentary Extraordinary Animals In The Womb , National Geographic captured rare highly detailed images of animals at various stages of gestation .
Now you can see fetal dog , elephants , penguins , and dolphins still inside the womb .
Extraordinary Animals
In The Womb aired last year , using advances in scanning and imaging technology to trace the gestational paths of animals outside the human family .
The documentary footage is actually a combination of digital photography , scans , and computer - generated models .
The filmmakers took detailed scans of the animal 's wombs , then had the model makers recreate every blood vessel and whisker .
The resulting images , while not direct photographs , are , according to the researchers , accurate representations of what goes on inside these creatures ' wombs .

We have always been and remain insular .
The insularity I am referring to is our professional blindness to any but Western philosophy , which fills our whole professional horizon .
Insularity tempts us by its overestimation of whatever we have learned wherever we happen to have grown up , but it is no intellectual birthright .
There have been more than a few great thinkers who have done their best to resist it .
Kant and Hegel , both conscientious , omnivorous scholars , took the trouble to learn what they could of Indian and Chinese thought , even though , as has become clear , they were not informed well enough to allow them to make plausible judgments .
Schopenhauer was extraordinarily favorable to Indian thought but wildly subjective ( or egotistical ) in his use of it .
Wilhelm von Humboldt , eager to understand the nature of languages , made an often painstakingly detailed study of a great number of them - Greek , Latin , Basque , the languages of Central America , Sanskrit , North - American Indian , Chinese , Polynesia , and Malaysia .
( 1 ) What Humboldt learned convinced him that the Indo - European languages  the Sanskritic ones , as he called them  were the best for methodical reasoning .
This judgment is now likely to appear prejudiced , but Humboldt made and enormous effort to learn what he took to be the creative act embodied in each of the diverse languages spoken by human beings .
To him , the language of each people and each individual was a unique imprint , the particular set of particular hieroglyphs of a particular view of the world .
The desire of Kant , Hegel , Humboldt , and their likes to philosophize out of a truly comprehensive knowledge is rare among contemporary philosophers .
No doubt , so much is now known that the effort to be comprehensive appears foolhardy .
But the impossibility of learning everything is a poor justification for remaining stubbornly insular .
Is it plausible for a philosopher of language to base his thought on no more than his native language , or for an analytic philosopher to assume that what he thinks is true for ordinary English must be true for all languages , or for all that prove their naturalness by conforming to familiar English practices ?
Or is it plausible that a hermeneutical philosopher should engage in the strenuous expansion of horizons but never try to expand one far enough to encounter anything not Western ?
Given the depths of our Western insularity and the limits of my essay , I have had to ask myself how I could best convey that our ignorance keeps us isolated and small - minded .
I played for a while with the idea of confronting the best - known thinkers who have recited confident phrases such as " only in Greece , " " only in Europe , " and " only in the West "  or recited , with a contrary intent , " only in China , " " only in India , " and " only in the East . " ( 2 ) I have given up this idea of confrontation because it does not seem useful , at least here , to show how otherwise intellectually respectable contemporaries retain an ill - informed bias in favor of Western or , sometimes , Eastern thought .
An attack on individual philosophers would be too personal for my tastes and , what is intellectually worse , would risk stirring up the philosophers ' defensive pride and postponing their recognition that they are simply wrong .
Having resisted the desire to begin with an attack on biased philosophers , I have played with the less invidious possibility of setting my argument in an autobiographical framework and explaining how , by chance and curiosity , I became involved in writing about comparative culture , especially philosophy .
But I am too involved in the work to begin reminiscing , so all that is left of my autobiographical impulse is the desire to tell you that , after some years of work , I have finished a comparative history of world philosophy up to Kant . ( 3 ) The examples I will use are taken verbatim or nearly so from this history , where they are spelled out in what I hope is much more convincing detail .
Given what I prefer not to do , I have decided to base my beginning of an attempt at persuasion on two examples of non-Western philosophizing .
Instead of trying and probably failing to persuade anyone by my own , Western argument , I will rely on the arguments of the very philosophers whose study I am recommending .
Here , I say to you , are specimens of Chinese or Indian philosophy worth studying .
Do n't they impress you as philosophical , and , what is more important , as philosophically significant ?
A large part of this essay will therefore consist of two examples , which I wish I had the time to extend .
One of the examples is a close paraphrase of the early Chinese philosopher Chinese philosopher Chuang - tzu , and the other a close paraphrase of passages from a relatively late Indian philosopher , the mystical Shriharsha .
There is n't time to explain much , so I have freed the Indian example of its technical phraseology .
I rely quite willingly on the reader 's intuitive completion of what I have left unfinished .
I begin with a text from Chuang - tzu , the earlier of the two philosophers .
The historian of ancient China , Ssu-ma Ch'ien , tells us that Chuang - tzu was a native of Meng , that his personal name was Chou , and that he was employed in Lacquer Garden ( either a garden or the city given its name ) .
" His chief doctrines , " the historian tells us , perhaps mistakenly , " were founded upon the sayings of Lao Tzu ...
His literary and dialectical skill was such that the best scholars of his age were unable to refute his destructive criticism of the Confucian and Mohist schools . " ( 4 ) A mystic and a relativist , Chuang - tzu argues that the distinctions made by reason and morality are all misleading , as their paradoxical character shows .
In the famous second chapter of the book that goes under his name , he at one point argues in the following way :
Try to think of the unity of things .
It has been said ( by the sophist Hui Shih ) that heaven and earth count as one unity .
True , the myriads of things and I together make one .
Now that I have called them one , have I not said something ?
But by calling them one , have I not added the word one to the total of things ?
And the one and the one make two , and the two and the first one make three : and so on , beyond what a skilled calculator , let alone an ordinary person , is able to sum up .
( 5 ) Altogether , those who distinguish between alternatives leave out what is not included in either alternative .
The sage embraces them all without distinction ; most people make the distinctions .
And so I say that to make distinctions is to fail to see something .
( 6 ) A little further on , Chuang - tzu gives a well - known answer to the question " Are we arguing ? "
He goes on : Arguments cannot really be settled .
Suppose I argue with you and you win , are you really right and am I really wrong ?
And if I win , am I really right and you really wrong ?
Or is one of us right and one of us wrong ?
Or are both of right or both of us wrong ?
And if I and you can't settle the argument between us , others will be equally in the dark .
Who can tell us what is right ?
If the judge share your opinion , how can he decide which is right ?
And if he shares both our opinions , how can he decide who is right ?
And if I , you , and another man can't arrive at a mutual understanding , can we find anyone else ?
( 7 ) Then Chuang - tzu says that he cannot distinguish between himself dreaming a butterfly , conscious of being only a butterfly , and himself awakened from the butterfly dream .
Did he dream the butterfly , he asks , or did the butterfly dream him , Chuang - tzu ?
As Chuang - tzu , he cannot make the final separation , which is also perhaps one between the genuineness or solidity of waking experience and the illusiveness or nothingness of dreaming .
( 8 ) The conclusion is not that the distinctions should be disregarded but that they should be accepted as inevitable , as part of the creative bounty of nature .
The fact that only waking human beings are reflective does not tilt the balance in favor of being human and wake , because it is just this condition that raises the problem of identity and shows it to be insoluble .
Chuang - tzu 's solution is to accept everything without prejudice  varying identities , varying states , and reflective doubts  so that in the end , he believes , there are only the many distinctions and spontaneous mutual transformations .
This Chinese example represents Chinese philosophy with exuberant humor and imagination .
In contrast , my two Indian examples are specimens of more sober , more technically developed philosophy .
The first is from Shriharsha , who flourished about 1150 C.E. ( 9 ) A court poet as well as a philosopher , he undertakes to destroy the pretensions of reason in order to defend his mystical faith in Brahman .
Like preceding Indian skeptics , Shriharsha attacks philosophical systems from within , on their own terms .
As is natural , his attack is aimed mostly at the school of Nyaya , which emphasizes logic and the technique of argument .
The world Nyaya envisages is one of real , independent beings known by reliable perception and tested inference , that is , by the accepted means or criteria of knowledge , the Indian word for which is pramanas .
As usual in Indian philosophy , he first puts the argument of his opponent or opponents , refutes the argument , and only then states his own position .
One of the crucial tactics he uses is to attack philosophical definitions .
Philosophical definitions are all too broad or too narrow , he finds , or suffers from circularity , infinite regress , or incompatibility with the opponent 's other concepts .
In other words , philosophical definitions always turn out to be useless for their declared purposes .
Beginning with the concept of valid knowledge ( prama ) , Shriharsha analyzes seven of its competing definitions .
They propose that valid knowledge is either : ( 1 ) experience of the thatness of an object ; or ( 2 ) experience that corresponds with its object ; or ( 3 ) complete experience ; or ( 4 ) unfaltering experience ; or ( 5 ) undisputed experience ( a Jain and Buddhist definition ) ; or ( 6 ) uncontradicted experience ; or ( 7 ) experience of a particular kind of power . ( 10 ) A simple example of Shriharsha 's method is his first analysis of valid experience as the experience of thatness ( meaning , roughly , essence ) .
Shriharsha's overall tactic is to make a critical examination of the meanings philosophers propose for the two concepts central to the definition , thatness ( tattva ) and experience ( anubhuti ) .
He points out that in the exact words of the definition , the that part of word thatness has no referent and therefore no meaning .
Maybe , he says , is refers to anything of which the speaker is thinking , such as the natural form of an object the speaker perceives .
But perceptual illusion makes it impossible to accept the definition when thatness is given such a sense :
If a shell is mistaken for silver , the object of cognition is the shell , not the natural form of silver .
The proposed definition does not allow the invalid perception to be excluded from it , so the definition is inadequate .
Shriharsha then asks if the definition can be modified to as to make is viable , but the opponent 's efforts , though ingeniously complicated , all fail .
Shriharsha goes on to ask how the opponent defines the term experience and faults whatever is suggested ; and he does the same with the term inference .
After finishing with the means of knowledge , he makes a calmly ruthless attempt to prove the incoherence of every key term in the accepted lexicon of philosophical definitions .
He repeats the questions , " How do you defined ...? " and " What is meant by ...? " and always finds that the term he asks about is unexplained or incoherent .
As terms are disabled by him from use , their inadequacy disables the other terms in whose definitions they appear .
No satisfactory answer is given to the question what the opponent means by cause , or by the terms before , after , and time that the opponent invoked in trying to explain what cause means .
To the protest that Shriharsha has shown only that the exact nature of time is doubtful , he answers , " You can not explain the exact nature of doubt , either . "
And so on , in technical detail .
Shriharsha destroys so much in order to shield Brahman against destructive criticism .
It is to make the shield impenetrable that the leaves the perceived world an unexplained , enigmatic fact .
It is at this point that I reluctantly leave my examples and go on to add a word on the problem of translatability or commensurability .
( 11 ) This problem is usually raised to emphasize the difficulty of translating a distant language or interpreting a distant culture .
But it is easier to grasp in its full extent when one applies it to a braid range of possibilities .
This is because , seen most broadly , it is the problem of uniqueness  inexplicability of untranslatability  as against that of generality  explicability or translatability .
Assume , for the sake of argument , the equation I have made of uniqueness , inexplicability , and untranslatability , on the one hand , and of generality , explicability , and translatability , on the other .
Since words refer to the experiences they are intended to convey , it is impossible or extremely difficult to convey to someone else and experience or quality of experience that is unique , meaning , , of course , never undergone by the person with whom one is communicating .
But because much and perhaps all of our experience is to some degree unique or unshared and to some degree general or shared , it is more accurate to consider all of our experiences as having different degrees of uniqueness and generality .
The point I now want to make is that uniqueness or ( so to speak ) a degree or fraction of uniqueness can be ascribed to all kinds or levels of experience , and to the expressions or expressive media in which we communicate these kinds or levels .
The levels or kinds range from the most limited , which are the single experiences of single persons , to increasingly broad , collective ones .
If we go from the least to the most inclusive level , uniqueness can be ascribed to : a certain person at a certain time ; a certain person without reference to time or occasion ; a certain dialect , argot , jargon , or technical language ( for example , of one or another school or field of philosophy ; a certain subschool or school of thought ; a certain group of languages ( Indo - European , for example ) ; and  the most inclusive level that I suggest  a certain culture or civilization .
I do not want to discuss each of these kinds or levels .
My point is only that each is to some degree unique with respect to every other .
To go still further :
No expression of any of these kinds or levels of experience can be repeated on different occasions , even in what appear to be the same words , or put into different words or logical symbols without loss of its uniqueness .
Strictly speaking , at every particular time , every expression of every person , jargon , school , language , language group , or culture is unique .
And if one disregards the uniqueness of every particular occasion , one is left with an atemporal - seeming uniqueness of individuals , jargons , schools , languages , language groups , and cultures .
To continue with the theme of uniqueness , we know that the experience of the writing or reading of one poem is not identical with that of writing another , nor is the reader 's experience of reading the same poem at different times .
And if every word , line , auditory quality , and rhythmic feature of the poem affects every other , does one not denature the poem intolerably in extracting its meter from it and comparing this meter with the meter of some other poem ?
Is the meter of the one poem the same as the abstractly similar one of the other ?
Although clear enough , the question has no exclusively correct answer because , as one wants , the answer is either " yes , " " no , " or , " it depends . "
Suppose we change our line of questioning and ask , somewhat analogously , about the history of philosophy : Does Plato represent Socrates accurately , Plotinus represent Plato accurately , and Alfarabi all four of them and Aristotle too ?
Does each of these thinkers , in attempting , as he says , to be essentially accurate to the intentions of his predecessor or predecessors reveal himself as a betrayer ?
Again , the answer is yes , or not , or , it depends  as one wants , or , rather , as one sees and intends to bring out either the uniqueness , the resemblance , or the uniqueness in resemblance of the doctrines compared .
If there is a great cultural distance between the thinkers or ideas we want to compare , the problem , though exacerbated , remains the same .
We can ask : When Chuang - tzu talks ( in Chinese ) about the relativity of tastes , is he making the same point as Protagoras ( in Greek ) or , perhaps , as Hume ( in English ) ?
Or , when Chuang - tzu points out that the idea of the complete oneness of everything is self - refuting or paradoxical because even to mention to oneness is to create a duality , , is Chuang - tzu saying something that can be translated into Plato 's third - man argument , which Plato directs against his own theory of Ideas ?
Or is Chuang - tzu developing only an infinite regress argument ?
As is he saying or is he not saying something similar to Shriharsha when Shriharsha points out , as he does , that the gathering of evidence to support evidence can lead to an infinite regress that leaves all evidence only fallible if at all supported ?
Furthermore : When Shriharsha tries to show that all the abstract definitions and abstract terms used for philosophy are so inaccurate and misleading that they have no valid application , is his attempt analogous to that of Wittgenstein to show that all metaphysical terms are misleading ?
As I have said , my point is that every one of the questions can be plausibly answered either yes , not , or , it depends .
The no rests on the attribution of decisive importance to the details and context of the subject of comparison .
Every detail is taken to be as indispensable as the exact sound of one 's lover 's voice is to the other lover .
The yes reflects the opposite feeling , need , or decision , to disregard certain details as inessential .
This is like the scientist 's decision to disregard as " noise " the variations in data that make it too difficult to formulate the generalization being sought .
The scientist knows in advance that if details of all kinds are considered essential , generalization will be either impossible or uselessly vague .
It should not be supposed that the choice of the yes or the no is no more than a matter of personal taste .
On the contrary , the choice may be empirically absurd or dangerous .
It is empirically absurd to identify as one 's lover someone who does not have the lover 's exact voice or nose .
Love ordinarily requires particularity .
But to think that an object is a different one every time it appears different because it is looked at from a different angle is also absurd .
Objects change far less often than their appearances .
And to think that an objects of a certain kind  a pen , for example  is altogether different from others of the kind is to deny the function that makes them all similarly useful .
Likewise , to insist that one instance of yes is totally different from another because spoken in a different voice or pronounced differently is to make the common meaning impossible to grasp and human interaction too confusing .
And though it may be true that every person who has a disease has it in distinctly personal way , an extreme emphasis on the uniqueness of each instance of the " same " disease would make the profession of medicine impossible .
All this , although argued and reargued interminably in the history of philosophy , is philosophical common sense , and I am not sure that it needs to be said .
But following the same ( or is it different ? ) line of thought , how do we in practice decide that Aristotle when translated into Latin , Hebrew , and Arabic and often from one of these languages into another  was still Aristotle , or that Buddhist philosophy translated from Sanskrit or Pali into Chines or Tibetan or retranslated from one of the latter languages into another remained recognizably the same ?
Again , the answer is commonsensical :
The translations were never prefect reproductions of the originals in a different linguistic medium .
This can be shown in detail .
But it can also be shown in detail that translations eventually transferred a great deal that was generally accurate .
The result was that genuinely Aristotelian ideas played a very effective role in Latin , Hebrew , and Arabic philosophy and led in time to powerfully original works that stemmed from a recognizably Aristotelian kind of thinking .
Something analogous can be said of the transference and creative use of Buddhist ideas in Tibet and China .
It is perfectly true that if we make a restrictive enough definition of philosopher and philosophy , we find that there was nothing of the kind in India and China .
That is , there were no exactly equivalent terms or functions : the Sanskrit terms anvikshiki and darshana were not , to begin with , equivalent to philosophy .
But the Greek terms and the comparable ones in India and China came to be used with such latitude of meaning that there is little intellectual difficulty in finding philosophy and philosophers in a recognizably Western sense both in India and China .
Indian " syllogisms " are not Greek or medieval ones ( are even the Greek and medieval the same ? ) , but they look and sometimes function much the same , and they are all formal mechanisms to establish the accuracy of inferences , so that anyone interested in logic , willing to give up some of the less easily translated characteristics , and willing to make the necessary technical adjustments can work out the formal relations between them .
And though the Sanskrit tarkika is not exactly the same as logician , there is not much difficulty in establishing the basic equivalence of tarka with Western logical forms .
In considering the relation of Western to non-Western philosophies , the yes alone and the no alone are too intellectually confining .
" It depends " is better because it is far more instructive to use both the yes and the no in order to specify the relations of the kinds of thought being compared .
Contemporary philosophers of every Western sort stand to gain in the variety of perspectives they can share , in the store of their ideas and nuances of ideas , and in their conceptual precision if they study on - Western philosophies just as seriously ( and , after they know them generally ) just as seriously as they study their own .
When it will no longer be possible to maintain the old , exclusive habits of mind , philosophers will wonder how their predecessors could once have been so blind to what has become so plainly true .
The sociology of the profession creates difficulties for a Western philosopher who ventures outside the limits of Western thought .
But there are good philosophical reasons to be beyond our usual Western selves and begin to philosophize in a more adequately human spirit .
Finally , after reading many reviews of these fights , have people started to get it right .
ITS NOT BOXING , points are not awarded on a ' per contact ' basis .
You win a hockey fight if you injure or KO the other guy .
When two guys are separated by the refs , no one has won !
This still applies when one guy throws the other to the ice .
Just cause you can hurl the other guy to the ice , does n't mean you won .
[ WARNING : this list contains images that may offend ]
This is a list of secret projects that have since been found to be true in light of released ( either officially , or unofficially ) documents .
Some have long been the source of conspiracy theories while others have been accepted by the mainstream as real .
In no particular order :
10 Churchill and Hitler ’s Execution
Sir Winston Churchill , Britain ’s wartime Prime Minister , planned to execute Adolf Hitler in the electric chair if the Nazi leader fell into Allied hands .
Declassified documents reveal that Churchill was opposed to Allied plans for war crimes trials and wanted summarily to execute leading Nazi figures including Hitler who he regarded as “ the mainspring of evil ” and a “ gangster ” , and was also content to see Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi starve to death during a hunger strike in 1943 .
They also show that he was willing , against the advice of his Cabinet colleagues , to “ wipe out ” defenceless German villages in retaliation for Nazi atrocities in Czechoslovakia .
Churchill ’s choice of the electric chair was despite the fact that it was never used in Britain before the final abolition of the death penalty in 1965 .

9 Operation Northwoods
According to secret and long - hidden documents , the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up and approved plans for what may be the most corrupt plan ever created by the U.S. government – a fake terrorist attack on citizens .
Code named Operation Northwoods , the plan , which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , called for innocent people to be shot on American streets ; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas ; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington , D.C. , Miami , and elsewhere .
People would be framed for bombings they did not commit ; planes would be hijacked .
Using phony evidence , all of it would be blamed on Castro , thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse , as well as the public and international backing , they needed to launch their war .
One idea seriously considered involved the launch of John Glenn , the first American to orbit the earth .
On February 20 , 1962 , Glenn was to lift off from Cape Canaveral , Florida , on his historic journey .
The flight was to carry the banner of America ’s virtues of truth , freedom , and democracy into orbit high over the planet .
But Lemnitzer and his Chiefs had a different idea .
They proposed to Lansdale that , should the rocket explode and kill Glenn , “ the objective is to provide irrevocable proof that the fault lies with the Communists et al Cuba .

8 Operation Gladio
US documents declassified in the 1970 ’s show that General Giovanni de Lorenzo , the chief of Sifar ( Italian Military Intelligence ) , joined the US in the 1950 ’s in preparing a plan against a Communist takeover , but did not inform his own government .
According to a document released by Mr Andreotti the CIA and Sifar sketched a plan in November 1956 , codenamed Gladio , to form a force of 1000 men capable of guerilla warfare and espionage .
A training base was set - up in Sardinia and 139 weapons and ammunition dumps were hidden in Northern Italy .
Gladio was controlled by NATO ’s Clandestine Planning Committee ; attached to Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Europe .
It was appropriate that the documentaries should be made by the BBC , since Britain ’s MI6 and SAS were key movers and trainers , along with the CIA , in the Gladio operation .
In 1990 the Italian secret army was exposed by Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to the Italian Senate , whereupon the press spoke of “ The best kept , and most damaging , political - military secret since World War II ” .
“ On the morning of August 2 , 1980 , a massive bomb exploded in the waiting room of the central train station in Bologna , killing 81 people and injuring 200 others .
General Santorito , the chief of Italy ’s military intelligence agency , SISMI testified in the wake of the bombing that it had been planned by the British - Swiss - American ‘ Montecarlo Comite ’ based in Monaco . ”
Google has unfortunatley removed the first two episodes of a three part documentary on Operation Gladio .
Part three is shown above .
7 My Lai Massacre
The My Lai Massacre was the mass murder of 347 to 504 unarmed citizens of the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) .
They were almost entirely civilians , the majority of them women and children .
The massacre was conducted by U.S. Army forces on March 16 , 1968 .
Before being killed some of the victims were raped and sexually molested , beaten , tortured , or maimed .
Some of the dead bodies were also mutilated .
Six months later , Tom Glen , a 21 - year - old soldier of the 11th Light Infantry Brigade , wrote a letter to General Creighton Abrams , the new overall commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam , accusing the Americal Division ( and other entire units of the U.S. military ) of routine and pervasive brutality against Vietnamese civilians .
The letter was detailed and its contents echoed complaints received from other soldiers .
Colin Powell , then a 31 - year - old Army Major , was charged with investigating the letter , which did not specifically reference My Lai ( Glen had limited knowledge of the events there ) .
In his report Powell wrote : “ In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent . ”
Powell ’s handling of the assignment was later characterized by some observers as “ whitewashing ” the atrocities of My Lai .
In May 2004 , Powell , then United States Secretary of State , told CNN ’s Larry King , “ I mean , I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai .
I got there after My Lai happened .
So , in war , these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again , but they are still to be deplored . ” further info from the BBC in 1988 .
6 Plame Affair
Beginning in mid July 2003 , according to federal court records , Bush administration officials , including Richard Armitage , Karl Rove , and Lewis Libby , discussed with various reporters the employment of a then - classified , covert , CIA officer , Valerie E. Wilson ( also known as Valerie Plame ) .
On September 16 , 2003 , the CIA sent a letter to the US Department of Justice asserting that Plame ’s status as a CIA undercover operative was classified information and requested a federal investigation .
Attorney General John Ashcroft referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel , directed by Patrick Fitzgerald , who convened a grand jury .
The “ CIA leak ” grand jury investigation did not result in the indictment or conviction of anyone for any crime in connection with the leak itself .
However , I. Lewis Libby , Chief of Staff of Vice President Dick Cheney was indicted on five counts of obstruction of justice , perjury , and false statements to the grand jury and federal investigators on October 28 , 2005 ; Libby resigned hours after the indictment .
5 Operation Paperclip
Convinced that German scientists could help America ’s postwar efforts , President Harry Truman agreed in September 1946 to authorize “ Project Paperclip , ” a program to bring selected German scientists to work on America ’s behalf during the “ Cold War ” .
The highest proflie of these scientist was Wernher Von Braun the man who masterminded the Moon shots , and a member of numerous Nazi organisations , he also held rank in the SS .
His initial intelligence file described him as “ a security risk ” .
The US operation saw von Braun and more than 700 others spirited out of Germany from under the noses of the US ’s allies .
Interesting side piece : do some snooping and find out what and who links Werner von Braun and L. Ron Hubbard .
4 Dunblane Massacre
The Dunblane killer Thomas Hamilton might have been stripped of his firearms licence had prosecutors heeded police reports about his worrying behaviour towards children , according to secret files .
These include claims that police were tipped off that Hamilton was armed and en route to Dunblane Primary School , that he was a Freemason and received favours from Masons in the police allowing him to avoid prosecution , and that he was part of a paedophile ring that included members of the security forces .
Lord Cullen on completing the public inquiry into the murders of 16 children and their teacher , ordered the documents in the case sealed for an extraordinary 100 years .
Even the major media in Scotland thought this smelled funny .
What was being hidden ?
The report banned under the 100 - year rule was com piled by Paul Hughes , then a detective sergeant with Central Scotland police , and concerns Thomas Hamilton ’s activities at a summer camp in Loch Lomond in 1991 , five years before the shootings .
Selected extracts published during the Cullen inquiry revealed that it recommended Hamilton should be prosecuted for his activities at the summer camp and that he should have his gun licence revoked .
The report , however , was ignored .
In October 2004 , former conservative party chairman Lord Tebbit added his voice to the growing outrage at this decision , and in October 2005 half of the files were opened .
Press reports suggested that the papers showed Hamilton be a paranoid obsessive , much given to writing letters of complaint to all and sundry ; a paedophile ring has not been found .
3 U.S.S Liberty
On June the 8th 1967 , during the six day war , Israel deliberately attacked the intelligence collection ship USS Liberty , in full awareness it was a U.S. Navy ship , and did its best to sink it and leave no survivors .
The attack killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded at least 173 .
Scores of intelligence analysts and senior officials have known this for years .
That virtually all of them have kept a 40 - year frightened silence is testament to the widespread fear of touching this live wire .
According to NSA documents – classified top secret – some senior officials in Washington wanted above all , to protect Israel from embarrassment .
this video gives a brief overview of the incident along with a few others of note .

2 The Lost Bomb
Classified documents obtained by a group of former workers at Thule , an Arctic air and radar base built by the United States in 1951 - 52 , suggest that one of four hydrogen bombs on a B - 52 bomber that crashed there in 1968 was never found , the daily Jyllands - Posten said “ Detective work by a group of former
Thule workers indicates that an unexploded nuclear bomb probably still lies on the seabed off Thule ” , the mass - circulation daily said .
The crash , on January 21 , 1968 led to a crisis in relations between the United States and NATO ally Denmark , which is responsible for Greenland ’s foreign , security and defense policy and at the time prohibited nuclear weapons on its territory , including Greenland .
Denmark was never informed about the lost bomb , which has serial number 78252 , the paper said .
A U.S. state department document dated August 31 , 1968 said all weapons onboard the crashed aircraft had been accounted for but did not spell out whether they had been recovered .
The United States assured the Danish government in spring 1968 that clean - up work after the B - 52 crash had been completed and gave up searching for the lost bomb in August that year .
Home to a ballistic missile early - warning radar station , Thule sits at the midpoint of a chain of similar sites between Alaska and the British Isles — a line along which the United States may build a shield against missiles from what it calls states of concern such as North Korea , Iraq , Iran and Libya .
1 The Templars and the Vatican
In October 2007 the vatican published secret documents about the trial of the Knights Templar , including a parchment – long ignored because of a vague catalog entry in 1628 – showing that Pope Clement V initially absolved the medieval order of heresy .
The Vatican work reproduces the entire documentation of the papal hearings convened after King Philip IV of France arrested and tortured Templar leaders in 1307 on charges of heresy and immorality .
According to the Vatican archives website , the parchment shows that Clement initially absolved the Templar leaders of heresy , though he did find them guilty of immorality , and that he planned to reform the order .
However , pressured by King Philip ( who threatened schism ) , Clement later reversed his decision and suppressed the order in 1312 .
Jacques de Molay , grand master of the Templars , was burned at the stake in 1314 along with his aides .

They do n't claim to know who 's been naughty or nice , but some Houston charities are asking whether children are in the country legally before giving them toys .
In a year when more families than ever have asked for help , several programs providing Christmas gifts for needy children require at least one member of the household to be a U.S. citizen .
Others ask for proof of income or rely on churches and schools to suggest recipients .
The Salvation Army and a charity affiliated with the Houston Fire Department are among those that consider immigration status , asking for birth certificates or Social Security cards for the children .
The point is n't to punish the children but to ensure that their parents are either citizens , legal immigrants or working to become legal residents , said Lorugene Young , whose Outreach Program Inc. is one of three groups that distribute toys collected by firefighters .
“ It 's not our desire to turn anyone down , ” she said .
“ Those kids are not responsible if they are here illegally .
It is the parents ' responsibility . ”
The idea of a charity turning away children because of decisions made by their parents unsettled some immigration activists .
“ It is very disturbing to think a holiday like Christmas would be tainted with things like this , ” said Cesar Espinoza , executive director of America for All , a Houston - based advocacy group .
“ Usually , people target the adults because the adults made the decision to migrate , where the children are just brought through no fault of their own . ”
Other groups do n't require specific documentation , relying instead on outside groups to recommend families .
“ When you distribute toys to 10,000 to 12,000 kids , it 's impossible to background ( check ) every child , ” said Fred Joe Pyland , a Houston police officer who oversees the Blue Santa program .
Blue Santa does n't consider immigration status but collects names from police officers , schools and churches .
Those who do check immigration status or other qualifications say they are trying to ensure they make the best decisions about whom to help .
“ We want to be good stewards , so the people that are donating to us trust we 're going to do the right thing , ” said Sonya Scott , manager of care ministries at West Houston Assistance Ministries .
The group does not check immigration but requires identification , including birth certificates for children , and proof of income .
It has registered 686 children to provide with gifts this year , up from 613 last year .
At the Salvation Army , 30,000 children have registered for the Angel Tree program , which allows children to request the gifts they want most .
That 's up 20 percent from last year , spokesman Juan Alanis said .
Gifts for all children
Alanis and Young say they will serve families if the children are here legally , regardless of the parents ' status .
The Salvation Army provides gifts for all children in the family if one sibling is a citizen .
The Outreach Program requires parents to show photo identification and birth certificates or Social Security cards for the children .
Young said she makes an exception if parents can show they have applied for legal status or that a child is enrolled in school .
Alicia
White , a spokeswoman for the Fire Department , said it is up to each group distributing toys to decide how to do so .
The other groups giving out toys collected by firefighters — Catholic Charities and the Hispanic Firefighters Caucus — do not ask about immigration status .
Participants in the Houston Chronicle 's Goodfellows toy drive were selected by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission , chosen from those with children between the ages of 2 and 10 who receive food stamps , Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid .
People who are n't legal residents do n't qualify for those services , but others in their household may .
Pre-registration closed
Most local toy drives are no longer accepting applications , although the Outreach Program does n't pre-register recipients , so families needing gifts for their children will line up Dec. 23 at 1305 Benson .
One of the season 's first big toy distribution events will be Saturday at the George R. Brown Convention Center , when 2,520 children from 63 area elementary schools will be treated to gifts by Navidad En El Barrio .
Israel Gomez , a retired Houston police officer who runs the program , said the kids are asked to donate one can of food .
Navidad En El Barrio draws participants from schools with a high percentage of students who qualify for free lunches .
For programs that select recipients themselves , deciding what documentation to require can be tricky .
Alanis said the Salvation Army traditionally has required photo identification and proof of income and legal residency to ensure help reaches those most in need and to prevent people from registering at multiple Salvation Army locations .
Catholic Charities does n't ask for proof of income or immigration status .
But it does require identification and birth certificates to ensure people actually have the number of children they claim , spokeswoman Julissa Guerrero Chappell said .

Just one day after a very public denial that American forces were in the process of attacking sites in Northern Yemen , President Barack Obama ordered multiple cruise missile attacks on sites across the tiny , coastal nation .
The air strikes were coordinated with the government of President Ali Abdallah Saleh and the attacks left 120 killed , many of them civilians according to witnesses .
President Obama called Saleh after the attack to “ congratulate ” him on the killings .
The Yemeni government denied any US role in the attacks , despite American officials ’ admissions .
This is largely in keeping with the Saleh government ’s policy , as they angrily denied reports of Saudi attacks in the north as a myth even as the Saudi government was giving a press conference detailing the attack .
One Yemeni official however claimed that a local al - Qaeda “ deputy ” named Mohammed Saleh Mohammed Ali Al - Kazemi was slain , and that “ scores ” of al - Qaeda members were killed in the assorted attacks .
The conflict with al - Qaeda is just one of many conflicts currently going on in Yemen , including an enduring separatist movement in the south and an increasingly violent insurrection in the Shi’ite north .
Technically Wednesday ’s State Department denials appear to have been accurate , as the missile strikes were in a completely unrelated conflict from the one they were accused of taking part in .
Nativity Featuring Sexy Characters Draws Criticism
Madison clothing store has created a very eye - catching window display – a nativity scene that has some sexual nature on it , KTLA News reports .
The store , located at W. 3rd Street and Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles , has featured a nativity scene where the Virgin Mary is scantily clad and sprawled on the ground .
The baby Jesus styled in golden glitters is on her lap .
The three wise men do not look wise at all but rather sexy–bringing gifts , apparently from the store , to the “ holy family . ”
A woman looking at the display said , “ The way they have presented Mary in a very provocative position with a baby in her crotch , and that baby is supposed to be Jesus … No . ”
People made criticism , calling the display risque .
A group is asking the store to change it immediately and vowed that they will go to every church in the area to get support for the removal of the unusual nativity scene if the store refuses .
Those of us who follow the career of Weekly Standard writer and ex-journalist Matthew Continetti have noticed that he enjoys parroting the line taken by his boss , Bill Kristol .
For example , Kristol will go on television and mouth some Republican talking point , and then a couple of days later , Continetti will echo the sentiment .
( An alternate theory is that they receive talking points from the same source ) .
Anyway , a few days ago , Kristol wrote a blog post lauding Joe Lieberman 's healthcare obstructionism ; Kristol concluded with some pathetic brown - nosing :
Reid tried to throw a Hail Mary .
It looks as if Lieberman has broken up the pass .
But there will be more Hail Mary 's to come -- and a massive assault from the left on the principled and responsible Lieberman .
After reading this I wondered how long it would take for Continetti to bravely second his boss .
Later that same day , Continetti wrote a blog post about healthcare that ended with this cheesy prediction : " It may all come down to Scoop Jackson 's heir . "
But now there is more .
In a new Weekly Standard piece ( portentously titled " The Power of One : The Return of Joementum " ) , Continetti has this to say :
Lieberman has displayed the courage and independence necessary to tell his party it's on the wrong track .
In 1998 , he pointed out that President Clinton 's affair with an intern was a moral transgression that deserved rebuke .
From 2006 to 2008 , when Democratic politicians and commentators ran away from an Iraq war that was going badly , Lieberman stuck with his principles and backed the surge of troops and counterinsurgency strategy that has put Iraq on the ( bumpy ) road to normalcy .
Lieberman 's reward was a left - wing primary challenge in 2006 that succeeded in depriving him of the Democratic nomination .
Running as an independent , he nevertheless won the general election .
In doing so , he became even more free to do what 's right regardless of political calculation .

Az idei válságos időszakban milliószámra szűntek meg a munkahelyek , és a recesszió nem kímélte meg az IT - szektort sem , most viszont úgy tűnik , beindul a lelassult világgazdaság , és megnő a befektetési kedv is .
Az IT Job Board jelentése szerint a következő esztendő meghozza a várt fellendülést , s a vállalatok derűlátása javítani fog a munkanélküliségi rátán is azáltal , hogy végre nem elbocsátásokat fognak bejelenteni a cégek , hanem új állásokat hirdetnek meg .
A piackutatók prognózisában az áll , hogy kivételesen sok programozó , telekommunikációs és biztonsági szakember fog tudni elhelyezkedni 2010 - ben .
S a bankszektor is ébredezni látszik csipkerózsika álmából , ugyanis a pénzintézetek végre kezdik belátni , hogy a takarékossági intézkedések következtében meggyengült biztonsági rendszerükön egyre több és nagyobb rés tátong , amiket jövőre profi hálózati specialistákkal és technikusokkal akarnak majd befoltozni - állítja Peter Healey , a Job - Board igazgatója .
A kutatás szerint a szoftverfejlesztő ágazat és a telekommunikációs iparág is feloldja a megszorításokat , és ezen területeken is tömegével fogják alkalmazni az IT - seket .

A Maryland woman lost her accounting job after a background check performed through the FBI 's criminal database indicated , erroneously , that she was unsuitable for the job , according to the Baltimore Sun .
Eschol Amelia " Amy " Studnitz had been working for Corporate Mailing Services since August 2008 as a senior accountant .
Last July , after CMS won a contract to handle mail for the Social Security Administration , the administration performed a routine background check on Studnitz and other CMS employees , who needed a low - level security clearance to work on the contract .
The SSA subsequently sent CMS a letter stating that the background check showed Studnitz was " unsuitable " to work on the contract .
The SSA letter did n't say what the background check had uncovered .
Rather than simply keep her off the contract , CMS decided to fire Studnitz .
The company gave her just a few minutes to leave its offices .
Studnitz maintained that she had no criminal history and , indeed , the only court record the Baltimore Sun was able to uncover on her was a civil case related to a $ 11,676 judgment that a nursing home had been awarded in 2005 .
Studnitz told the paper this actually involved a suit against her late father 's estate .
About two weeks later , the Social Security Administration sent a letter to CMS backing her claim of innocence .
The letter said Studnitz had passed a pre-screening check and could work on the SSA contract pending a final determination .
It made no mention of the previous letter that claimed she was unsuitable .
That should have settled the matter .
But instead of reinstating her in her job , CMS told her to re-apply for her position .
After she did so , the company wrote back saying it was reorganizing the department and would get back to her .
The company finally sent her a letter last week saying it had no intention of restoring her job .
The company claimed it had uncovered some problems that would be " detrimental " to her performing her job successfully .
The company said she had failed to process some invoices or bill customers at new rates after they 'd been raised .
Studnitz has disputed the claims .
Studnitz has since learned that an unspecified error in the FBI 's National Criminal Information Center database was the cause for the SSA 's initial determination that she was " unsuitable .
The NCIC database is a repository for criminal records and information on fugitives , stolen property and missing persons .
Information is fed to the database from local , state .
and federal law - enforcement agencies around the country .
Canada uses the database to refuse border entry to anyone with a criminal record .
Studnitz is now considering a lawsuit .
Since losing her job , she has not been able to find a new position anywhere .
She has fallen behind on her mortgage payments and recently received a shut - off notice from her local utility company .

Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) said there was broad agreement on their side of the aisle about how to create jobs by aiding small businesses and boosting infrastructure spending .
Pelosi said she thinks on those issues , " it 's possible for us to find some common , bipartisan ground .

"

" And the president wants to blame us for informing the American people about what 's happening here and how it will affect them , but it 's not what we 're doing ; it 's the policies that they 're promoting here in Washington . "
The Republicans presented a letter to Obama detailing how they think he should approach job creation , including by way of tax cuts and trade expansion .
For his part , Obama also expressed hope that Republicans would support him on his proposals , particularly on items like a one - year elimination of the capital gains tax that the GOP has supported in the past .
" It 's appropriate that I met with leaders of both parties , " Obama said after the meeting .
" Spurring hiring and economic growth are not Democratic or Republican issues .
They are American issues that affect every single one of our constituents . "
The president noted Republican opposition to his $ 787 billion stimulus package , but he said he hopes that he will get some GOP support for his attempts at job creation .
" It 's no secret that there 's been less than full bipartisan support for the recovery act and some of the steps that have broken the free - fall of our economy , " Obama said .
" But my hope is that as we move forward we can do so together , recognizing that we have a shared responsibility to meet our economic challenges on behalf of all Americans : those who elected us to make sure that we 're doing the people 's business . "
Despite the GOP opposition , Democratic leaders seemed optimistic they can move quickly on a jobs bill that contains much of what the president outlined in a speech Tuesday .
Reid declined to say when a jobs bill might come up in the Senate , but he said after Tuesday night 's " breakthrough " on healthcare reform that he does think the Senate will pass a healthcare bill before lawmakers leave for Christmas .

After some gentle fiscal stimulus , these countries are on track for strong growth next year .
The IMF forecasts that gross government debt among advanced economies will continue to rise until 2014 , reaching 114 % of GDP , compared to just 35 % for developing nations .

Ghosts hover nearby as he works , Mr. Wong said , invisible beside the family members who gather at this reverse funeral , but he says he knows the spirits well by now and is not afraid .
Mr. Wong ’s exhumations are part of a redefinition in much of Asia of the concept of burial .
This is a continent where ancestors are revered and their graves are places of worship , but where sheer numbers are straining funeral traditions .
With a population that is expected to rise by 40 percent , to 6.5 million , over the next half century , Singapore illustrates the growing scarcity in Asia of a fundamental resource , land .
In China , where arable land and urban space are in high demand , ground burial is prohibited in most of the country , although exceptions are made if a fine is paid .
“ Space is so tight that something has to give , ” said Lily Kong , director of the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore , who has studied funeral practices .
“ And that means a shift throughout the region to crematoria and columbaria . ”
But even the columbaria are now filling up , and residents in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan are resisting the construction of new ones in their neighborhoods , she said .
“ Essentially , it is a spatial competition between the living and the dead . ”
Given this increasing demand , slots in columbaria have become real estate investments in Singapore , with companies promoting block purchases and zero- interest payment plans .

There is no WebKit on Mobile
Last week I spent a lot of time on WebKit in order to produce a comprehensive comparison of all WebKits .
My purpose was to prove there is no “ WebKit on Mobile , ” and to gain some more insight in the complicated relations between the various WebKits .
Therefore I now present the Great WebKit Comparison Table .
In it I compare 19 different WebKits on 27 tests .
Senior web thinkers from Alex Russell to Tim Bray have envisioned a bright new future for the mobile web based on the argument that “ WebKit on Mobile ” is taking over , and that , with browser incompatibilities out of the way , developers can concentrate on building compelling web applications .
Much as I hate to disagree with them , I feel honour - bound to point out that there is no “ WebKit on Mobile . ”
There ’s iPhone WebKit , Android WebKit , S60 WebKit ( at least two versions each ) , Bolt , Iris , Ozone , and Palm Pre , and I do n’t doubt that I ’ve overlooked a few minor WebKits along the way .
All 10 mobile WebKits I ’ve identified so far are subtly or wildly different .
Media queries , especially , which are the most important single technique for creating consistent interfaces across inconsistent devices , have wildly differing support levels .
And Acid 3 scores range from a complete fail to 100 out of 100 .
This is not consistency ; it ’s thinly veiled chaos .
Therefore , testing all your mobile web applications and sites in several WebKits will remain mandatory for the time being .
The tests
Most of the tests in the new table are taken from my existing compatibility tables .
It contains golden oldies , such as the dynamic problems in the + selector and : first - child , cutting - edge JavaScript methods such as querySelectorAll ( ) , and a few new HTML5 functionalities such as geolocation and localStorage .
My main criterion for test inclusion was that a certain method , property , or declaration must be supported by at least two WebKits , but not by all .
I made an exception for geolocation , since it ’s so totally crucial for the mobile platform .
( Geolocation is currently supported only by iPhone 3.1 )
I tested three Safari versions , three Chrome versions , one Konqueror version ( with a newer one hopefully coming up ) , the 10 mobile WebKits I mentioned above , and at the request of Vodafone I added the JIL Emulator ( it's an Android G2 except that it supports media queries ) .
Emulators are not allowed ( except for the JIL one , which does n’t claim to emulate any existing browser ) .
Few mobile browser vendors will take the trouble to port their browser to Windows or Mac .
Instead they ’ll opt for an already - existing WebKit on those platforms ; probably Safari .
However , as the tests show , Safari is wildly different from all mobile WebKits .
Therefore emulators are not to be trusted .
Note that I only test for compatibility .
Other factors , notably user interface and performance , are left out of the equation — and that may have to be corrected in the future , seeing that S60v3 WebKit , which is by far the worst - scoring one , at least has a workable user interface , something that much - higher scoring WebKits such as Iris do n’t .
I devised a scoring system .
I ’m not 100 % certain that this is a good idea , but I desperately needed an automated method to judge WebKits .
Details are on the page .
With the scoring system in place I created a script that does a bit of basic data mining in trying to establish the number of differences between WebKits as well as an exact list of those differences .
The results were surprising :
Out of 19 tested WebKits , no two are exactly the same .
The best WebKit available is Safari 4 ; the worst is S60v3 .
The Android G1 and G2 WebKits score rather badly ; it ’s the worst mobile WebKit except for S60 .
Regressions are fairly common : iPhone 3.1 , Android G2 , and S60v5 all ( partially ) dropped support for something their predecessors did support .
The closest relation of a desktop WebKit to a mobile WebKit is between Safari 3.0 and S60v5 .
I ’m now fairly certain S60v5 is actually based on Safari 3.0 .
Unfortunately this is the single example of such a close relation .
All in all I hope that this research shows that there are many flavours of WebKit , and that “ WebKit taking over the mobile space ” does not equate “ there are no more browser differences . ”
( Besides , let ’s not forget Opera , shall we ? )

Silent Night : The Story of the World War I Christmas Truce
By Stanley Weintraub
The Free Press , 2001
206 pages
It was the war that was supposed “ to be over by Christmas ” .
It very nearly was .
A spontaneous soldiers ' truce broke out along the Western Front on Christmas Eve 1914 , four months after the start of hostilities .
“ Peace on Earth ” , “ goodwill to all men ” — British , French and German soldiers took these usually hypocritical Christmas sentiments for real and refused to fire on the “ enemy ” , exchanging instead song , food , drink and gifts with each other in the battle - churned wastes of “ no - man 's land ” between the trenches .
Lasting until Boxing
Day in some cases , the truce alarmed the military authorities who worked overtime to end the fraternisation and restart the killing .
Stanley Weintraub 's haunting book on the “ Christmas Truce ” recounts through the letters of the soldiers the extraordinary event , routinely denigrated in orthodox military histories as “ an aberration of no consequence ” , but which was , argues Weintraub , not only a temporary respite from slaughter but an event which had the potential to topple death - dealing governments .
With hundreds of thousands of casualties since August from a war bogged down in the trenches and mud of France , soldiers of all countries were tired of fighting .
There had already been some pre-Christmas truces to bury the dead rotting in “ no - man 's land ” but these truces had needed the approval of higher authority .
“ Soon ” , however , “ few would care about higher authority ” as an unauthorised and illegal truce “ bubbled up from the ranks ” .
The peace overtures generally began with song .
From German trenches illuminated by brightly lit Christmas trees would come a rich baritone voice or an impromptu choir singing Silent Night ( Stille Nacht ) .
Other carols and songs floated back and forth over the barbed wire .
A German boot tossed into the British trenches exploded with nothing more harmful than sausages and chocolates .
Signs bearing “ Merry Christmas ” were hung over the trench parapets , followed by signs and shouts of “ you no shoot , we no shoot ” .
The shared Christmas rituals of carols and gifts eased the fear , suspicion and anxiety of initial contact as first a few unarmed soldiers , arms held above their heads , warily ventured out into the middle to be followed soon by dozens of others , armed only with schnapps , pudding , cigarettes and newspapers .
The extraordinary outbreak of peace swept along the entire front from the English Channel to the Switzerland border .
Corporal John Ferguson , from the Scottish Seaforth Highlanders shared the pleasant disbelief —
“ Here we were laughing and chatting to men whom only a few hours before we were trying to kill ” .
Uniform accessories ( buttons , insignias , belts ) were swapped as souvenirs .
Christmas dinner was shared amongst the bomb craters .
A Londoner in the 3rd Rifles had his hair cut by a Saxon who had been his barber in High Holborn .
Helmets were swapped as mixed groups of soldiers posed for group photographs .
Some British soldiers were taken well behind German lines to a bombed farmhouse to share the champagne from its still intact cellar .
Soccer matches were played in " no - man 's land " with stretchers as goal posts .
Races were held on bicycles with no tyres found in the ruins of houses .
A German soldier captivated hundreds with a display of juggling and magic .
“ You would have thought you were dreaming ” , wrote captain F.D. Harris to his family in Liverpool .
The high command ordered the line command to stop the fraternisation .
Few line officers did or could .
The truce momentum could not be arrested .
Deliberate or accidental breaches of the tacit truce failed to undermine it .
Stray shots were resolved by an apology .
If ordered to shoot at unarmed soldiers , soldiers aimed deliberately high .
Sergeant Lange of the XIX Saxon Corps recounted how , when ordered on Boxing Day to fire on the 1st Hampshires , they did so , “ spending that day and the next wasting ammunition in trying to shoot the stars down from the sky ” .
By firing in the air , as the sergeant noted with approval , they had “ struck ” , like the class - conscious workers they were in civilian life .
They had had enough of killing .
Fear of fraternisation
Military authorities feared fraternisation — a court - martial offence , punishable by death , it weakens “ the will to kill ” , “ destroys the offensive spirit ” , saps “ ideological fervour ” and “ undermines the sacrificial spirit ” necessary to wage war .
It was politically subversive — A bas la guerre !
( “ Down with the war ! ” ) from a French soldier was returned with Nie wieder Kreig !
Das walte Gott !
( “ No more war !
It ’s what God wants ! ” ) from his Bavarian counterpart .
After “ mucking - in ” with British soldiers , a German private wrote that “ never was I as keenly aware of the insanity of war ” .
Soldiers reasserted their shared humanity — Private Rupert Frey of the Bavarian 16th Regiment wrote after fraternising with the English that “ normally we only knew of their presence when they sent us their iron greetings ” .
“ Now ” , we gathered , “ as if we were friends , as if we were brothers .
Well , were we not , after all ! ” .
If ordinary soldiers acted on these sentiments , a big danger loomed for governments and the ruling class .
If left to themselves , the soldiers would have been home from the shooting war by Christmas all fired up for the class war at home .
As Weintraub says , “ many troops had discovered through the truce that the enemy , despite the best efforts of propagandists , were not monsters .
Each side had encountered men much like themselves , drawn from the same walks of life — and led , alas by professionals who saw the world through different lenses ” .
Even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , the Sherlock Holmes creator , who had turned from jingoistic imperialism to spiritualism after the death of his son in the war , shot an angry glance to military and civil authority — “ those high - born conspirators against the peace of the world , who in their mad ambition had hounded men on to take each other by the throat rather than by the hand ” .
Brass desperate to restart war
The high command on both sides were desperate to restart “ the war that had strangely vanished ” .
Replacement troops with no emotional commitment to the truce were rushed in .
The 2nd Welsh Fusiliers who had not fired a shot from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day were relieved without notice , an exceptional practice .
Sometimes threats were necessary — when German officers ordered a regiment in the XIX Saxon Corps to start firing and were met with replies of “ we can't — they are good fellows ” , the officers replied “ Fire , or we do — and not at the enemy ! ” .
To prevent further spontaneous truces after 1914 , the British high command ordered slow , continuous artillery barrages , trench raids and mortar bombardments — immensely costly of lives but effectively limiting the opportunities for fraternisation for the rest of the war .
To discourage others , conspicuous disciplinary examples were made of individuals .
For organising a cease - fire to bury the dead , which was followed by half an hour of fraternisation in “ no - man 's land ” with no shooting for the rest of Christmas Day 1915 , Captain Iain Colquhoun of the 1st Scots Guard was court - martialled .
Merely reprimanded , the message was nevertheless clear for career - minded British officers .
Tougher medicine was needed when French soldiers refused to return to the trenches at Aisne in May 1917 — 3427 courts - martial and 554 death sentences with 53 executed by firing squad were necessary to crank - start the war on this sector of the French front .
Repression from above won the day against the Christmas Truce of 1914 but it was the lack of soldiers ' organisation from below that stifled the potential for turning the truce into a movement to stop the war .
On the eastern front , on the other hand , fraternisation and peace were Bolshevik policy and in Germany , it was mutinies by organised sailors and home - based soldiers , which finally put paid to Germany 's war effort .
Weintraub has resurrected a beautiful moment in history , made all the more beautiful in the darkness of the carnage that was to follow when four more years of war took the lives of 6000 men a day .
Far from a “ two - day wonder ” , the Christmas truce “ evokes a stubborn humanity within us ” .
As folksinger John McCutcheon put it in his 1980s ballad Christmas in the Trenches , the war monster is a vulnerable beast when the common soldier realises that “ on each end of the rifle we 're the same ” .
[ From Green Left Weekly , February 13 , 2002 . ]
Global climate change has prompted efforts to drastically reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas produced by burning fossil fuels .
In a new approach , researchers from the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science have genetically modified a cyanobacterium to consume carbon dioxide and produce the liquid fuel isobutanol , which holds great potential as a gasoline alternative .
The reaction is powered directly by energy from sunlight , through photosynthesis .
The research appears in the Dec. 9 print edition of the journal Nature Biotechnology and is available online .
This new method has two advantages for the long - term , global - scale goal of achieving a cleaner and greener energy economy , the researchers say .
First , it recycles carbon dioxide , reducing greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the burning of fossil fuels .
Second , it uses solar energy to convert the carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel that can be used in the existing energy infrastructure , including in most automobiles .
While other alternatives to gasoline include deriving biofuels from plants or from algae , both of these processes require several intermediate steps before refinement into usable fuels .
" This new approach avoids the need for biomass deconstruction , either in the case of cellulosic biomass or algal biomass , which is a major economic barrier for biofuel production , " said team leader James C. Liao , Chancellor 's Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UCLA and associate director of the UCLA - Department of Energy Institute for Genomics and Proteomics .
" Therefore , this is potentially much more efficient and less expensive than the current approach . "
Using the cyanobacterium Synechoccus elongatus , researchers first genetically increased the quantity of the carbon dioxide - fixing enzyme RuBisCO .
Then they spliced genes from other microorganisms to engineer a strain that intakes carbon dioxide and sunlight and produces isobutyraldehyde gas .
The low boiling point and high vapor pressure of the gas allows it to easily be stripped from the system .
The engineered bacteria can produce isobutanol directly , but researchers say it is currently easier to use an existing and relatively inexpensive chemical catalysis process to convert isobutyraldehyde gas to isobutanol , as well as other useful petroleum - based products .
In addition to Liao , the research team included lead author Shota Atsumi , a former UCLA postdoctoral scholar now on the UC Davis faculty , and UCLA postdoctoral scholar Wendy Higashide .
An ideal place for this system would be next to existing power plants that emit carbon dioxide , the researchers say , potentially allowing the greenhouse gas to be captured and directly recycled into liquid fuel .
" We are continuing to improve the rate and yield of the production , " Liao said .
" Other obstacles include the efficiency of light distribution and reduction of bioreactor cost .
We are working on solutions to these problems . "
The research was supported in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy .
FIRE MARSHALS ARRESTED a self - proclaimed " honorary firefighter " for allegedly touring the country with pilfered FDNY gear to promote a 9/11 book , officials said yesterday .
Michael Bellone , 51 , of Brooklyn , who volunteered at Ground Zero and later collaborated on a book about the experience , showed off the equipment during speeches to schoolchildren , authorities said .
After fielding complaints , FDNY investigators questioned Bellone and discovered that a breathing mask , air tank and other gear he was using had been missing from the department since October 2001 , officials said .
He was charged yesterday with grand larceny , criminal impersonation and possession of stolen property .
Mr. Bellone was a burly nightclub bouncer from Brooklyn with training as an emergency medical technician when he went down to the Pit ( sic ) .
Except for some Saturday nights back at the club where he worked , he said he spent virtually all of the next nine months at ground zero .
That was an interesting , if stupifying hour of TV .
One noticeable point was that there was almost no advertising during the episode , which presumably reflects the controversial nature of the show .
Jesse quickly clads himself in the old " I 'm just asking questions for the family members , " armor .
Donna Marsh O'Connor appears and actually seems normal .
Compare and contrast her appearance then with this from 2006 :
One can feel sorry for her while at the same time recognizing like five years later she should not be appearing at a rally with the 9 - 11 fruitcake " Inside Job " banner behind her .
Sorry , Donna , but you and Bob McIlvaine ( who appears later ) have sold your credibility as 9 - 11 family members for the adulation of the Troofers .
Next up , Willie Rodriguez .
Hilariously , Jesse claims Willie worked in WTC - 2 .
Wow , way to fact check your stuff , guys .
We get W - Rod 's claim that he felt the explosion from below him .
Never mind that his initial reports were that he heard a big rumble , remember ?
Then comes Steven Jones .
This time his substance is " superthermite " ; it 's been nanothermite , thermite and thermate in the past .
It 's liquid and can be painted on the steel .
So they show poor Van Romero painting superthermite on this beam .
And we see that while the unpainted beam did not catch fire , the painted beam did seem to light up .
But will it fail structurally ?
Well , no kidding they skip right over that part .
Apparently the idea that the steel caught on fire , however briefly , is enough to convince Jesse that this was how they did it .
And nobody stops to mention that the claim is that they destroyed columns ( vertical ) not beams ( horizontal ) , and that we have n't seen the beam actually destroyed in the video by any means .
It 's another TrutherBurn fiasco !
Jesse makes it real by claiming it could be everywhere , in every highrise in the country .
Because , you know , there are never any fires in highrises which would ( according to the theory ) suddenly and bizarrely implode due to that painted - on superthermite .
We get a little bit of Manny Badillo , who has basically supplanted Luke in the hierarchy of the 9 - 11 Troofers although Rudkowski does get to be in the background of the shot .
I guess being the nephew of a victim gives Manny a little more credibility than being the boyfriend of a girl who used to go out with a guy whose father died on 9 -11 .
Jesse decides to stride into Ground Zero and get some samples of steel .
Uh , Jess , it 's been eight years , we have no steel samples here .
We get the usual BS about how the steel was shipped out immediately .
No mention of the Fresh Kills dump where everything was examined .
And oh , does he step completely into the sewer , from here on in .
I can't imagine how the supposedly responsible Truthers are going to take this .
Jesse goes north to Syracuse to talk to phony Bellone .
We learn helpfully from Jesse that Flight Data Recorders ( FDRs ) are yellow - striped .
And at this point you 've got to wonder if somebody 's really throwing us all a wink , because ( as is shown several times during the show ) actually FDRs are orange .
Anyway , Mike Bellone is a discredited witness , but you 'd never know that from the extensive face time he gets in this episode .
Let 's let the NY Daily News give it to us straight :
But do we hear any of this during the breathless passages of smirk - terviewing that follow ?
No , Mike 's a hero of 9 - 11 , and so what he says must be true .
Never mind that Bellone also claimed in his speeches to schoolchildren that he was an honorary FDNY member , never mind this :
At any rate , Bellone claims that he personally saw one Flight Data Recorder , and that " Nick " ( generally identified as Nicholas DeMasi ) told him he found two others .
As you would expect , Jesse grills him on his claims .
Uh , no , Jesse looks like he 's amazed at this .
Wow , you went all the way to Syracuse to interview this guy in a diner and you did n't have any idea what he was going to tell you ?
Jesse , I knew what he was going to say .
So now the 9 - 11 Truth Movement is the " what happened to the black boxes movement . "
Because fully half of the show becomes Jesse on the trail of the FDRs , and leads to the show 's climactic moment , when we learn Jesse 's new conspiracy theory about 9 - 11 .
When one of the producers questions the value of the black boxes , an obviously scripted bit comes with the black British woman snapping about how it might explain how these lousy pilots could hit the buildings .
Yawn , how many times do we have to go over the same points ?
The towers were 210 feet on a side , wider than an average runway .
After some forgettable bits with other idiots , we go back to Bellone .
He 's got secret people who want to meet with Jesse to give him important 9 - 11 information .
But they do n't show up for the meeting and Bellone says they feel threatened and shut off the camera .
Then he tells them something confidential off - camera .
Ooooh , mysterious !
Do I detect foreshadowing ?
Then we get Jesse leaving a message on some supposed informant 's voice mail about how the " Truth shall set you free " .
Gawd , this is getting thick !
Later , back at Conspiracy Central , the question comes up , is Mike telling the truth ?
And once again , they fail to mention Bellone 's problems in that regard .
Then we get some bit with Jesse talking to a NY FBI agent .
Jesse tries the " no steel structure " argument .
They get some sort of quote from the poor guy about how the feds indeed sometimes do things surreptitiously , just as Jesse did when he was in the SEALs .
Of course Jesse nods at this part .
And now , back to phony Bellone !
You did n't think we'd leave the show without one last revelation from him , did you ?
Well , I 've been covering the 9 - 11 Truthers for about 3 - 1 / 2 years now , and I 've never heard this one before .
Bellone claims to have evidence that the " hijackers " had control of Flight 11 before it left Logan Airport .
Wow .
I 'm flabbergasted at the pathetic nature of this episode .
Even the guy who 's supposed to be the skeptic ( Alex Piper ) should be ashamed of his participation in this ridiculous fraud .
Update :
Let me add here that while Bellone 's claims are laughable , according to this NY Times piece , he really did work on the pile :
But he also claimed to have been an " honorary FDNY " which proved to be false , and his claims on Jesse 's show were a joke .

A month of the Hurd : initial work on network device drivers in user space , GRUB 2 .
This month Zheng Da , our former Google Summer of Code student working on network virtualization and some related topics , published the code for the pcnet32 device driver that he had modified to run as a user - space process instead of inside the kernel , and posted some preliminary performance benchmark results .
The test results are mostly on par with the in - kernel driver , so they show that moving the lower - layer parts of the networking stack , the device drivers themselves , into user space can be done without losing ( much ) performance .
Given this encouraging start , work is going on to explore whether the Device Driver Environment that has been created for L4 - based systems can be used for providing GNU / Hurd systems with device drivers that ( a ) are more recent than our current ones , ( b ) support classes of devices that we do n't support so far , and ( c ) are running as ( possibly separate , fault - isolated ) user - space processes .
Thanks to Samuel Thibault , the latest Debian GRUB 2 package ( 1.97+20091130 - 1 ) supports native installation from GNU / Hurd itself -- booting GNU / Hurd systems with GRUB has always been working , but until now it was n't possible to install GRUB from a GNU / Hurd system .
GNU GRUB has originally been written for booting GNU / Hurd systems , so this step completes its original purpose .
Samuel also continued to work on preparing the Xen branch of GNU Mach for being merged with the mainline code , and he fixed a kernel panic in the kernel 's floating point support code .
According to an article by Chris Isidore of CNNMoney.com , a vast majority of economists expect that the United States Federal Reserve will keep its overnight lending rate â€ “ to which many home equity and credit cards interest rates are tied â€ “ near 0 % through 2010 and into 2011 .
Obviously , this is great news for those of us to have any loans tied to the Federal Funds rate , since lower rates obviously mean lower ( required ) monthly payments .
It is assumed that this decreased interest stress on consumers will help to spur more consumer and business spending .
Since consumer spending accounts for nearly three - quarters of the U.S. GDP , this could ultimately be the thing that brings our economy completely out of â€ œThe Great Recession.â€ 
Unfortunately , keeping rates this low has for what will likely be close to two years , has a negative impact on two fronts :
It hurts those who depend on interest from their money market and savings account as income , for example , many retirees .
Not only are many consumer loans pegged to the Federal Funds rate â€ “ as stated above â€ “ but so too are most interest bearing savings accounts .
So , as long as these rates are low , people who depend on this income will have to learn to get by with little to no margin for surprise expenses .
It fosters long - term inflation due to the increased availability of money in the economy .
Currently , with the credit crunch still having lingering effects , inflation has been relatively tame .
However , since many of the extraordinary efforts to keep the country â€ “ and the world for that matter â€ “ out of a depression have been centered around pumping massive amounts of money into the economy , there is a very good chance we will all face very strong inflationary pressures once the economic rebound solidifies .
Based on the current view of economists , it appears that the Federal reserve would rather wait for inflationary pressures to come to fruition before raising rates as opposed to risk raising rates too early and undoing all of the work theyâ€™ve done so far .
Iâ€™m torn on when rates should start to increase , although , Iâ€™m currently leaning towards wanting them raised sooner rather than later .
When do you think rates should start to climb ?
Leave your thoughts below .

She blocked his number and got a restraining order to keep him from telling his side of the story .
I have n't talked to my dad for six years because of this .

For decades , depleted uranium ( DU ) has been the material of choice for anti-tank projectiles – despite a series of controversies about its potential health hazards .
But for the near future , at least , the U.S. military will keep on using DU .
Alternatives based on tungsten have n't panned out .
Now , the Army is upgrading to a new 120 mm Advanced Kinetic Energy round , and about the only thing we know for sure is that it will be made of DU .
The generation after that … may be an improved version of DU called Stakalloy .
Kinetic rounds are slim metal darts fired from tanks like the MAA1 Abrams at very high velocity .
The preference for DU is not based , as some conspiracy theorists would have it , on a diabolical scheme to dump nuclear waste in developing countries .
It 's because in addition to its high hardness and density , it has a property called adiabatic shear banding .
Essentially , DU is crumbly rather than squishy .
During the process of high - speed penetration through metal armor , fragments flake off a DU projectile .
This means that a DU projectile is " self - sharpening " ( compared to tungsten , which tends to deform in a blunted , mushroom shape . )
It also means that DU produces a pyrophoric effect , filling the vehicle hit with a lethal fireball of tiny burning particles .
That too makes it more effective than tungsten .
For many years , the Pentagon has been researching alternatives to DU , most notably Darpa 's " Liquidmetal " initiative on amorphous tungsten .
This is a " glassy metal " without a crystalline structure which is very hard and shows the right kind of behavior under extreme stress .
However , there still appear to be difficulties with producing large amorphous - tungsten penetrators .
Darpa was n't able to comment on the current state of the amorphous - tungsten research effort .
However , Peter Rowland , spokesman for the Army 's Armament Research , Development and Engineering Center ( ARDEC ) was able to give a categorical statement : Tungsten still plays second fiddle to depleted uranium .
" At present , there is no tungsten alloy or other material that provides armor penetration performance as good as DU , " he told Danger Room .
" For some time , there have been efforts to continually improve the performance of tungsten alloys , in an effort to achieve performance comparable with DU .
Thus far , DU remains superior . "
This is why the requirement for the new Advanced Kinetic Energy round specifies that it must be made of DU .
It should also be mentioned that the idea of tungsten being introduced as a " clean " alternative to " dirty " DU took something of a knock when it was found that military - grade tungsten alloy is highly carcinogenic in rats .
A 2007 Department of Defense memo advised considering alternative materials to tungsten in munitions developments .
Pure tungsten is not carcinogenic , and amorphous tungsten would be very different to existing applications , but this might be a difficult one to sell to the media .
Meanwhile , research continues into improving the performance of depleted uranium penetrators .
From the earliest days of uranium processing , natural uranium was known as Tube Alloy ( from " Tube Alloys " , a codename for the Manhattan Project ) , while enriched uranium was Oralloy ( " Oak Ridge Alloy " ) and the depleted remnant was known as Staballoy .
Staballoys containing DU with a small admixture of titanium ( from 0.75 percent to 3.5 percent ) have been the basis of anti-tank rounds for decades .
However , now researchers are experimenting with a new version , known as Stakalloy , which combines uranium with niobium and vanadium .
This is said to have improved hardness and ballistic properties compared to traditional uranium - titanium Staballoys .
In 2007 , the Army requested the processing of " U - V - X Alloy Ingots , " described in the solicitation as Stakalloy .
The document noted that " previous development work over the last few years at Aerojet for the Army Research Laboratory ( ARL ) has produced new alloys with interesting properties and test prototypes for ballistic evaluation at ARL . "
The idea was to find the best method of turning the ingots into " full - scale kinetic - energy penetrators . "
( A two - stage quench process is suggested to prevent cracking . )
A detailed description of the new Stakalloy can be found in the patent for it .
Stakalloy , incidentally , is named after its inventor , Dr Michael Staker .
Peter Rowland stated that the Stakalloy was not being considered for the new Advanced Kinetic Energy round , but left the future wide open .
" There is no way of predicting whether the performance of tungsten alloys or some other alternative material will ever approach that of DU , or if the penetration performance of DU itself can be further improved , " he said .
It 's possible that a viable alternative to depleted uranium will emerge in the next few years .
But – at least from an engineering perspective – the advantage is all with DU .
Whether it remains politically acceptable is another matter .

Alfa Romeo can't go any lower – click above to watch the video
Years ago , we read a book by Jerry Mander called Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television .
While we can't remember the four arguments , we 'll never forget one point Mr. Mander made .
" People in advertising are either good at controlling peoples ' minds , or they enjoy it . "
With that said , it looks like Alfa Romeo hired a bunch of people that enjoy controlling folks ' minds , but are n't very good at it .
What are we talking about ?
Alfa is selling its sexy little 147 for less than € 15,000 ( circa $ 21,600 USD ) with a tagline , " We Could n't Go Any Lower . "
To prove that mantra , they decided to go ahead and lower a billboard more than 36,000 feet down into the Marinas Trench .
If you do n't know , the Marianas Trench is the absolute lowest point on earth , more than seven miles below sea level ( actual depth is 11,034 meters , or 36,200 feet ) .
And Alfa Romeo just dropped a billboard into it .
We do n't know about you , but we had a pretty visceral reaction to this video .
From the self - satisfied , spiky - haired , twenty - something Euro - boy ad men to the fact that they actually went ahead and stuck a billboard in the Marianas Trench , the whole thing feels wrong and sits wrong with us .

Eben Moglen has sent a letter to the EU Commission essentially in support of Oracle / Sun : A top legal expert on open - source software has told European antitrust regulators holding up Oracle Corp 's $ 7 billion purchase of Sun Microsystems that their analysis of the deal is partly flawed ....
" The issues raised ( by the commission ) concerning the GPL v2 status of the MySQL code base do not warrant a conclusion that this transaction threatens significant anti-competitive consequences , " Moglen told EU regulators in a Nov. 19 letter .
Moglen writes that the GPL was designed to be effective no matter who owns the copyrights .
So the world 's expert on the GPL has just told the Commission that the so - called analysis of the GPL by Florian Mueller and Monty Widenius , which apparently influenced the Commission heretofore , is full of beans .
A lot of people do n't understand the GPL , of course .
But between Eben Moglen and anyone else on the planet , if you do want to understand it , Moglen is who you would ask .
Would you like to see the email that Mueller is sending around in response to this latest event ?
Hold your nose .
Florian takes it ad hominem : I just saw a Reuters piece on " activist lawyer " Eben Moglen concerning the merger :
http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSN0310376420091203
Some comments ( please feel free to quote as you see fit ) : Compared to Richard Stallman he 's very unimportant in a GPL context because Richard really founded the movement and developed the concept , Richard is the giant on whose shoulders a lot of people stand and the best ones of those admit that this is the case while some midgets try to deny that fact .
I met Eben Moglen in 2004 to talk about a legislative process in the EU on software patents and back then it was already clear that he had a GPL - centric not market - oriented agenda .
I disagreed with his approach back then ( a year later I became the European Campaigner of the Year with my approach ) and so I do now .
I also got the impression at the time that he was primarily interested in obtaining funding ( at the time from MySQL , on whose behalf I met with him ) for some initiatives of his ( at the time " patent busting " , a pretty pointless approach that never got anywhere but some lawyers made some money with it ) .
He is now probably just afraid of a possible license change away from the GPL to another open source license entering the remedies discussion , something that I do n't propose anyway because a divestiture would be the only approach that entirely eliminates the competition concerns identified .
I am wholeheartedly convinced that the Commission has perfectly understood all GPL - related issues and the fact of the matter is that if Oracle buys MySQL on the current basis , it will get as much control over an open source project as money can possibly buy .
That 's why there are serious competition issues .
Florian
Is n't that disgusting ?
Blow his own horn much ?
Moglen " unimportant in a GPL context " ?
Moglen is the lawyer who has been enforcing the GPL since 1994 .
He served * without fee* as General Counsel for the FSF during that time , until he founded the Software Freedom Law Center .
He led the revision process for GPLv3 .
Yes , that means he * wrote * it , with input from the world .
There is literally no one who understands the GPL legally any better than he does .
Guess who Richard Stallman contacts if he has a legal question about it ?
Yes .
Exactly .
Back when MySQL was in litigation with Progress Software in 2002 ( Progress Software Corp. v. MySQL AB , 1st Cir. , No. 02-1402 , which you can read about here ) , guess who MySQL asked to explain to the court how the GPL works ?
Yes .
MySQL asked Eben Moglen .
He provided a declaration to the court to explain the GPL .
MySQL did n't ask Florian Mueller to do that .
It asked Moglen , because he is the world expert on the GPL , not Mueller , and MySQL knew it very well .
So for Mueller to slyly denigrate Moglen 's role , as if he were a know - nothing money - grubbing lawyer with an imagined private agenda and no real importance in a GPL context is absurd and factually inaccurate .
There is no way for Mueller to truthfully claim to know more than Moglen about this subject matter .
Happily , I 'm sure the EU Commission knows that .
Now the community needs to ask , what kind of " community representative " would say what has been said by Mueller and his group about the GPL and now about Moglen ?
What 's their real angle and who are they really representing ?
Who benefits from such statements ?
The community ?
You ?
Me? The GPL ?
Microsoft ?
SAP ?
( There 's a little water under that bridge . )
Who ?
I think there are enough clues now on the table to draw a pretty good map .
I am deeply angered , speaking personally , to have someone pretending to represent community interests to the EU Commission misrepresent the GPL and make factually untrue statements .
In the future , how seriously will the Commission take complaints from the FOSS community , do you think ?
It is , in my estimation , a misuse of the good reputation built by genuine representatives of the FOSS community , like tridge and the ethical SAMBA team during the EU Commission 's antitrust litigation against Microsoft .
Mueller 's group * did * propose a license change away from the GPL in their filings with the EU Commission .
I 've read them [ PDF ] .
They called the GPL " a source of infection " and a barrier to commercial interests .
I am shocked that Mueller would say otherwise now .
They absolutely did ask for a license change as a remedy , as the EU Commission knows .
This is a public repudiation by Moglen of Mueller 's analysis of the GPL by someone who certainly knows a great deal more about it than he does .
And it 's very timely .
The commission will be holding a hearing on the Oracle / Sun deal on December 10th in Brussels .
Here 's the Software Freedom Law Center press release , and here is the letter [ PDF ] .
The press release : The Software Freedom Law Center Submits an Opinion on the Oracle / Sun Merger to the EC
Urges Regulators to Have Faith in GNU GPL New York , NY ( 12/03/09 ) : The Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) submitted an independent opinion to European Union regulators to consider in the ongoing merger approval investigation of Oracle 's acquisition of Sun Microsystems .
Eben Moglen , the founder and executive director of the SFLC and a leading expert in free software law , sent a letter to the commission on November 19 responding to portions of the Commission 's Statement of Objections , issued on November 9 , concerning the GNU General Public License Version 2 ( GPLv2 ) and MySQL .
At Issue The Commission 's Statement of Objections argues that MySQL currently imposes " a competitive constraint " on Oracle 's pricing and marketing of its flagship Oracle 11 database product .
The Committee 's statement views the GPLv2 as an inadequate protection of the rights of non-Oracle parties to freely improve and redistribute MySQL .
Moglen believes the Commission has underestimated the robustness the GPL has consistently demonstrated over the past 18 years .
" The GPL was designed specifically to ensure the permanent freedom of software , and the ability of everyone to improve and share their improvements to the program , no matter who acquires the copyrights to the code , " Moglen said of the argument he presented to the Commission .
" The whole point of GPL as a copyright license is to deal with every contingency that could result in hobbling or destroying the freedom of code shared under it .
The drafters of GPL versions 2 and 3 considered scenarios very similar to the ones that the Commission is concerned about now .
The design of the license , and the experience we have had using it , show that it can be counted upon to operate as intended in situations like this one . "
Historical Perspective Programs released under the GPL , including Linux , Samba , and the GNU Compiler Collection , have continually proven to be resistant to anti-competitive conduct in the marketplace .
" GPLd programs competing effectively against offerings of the richest and most powerful monopoly in the history of information technology have resisted the efforts of the monopolist to find a chink in its armor , " Moglen writes .
Moglen and the SFLC issued their opinion , pro bono publico and without fee , at the request of Oracle 's counsel ; it has been incorporated in Oracle 's response to the Commission 's Statement of Objections .
A hearing on the Objections , and Oracle 's response , is scheduled to occur in Brussels on December 10 .
Oracle is a donor to the Software Freedom Law Center , which has also received donations from other parties with diverse views on the merger , and on the future of MySQL .
For disclosure of all relevant details , please consult the text of the opinion .
The PDF is available here .
And here 's a relevant section of the letter to the EU Commission , but do read the original for footnotes and further details : 8 . I have no knowledge of Oracle 's business plans or intentions , and I have no comment on the Commission 's assumption that Oracle experiences " competitive constraint " as a result of MySQL 's existence as free software .
I nonetheless believe that the Commission 's analysis overlooks both general and specific reasons why acquisition of existing centralized copyright in MySQL is not in fact the threat to competition that the Commission is concerned about .
9 . GPLv2 and GPLv3 are copyright licenses engineered by their makers to ensure the free flow of ideas and improvements to software regardless of who holds the copyrights .
The underlying purpose of the GNU General Public License ( which we now all abbreviate GPL ) was to enable diverse developers to collaborate on the long - term construction of an entire computer operating environment ( which Richard Stallman dubbed " GNU " ) that would preserve its own freedom no matter who came into ownership of the code from a legal point of view , and no matter what their commercial motives were with respect to it .
10 . The " copyleft " properties of GPLv2 and GPLv3 have proved themselves enormously robust over the last twenty years .
Since the promulgation of GPLv2 in 1991 , the technical , commercial and development environment surrounding GPL'd software has changed profoundly .
Firms with business models directly hostile to the " free software " idea pioneered by Richard Stallman have directed substantial adversary attention to the GPL .
GPL 'd programs competing effectively against offerings of the richest and most powerful monopoly in the history of information technology have resisted the efforts of the monopolist to find a chink in its armor .
At the same time , the copyleft 's friendliness to large - firm business models has attracted other IT giants such as IBM and Hewlett - Packard to the value of supporting the development and distribution of projects that cannot be deployed with proprietary improvements or restrictions , sharable by all users and improvers .
11 . MySQL is now and always has been an atypical GPL software project , because its copyright was highly centralized inside a small commercial firm that considered dual licensing its only commercially attractive strategy for survival .
But even MySQL AB 's atypical business model , which was highly unreflective of the mass of GPL'd software development , occurred within the parameters of the GPL 's overall design , which is to ensure the freedom of the software it protects regardless of the commercial motivations or behaviors of the parties distributing the primary upstream version .
12 . The Commission 's analysis underestimates the distinctive operation of GPL 's copyleft under market conditions , arriving at conclusions that insufficiently distinguish between the real - world behavior of GPL'd software communities and those operating under " permissive " open source licenses such as BSD or Apache .
13 . The SO contains , for example , substantial analysis of the history and commercial prospects of PostgreSQL as a possible competitive constraint on Oracle ( 714-728 ) .
The Commission observes that development resource for the commercial exploitation of PostgreSQL has been divided among numerous ventures .
Projects under GPL , on the other hand , precisely because they do not permit proprietary enhancement , channel the investments of interested parties into an ecologically sounder pattern , in which technical innovation occurs throughout the project , rather than concentrating on the points of attachment for proprietary add - ons or feature modules .
14 .
For this reason , other basic infrastructure components of modern computer systems ( operating system kernel , C compiler , shared file system protocol implementation , networking stacks , and web content management systems ) used by industry and commerce have tended to emerge from the GPL 'd commons , where both firms and non-firm actors have been able to collaborate in confidence that their improvements would not be proprietized by other , more powerful or less ethically motivated parties .
Linux , GCC , and Samba , with all of which the Commission is familiar from other investigations , are examples of the superior resistance of the GPL 'd commons to fractionation of effort or misallocation of resources .
15 .
As another example , I think the SO ( 759 ) may be mistaken in asserting that only the permissive nature of the Apache Software License enables the close collaboration between IBM and the Apache Software Foundation .
IBM has also collaborated on equally close terms with projects and project clusters under GPL , including for example its leading role in the Free Software Foundation 's GCC Steering Committee , which is backed by an effort of IBM's Linux Technology Center involving dozens of IBM programmers directly paid to work on the compiler and its toolchain ; or IBM 's very significant efforts to enhance and improve the utility of the Linux kernel for a variety of hardware , including the IBM S/390 mainframe architecture .
In that last case , as early as 2000 , IBM completed at great expense and solely using dedicated IBM resources , a port of the Linux kernel , C Library , and toolchain for this proprietary IBM architecture , and then donated all copyrights to the Free Software Foundation .
16 .
In general , we think of free software projects in ecological rather than purely commercial terms , because the breadth of possible contributors to technical innovation in free software far outstrips the number of venture capital - funded small firms likely to play a role .
Such firms do have an important role in the development of free software assets , but their economic health is a product of , rather than a producer of , the overall health of the commons to which they contribute .
GPL and MySQL 17 .
For these reasons , the Commission 's analysis of the probable consequences of Oracle 's acquisition of the MySQL copyrights seems to me to overlook important elements in the model of competition appropriate to sketching the future of the commons at stake here .
The Commission assumes that both the technical structure of MySQL itself and the structure of firms and non-firms contributing to its growth must be in the future more or less what it was in the past .
But MySQL 's technical and commercial history is a product of the originating firm 's perception that it required dual license revenue , not a necessary condition of its future .
18 . " Storage engines , " for example , are much discussed in the SO , under the impression that it is a virtue of MySQL that it is designed around replaceable storage engines , which the SO asserts can only be created and implemented by venture - funded firms needing proprietary distribution opportunities in order to recoup development costs .
This , I think , is a misunderstanding of the technical history .
MySQL 's design was an outcome of the need for dual - license revenue , not a pre-condition to it .
PostgreSQL , for example , does not have or need multiple storage engines : it contains a single highly - configurable storage manager which is not independent of the database engine .
MySQL 's use of multiple storage engines resulted from MySQL 's need to have something to sell dual - license customers different and better than that provided to users under GPL .
The resulting uncertainty that could arise over whether a table had been created using a transaction - safe storage engine or by the original freely - available MyISAM storage engine contributed to the problem with occasional corruption of MySQL databases that was long a primary drawback to the enterprise use of MySQL .
MySQL AB contemplated and designed a single multi-purpose high - performance storage engine , named Falcon , that would have substantially replaced all existing MySQL storage engines , but the business - model consequences of that step were sufficiently negative for MySQL AB , because of its need to produce dual - license revenue , that the project was never completed .
19 .
Similarly , MySQL experienced great difficulty in creating a vibrant ecology around the program , because the perceived need for dual - license revenue meant that MySQL AB believed it could not afford to accept any third - party code contributions unaccompanied by copyright assignment , because without 100 % ownership of the copyrights in the base code , it could not provide OEM or " commercial " licenses to users who were frightened of or ignorant about GPL .
By late in the independent history of MySQL AB , before the acquisition by Sun Microsystems , the firm was actively seeking to expand the scope of its unaffiliated developer community , but was hampered in doing so by the need to retain entire control over copyright in order to maintain the dual - licensing business .
20 .
The SO raises ( 663 ) the question of third - party storage engines under non-GPL license being combined with MySQL under GPL .
The SO states that " for third - party storage engines aimed at specific market segments a business model based on code under the GPL is often not sustainable . "
21 .
In the narrowest sense , the SO 's question can best be answered by saying that under limited circumstances , a non-GPL storage engine could be combined with MySQL by a dual - licensing commercial producer .
Under GPLv2 , distribution with MySQL of a non - free storage engine designed to work only with MySQL would be infringement of the MySQL copyright unless permitted by the copyright holder .
But a storage engine that actually qualified as a separate and independent work -- either because it worked with other database server engines or because it could perform useful work standing alone -- could be distributed separately and combined with MySQL by end users without violating the license .
See GPL v2 section 6 . This would be a conceivable business model for a dual - licensing storage engine manufacturer .
When distributed along with MySQL , only the GPL version of such a storage engine could be provided without violating the license , but separate and independent works separately distributed would not have to be licensed under GPL .
Innobase could have explored such a business model itself , before its acquisition by Oracle .
InnoDB could be used as a storage engine for other data , besides MySQL database tables , standing alone .
Innobase could therefore have provided an enhanced version of InnoDB , like Oracle 's current InnoDB + , under non-GPL license , for end users to replace on a plug - in basis in their MySQL installations .
22 . The SO proceeds under the assumption that a non-dual - licensing model for the distribution of specialized storage engines would not be commercially viable for a small or nascent firm .
But the diversity of GPL - surrounding business models actually observable in the market suggests that this assumption is hasty , and probably incorrect .
GPL 'd programs can support a diverse ecology of surrounding commercial enterprises .
CodeSourcery , for example , has since 2004 sustained itself commercially with specialized libraries and toolchain improvements to be used with GCC under GPL in a license compliant fashion that end - users combine with their GPL'd GCC installations to improve compiler performance for specialized hardware or in niche applications .
A storage engine developed for MySQL to be used under GPL , accompanied by tuning tools , monitors and other supplementary software under non-free license would be an equivalent and entirely GPL - compatible model for a growing software house .
A highly specialized storage engine meant for niche application use would generate not large - scale service obligations requiring high levels of personnel and large initial outlays , but rather highly precise expert consulting services , such as are added to the R statistical computing environment by firms such as REvolution Computing , XL Solutions , and Random Technologies .
Niche delivery of specialized versions of R , still under GPL but at very high prices surrounded by tools enabling multiprocessing clustering of very large scale statistical computation by , inter alia , pharmaceutical manufacturers , have been discussed in the public press .
This too is a feasible non-dual licensing model for a storage engine producer under GPL capable of adding additional tools in niche environments .
23 .
These and other similar examples that could be provided broaden somewhat the available information bearing on the risks and rewards of supplementing MySQL under GPL for small or nascent software firms .
The SO states ( 663 ) that " the one precedent in this regard " is NuSphere ( Progress Software ) v. MySQL .
The SO concludes that " This precedent illustrates why any third - party provider of a storage engine for MySQL that does not exclusively rely on the GPL itself will be wary to conduct business without a commercial relationship with MySQL 's owner . "
But this conclusion is based on a misunderstanding of the factual setting of that dispute .... 29 . MySQL is not now distributed under the " pure " GPLv2 .
Both MySQL AB and Sun provided a " linking exception " to permit MySQL client libraries to be linked into applications programs not released under GPL .
Sun broadened somewhat the FOSS license exception , to allow any program released under a major FOSS license , whether or not compatible with GPL , to link with the client libraries distributed under GPL .
Sun put substantial marketing stress on the encouragement of free downloads of the GPL'd MySQL product , because it had a diversified line of hardware , software , and systems integration services to offer customers , and realized that it did n't need MySQL OEM licenses to pay for all the development and support of MySQL itself .
30 .
In this context , I am surprised to find nowhere in section 4.7 of the SO a mention of Microsoft SQL Server in relation to the MySQL ecology .
Whether or not MySQL is a significant " competitive constraint " on the selling of Oracle 11 , MySQL is an effective , indeed potentially lethal competitor for the much less powerful Microsoft product .
For Sun , and a fortiori for Oracle , the rather scant dual - license revenue available from MySQL , or the long - term negative consequences from competition between MySQL and the top - drawer product line , must be significantly outweighed by the value of GPL'd MySQL , available at near - zero price , as a formidable competitor against Microsoft 's only database offering .
Scenarios of Possible Oracle Anti-Competitive Conduct and the Resulting GPL Dynamics 31 .
From the ecological perspective most useful in analyzing the consequences of potential anti-competitive conduct in a GPL 'd commons ( a form of analysis familiar to me from my work as chief legal drafter of GPLv3 -- an activity which required countless exercises in scenario definition and analysis in order to optimize the terms of GPLv3 - - and from my daily work with my colleagues at the Software Freedom Law Center in considering potential legal threats to and responses by our clients , many if not most of whom employ GPL v2 or GPLv3 ) there are three possible courses of conduct that could be engaged in by an acquireror of MySQL 's copyrights against which GPL might need to provide .
I am content that in each of the three scenarios it is difficult or impossible for a party in possession of the copyrights and associated legal privileges effectively to extinguish the free competitor .
The SO analytically conflates the three possible courses of action .
Clear specification of each makes the analysis simpler .
32 .
In the first scenario , which is referred to in SO at 736 and 754 , Oracle decides to " abandon " MySQL , ceasing to provide either maintenance or enhancements .
Because , as the SO notes , all parties agree that there would be no restriction on other parties copying , modifying and redistributing MySQL code , Oracle could not thereby require the forced migration of users from MySQL to its own products ( a scenario common to the proprietary database market , as when Oracle purchased PeopleSoft or IBM purchased Informix in order to acquire their users ) .
Given the free software nature of MySQL , the result of such a step by Oracle would effectively be to make a very expensive present to HP , IBM , and any other companies who wanted to make marginal investments in ensuring the longevity of this " competitive constraint " on Oracle .
33 .
In this scenario , the SO 's long estimate of the time necessary for a " fork " to gain acceptance and compete advantageously would be reduced to zero .
A large existing user base requiring support and willing to pay for it would constitute a guaranteed market , and the subsidy provided by Oracle through the effective abandonment of a fully - functional and popular codebase could be expected to attract both firm and non-firm developers .
Aside from making poor use of the investments of Oracle shareholders , abandoning a GPL'd project is an outstandingly poor way to prevent it from competing against the owner who abandons it .
34 .
In the second scenario , Oracle does not abandon the existing MySQL user base , nor does it invest in enhancing MySQL , but it does everything possible outside the realm of the GPL to discourage community development efforts that might make MySQL more competitive with Oracle 's own products .
( See SO at 766 ) It promulgates a trademark policy that prevents any modified version of MySQL from using the name .
It threatens enforcement of its patent claims against any modified versions of MySQL .
It inhibits development of third - party software to interoperate between MySQL and Oracle databases , etc. 35 .
In this possible course of events , Oracle tests all non-copyright mechanisms , which lie outside the scope of the GPL , to burden the commons .
Experience shows that the trademark attack is likely to fail .
Popular free software programs with large personal as well as enterprise install bases have been denied use of their " brands " in the past .
GAIM was denied use of its name by AOL and became Pidgin ; Phoenix became Firebird became Firefox , which in turn denied use of its name to the Debian browser version now known as Iceweasel .
Lawyers for free software projects have learned that name changes are of minor concern to projects substantially based around commons production , and that trademark forms a poor way to restrict commons development .
36 . Patent aggression against modifiers of one 's own GPL 'd programs is also difficult or impossible .
The breadth of the implicit patent license under US patent law extends , according to the cases , to " repair " as a limited form of " making . "
So maintenance to a product distributed under GPL by third - party maintenance providers is unlikely to result in patent liability for either the provider or its customers , who can always download another GPL'd copy from the patent - holding upstream copyright owner and apply third - party patches themselves .
Oracle , I am sure , is well aware that suing one 's customers is a poor business model .
37 .
In this connection , I would be more cautious about the legal conclusion reached in SO 765 , involving the example of feature Z , placed in a copy of a GPLv2 MySQL distributed by Oracle , and then reimplemented a second time , elsewhere in the MySQL codebase by a subsequent modifier .
The conclusion drawn may be correct under one or more patent systems , but in my own , I am doubtful .
If , for example , we were talking about a literal copy of the patent - covered code duplicated from one portion of the codebase to another , I very much doubt that the second invocation of the same code could be patent infringing , while the first is covered by implicit license .
In any event , the implicit license is to use the patent claims , and it is hard to see how the license to use could fail to cover both copies .
Whether the provision of a second literal copy of the code constituted " making , " would I suppose hinge at most on whether the code was actually duplicated , or was turned into a subroutine called from more than one location .
In any event , I would not expect the threat of such a patent infringement action to be taken seriously by any US party engaged in modifying the code .
38 . I should also note an error in the legal analysis of the consequences of Oracle 's putative decision " ensuring that the code cannot be acquired under [ GPL ] anymore from the moment the transaction is completed . "
SO 766 .
Under GPLv2 any party distributing the code commits to automatic issuance of a new license , from itself to any party to whom a copy is distributed .
GPL v2 section 6 . In this scenario then , contrary to the conclusion of the SO , all recipients of the code from anyone , regardless of the continued availability of that code from Oracle , receive automatically a copyright license to the code , from the copyright holder , which conveys the same implicit patent license as though the code were acquired directly from it .
39 .
For these and other reasons , a decision by Oracle to keep MySQL nominally alive as an Oracle product but to actively discourage commons co-development is likely to fail .
It would require investments , produce little revenue , abandon an opportunity to cause disproportionate competitive harm to Microsoft , and it would irreparably damage Oracle 's standing with the free and open source software communities on which it will be inclined to cooperate over other assets , including OpenOffice , OpenSolaris , and Java , which it has acquired from Sun Microsystems and in which it is also already significantly invested .
Such a course is therefore neither rational nor likely to be successful , and I think it is reasonable to predict that it is not going to be tried .
40 .
The third significant possible course of conduct is that Oracle might progressively proprietize MySQL , by adding features , including features affording heightened interoperability with Oracle databases , only to customers buying commercial licenses , while meagerly enhancing the free version and refusing to integrate third - party contributions .
( See SO at 733 , 736 and 772 ) 41 .
This strategy is not unknown for firms in more or less complete control of the copyright for commercially significant free software products .
But accumulated experience indicates that it usually works poorly .
Many redistributors and users believed , for example , that Sun Microsystems itself essentially practiced such a strategy with respect to OpenOffice .
Sun had its own proprietary version of the Star Office suite available under commercial license , it had sold to IBM the right to produce another proprietary version under the Lotus Symphony name , and downstream free software redistributors found it extremely difficult to get patches into the official OpenOffice.org distribution under Sun control .
42 .
The result was a de facto fork under the management of Novell .
Go-oo.org , and the Novell Edition of OpenOffice ( which like OpenOffice are LGPL licensed works , though like all LGPL licensed programs they can also be distributed under GPL ) , show the comparative ease with which other firms with a commercial interest in free software programs can counteract a perceived " go slow " development approach by a copyright holder with conflicting commercial interests .
43 .
The OpenOffice situation is one reason among many to doubt the conclusion reached by the SO ( 760 ) that " in fact , a fork of a major piece of software that is available under the GPL with a view to create a commercially successful product against the wishes of the project ( and copyright ) owner has never happened . "
Two of the Free Software Foundation 's most significant and commercializable projects , GCC and GNU Emacs , have historically forked against the Foundation 's wishes .
The EGCS fork of GCC eventually rejoined GCC , while Lucid Emacs , now known as XEmacs , remains a separate development path with a codebase that cannot be merged with GNU Emacs as a result of their long genetic separation .
Samba , a GPL 'd project with whose commercial value the Commission is well - acquainted , was forked by Luke Leighton to create Samba - TNG .
The Joomla !
content management system , a more recent example , forked from the parent Mambo CMS in 2005 , and now has almost entirely eclipsed the parent project .
This is one reason to distrust the expertise of Microsoft in opining on GPL - related issues , rather than relying upon it , as the SO does ( 758 ) in concluding that " Linux is the only commercially viable software product that is distributed exclusively under the GPL . "
44 .
The goal of GPL is to create development ecosystems , in which diverse parties with diverse commercial and non-commercial interests interact on a basis of guaranteed trust to achieve results unattainable by individual firms or even business models standing alone .
GPL 's success in achieving its design objectives lies in the elegance with which its basic rules align the incentives of commons participants and reduce the benefits of defection .
The GPL ruleset has enabled competitors and cooperators to produce collectively all sorts of specialized software while resisting the various strategies for appropriating the commons .
The MySQL ecosystem never attained maximum strength , precisely because the dual - licensing business model of MySQL AB forced it to turn away community resources available for the program 's improvement .
Far from being a challenge justifying a further weakening of the ecosystem , by replacement of the GPL by a permissive license for example , the Oracle acquisition of the MySQL copyrights could be the occasion for a significant strengthening and broadening of the community .
45 .
The crucial issue is not the license under which MySQL is distributed , although GPLv3 might be preferable to GPL v 2 if one were writing on a clean slate .
Rather , the central issue is an increase in the copyright diversity of the project , in which multiple parties have significant code in the main line .
This would be sufficient to prevent anyone having an exclusive right to make proprietary enhancements or to undertake distribution under non-free licenses .
While it is unlikely that Oracle will in the short term decide to incorporate third - party copyrighted modifications into the Oracle base product , thus terminating its dual - license business opportunities , in the long run the cost of maintaining two MySQL source trees ( one for GPL and one for commercial versions ) is more than the dual - license business is worth , particularly since the GPL branch in its wholly - owned source trees must be prepared to compete with any third - party GPL 'd modified version that might be supported by Novell , Red Hat , Ubuntu , and other distribution vendors , as well as IBM , HP , and other systems companies .
Conclusion 46 .
The analysis presented by the SO contains a number of legal and factual judgments about which there seems to me sufficient basis for doubt .
The primary judgment to be made , as the SO says , is whether there would be " sufficient " development and distribution alternatives , assuring the continued vitality of MySQL .
( 731 )
In my view , the SO unduly emphasizes some of the aspects of the situation and undervalues others .
The general design of GPL and the robust diversity of business models and non-firm development ecologies it creates seem to me the central sources of doubt .
Secondary concerns arise from the places where the analysis seems to me to rest on legal conclusions that are unestablished or factual assertions made by others to the Commission which are demonstrably incorrect .
47 .
In my view , the SO reaches an incorrect conclusion in supposing that GPL itself provides insufficient protection against anti-competitive conduct by a copyright holder in Oracle 's putative position .
All scenarios likely to result from Oracle 's acquisition of the copyrights , whatever Oracle 's business intentions may be , are tolerable from the point of view of securing the freedom of the codebase , which is the primary concern of the communities I represent .
48 .
Further measures for the security of the software 's freedom are possible .
The improvements to GPL 's effect introduced in GPL v3 would be of some additional value .
Incorporation of third - party contributions in the version of MySQL distributed by Oracle - - which in my view it is likely Oracle will find it desirable to accept in the medium term , as its own experiences of the benefits and drawbacks of dual licensing for a wealthy and diversified firm lead it to choose its own business direction -- would provide further security for the health of the MySQL ecosystem , taking it beyond any point reachable by the original MySQL AB given the scale of its resources .
Without expressing any opinion on any other aspect of the Commission 's ongoing merger investigation , I believe that the issues raised concerning the GPL v2 status of the MySQL codebase do not warrant a conclusion that this transaction threatens significant anti-competitive consequences .
Update : Brian
Aker has now written a blog post , giving further support to one point in particular that Moglen makes , that the GPL protects the code no matter what the copyright owner wants later , by offering examples :
When MySQL was concerned about the Oracle acquisition of Innodb , it looked into alternative engines .
One of the engines we looked at was the Gemini Engine .
Why did we look at it ?
Since Progress had open sourced their engine we had the option to use it .
An option that history has shown was never needed , since Oracle has continued to develop Innodb .
It was an option though , and we looked at it .
We had that right .
As another example , when Galbraith left MySQL , development of the Federated engine collapsed .
When it became impossible for him to provide back contributions to the engine because of his lack of employment to MySQL , what happened ?
He forked Federated to create FederatedX , which is still developed and distributed today .
Even though the version of Federated has remained nearly static in the main tree for years , his version continues to be enhanced .
When Monty and David changed the license on the MySQL network drivers from public domain to GPL , the PHP project and Redhat continued to distribute the public domain version for years ( I believe Redhat still does ) .
The entire concept of taking what has been made publicly available , and somehow removing it from the commons is inane .
It makes me think about how American Society of Composers , Authors & Publishers tried to sue the Girl Scouts for singing songs around the campfire .
Once the tune is in your head , it stays in your head .
Once software has been published under an open source license , it continues to be available , whether its current owners wish it to be or not .
By the way , please notice particularly Moglen 's paragraph 38 , because it succinctly describes SCO 's doom , so far as its copyright infringement claims go , even if it were to win the copyrights at trial , because it itself distributed all the code at issue under the GPL : 38 .
I should also note an error in the legal analysis of the consequences of Oracle 's putative decision " ensuring that the code cannot be acquired under [ GPL ] anymore from the moment the transaction is completed . "
SO 766 .
Under GPLv2 any party distributing the code commits to automatic issuance of a new license , from itself to any party to whom a copy is distributed .
GPL v2 section 6 . In this scenario then , contrary to the conclusion of the SO , all recipients of the code from anyone , regardless of the continued availability of that code from Oracle , receive automatically a copyright license to the code , from the copyright holder , which conveys the same implicit patent license as though the code were acquired directly from it .
CBS has formally agreed to air its second Strikeforce event in April , Sherdog.com has learned from an executive within the major network .
A specific date and venue has not been decided , though numerous locations are currently being scouted from coast to coast , according to the executive .
Fedor Emelianenko and Dan Henderson are expected to appear on the card , said the CBS source .
Henderson , a top - five ranked middleweight , left the UFC to sign a four - fight 16 - month deal with Strikeforce on Dec. 5 .
Sherdog.com has learned that Henderson is being strongly considered to challenge middleweight champion Jake Shields in his promotional debut in April .
Both fighters ’ camps told Sherdog.com on Tuesday that they ’re open to the possibility of the matchup , though no official talks have begun with the promotion .
Strikeforce “ Fedor vs. Rogers ” earned favorable ratings for CBS when it aired in its “ Saturday Night Fights ” slot on Nov. 7 from the Sears Centre Arena in Hoffman Estates , Ill .
The event reached 4.04 million homes to take the coveted Men 18 - 34 timeslot and peaked during the main event between the world ’s No. 1 heavyweight and Rogers with 5.46 million viewers , making it the ninth most watched live fight in U.S. history .
Mark
Twain once said , " Get your facts first , then distort them as much as you please . "
By contrast , he also exclaimed , " How empty is theory in the presence of fact ! "
This pretty well covers the recent controversy over the altered global temperature data from Dr. Jones at East Anglia University in Great Britain .
What are the facts ?
Well for starters , scientists at the Smithsonian Institution tell us that during what is known as the Medieval Optimum , the Vikings were growing grapes in Greenland .
An agronomist at Virginia
Tech suggest that if you are planning to start a vineyard , the roots of the vines cannot be exposed to temperatures below 25 oF or the vine will die .
Even though there were no thermometers at the time of Eric the Red , this gives us a benchmark for reference .
There are no vineyards in Greenland today because it is too cold .
In fact , the Smithsonian reports that there is evidence which supports the theory that the Viking colonies later collapsed as a result of a dramatically cooling climate .
Other facts seem to stand stubbornly in the way of the global warming theory .
Paleoclimatological records show that after the last ice age -- about seven thousand years ago -- the climate on earth reached a very warm period ( much warmer than now ) known as the " climatic optimum , " which resulted in green pastures covering what is now the Sahara Desert in Africa .
This fact contradicts the popular mantra from former Vice President Al Gore that we are warmer now than ever before .
Geologists tell us that the earth 's climate has changed many times from hot to cold and back again .
The prevailing theories are that over the last billion years , there have been at least four major ice ages .
Since the end of the last ice age , we have been in what these climatologist say is an interglacial period .
In English , this means that the planet has not yet transitioned to a climate of either beach balls or snow balls .
But what about the curve balls in ClimateGate ?
The swirling controversy concerns the infamous e-mails about the Jones global temperature data set .
The recent e-mails published on the internet suggest that the data was deliberately modified to reach a preconceived conclusion .
This data was used in the reports generated by the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which has concluded that Carbon Dioxide ( CO 2 ) causes global warming by absorbing infrared radiation .
The vast majority of the report documents the measured increase in CO 2 .
The report also represents climate change model predictions as " evidence " of the effects of this increase in CO 2 .
Climate models are computerized forecasting aids , not evidence .
Atmospheric chemists will tell you CO 2 is a trace gas in the atmosphere and is measured in parts per million .
It seems a bit of a stretch that the tail can wag the dog , especially when CO 2 absorbs such a narrow portion of the infrared spectrum .
According to Dr. Fred Singer of the Science and Environmental Policy Project , the global climate change models cannot " hindcast " known climatic changes such as the Medieval Optimum , when good , vintage , homegrown wines could be enjoyed in Greenland .
As forecasters at the National Hurricane Center will tell you , if a model cannot hindcast , it can not be relied upon for a forecast .
Could it be that the data was tampered with to agree with the global climate models ?
Is this an isolated incident of over - pressured scientists caving in to temptation ?
Well , the cracks in the global warming theory began appearing as far back as 1998 .
Dr. Sallie Baliunas published a study that linked global temperature fluctuations to solar activity .
This theory is not a new one , but meteorologists have been very reluctant to accept this theory because the physical connection has been hard to determine .
Dr. Baliunas suggested that solar wind was the physical connection .
Dr. Baliunas was maligned by many scientists among the global warming crowd in an attempt to discredit her work .
More recently , Dr. Bill Grey of Colorado State University claimed that the university had cut his funding for hurricane research because of his outspoken opposition to the global warming theory .
Even NASA has been caught making exaggerated claims .
Late in 2008 , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies reported that October 2008 was the hottest on record .
They " corrected " the statement after two meteorologists caught the " error " in the data and posted their findings on the internet .
Another " error " was admitted by the National Snow and Ice Data Center when they under - reported the amount of polar sea ice in the northern hemisphere .
It seems they had a " sensor drift " which prevented the detection of ice coverage of more than 190,000 square miles -- roughly an area the size of California .
Mr. Gore insists that the debate on global warming is over .
With so many questions concerning the validity of the data , how can anyone believe this ?
John Adams once said that " facts are stubborn things . "
But we need to establish the facts concerning the data before the debate can begin .
Thousands of women appear to be using the internet to share sexual fantasies of abuse involving children .
An investigation by The Independent on Sunday found a series of websites that depict female - perpetrated child abuse as " natural , educational and enjoyable " for children .
Users log into online forums to meet other " like - minded " web users and to share personal childhood experiences about sexual acts with adults that they say include mothers , teachers and babysitters .
User profiles on one website monitored by the IoS claimed to be those of teachers , doctors and retired grandmothers with an interest in " young girls " and " lesbian incest " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The postings on such sites – assuming they are not posted by men – run counter to the widely held belief that female abusers are either anomalies or feel forced into such depravity by abusive men .
Many of the users appear to have easy access to children and describe deriving sexual gratification from sharing their fantasises .
The discovery comes just days before three women are due to be sentenced for a range of sexual offences involving children .
Vanessa George , a nursery school teacher and mother of two , and Angela Allen , a single mother , were part of an online paedophile ring uncovered last summer after police were alerted to sadistic photos they were emailing to each other and a male paedophile , Colin Blanchard .
The three met on Facebook and only ever communicated by email or text .
Carol Clarke , 46 , will also be sentenced this week in Grimsby after she admitted following boys and girls and abusing them in public toilets .
Dr Anne Carpenter , a clinical and forensic psychologist in Glasgow , said : " The internet is presenting clinicians with completely new dilemmas and new questions .
We do n't know if interaction on these websites translates into offences , but while many may be able to stop at the fantasy level , we cannot ignore these sites and assume people wo n't act on these fantasies .
They may be fewer in number , but women are as accountable for their actions as men .
Being a victim of abuse does n't mean a woman can't be dangerous . "
The IoS findings are supported by research carried out in a study in Ireland , which found that women were using such websites to justify their feelings as " natural " .
Many of the women used the forums , chatrooms and " frequently asked questions " to share tips on how not to get caught – for example , by exploiting situations such as bath time or breastfeeding .
They share many of the same beliefs as men who abuse children : that having sex with a child is educational and children are sexual beings .
An excerpt from one website reads : " If you are a female child lover we want you to know there is nothing wrong with you .
The biggest problem is the teachers , therapists , cops , clerics and parents who force their stale morality on the young people in their custody .
For children , experiencing sexual pleasure is not damaging at all , they enjoy it ... just like we do . "
A discussion forum on another website details myriad claims of abuse .
" Julie " , 32 , wrote : " My first real kiss was from my mom , I was about 6/7 , she had been on her own a long time I guess ... it was a bit scary , but she was so loving and I just loved the way she held me ... "
While the majority of the 1,200 registered users on the website do not reveal details about themselves , 25 say they live in the UK .
Although no abusive images were posted , much of the text is too disturbing to print .
Very little is understood about whether use of these websites encourages actual abuse .
The Metropolitan Police 's paedophile unit , which targets the activities of paedophiles online , has told the IoS that it is unaware of any female - specific websites .
None of the 115 people arrested by Europol for alleged child sex offences last Thursday – after a two - year operation – were women .
Last week we passed details of our research to the police .
Dr Sharon Lambert , a forensic psychologist who carried out in Ireland some of the few studies in the world on this subject , said : " It is only in the past decade that we have started to understand how males engage with and are affected by online paedophilic material .
Now is the time to lift the taboo surrounding female offenders and to engage in some research that attempts to understand these emerging trends .
Deviant female sexuality is under - researched and requires attention . "
Susannah Faithfull ( no connection to the Faithfull Foundation ) survived years of sexual and physical abuse perpetrated by her mother .
Her therapy service , Aurora , has received a 25 per cent jump in calls from survivors of female abuse since news of Vanessa George 's crimes .
( Newser ) – Ron Livingston , the actor probably best known for headlining Office Space , is suing … someone .
Livingston is peeved that someone keeps editing his Wikipedia page to say that he ’s gay , but since the user is anonymous , his suit simply names him as “ John Doe . ”
The suit , however , will give the actor the power to subpoena Wikipedia and hopefully root out the prankster .
Livingston calls the vandal ’s actions “ despicable , ” alleging libel , invasion of privacy , and breach of publicity rights .
He may also subpoena Facebook , since he suspects the same Mr. Doe is behind the fake profile of him on that site , which also asserts that he ’s gay .
But the suit has issues , one Hollywood attorney tells Wired .
Most notably , a New York court recently ruled that a false accusation of homosexuality was not defamation , because there ’s nothing wrong or shameful about being gay .

The FHA continues to guarantee risky loans on behalf of the American public .
And they ’re now backing loans of almost $ 1 m .
Clearly , the FHA no longer serves the purpose it was created for – providing responsible loans to low - income and minority borrowers .
The current system simply transfers risk from private lenders to taxpayers .
What a deal for lenders – government takes all the risk , and lenders only have to do paperwork and service the loan .
With this kind of sweetheart deal , it ’s no surprise that banks are reaping huge profits .
Part of recent profits are due to banks setting aside smaller cash reserves to cover losses .
But why should they ?
Taxpayers will mop up the red ink , while banks reap all the gains .
See Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae , AIG , and GMAC for more examples .
Quite the recurring theme these days .
Add accounting gimmicks and low interest rates , and voila !
Banks look great again .
The overall economy , not so much .
But banks are cleaning - up .
Excerpt from a great NYT piece .
In January , Mike Rowland was so broke that he had to raid his retirement savings to move here from Boston .
A week ago , he and a couple of buddies bought a two - unit apartment building for nearly a million dollars .
They had only a little cash to bring to the table but , with the federal government insuring the transaction , a large down payment was not necessary .
“ It was kind of crazy we could get this big a loan , ” said Mr. Rowland , 27 .
“ If a government official came out here , I would slap him a high - five ” …
Some F.H.A. borrowers here say they have the cash for a full down payment but would rather invest it in the stock market or use it for remodeling .
Others , like Mr. Rowland and his friends , simply do not have the money required by private lenders — which would have been nearly $ 200,000 , in their case .
Apparently we have n’t learned much from recent crises .
The current strategy is to resurrect the problems that got us into this mess , but on a larger and publicly - backed plan .
Push back doomsday a few years if you can .
Take a look at these past FHA pieces if you ’re interested , where I uncovered some ridiculous claims from FHA - backed lenders :
# 1 – FHA – Bailout waiting to happen ?
# 2 – FHA dutifully following sub - prime playbook
# 3 – Quicken Loans responds
London , England ( CNN ) --
British police have appealed for information about the whereabouts of an escaped prisoner who has been telling the world via Facebook about his life as a fugitive .
Craig Lynch , 28 , escaped Hollesley Bay open prison near Suffolk , eastern England , back in September , but has continued to update his Facebook status regularly -- describing everything from his meals to who his next girlfriend will be .
" mmm i just had a 12lb venison steak .
Roasted veg and chips , bangin meal .
I feel stuffed but still got room for the j.d's .
Hope you enjoyed the meal babe's .
We 'll have to eat here again " Lynch wrote on his wall .
In another posting from earlier this week Lynch wrote " Is thinkin , which lucky girl will be my first of 2010 !!. "
Police are trying to use clues left by Lynch on his Facebook to track down where the convicted burglar may be hiding .
Lynch was sentenced to a seven - year prison term for aggravated burglary and was serving his sentence in an open prison before his escape , according to a police spokeswoman .
" We have spoken to Facebook and we are trying to trace him from the information we have , but it's one of those things that we 're also asking for help from members of the public , " Suffolk police spokesperson Anne- Marie Breach told CNN .
" Obviously we 're taking what he 's saying on Facebook with a pinch of salt because he's now aware that people may be reading what he 's writing . "
News that Lynch 's Facebook was being updated broke yesterday and since then , he has written several times of his life on - the - run .
" The hotel staff have n't even clocked which was the only thing I 've been paranoid about all day ! " he wrote .
Lynch 's most recent posting read " well what can i say fellow friends .
The run is nearly over .
Sorry some of you had to find out like this .
I know some of you might take offence that i never told you personally .
But you know me .
I Trust No One .
Its the only way to be . "
I think it 's ironic .
Because the man who coined the phrase was none other than Friedrich Nietzsche , a non-theistic person who famously succumbed to madness later in life .
It does touch on some of the more blurry aspects of faith .
For example ;
In Jesus 's time , there was another self - proclaimed savior of the Jews : called Simon the flyer , who was famous for raising the dead , curing the sick and diseased , and oddly enough , flying .
When the authorities asked him to prove that he could fly , in front of a large crowd he lept off of a ledge ... and broke his leg .
Laughable , for sure , but what if the authorities had asked Jesus to walk on water in order to prove that he was the savior ?
Christianity as we know if might not have existed if Jesus tried and failed miserably .
Romans were hard - nosed realists , and if someone in Galilee had been proven to have walked on water , the Romans would have almost certainly wrote it down .
But they did n't .
There is n't even any real Roman record that Jesus existed at all ( they 're all second - hand sources ) .
How about the numerous other miracles in the bible which are known copycats of miracles in other religions ?
Moses turning his staff into a snake is a famous example of an older Egyptian myth .
Furthermore , how does a Christian prove that Muhammed was n't the prophet of God ?
They can't .
How do they prove that Jesus was in fact the son of God and not an imposter as the Jews say he is ?
They can't .
How can they prove that Joseph Smith , the spiritual founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints , was n't a prophet of God ?
They can't .
In fact , the only real assurance that they have that they are correct is their safety in numbers .
So we can say that faith with only one member is called a madman , a faith with only a few members is a cult , and faith with a significant number of followers is a religion .
Location :
The Bush administration sold the PATRIOT
Act 's expansion of law enforcement powers , including " sneak and peek " searches in which the target of the search is never notified that his home has been searched , as necessary to defend the citizens of the US from terrorist attacks , but that 's not how federal law enforcement has used its sweeping new powers .
According to a July report from the Administrative Office of the US Courts ( thanks to Ryan Grim at the Huffington Post ) , of 763 sneak and peek search warrants issued last year , only three were issued in relation to alleged terrorist offenses , or less than one - half of 1 % of all such black - bag clandestine searches .
Nearly two - thirds ( 62 % ) were issued to investigate drug trafficking offenses .
The report also includes figures on existing warrants that were extended last year .
When new and extended warrant figures are combined , the total number of warrants was 1,291 , with 843 , or 65 % , for drug investigations .
Only five of all new or extended sneak and peek warrants were for terrorism investigations .
Of 21 criminal offense categories for which warrants were issued or extended , terrorism ranked 19th , exceeding only conspiracy and bribery .
As Grim noted , Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , a leading critic of the PATRIOT Act , challenged Assistant Attorney General David Kris about why powers supposedly needed to fight terrorism were instead being used for common criminal cases .
" This authority here on the sneak - and - peek side , on the criminal side , is not meant for intelligence , " said Kris .
" It 's for criminal cases .
So I guess it 's not surprising to me that it applies in drug cases .
" As I recall it was in something called the USA PATRIOT Act , " Feingold retorted , " which was passed in a rush after an attack on 9/11 that had to do with terrorism it did n't have to do with regular , run - of - the - mill criminal cases .
Let me tell you why I 'm concerned about these numbers :
That 's not how this was sold to the American people .
It was sold as stated on DoJ 's website in 2005 as being necessary - quote - to conduct investigations without tipping off terrorists , " he said .
" I think it 's quite extraordinary to grant government agents the statutory authority to secretly breaks into Americans ' homes in criminal cases , and I think some Americans might be concerned it 's been used hundreds of times in just a single year in non-terrorism cases , " the Wisconsin progressive continued .
" That 's why I 'm proposing additional safeguards to make sure that this authority is available where necessary , but not in virtually every criminal case . "

AP reporter Brett Blackledge should be ashamed of this lead :
WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
His name appears on radical Internet postings .
A fellow officer says he fought his deployment to Iraq and argued with soldiers who supported U.S. wars .
He required counseling as a medical student because of problems with patients .
Soon after Nidal Malik Hasan allegedly opened fire at Ft. Hood , web surfers discovered some radical online comments signed " NidalHasan . "
Interesting discovery .
Bloggers like Steve Huff of ASSME kept this factoid in perspective :
We should really , really keep in mind the possibility that Nidal Hasan may not be as uncommon a name as the average American might assume .
Still , an interesting comment was made by a “ NidalHasan ” on May 20 , 2009 on a document published on the document hosting service , Scribd.com .
Blackledge was n't so responsible .
A casual reader would assume from the lede that Blackledge has some proof that these comments were written by the alleged shooter .
Not so much :
At least six months ago , Hasan came to the attention of law enforcement officials because of Internet postings about suicide bombings and other threats , including posts that equated suicide bombers to soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save the lives of their comrades .
They had not determined for certain whether Hasan is the author of the posting , and a formal investigation had not been opened before the shooting , said law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the case .
So , Blackledge 's anonymous source basically told him that the authorities had noticed the same inflammatory comments as everyone else .
For obvious reasons , the FBI spends a lot of time scouring the internet for people waxing poetic about suicide bombings .
People who write about suicide bombings probably know that .
Which is one reason to wonder whether " NidalHasan " was the poster 's real name .
The authorities admit they do n't know who wrote it .
Blackledge does n't specify whether the authorities had any evidence besides the handle to link Nidal Hasan , MD of Fort Hood , TX to the posting .
It 's the height of irresponsibility to imply that Nidal Malik Hasan posted those musings about suicide bombers on scribdb .
We simply do n't know .
There 's no shortage of Nidal Hasans out there .
Googling " Nidal Hasan " last night , I came across one in Nidal Hasan in Florida , one in Pakistan , and several others .
There 's even another Nidal Hasan , MD , an endocrinologist in Illinois .
( By the time you google this , the page rankings will have changed .
Items related to the alleged shooter will progressively crowd out the other Nidals . )
Let 's not turn this horrible crime into an excuse for an orgy of Islamaphobia .

James
Ng was set to propose to his fiancee on a hot - air balloon ride until the symbol of their love fell 500 feet into the woods .
BURTON , Ohio 
This is a story of love rewarded .
Twice .
James
Ng was set to propose to his fiancée on a hot - air balloon ride when the symbol of their love fell 500 feet into the woods .
Ng , 26 , pastor of New Mercies Community Church , had hidden the 1 - carat diamond ring in a box in his camera case .
As they floated along on Oct. 29 , the case slipped from his hands .
" I just watched it tumble , and it hit a tree and spun around , and the stuff fluttered out of it , " Ng recalls .
" And I just put my head down on the side of the balloon , and I was just — I just could n't believe I 'd just done that .
" My first thought was do n't tell her ... and buy another ring — which it took me forever to afford the one I had , " Ng says .
But Sonya Bostic , 27 , caught on .
" When he reacted the way he did , that 's when I knew , " she says .
" Wait a second !
My ring 's in there ! "
Ng dropped to one knee and proposed anyway .
She said yes .
" I got up and I was like , ' What river did we just pass ? ' " Ng says .
" I started trying to get a feel for where we were . "
Back on the ground , he Googled maps , plotted flight paths and marked off search grids .
For seven days , as Ng and a friend searched , Bostic wore a twist tie on her finger , then a $ 9 Wal - Mart ring .
Then , as Ng thrashed through brush and brambles with a machete — the camera bag !
" We ran up to it ... and we 're like , ' Yes ! ' " Ng recalls gleefully .
The only thing still in the bag was the ring box .
Ng and Bostic say God gave them a miracle .
" I just kept looking at it , " Bostic says .
" It was so beautiful .
It was perfect .
It was everything that I wanted .
And that we found it , and I never thought in a million years we 'd find it , that was truly God .
It really was . "
Bridget Pericolo of Parsippany , N.J. , can relate .
She set her wedding ring in a disposable cup for safekeeping Monday .
Then her husband , Angelo , disposed of it in the trash as he left for work .
Before anyone noticed , that trash was headed for the Parsippany transfer station .
Bridget called Angelo , and Angelo called the dump .
Supervisor Michael Brotons and crew Edgar Lopez and Joseph McGee dug through 10 tons of trash , and they found the ring .
There 's one thing lost - and - then - found wedding rings seem to have in common .
As Bridget Pericolo said when she recovered the ring she has worn for 55 years , " I think it was a miracle . "

Auschwitz 's Facebook page follows the launch of its channel on YouTube The Polish authorities in charge of Auschwitz have launched an official site for the former Nazi death camp on the social networking website Facebook .
A spokesman said the move was aimed at reaching the younger generation and educating them about the Holocaust .
It follows the launch by Auschwitz - now a state museum - of a YouTube channel earlier this year .
More than a million people - 90 % of them Jews - were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II .
" We 're always trying for new ways of reaching people , and in today 's world one of the most popular tools is the internet , and on the internet millions of people use Facebook , " said Auschwitz Museum official Pawel Sawicki .
More than a million people have visited Auschwitz so far this year , the majority of them young people .
Have Your Say
We must raise awareness through whatever means possible Stephen McCann , Glasgow , UK " If our mission is to educate the younger generation to be responsible in the contemporary world , what better tool can we use to reach them than the tools they use themselves ? " said Mr Sawicki .
The Facebook page contains news and information about the museum , links to its YouTube channel and official website , and a discussion board .
The first topic is about whether Auschwitz should have a presence on Facebook .
" The Facebook page will provide a place for discussion which is not available on the official website , " said Mr Sawicki .
" We want it to be a place of discourse but of course we wo n't let anyone do anything that may abuse the memory of the victims and this place .
" So far , it 's just an experiment .
We 'll see how people react , " he said .

The Moblin project was launched by Intel in 2007 with the goal of building a Linux - based platform for small form - factor mobile devices .
Although the underlying technology is compelling and exhibits considerable potential , Intel 's surprising degree of ambivalence on fundamental issues like hardware compatibility and open drivers could threaten Moblin 's relevance .
One of the clearest examples of Intel 's declining commitment is the company 's cavalier disregard for concerns about the status of the Linux drivers for its GMA500 integrated graphics component .
The GMA500 , which is also known as Poulsbo , is shipped in popular netbooks like the Acer Aspire One and certain Dell Mini models .
Unlike Intel 's other integrated graphics solutions , Poulsbo is partly based on Imagination Technologies 's PowerVR and is only marginally supported on Linux .
The Poulsbo drivers are a complete disaster and are almost impossible for Linux vendors to support .
Watching the Poulsbo trainwreck
The open source parts of the Poulsbo driver , which are now in the " deprecated " section of the Moblin git tree , are unmaintained and have n't received improvements since March , 2008 .
This code wo n't work at all with recent versions of the Linux kernel .
The drivers also require proprietary binary blobs — which apparently can't be freely redistributed — for handling things like 3D acceleration .
For greater technical insight into how badly the drivers are broken , you can refer to Red Hat QA engineer Adam Williamson 's detailed blog entry on the subject , Intel GMA 500 graphics on Linux : a precise and comprehensive summary as to why you 're screwed .
The crappy Poulsbo Linux drivers are practically notorious by now , so these issues are n't exactly news to Linux enthusiasts who have been watching the fiasco unfold for over a year ; it has been like a trainwreck in slow motion .
The real problem is Intel 's lack of responsiveness to the concerns expressed by the Linux community .
Intel has responded to criticism with extraordinary dismissiveness and has failed to provide meaningful clarification about the extent to which it intends to provide Linux software support for the hardware that it sells to vendors .
Several well - known Linux bloggers have recently attempted to raise awareness of the issue , but Intel 's response has not been very promising .
Shawn Powers of Linux Journal expressed frustration about Intel in an October article , How To Kick Your Friends in the Face : GMA500 .
" The folks in charge of kernel developing , X.org developing , and major distribution packaging all have the same thing to say about the GMA500 chipset — and I 'm not allowed to publish those sort of words on a company blog , " he wrote .
" So Intel , I have to ask — what were you thinking ?
Do n't you realize if you want to remain a powerhouse in the small form and embedded market you have to have a good relationship with Linux developers ?
Do you know current versions of Moblin , your very own baby , do n't work with your GMA500 chipset ? ! "
Intel 's Moblin astroturf blog : " Closed drivers ?
Who cares ! "
In response to the Linux Journal article , Intel 's MoblinZone blog published a bizarre editorial that downplays the importance of open drivers and claims that users who are dissatisfied with the lack of support for GMA500 on Linux are at fault for buying products with that hardware .
The editorial was written by Henry Kingman , who argues that open drivers are n't needed in the mobile and embedded space because products in that market do n't have to be user - upgradeable .
" If some of the device drivers are closed , what does it matter ?
The system is ' embedded '— it 's tied closely to the actual hardware present on the platform — and the user is never expected to change anything about the core system , neither hardware nor software .
Even the manufacturer might not ever expect to upgrade the firmware on the device , once it 's shipped .
Closed drivers ?
Who cares ! " he wrote .
" Not only is there no significant penalty for closed drivers in the device world , sometimes , they work out better .
There 's a business advantage , in terms of vendor lock - in .
If I 'm a chip maker , my customer has to come back to me for a new driver or source - level license ( with non-disclosure agreement ) when they begin working on a new product model , or a firmware upgrade . "
He seems to be arguing that closed Linux drivers are a good business move because that approach to Linux support will allow the chip maker to extract recurring licensing revenue from the OEMs every time they want to make their devices work with a new version of the kernel .
That kind of behavior is so egregiously antithetical to the principles of Linux development that I can't really imagine that any upstream Linux developers would consider it acceptable .
If Intel and its partners want to do that kind of thing , it 's their prerogative -- but it 's absolutely not going to help Moblin 's credibility .
After seeing the MoblinZone editorial , I began trying to get clarification from Intel .
I wanted to give the company an opportunity to distance itself from the claims in the blog post and provide more insight into what went wrong with Poulsbo and how the company hopes to correct the problem .
Unfortunately , I did n't get much .
MoblinZone 's front page lists
Intel as one of its " featured partners , " but does not indicate who actually operates the site .
Intel 's corporate address , however , appears on MoblinZone 's terms of service and privacy policy .
Some readers thought that the whole site smelled of astroturf .
Such suspicions were apparently well - founded — Kingman openly confirmed it in a discussion about his editorial at LWN .
" Howdy , author Henry here .
Yep , MoblinZone is astroturfing .
But , it 's also paying my bills during a career transition , " he wrote .
I asked Intel several questions about the MoblinZone website and the offending blog post .
They said that they play a role in funding the site , but they claim to have no direct editorial involvement with the content .
They declined to answer my question about whether the content of the blog post represents Intel 's position .
They have also not issued a retraction , so I can only assume that they condone its claims .
Intel acknowledges problem , denies responsibility
The real question at this point is whether Intel plans to take steps to address the issues with the Poulsbo driver or ensure that future products are better supported .
When we put this question to Intel , they acknowledged that their GMA500 hardware is poorly supported on Linux , but they denied that they have a responsibility to make it work .
" As an open source community effort , the Moblin project relies on commitment from various vendors in the ecosystem to deliver and support device drivers .
In the case of the GMA500 series , no vendors have been able to deliver or maintain this driver for Moblin .
Despite demonstrations of platforms with partial GMA500 support , a fully - tested and supported driver for the GMA500 remains unavailable , " Intel told Ars .
" Intel understands the frustration Moblin enthusiasts are experiencing with the lack of support and are aware of how this impacts the perception of Moblin , however the Moblin project team remains hopeful that a member of the ecosystem will choose to support GMA500 drivers in the future . "
Intel has been courting the Linux community with the hope of expanding its involvement in Moblin so that they can build mindshare for their technology .
The company , however , does n't seem to feel any responsibility for making sure that the hardware that it sells to OEM's is fully compatible with the Moblin platform .
That 's not a good way to attract supporters .
One of the reasons that the Linux community has shown so much enthusiasm for Moblin is because the project had serious potential to boost OEM confidence in Linux hardware compatibility .
That potential has evaporated in the face of evidence that Intel can't or wo n't provide any meaningful compatibility guarantees .
Even if Intel can't make arrangements to open the binary blobs ( which are licensed from Imagination Technologies ) it should at least make sure that the blobs are publicly available and that the open source wrappers are properly maintained and compatible with the latest versions of the Linux kernel .
In a mailing list post written six months ago , Intel Linux engineer Richard Purdie said that he was working on making that happen .
Nothing has come of it , however , and the source code is still bitrotting .
Based on what their spokesman has told Ars , the company has given up on solving the problem itself and is now contending that it is up to the Moblin " vendor ecosystem " to make it work .
A light at the end of the tunnel ?
What makes this entire situation so profoundly frustrating is that it is entirely out of character for Intel , a company that has historically been one of the stronger backers of the Linux platform .
A lot of Intel 's other integrated graphics hardware is extremely well supported on Linux , and its open source drivers are maintained directly by Intel .
Some of the most important improvements to Xorg and the kernel graphics stack in recent history have been funded by Intel and implemented by the incredibly smart people that Intel employs to make Xorg work .
For that reason , I remain hopeful that Intel will eventually accept responsibility and start taking steps to address the problems with Poulsbo .
If it does n't , the company risks undermining the credibility of the Moblin initiative and could lose its reputation as a company that is committed to making Linux - compatible products .
Last month , the Linux Foundation leaked some information alleging that a new officially - supported closed - source Linux driver for Poulsbo would be coming soon and that it will be based on Gallium3D .
Although another closed - source driver is far from an ideal outcome , it would be a very welcome improvement .
Phoronix , which has had good ongoing coverage of the situation with Poulsbo , published a report in early November about the rumored driver overhaul .
Unfortunately , Intel has not confirmed the rumor and the new driver has still not materialized .
Phoronix posted an update last week saying that Intel may have changed its mind .
" We have learned that the updated kernel and Gallium3D drivers should have premiered with Moblin 2.1 that was released in November , but at the last minute Intel apparently diverted from their plans , " wrote Phoronix .
" We have no update as to when the new driver may reach the general public , but hopefully we will not be waiting for Moblin 2.2 in 2010 . "
Intel has told Ars that it is not working on a Poulsbo fix , so I 'm skeptical that the rumored driver will ever emerge .
If Intel cares at all about restoring confidence in its commitment to Moblin , now would be a very good time to do something about the problem , or at least provide some transparency if they have a partial solution in progress .

For more than three decades , all but the wealthiest Americans have seen their wages stagnate while education , health , and energy costs continue to grow at a rate well above inflation .
To maintain the middle - class lifestyle they deserve , many hard working Americans have turned to credit cards to finance a greater and greater share of their expenses .
As the personal debt of Americans has risen , so too have interest rates on that debt .
Many sign up for cards with much lower rates , only to see their rates hiked with the flimsiest of excuses .
Even those who pay off their balance every month can have their rates raised .
High credit card interest rates trap Americans in a vicious cycle ; a single late payment can lead to skyrocketing rates , which make balances and future payments out of reach .
Out of control interest rates hurt all Americans , not just those with high rate cards .
As more and more of Americans earnings go into the financial industry , less and less go to buy goods and services whose production employs most Americans .
It also limits our ability to stimulate a slowing economy , since millions of credit card holders use tax rebates to pay down their personal debt rather than act as consumers .
Our bill will cap annual credit card interest rates at 16 % , and include in this calculated rate the fees that many issuers use to hide the true cost of their cards .
This cap will bring immediate relief to those who are struggling to make ends meet while burdened by the weight of credit card debt .
We of course also have a provision in there to grandfather lower interest card holders so that card companies do n’t react to the law by immediately raising everyone ’s rate up to 16 percent .
Now we need the Senate to step up and match our legislation , as we continue to build support for it here in the House .
The last thing Americans suffering from job losses and declining wages need is to worry about being trapped under a growing mountain of debt .
It is time we acted to protect them .

Toyota Australia company has introduced the most significant Hybrid car in order to change the Australian Automotive landscape , and also offer Australian motorists with an inexpensive and environmentally responsible vehicle .
All the Hybrid vehicles are producing lower and cleaner productions than the standard engine technologies that diminish fuel consumption and also lessen the demand for oil .
Toyota Industry Company is planning to build total ten thousand ( 10,000 ) vehicles in only one year for the domestic market .
It also produces 300 more vehicles to export in New Zealand from Australia .
Toyota will release its exclusive version of Hybrid Camry car to the market in February 2010 .
This product has many different advantages , but the most and most demanding advantage of this vehicle is that it is fuel - efficient .
This Toyota Hybrid Camry car is currently manufacturing in different countries of the world instead of Australia .
This vehicle is available in Thailand , Japan and United States of America .
The fuel saving data of this Hybrid Camry is based on ADR 81/02 combined cycle .
It consumes very low fuel as compared to the other vehicles , but its fuel consumption depends on your driving styles and conditions .
We ’ve been accused on more than one occasion … okay , pretty much every single day …of harboring some kind of creepy Arduino love affair .
The topic does come up an awful lot here , we ’re not oblivious to that , and had been patiently waiting for April Fool ’s Day to post an article lampooning the whole situation , both ourselves and critics alike , so that everybody could have a good laugh ( or possibly annihilate the entire planet in the resulting flame war , we ’re not sure ) .
And what could possibly make for a more self - referential joke than an Arduino shield … for Arduino ?
Truth , as it turns out , is stranger than fiction .
“ Core2duino ” is — seriously now , no joke — an Arduino shield containing a second ATmega microcontroller and full complement of I /O pins .
The two chips in this Young Frankenstein - esque assemblage coordinate over the I2C bus , providing , at least in theory , more processing power , more I/O , and perhaps a degree of fault tolerance .
In reality , we ’re pretty skeptical , but do have to give them props for a great Instructable , detailing the whole process start to finish with Eagle CAD files , board etching and drilling , and advice on where to score free Cosmopolitan magazines ( it helps “ if you know any women , ” we ’re told ) .
There ’s no indication whether this works with stacking headers to allow for an Arduino shield for Arduino shield for Arduino , or perhaps some Möbius strip - like endless stack of Arduinos .
Feel free to discuss in the comments .

The Obama administration insists that it understands the risks posed by deficits and ever - increasing debt .
Its critics are doubtful .
But as Washington runs up a trillion - dollar deficit this year , with trillions in debt for years to come , it need look no farther than Tokyo to see how overspending can ravage an economy .
Image Credit ... Photo Illustration by The New York Times
Tokyo’s new government , which won a landslide victory on an ambitious ( and expensive ) social agenda , is set to issue a record amount of debt , borrowing more in government bonds than it will receive in tax receipts for the first time since the years after World War II .
“ Public sector finances are spinning out of control  fast , ” said Carl Weinberg , chief economist at High Frequency Economics in a recent note to clients .
“ We believe a fiscal crisis is imminent . ”
One of the lessons of Japan ’s experience is that a government saddled with debt can quickly run out of room to maneuver .
“ Japan will keep on selling more bonds this year and next , but that wo n’t work in three to five years , ” said Akito Fukunaga , a Tokyo - based fixed - income strategist at Credit Suisse .
“ If you ask me what Japan can resort to after that , my answer would be ‘ not very much . ’ ”
How Japan got into such a deep hole , and kept digging , is a tale of reckless spending .
The country poured hundreds of billions of dollars into civil engineering projects in the postwar era , marbling Japan with highways , dams and ports .
The spending initially fueled Japan ’s rapid postwar growth and kept the Liberal Democratic Party in power for most of the last half - century .
But after a spectacular asset and stock market boom collapsed in 1990 , the country fell into a long economic malaise .

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has released a report which calls on the United States and Russia to cut their nuclear arsenals by 90 per cent within 15 years .
The report warns the risk of nuclear catastrophe is as significant as the threat of climate change and is the culmination of 18 months work by the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament ( ICNND )
The report sets a goal of cutting the number of nuclear weapons around the globe from 23,000 to 2,000 by the year 2025 .
Commission chairman Gareth Evans say the plan rests on the cooperation of Russia and the United States .
" That 's critical because between them they have 95 per cent of the world 's nuclear warheads , " Mr Evans said .
" It means the Russians coming down from 13,500 , the Americans coming down from 9,000 to 500 , and everybody else not increasing from where they are at the moment . "
The report also calls for talks on a nuclear - free zone in the Middle East and for a successful review next year of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty .
Mr Rudd launched the commission 's report in Tokyo with the Japanese Prime Minister , Yukio Hatoyama .
Anti-nuclear campaigners say they are disappointed the report does not aim for nuclear weapons to be completely eliminated within 15 years .
Dimity Hawkins from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons says the report does not go far enough .
" It would still leave about 20 times the number of nuclear weapons capable of causing massive climate change and trigger a catastrophic famine in the world , " Mr Hawkins said .
" If we give permission or are seen to be endorsing any nuclear weapon state to maintain an arsenal , then those questions will be raised by those other states who will ask ' well , why ca n't we have one as well ? ' "

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - Internet auction site eBay stopped a 10 - year - old girl ’s attempt to auction off her “ moaning ” granny online .
Zoe Pemberton from southern England put her 61 - year - old grandmother up for sale on the auction website with no reserve price , describing her as “ rare and annoying and moaning a lot . ”
But she also said pensioner Marian Goodall was “ very cuddly , ” loved word searches and enjoyed drinking tea .
More than 20 bids were received for Goodall , but she has since been withdrawn from the site , eBay said .
“ While no doubt Mrs. Goodall would have fetched a princely sum , eBay does not allow the listing of any human being on the site , ” an eBay spokeswoman said in an emailed statement .
“ Mind you , we were impressed to see a total of 27 bids for the lady in question ! ”
Halloween is a holiday celebrated on October 31 annually .
Today the Halloween regards as a secular celebration even though it has actually roots in the Celtic festival of Samhain and the Christian holy day of All Saints .
Most common Halloween activities include trick - or - treating , wearing costumes , attending costume parties , carving jack - o’- lanterns , ghost tours , bonfires , visiting haunted attractions , pranks , telling scary stories , and watching horror films .
Below are the photos from the varied observations of the Halloween day around the world .

A Ring - tailed lemur at Bristol Zoo Gardens investigates a carved pumpkin that had been left as a special Halloween treat in its enclosure on October 28 , 2009 in Bristol , England .
The gift of the pumpkin does have a serious side , as they are a great addition to the animals ’ regular diet as they are high in vitamins , potassium , protein and fiber – as well as being the perfect enrichment toy , since the animals have to delve inside to reach the succulent flesh and plump seeds .

Anticipation surrounding the much - rumored " Google Phone " , now apparently known as the Nexus One , has been growing in recent weeks , and it appears that the rumors were correct : Google has announced an Android - related press conference for January 5th , and all indications point to a launch of the Nexus One at the event .
A source has also provided information to Gizmodo claiming that the Nexus One will be offered at an unsubsidized price of $ 529.99 , or at $ 179.99 with a two - year agreement on T - Mobile .
- Yeah , it 's $ 530 unsubsidized .
Google 's not going to be selling the phone at cost , like so many people considered .
They 're not going to save us from the " making money off of hardware " culture we 've got right now , so this is basically just another Android handset , albeit a really good one
- If you want it subsidized , you 'll have to sign up for a 2 year mandatory contract and pay $ 180 for the phone
T- Mobile will reportedly offer only a single rate plan for the Nexus One , with unlimited talk , text , and web for $ 79.99 per month .
Subsidized handset pricing is apparently only available to individual subscribers , and family plan and FlexPay subscribers and other special accounts will be required to purchase the Nexus One at the unsubsidized price .
Sources have also indicated to TmoNews that Google will begin taking orders for the Nexus One on January 5th .
The Nexus One has received favorable reviews from those who have been able to handle the new device , but most observers see it as competition for the Motorola Droid within the Android market segment rather than being positioned as a true " iPhone killer " .
Colt New Agent A Gun Test by Hunter Lee Elliott ( Hunter , ) After having toured the Colt factory in Connecticut , I anxiously awaited arrival of the New Agent from Mark Roberts for my evaluation .
I was headed back from supper when I got the call from Jim at Jim's Guns that there was a blue plastic box sitting on his counter with my name on it .
I was headed back home but decided that there is no time better to pick up a new Colt than now .
It looked like I would be out a little later than I had figured .
First Impression
When I got to Jim's Guns that evening I took a few minutes to give the little Colt a once over .
When I got the box open the first thing I noticed was how small this pistol really is .
The bluing was nicely done and , as I picked it up and admired the fit , I felt a smile creep across my face .
When I checked out the trench sight I will admit this was the first time I had seen this in person .
I wondered how effective it would be .
I personally like the cut of the slide serrations at the muzzle .
I am not sure if they serve any purpose other than aesthetics but I have used them to cock the slide from the muzzle similar to forward cocking serrations but less chance of a snag .
The mainspring housing was fitted well to the receiver .
The front strap is serrarated to aid in purchase .
The wooden stocks and thumb safety are reminiscent of earlier Colt Government Models .
The grip safety is also well fitted and disengaged positively .
far as the bang button , it is an aluminum - three hole design .
The whole pistol looked to be well thought out , and to fill somewhat of a market void for Colt as a dedicated carry pistol .
I am not unfamiliar with small Government Model styled pistols but I am by no means an expert so I anticipated that there would be somewhat of a learning experience for me .
This pistol uses a bushingless system with a bull barrel , as the slide is too short to accommodate a barrel bushing .
Comparison to a few other Colts
Here are a few pictures of the New Agent among a few of my beloved Colts just as to compare it in size .
Colt Gold Cup Trophy , Compact , New Agent , Mustang Plus II , and Detective Special .
Detail Strip The New Agent detail strips a little different than the standard Government Model .
It is similar to the Colt Defender , for those who may be familiar with that pistol .
For those who are not , I will give you a quick rundown .
With the full length guide rod and reverse recoil spring plug set up I would remove the slide as an assembly .
The guide rod and dual recoil spring assembly can then be removed from the rear of the slide , followed by the barrel .
The rest is pretty much a standard Series 80 slide strip .
and begin dissembling the receiver the same as any other Series 80 Government Model .
The guide rod keeps steady pressure on the link , so when the slide stop is removed the link is pressed backwards .
This can make reinserting the slide stop a little troublesome .
A trick I used was to take the pressure off the recoil spring from the muzzle end by using a tool .
That allows the link to swing freely , easing slide stop insertion .
The picture is not of great quality but as you can see with the pressure off the dual recoil spring the link swings freely and can be aligned with the receiver to install the slide stop .
You can also use an alignment tool to line up the link but I found this method easier .
Initial Range Trip I woke up early Sunday morning with a case of the butterflies .
I had stayed up late loading some 200 gr lead semi-wadcutters and gathering the test ammunition together for the impending test .
Knowing this was somewhat of a new design I had wondered how the little Colt would wring out but , honestly , I was optimistic .
Still , the proof would be at the impact berm after the smoke cleared .
I started off the day setting up my CED chronograph about ten feet from my position and about fifteen feet from my target .
I sprayed the New Agent with a shot of CLP on both sides and worked the slide a few times .
The moment of truth was upon us .
Since this is a defensive pistol I though I might as well start off with a defensive round and see where we stood when the slide locked back .
I loaded a magazine with 230gr Federal Hydra - Shoks and went to work .
Next up was Federal 185gr JHP , which is one of the most aggressive hollow points I have seen , function was flawless with both defensive rounds .
The ammunition lineup for the first range trip was two types of Federal defensive rounds , Federal 185gr Gold Match SWC , Speer 185gr Gold Dot JHPs , Winchester 230gr FMJ , Armscor 230gr FMJ , and my home - cast 200 gr LSWC ; all were run through the supplied Colt seven - round , smooth follower magazines and Colt six - round dimpled follower magazines that I have on hand .
I fired 200 rounds of a representative selection of these and experienced no pistol failures .
Everything worked , as it should , though perceived recoil was greater than with a full - size Government model , and the sight trench was different enough to require a little getting used to .
My range partner , Clint , ran a few magazines through the New Agent with 230gr FMJ and 200gr LSWC , sharing the load of the test .
His opinion was " Colt reliability in a pocket sized .45 ACP , nice pistol . "
We agreed that this pistol filled a market void for a reliable , compact pistol chambered in .45 ACP from Colt .
Second Range Trip
I got up early one pretty Sunday morning and headed out to the range to give the little Colt another work out .
I stopped by and picked up my buddy , Jamie Dawson ( from the Kickin Grass bluegrass band ) , and figured I would get his opinion on the New Agent .
Jamie has been looking for a new carry pistol and was interested in shooting the New Agent to get an idea of how it would act .
I loaded up a few magazine of my home - cast 200 gr lead semi-wadcutters and turned the New Agent over to him .
Well , I am sad to say right off the bat he out - shot my best target so far with the little Colt .
I believe it is due to his mandolin skills that he was able to do so well .
( I can not admit being bested without a good excuse )
We took turns with the New Agent , putting a total of 143 rounds through her that day with no pistol failures .
The rounds were 230gr Winchester full metal jacket , my home - cast 200 gr LSWC , and Hornady Tap 200 gr + P jacketed hollow points .
After the smoke cleared I believe Jamie liked the little Colt , and I expect him to show up with one of his own .
By this point I had fired a total of 343 rounds with no pistol failures .
Third Range Trip
This was to be the last time out and the last chance to fail .
I received a few boxes of defensive ammunition from M1911.org forum member Justin ( screen name Justintime ) and , since this pistol was built primarily as a defensive weapon , I wanted to run a large cross-section of defensive rounds through it to see how reliability measured up .
The ammunition for the day consisted of Winchester Ranger 230 gr +P JHP , Remington Golden Saber 185gr , and Cor - Bon 185 gr +P JHP .
The New Agent had passed my LSWC litmus test so I was confident in its reliability .
There was another reason for a third range trip , as well , this go - around I brought one more person to run a few rounds through the Colt and get one more opinion : my mother .
I gave her a brief instruction on the trench sight and a full magazine and awaited her thoughts .
She ran a magazine of Winchester 230gr FMJ and then my home - cast 200 gr LSWC .
My mother is a small woman - about 5 feet tall and about 100 pounds - and she was able to control the pistol well and did manage to get the rounds on target .
I believe if limp wristing had been an issue it would have been prevalent here , especially with the LSWCs .
We rounded out the test with 62 rounds down range , putting the total count at 405 rounds with no pistol failures and no cleaning .
The little Colt was plenty dirty by now .

Conclusions
The first point I want to make clear is that this not an IDPA / IPSC / Competition pistol .
I have heard some complaints about the New Agent not having sights .
That is not entirely true ; the sight trench works well but it does take a little practice to use effectively .
It may not be as precise as the adjustable Bomars found on top of the Special Combat Government , but it is plenty good for the intended usage of this pistol .
The little Colt cleared leather quick and with the enhanced frame causing it to sit low in my hand it pointed nicely .
The New Agent is definitely more than a sum of it's parts .
This pistol fills a niche for a small carry pistol without sacrificing stopping power .
I am not looking to get into the whole 9 mm vs .45 ACP debate .
Lord knows that has been discussed more times than semi-auto vs. revolver .
I know the 9 mm is accepted as a defensive round and I agree it can do the job .
I also agree the revolver is a viable option as a carry pistol .
I am just referring to those who prefer a small semi-auto chambered in .45 ACP as a carry pistol , which I believe is a large demograph .
Now that I have got the disclaimers out of the way so my inbox does not fill up with hate mail , I can say that I am impressed with the New Agent .
With the +P loads recoil was sharp but manageable .
Pistol function was flawless with both dimpled and smooth followers through the charted rounds .
While I was testing this pistol I made it a point to carry it often .
Logic would dictate that comfort is almost as important as reliability in a dedicated carry pistol .
I carried it mostly in a Wild Bill 's Speed Scabbard but also in my front pocket .
Though pocket carry was not as comfortable and was prone to some printing , it was very convenient .
A few times out wearing a tucked - in dress shirt , I was able to carry the New Agent in my front pocket without notice .
Though inside the waistband would work also , the front pocket was more accessible .
I am glad to see Colt making the effort to come out with new models and I believe they hit a home run with this one .
Something else I would like to point out .
I am disappointed in many of the gun " rags " - especially those that covered the SHOT show - which no mention was made of the introduction of this pistol .
The only coverage I saw was the pictures John Caradimas took for our e-zine when he toured the SHOT show .
Good for you John .
Colt is an American icon that still has a loyal following .
We continue to hear the same old internet rhetoric that Colt has gone out of business , has been sold , or has been abducted by aliens all the time .
Here was a great chance for the gun magazines to show that Colt is still in the game and trying new things but , instead , the New Agent was ignored .
The fact it has been left out leads me to believe advertising dollars are more of a concern for many magazines than complete coverage , something you will never see here .

Martin O'Carrigan says he has nothing to hide .
That 's why he did n't think twice when officers showed up at his door Monday asking to search his apartment for clues in the case of a missing Toronto teen .
He even opened up his closet door for the two detectives to get a closer look .
" They were just doing their jobs , " said O'Carrigan , adding he had no qualms about letting the " very personable " detectives search his apartment , in the same building where the family of 18 - year - old Mariam Makhniashvili lives .
In what police are calling an unprecedented move , they have assigned 60 detective constables from squads such as fraud , sex crimes and homicide to canvass about 6,000 homes in the midtown area where Mariam lived and went to school .
While O'Carrigan responded to a list of questions about whether he saw Mariam or anything suspicious around the time of her disappearance on Sept. 14 , the officers listened attentively .
They took note of what he said and how he said it .
" If you 've got nothing to hide , just answer the questions .
Someone in the building must know something , some lead , some tip , something that will help , " said O'Carrigan .
Police are hoping to find that someone .
For the next two or three weeks , plainclothes officers will visit houses , condos and apartments near Bathurst St. and Eglinton Ave. W. , targeting Shallmar Blvd. , where the family lives .
" You will expect a knock at your door and police will keep knocking at your door , " Det. Sgt. Dan Nealon told a news conference .
" We 're also asking to be invited into your home just for a quick peek into areas of your home to ensure that there is no evidence ... and we can move on . "
While people have the right not to answer questions from police or let them into their homes , those who do not co-operate may find themselves subject to a search warrant , said the lead investigator .
In the past , such door - to - door searches have raised concerns by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association because residents felt intimidated and threatened by the presence of officers .
No one from the association could be reached for comment Monday , but residents told the Star they did not mind the police presence .
" There 's a missing child involved , why would n't you help ? " said one man , who asked that his name not be used .
Even though police visited homes in the area after her disappearance , this " intensive investigative canvass " will enable investigators to " drill down , " said Nealon , adding there is no evidence of foul play .
One resident , who lives above the Makhniashvili family , said this second visit by police was much more thorough .
" Last time , they did n't come in and we just had a very short conversation in front of the door , " said the man , who asked not to be identified .
But this time , he said , officers entered his apartment and looked inside cupboards , closets , and the refrigerator .
The canvass comes after failed attempts by police to drum up leads in a case that has baffled them .
In the nearly two months since Mariam disappeared , police have appealed for help at three high schools , used helicopters to search two Toronto parks and seized 27 computers from two public libraries to try to trace her emails and Internet surfing .
The city has been papered with posters and officers have followed up on hundreds of tips .
But still , no clues .
The teen disappeared after walking to Forest Hill Collegiate with her brother .
They parted ways outside and she never made it to class .
The siblings had moved to Toronto in late June from the Republic of Georgia to be reunited with their parents , who had been living in California for five years .
Her parents have said she did not speak English very well , had no friends and did not know her way around Toronto .
She left home without her passport and with no money .
On Monday , police released a new digitally enhanced photo of Mariam in the clothes she wore Sept. 14 .
The image will be displayed on a large information screen outside the Yonge - Eglinton Centre , which is near where Mariam 's knapsack was found last month , in a parking lot behind 120 Eglinton Ave .
E .
The intersection is " one of the busiest areas in the city and hopefully it'll grab someone 's attention , " said Nealon .

Many people want to help the unwanted pets of society , and they turn to the animal shelters to look for places to adopt pets .
While this is good , it has also been the cause for some debate and controversy .
Some people will only support No - Kill shelters , and advocate donating finances only to them , and encourage adoptions only from them .
Here is the truth of it all in short terms .
Adoption from either type of shelter helps animals , donating to either helps animals , volunteering at either helps animals .
Ignoring one over the other hurts animals .
Understanding how both work is a good place to start .
No -Kill Shelters
These operate primarily from private donations .
Not all have charitable ( non-profit ) status .
If they have charitable status they can apply for government grants .
A few receive local funding .
Some are actual buildings while others operate out of a series of homes ( called foster homes ) .
When no -kill shelters are full , they simply turn animals away , refusing to accept more than they have space for .
Some no-kill shelters are extremely selective about what animals they accept , either taking only the most adoptable ( young animals and those of breeds that are in high demand ) or taking only specialty animals .
Some no-kill shelters only accept owner - surrendered animals and not strays .
Other Animal Shelters - Open Admission Shelters
These operate primarily from private donations .
Not all have charitable ( non-profit ) status .
If they have charitable status they can apply for government grants .
Some receive local funding , particularly those who also operate as the area 's pound for strays .
Most have an actual building and some also have foster homes .
When these shelters are full they have no option but to make room by euthanizing some animals .
These shelters can inform people that they are full , and cannot guarantee a pet a home , but most operate in a way that they cannot turn down an animal being surrendered or brought in as a stray .
These shelters deal with all the animals turned down by the no-kill shelters .

Dispelling some Myths !
In shelters that do euthanize animals , it is NOT a first choice , nor is it ever easy .
It is done on animals who are aggressive , old ( and typically unadoptable ) , or those who have been there too long and have been passed over for adoption time and time again ; they are put down to make room for new animals so those pets have a chance at a home .
There are always good reasons why pets are euthanized .
Shelters who take in strays cannot legally put those pets down right away , most areas have a 72 hour law .
This means stray pets must be held for 72 hours ( longer if the pet is microchipped or tattooed ) in order to allow an owner to claim them .
After the 72 hours is up the shelter is considered the legal owner of the pet and can put it up for adoption if they feel it is adoptable .
Most shelters , when space allows , hold stray pets for at least 1 week to allow the owner more time to claim it .
Microchipped or tattooed pets can be traced to their owners , and in most areas shelters must hold them for 10 days to allow the owner to be traced , or to come forward .
If they decide an animal is adoptable the shelter has it dewormed , vet checked , and vaccinated .
Once they have invested this money into the pet they certainly would rather have it adopted than euthanized .
Shelters do not have unlimited space ( or unlimited funds ) .
In most areas more animals are brought in on a weekly basis than are adopted out .
This is why no-kill shelters are forced to be picky and turn pets away when full , it is also why the other shelters are forced to euthanize animals .
Adopting out a dangerous dog , or a sick animal , could mean a lawsuit against a shelter ; and as such , lacking funds and / or time to aid such an animal , they are forced to euthanize it to allow safer , and healthy pets , a chance at getting a home .
Also , keeping sick animals in their care could spread health concerns to the other animals in their care .
Who Should You Support ?
Both are ultimately worth supporting , but turning your back on the shelter that is forced to clean up the surplus number of animals is truly wrong .
Adoption is saving a life , be it from one shelter or the other .
If you look at one shelter and they do not have a pet you want to adopt , check out the other kind of shelter , too .
Look for shelters with charitable ( non-profit ) status .
If you have to surrender your own pet , you should be honest , is it adoptable ?
If not then it should be humanely euthanized rather than having it become a burden on an already full shelter .
Dumping a problem pet on a shelter is unfair to all the healthy pets in their care , as well as being unfair to the staff .

The Miami Herald is reporting that a technicality in the wording of the Texas Defense of Marriage Act may actually ban all marriages , not just those pesky homo ones .
In the state constitutional amendment it states , “ Marriage in this state shall consist only of the union of one man and one woman . ”
But the huge issue is in following statement meant to block civil unions and domestic partnerships :
“ This state or a political subdivision of this state may not create or recognize any legal status identical or similar to marriage . ”
“ You do not have to have a fancy law degree to read this and understand what it plainly says , ” said Barbara Ann Radnofsky , a Houston lawyer and Democratic candidate for attorney general .
She also said the language effectively “ eliminates marriage in Texas . ”
Of course this language will not result in an overnight cancellation of all marriages in Texas , it is still quite hilarious .
It seems that whomever wrote the Texas DOMA amendment was so worried about gays finding some sort of equality in civil unions or domestic partnerships that they accidentally eliminated marriage for everyone .
Talk about irony .
Cue the cynical laughter .
When I de -bloated my piece of the web , I noted that the largest asset I was serving on my blog was a local version of jQuery - coming in at some 70 + kilobytes - that " I still need to insert into the head of my page for historical reasons : 15 years ago I in - lined lots of my wacky JavaScript experiments " .
But things change : we are now in the middle of a bloat - a - demic .
Web sites are tracking and expanding far beyond sustainable levels ... and emergency measures must be taken .
So I have done the unthinkable .
I have pulled the plug on JavaScript on my blog .
All of it .
Now the total number of network requests ( not counting any images inside of posts ) comes in at six ( 6 ) :

And `mrman.jpg` and `mrman - up.jpg` are the same image , flipped vertically - so I should certainly lose one of them .
1.5 k for a favicon seems a bit hefty - I should check that .
And I did some more tweaking of my old php software and made the html output prettier and leaner , but I 'm sure there 's more to improve in there too .
Naturally , " no scripts " means my wacky JavaScript experiments have been killed dead … and that simply can not stand .
I 'll commence the long process of de-jquery - fying them and making them run stand - alone ( mostly they were just using JQuery for the `$( document ) .
ready` anyways ) .
But it feels pretty good to go cruft - free .
Having dropped the kilobytes ( down originally from around 5 Mb (! ) to around 200 k for a full page of posts ) I feel like a whole new webmaster .
A giant weight has been lifted .
Until the next big web trend comes along , of course .
Anchoring live coverage on Friday of Barack Obama 's speech about receiving the Nobel Peace Prize , ABC's Charles Gibson enthused that the President won the award because he inspires .
The World News host extolled , " The Nobel Committee feeling that he has inspired a new sense in the world . "
Introducing another ABC host , Gibson commented on the " humble " tone of Obama 's address .
He then spun , " But , the use of the word inspiration is interesting , George Stephanopoulos , because , indeed , that 's why he won this award . "
Stephanopoulos would not be outdone in lauding the Commander in Chief for his humble nature .
He touted , " I thought it was a deft statement , Charlie .
I thought the President deftly deflected a lot of the criticism of the committee and he might get for getting this prize by saying .
' I do n't feel I deserve to be in the company of other winners . ' "
Stephanopoulos added , " He had to strike that humble note in accepting this award today . "
At no time did Gibson or his colleague entertain the notion that Obama won because of his arch - liberal policies and not because of how inspiring he is .
A transcript of the live coverage , which aired at 11:22 am EDT on October 9 , follows :
CHARLES GIBSON : The President remarking on the fact that he has won the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009 , saying he will accept it as a call to action .
And he says the goals that he has outlined in speeches in the first nine months of his presidency can't be achieved by any one leader .
It requires the cooperation of people around the world .
And he says he shares the award with all who strive for justice and dignity .
And he said he is humbled to be in the company of those who have inspired the entire world .
But , the use of the word inspiration is interesting , George Stephanopoulos , because , indeed , that 's why he won this award .
The Nobel Committee feeling that he has inspired a new sense in the world .
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS :
And they wanted to give some momentum to those feelings .
And the President acknowledged that when he talked about the aspirations of the world and how this is an affirmation of America 's leadership .
I thought it was a deft statement , Charlie .
I thought the President deftly deflected a lot of the criticism of the committee and he might get for getting this prize by saying .
" I do n't feel I deserve to be in the company of other winners . "
He had to strike that humble note in accepting this award today .
GIBSON : It is interesting that he wins this award at a time when he is considering what to do about stepping up a war in Afghanistan .
And you wonder if indeed subtly in the back of his mind this in any way might influence decisions he will make .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's very true , Charlie .
You know , he referred to himself as Commander in chief in this statement as well .
And you could almost imagine this might subtly create more pressure for the President to approve of the troop request increase by his commanders so that he can prove that he was acting independently and not simply bowing to world opinion or to public opinion here .
I 'm sure he will be disciplined about trying to make sure that those considerations do n't come into play at all .
But you wonder how it might affect the entire debate around this troop decision .
GIBSON : All right .
George Stephanopoulos in Washington .

Our friend Dennis DeSantis of Ableton offers his own take in a video shot at NYC - based music tech learning center dubSpot .
This is a pretty good conceptual overview of what the whole thing is about .
Basically , what I ’m hearing is that people used to previous versions of Warp Markers , while they find it confusing at first , do like the new system once they understand how it works .
Controllerism
Mark Mosher has been doing fantastic tutorials on his site Modulate This .
For one thing , he ’s got tips for getting Wacom tablets to work in Live 8 and finally getting text entry support , which means Kore works properly in Live at long last ( among others ) .
Best of all , he has a tutorial that demonstrates how he ’s putting together all his controllers – the Notation ReMOTE SL with Automap and the Akai APC40 – and making them function more effectively using some subtle controller changes in Live 8 .
What ’s interesting to me is that this is n’t so much about unique , proprietary stuff added to the APC integration , but basic feature improvements in Live itself , which could help you be more effective with other controllers , as well .
That ’s the kind of functionality I like to see , because it helps everyone .
All of this is great , but we are getting a little heavy on the Ableton - only video tutorials .
It ’s time to pick up the screencasting tools and demonstrate other tools , too .
I ’ve got some time blocked out this summer for the task .

It 's been several days since the chaotic end to the Copenhagen climate conference but the aftershocks from its failure are still reverberating .
As John Prescott points out in his letter to the Guardian , the pointing of fingers in the blame game does not help the regaining of trust needed for the positive resumption of talks early next year and to complete them by December 2010 , the new deadline agreed to in Copenhagen .
First , the misinformation put out in the past few days has to be corrected .
The UK climate secretary , Ed Miliband , backed by individuals such as Mark Lynas ( both writing in the Guardian ) have turned on China as the villain that " hijacked " the conference .
The main " evidence " they gave was that China vetoed an " agreement " on a 50 % reduction in global emissions by 2050 and an 80 % reduction by developed countries , in the small meeting of 26 leaders on Copenhagen 's final day .
There was indeed a " hijack " in Copenhagen , but it was not by China .
The hijack was organised by the host government , Denmark , whose prime minister convened a meeting of 26 leaders in the last two days of the conference , in an attempt to override the painstaking negotiations taking place among 193 countries throughout the two weeks and in fact in the past two to four years .
That exclusive meeting was not mandated by the UN climate convention .
Indeed , the developing countries had warned the Danish prime minister , Lars Lokke Rasmussen , not to come up with his own " Danish text " to be negotiated by a small group that he himself would select , as this would violate the multilateral treaty - based process , and would replace the documents carefully negotiated by all countries with one unilaterally issued by the host country .
Despite this , the Danish government produced just such a document , and it convened exactly the kind of exclusive group that would undermine the UN climate convention 's multilateral and democratic process .
Under that process , the 193 countries had been collectively working on coming to a conclusion on the many aspects of the climate deal .
Weeks before , it had become clear that Copenhagen could not adopt a full agreement because many basic differences remained .
Copenhagen should have been designed as a stepping stone to a future successful outcome accepted by all .
Unfortunately , the host country Denmark selected a small number of the 110 top leaders who came , to meet in secret , without the mandate or even knowledge of the convention 's membership .
The selected leaders were given a draft Danish document that mainly represented the developed countries ' positions , thereby marginalising the developing countries ' views tabled at the two - year negotiations .
Meanwhile , most of the thousands of delegates were working for two weeks on producing two reports representing the latest state of play , indicating areas of agreement and those where final decisions still had to be taken .
These reports were finally adopted by the conference .
They should have been announced as the real outcome of Copenhagen , together with a decision to resume and complete work next year .
It would not have been a resounding success , but it would have been an honest ending that would not have been termed a failure .
Instead , the Copenhagen accord was criticised by the final plenary of members and not adopted .
The unwise attempt by the Danish presidency to impose a non-legitimate meeting to override the legitimate multilateral process was the reason why Copenhagen will be considered a disaster .
The accord itself is weak mainly because it does not contain any commitments by the developed countries to cut their emissions in the medium term .
Perhaps the reason for this most glaring omission is that the national pledges so far announced amount to only a 11 - 19 % overall reduction by the developed countries by 2020 ( compared to 1990 ) , a far cry from the over 40 % target demanded by the developing countries and recent science .
To deflect from this great failure on their part , the developed countries tried to inject long - term emission - reduction goals of 50 % for the world and 80 % for themselves , by 2050 compared to 1990 .
When this failed to get through the 26 - country meeting , some countries , especially the UK , began to blame China for the failure of Copenhagen .
In fact , these targets , especially taken together , have been highly contentious during the two years of discussions , and for good reasons .
They would result in a highly inequitable outcome where developed countries get off from their responsibilities and push the burden of adjustment onto the developing countries .
Together , they imply that developing countries would have to cut their emissions overall by about 20 % in absolute terms and at least 60 % in per capita terms .
By 2050 , developed countries with high per capita emissions – such as the US – would be allowed to have two to five times higher per capita emission levels than developing countries .
The latter would have to severely curb not only their emissions but also their economic growth , especially since there is , up to now , no credible plans let alone commitments for financial and technology transfers to help them shift to a low - emissions development path .
The developed countries have already completed their industrialisation on the basis of cheap carbon - based energy and can afford to take on an 80 % goal for 2050 , especially since they now have the technological and organisational capacity and infrastructure .
For a minimally equitable deal , they should commit to cuts of at least 200 - 400 % , or move into negative emission territory , with net re-absorption of greenhouse gases , to enable developing countries the atmospheric space to develop .
The acceptance of the two targets would also have locked in a most unfair sharing of the remaining global carbon budget as it would have allowed the developed countries to get off free from their historical responsibility and their carbon debt .
They would have been allocated the rights to a large amount of " carbon space " , historically and in the future , without being given the obligation and responsibility to undertake adequate emission cuts nor to make adequate financial and technology transfers to developing countries .
Fortunately these targets are absent from the accord .
The imperative for the negotiations next year is to agree on what science says is necessary for the world to do ( in terms of limits to temperature rise or in global emissions cut ) but also on what is a just and equitable formula for sharing the costs and burdens of adjustment , and to decide on both simultaneously .
By asking for agreement on only a global goal and a very low commitment figure for their own obligatory cut , the developed countries were attempting to fix a global carbon budget distribution that enables them to get away with the hijacking of atmospheric space , a resource worth many trillions of dollars .
Learning from Copenhagen 's mistakes , the countries should return to the multilateral track and resume negotiations in the climate convention 's two working groups as early as possible .
They can start with the two reports passed at Copenhagen as reference points .
There should not be more attempts to hijack this multilateral process , which represents our best hope to achieve final results .
The bottom - up democratic process is slower but also steadier , compared to the top - down attempt to impose a solution by a few powers that will always lack legitimacy in decision - making and success or sustainability in implementation .
Who knew that killing bankers could be so hard on the hands ?
Between throwing them into the air , blowing them up , shooting them down and shaking them so hard their clothes fall off , it ’s easy for your fingers to get a little cramped now and again .
Especially when you kill so many .
To date this morning , I ’ve killed 424 day traders , 185 stock brokers , 79 vice presidents of acquisitions , 78 high risk investors , and 29 chief executive officers .
Not bad for about ten minutes of work .
No , I have n’t gone crazy .
Instead , I ’ve been playing “ Bailout Wars , ” a new iPhone game from French publisher Gameloft that is themed around the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
The game features cash - hungry bankers attempting to raid the White House for bailout cash and it ’s up to the player to stop them .
That involves tapping the bankers , allowing you to fling them around , hold them and shake them , and even double tapping to blow them up .
Given the pace of the onslaught , however , that is not enough .
Players earn gold for each banker they successfully kill , which eventually can be used to purchase and upgrade a sniper , tank , and a satellite laser - wielding Uncle Sam that help fend off the horde of bankers .
Each banker , too , has its own particular weakness .
While the basic banker can be killed in several ways , stock brokers are resistant to being flung to their deaths ( they use their briefcase as a parachute ) and must be slammed violently to the ground .
High risk investors descend on you from helicopters and must be forcibly crashed while CEOs can only be hurt by the tank , laser beam , or throwing little bankers into them .
The game ends when all the bailout cash is stolen .
Aside from the dubious morality of featuring a game that involves a wholesale slaughter of the industry I cover , the game is addictively fun .
As you progress levels , the bankers get faster and more plentiful , and your upgrades grow ever more impressive .
Throwing a tank shell onto a field full of bankers is sick fun .
Clearly I ’m not the only one having a good time .
The game has earned 95 reviews since its release on iTunes last month – the vast majority of which were positive – and was a featured selection from Apple last week .
“ I wo n’t see my banker the same way now , ” wrote shizuka123 at the iTunes Web site .
The only criticism was that many players wanted to take the fight to bankers directly .
“ We should be able to attack the banks bank and confiscate CEO ’s private jets to recoup money ! ” wrote Game Reviewer .
Com
Some just wanted a little bit more blood .
“ You should make CEOs easier to kill , ” wrote roachkotchou .
“ Bailout Wars ” is not the only iPhone app to play off of Tarp .
“ Bailout Ben , ” released in May , involves helping Federal Reserve Board Ben Bernanke to lower cash to failing companies .
“ Bailout America , ” released in February , involves moving obstacles out of the way to help Uncle Sam funnel more money to greedy bankers .
“ Bag the Bankers , ” meanwhile , also released last month , involves dragging bankers into , wait for it , a bag , and retaking some of their cash .
All in all , it ’s clear that the public ’s hatred of the banking industry – far from easing – may just be winding up .
And next time a bank CEO heads for the White House , I ’d steer clear of the snipers .
RedLynx , the developer of the well received downloadable title Trials , said that it seeded pirate torrent sites with neutered copies of the game in order to stoke interest in the title .

According to GamesIndustry.biz , Tero Virtala , the RedLynx CEO , said that the pirated version his team sent out did not include leaderboard support , which Virtala called the " soul " of the game .
In other words , the pirate version functioned as a kind of demo without being a demo , encouraging downloaders to grab the fully enabled version if they enjoyed the illicit one .
" Piracy is here , so how can we take advantage of that ?
What we did actually , on day one , we put that game immediately on all the torrent networks ourselves , " Virtala said at the Develop Liverpool conference .

The 150,000 copies the game has sold since its launch matches the number of users with access to the leaderboards , Virtala said , so if the gambit did n't work , at least it did n't hurt .
" At least people have not cracked our leaderboards yet , " he said .

On a recent morning in Sausalito , media consultant Myles Weissleder pulled up to the Paradise Bay Restaurant , walked out on the dock and got into a blue inflatable dinghy .
He was headed to his new office .
" This is not like taking Muni to work , " said Weissleder as he yanked on the outboard pull string to start the motor and pointed the dinghy toward the red-and - white houseboat anchored 500 yards out in Richardson Bay that now serves as his floating office .
The 39 - year - old entrepreneur , who works with tech startups and organizes SF New Tech , San Francisco 's largest event series for technology lovers , purchased the 1971 houseboat for $ 2,600 last month when a recent addition to his family made working from home impossible .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Weissleder had been running his company from his small flat in Sausalito since he moved to the Bay Area 10 years ago .
Besides organizing the monthly technology events that attract several hundred people , his company Mylermedia has been busy helping launch online projects such as CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 podcast , ReFrameIt.com , Power.com and Greenbydesign.com .
Last year , Mylermedia also helped organize the National Presidential Caucus .
While he enjoyed not having a commute and the flexibility of working from home , he decided it was time to establish a real and unique headquarters for his rapidly growing business after having his best quarter yet .
Just as many other small - business owners in this position , he first considered traditional office space .
The recession helped flood the Bay Area office market with space , but prices in areas like Sausalito remained far from affordable .
Although Sausalito office prices decreased by 20 to 30 percent in the past eight months , few spaces are available for less than $ 2.50 a square foot a month , according to Theo Banks of Keegan & Coppin Company Inc. , which specializes in commercial real estate in the North Bay .
High price of space
For a one - man operation like Weissleder 's , there was another issue .
" There are n't many offices available under 1,000 square feet and they can command a higher price , " explained Banks .
San Francisco 's office market , which offers more choices , presented its own problems - a long commute and few dog- friendly options for his 90 - pound Lab - pit , Pico .
" I love coming into San Francisco when I need to , but I do n't find much value in spending time in a car commuting when you could be geared up where you are - all you need is a phone , Internet , time and space , " said Weissleder .
Besides , he always wanted to work on the waterfront .
Inspired by the first social Internet platform , the Well , which came out of the same Sausalito waters in the 1980s , Weissleder settled on the rusty houseboat that allows for a short commute ( provided the motor is n't flooded ) along white yachts and a row of sleepy sea lions stretched out on the docks .
" You ca n't beat this , " he said .
Although it features one of the world 's best views - Mount Tam to the north and San Francisco 's skyline to the south - an old boat floating 500 yards out in the water is n't exactly a reliable spot for client meetings .
Weissleder conceded that he will have to refrain from working at his floating office during bad weather , but said the general rocking just takes getting used to .
The bigger issue is that the fixer - upper boat is in desperate need of redecorating , but he hopes to make it more comfortable and modern by changing the windows , bringing in cushions and setting up a whiteboard .
Allowing for creativity
So far , Weissleder 's clients have been supportive .
Jake Saxbe , founder of Toobla.com , which provides a visual social bookmarking service , said he could n't wait to have a meeting on the boat .
" No office allows for more creativity , " he said .
" We 've worked with big firms that have offices in buildings , but a guy on a houseboat is more our style .
I think that it would be great for our business , too - he mentioned flying a Toobla flag outside the boat . "
But not all clients are so easy to please , argued Gary Marshall of the U.S. Small Business Administration 's San Francisco office .
" The location of your business definitely affects the perception of your client base , " he said .
" Before making a decision of where to locate your office , you should think really strongly about how it 's going to affect your customers .
If you rely on your business to be easily accessible , you need to think about that . "
While he has n't brought any of his clients there yet , Weissleder said his boat - office can only help with marketing his business .
After all , his company is most likely the only tech firm actually based in San Francisco Bay .
But Marshall warned other small businesses about using their office location for marketing .
" I think looking at your location as a marketing tool should be one of the last considerations , " he said .
" If your location works out as a marketing tool , more power to you , but making a decision based on that is questionable . "
So far , Weissleder has no regrets .
" I hope it will help me focus more , " he said as he waved to a couple of kayakers passing by .
" Because if you drill down and get comfortable out here , the sky is the limit . "
It 's been a long time coming , but the Archos 9 is finally being unleashed wholesale upon the world .
The 9 - inch tablet has been delayed and had its price hiked , but if you have n't leapt off the hype train yet you 'll be interested in watching the unboxing and initial impressions video after the break courtesy of UMPCPortal .
The 60 GB device contains a mere 1.1GHz Atom processor and has been unfortunately crippled with Windows 7 Starter Edition , lacking the cool tablet features that you might have wanted to use on a tablet device .
A few times during this video the Archos is likened to the Joojoo , which will almost surely face some delays of its own before receiving a similar berth months from now .
Overall it 's looking like a nice machine if you have the bank -- and do n't want to do anything particularly processor intensive .
The Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer mission will survey the entire sky in a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called the mid-infrared with far greater sensitivity than any previous mission or program ever has .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Engineers and scientists say the maneuver went off without a hitch , and everything is working properly .
The mission 's " first - light " images of the sky will be released to the public in about a month , after the telescope has been fully calibrated .
" The cover floated away as we planned , " said William Irace , the mission 's project manager at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Our detectors are soaking up starlight for the first time . "
WISE will perform the most detailed infrared survey of the entire sky to date .
Its millions of images will expose the dark side of the cosmos -- objects , such as asteroids , stars and galaxies , that are too cool or dusty to be seen with visible light .
The telescope will survey the sky one - and - a - half times in nine months , ending its primary mission when the coolant it needs to see infrared light evaporates away .
WISE launched on Dec. 14 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
Once it was thoroughly checked out in space , it was ready to " flip its lid . "
The cover served as the top to a Thermos - like bottle that chilled the instrument -- a 40 - centimeter ( 16 - inch ) telescope and four infrared detector arrays with one million pixels each .
The instrument must be maintained at frosty temperatures , as cold as below 8 Kelvin ( minus 447 degrees Fahrenheit ) , to prevent it from picking up its own heat , or infrared , glow .
The cover kept everything cool on the ground by sealing a vacuum space into the instrument chamber .
In the same way that Thermos bottles use thin vacuum layers to keep your coffee warm or iced tea cold , the vacuum space inside WISE stopped heat from getting in .
Now , space itself will provide the instrument with an even better vacuum than before .
The cover also protected the instrument from stray sunlight and extra heat during launch .
At about 2:30 p.m. PST ( 5:30 p.m. PST ) , Dec. 29 , engineers sent a command to fire pyrotechnic devices that released nuts holding the cover in place .
Three springs were then free to push the cover away and into an orbit closer to Earth than that of the spacecraft .
Scientists and engineers are now busy adjusting the rate of the spacecraft to match the rate of a scanning mirror .
To take still images on the sky as it orbits around Earth , WISE will use a scan mirror to counteract its motion .
Light from the moving telescope 's primary miror will be focused onto the scan mirror , which will move in the opposite direction at the same rate .
This allows the mission to take " freeze - frame " snapshots of the sky every 11 seconds .
That 's about 7,500 images a day .
" It 's wonderful to end the year with open WISE eyes , " said Peter Eisenhardt , the mission 's project scientist at JPL .
" Now we can synch WISE up to our scan mirror and get on with the business of exploring the infrared universe . "
WISE is scheduled to begin its survey of the infrared heavens in mid-January of 2010 .

Judge Allows Interplay To Publish “ Fallout Trilogy ” and Continue Work on Project V13
Bethesda Softworks , who developed Fallout 3 , has lost its attempt to stop Interplay from selling Fallout games , and as a result , could face competition from another Fallout game .
Interplay developed the original Fallout back in 1997 , but in 2007 it sold the Fallout license for US $ 5.75 million to Bethesda , who went on to develop the hugely successful Fallout 3 .
Interplay still owns the rights to Fallout ( 1997 ) , Fallout 2 ( 1998 ) and Fallout Tactics ( 2001 ) , but recently garnered Bethesda ’s ire over the packaging to the Fallout Trilogy , which Bethesda says is too similar to the packaging for Fallout 3 and so might mislead consumers into thinking it contained said game .
However , as reported by Gamasutra , a US District Court judge has ruled that a preliminary injunction request intended to prevent Interplay from continuing development on their Fallout MMO and from selling their Fallout Trilogy was denied .
The ruling is a blow to Bethesda ’s ongoing lawsuit against Interplay , who will be allowed to sell their Fallout Trilogy package , and more importantly , to continue the development of a rival Fallout game during the course of the lawsuit .
Interestingly , although the 2007 deal granted Bethesda with the right to develop Fallout and new Fallout content , it left Interplay with the rights to develop a MMO Fallout game .
Bethesda claimed that Interplay had failed to meet the criteria for developing this game ( the contract specified that the MMO had to begin development by 4th April 2009 ) , but this new ruling paves the way for Interplay to release an entirely new Fallout MMO .
Could this lead to two rival Fallouts ?

A Jewish settler moves a window after a house was demolished at an outpost near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Negohot November 16 , 2009 .
According to witnesses , several structures were demolished by Israeli authorities on Monday at an outpost that Israel considers illegal .
REUTERS / Baz Ratner
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A group of Israeli soldiers disobeyed orders Monday to help in the dismantling of several structures that Jewish settlers had built without government authorization in the occupied West Bank .
A military spokeswoman said two of the soldiers were sent to prison for 30 days and permanently dismissed from command or combat positions .
Several others were still being investigated , the spokeswoman said .
The mutiny followed a similar incident last month that raised concern in Israel about rebellion in the ranks of soldiers opposed on religious or political grounds to any settler evacuation in a future peace deal with the Palestinians .
“ It should be emphasized that the soldiers ’ actions were fundamentally wrong and contradictory to the ( military ’s ) core values , ” an army statement said about Monday ’s events .
A Reuters photographer at the scene , a settler - outpost erected without government permission outside the West Bank town of Hebron , said two wooden houses were dismantled by police .
The area was secured by soldiers from an infantry battalion , some of whom “ did not follow orders given to them , ” the army spokeswoman said , declining to provide exact numbers .
The YNet news Web site said six soldiers were relieved of duty .
Last month , a group of conscripts disrupted their swearing - in ceremony at Jerusalem ’s Western Wall , calling for continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank .
Palestinians say settlements could deny them a viable state .
The military said two soldiers were sentenced to 20 days in jail for their actions at the holy site and removed permanently from the unit .
In a report Sunday that stirred debate in Israel , the Haaretz newspaper said the chief military chaplain , Brigadier - General Avichai Rontzki , told religious conscripts last week to show no mercy toward their enemies .
ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkey ’s top court closed the only pro-Kurdish party in parliament on Friday for having links to PKK Kurdish rebels in a ruling that deals a fresh blow to the country ’s faltering bid to join the European Union .
Pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) leader Ahmet Turk addresses the media in front of his party headquarters in Ankara December 11 , 2009 .
Turkey 's top court on Friday closed the country 's main pro-Kurdish party for having links to PKK Kurdish rebels in a ruling that could undermine efforts to end a long - running conflict with the separatists .
The ruling imposes a five - year ban from politics on 37 members of the DTP , including Ahmet Turk .

The EU promptly issued a statement of concern , having warned that banning the Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) would violate Kurdish rights and could set back the government ’s drive to end decades of conflict with militant Kurdish separatists .
Turkey ’s Constitutional Court voted unanimously to ban the DTP after finding it guilty of cooperating with the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party ( PKK ) separatist guerrilla group .
“ The DTP ’s closure was decided due to its connections with the terror organization and because it became a focal point of the activities against the country ’s integrity , ” Constitutional Court Chairman Hasim Kilic said .
The ruling will raise political tensions and could hit sentiment in Turkish financial markets when they reopen .
“ Implications ... on Turkish assets will be negative for the short term due to a possible increase in the political risk premium , ” said Mehmet Ilgen from ATA Invest .
The decision was announced after markets had closed , but the lira currency slipped and bond yields rose in after - hours trade .
GAMBLE
With EU membership in mind , Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan ’s Islamist - rooted AK Party took a political gamble when he launched reforms to improve Kurds ’ cultural rights in the hope of ending a conflict that has cost more than 40,000 lives .
In courting Kurdish support , Erdogan incurred hostility from a conservative establishment , including the judiciary , that historically regards Kurdish aspirations for more autonomy as a threat to the secular state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk .
The PKK has fought for 25 years for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey .
The Kurds , who make up around 20 percent of the population but were for decades forbidden to use the Kurdish language , have long complained of discrimination .
The ruling bans 37 members of the DTP from politics for five years .
The DTP is the only Kurdish party in parliament , and controls about 100 municipalities in the southeast .
“ Turkey can not solve its problems by closing down parties , ” DTP chairman Ahmet Turk told reporters .
“ As long as our goal is a solution to the Kurdish problem , it does n’t matter who is banned or not from politics , because our determination to find a solution continues . ”
He had said all 21 DTP deputies in Turkey ’s 544 - seat parliament would resign if the party was banned , which could trigger a by - election in Kurdish districts .
Sweden , speaking for the EU , said that while it strongly denounced violence and terrorism , “ the dissolution of political parties is an exceptional measure that should be used with utmost restraint . ”
It said the EU would monitor further developments closely .
HISTORY OF BANS
Turkey has a long history of banning or overthrowing political parties deemed a threat to national security , including Islamists and Kurdish groups .
Analysts say the ban could strengthen the PKK ’s hand by undermining confidence in the democratic process and the government ’s Kurdish reform , backed by the United States as a way to help bring stability to neighboring Iraq .
Wolfango Piccoli , analyst at Eurasia , said the ruling would stoke ethnic tensions and hurt support for the AK Party among Kurds and nationalists ahead of a general election set for 2011 .
Residents of Diyarbakir , the main city in the mainly Kurdish southeast , which witnessed scenes of violence ahead of the verdict , voiced their disenchantment .
“ We think that to ban our political party , which reached its position with our votes , is an attack on democracy , ” said Orhan Altun , a Kurd in his 20s watching the announcement of the verdict on television in a cafe in Diyarbakir .
Many non-Kurds were unsympathetic .
“ I think this an appropriate decision .
What can I say ? ” said Ali Kaya , a Turk in his late 40s waiting for a bus in rainy Istanbul .
“ They did their best to split our country . ”
The 23 - year - old Nigerian , charged with attempting to destroy a US aircraft on its final approach to Detroit airport , was " recruited " in London and " groomed " in Yemen by the al Qaeda , a British newspaper has claimed .
Quoting security sources ,
The Times reported that the pictures emerging of undergraduate years of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a former president of the Islamic Society at University College London , suggests that he was recruited by Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda terror network in London .
According to the newspaper , one of the events he had organised took place in January 2007 , and included talks on Guantánamo Bay , the alleged torture of prisoners and the War on Terror .
In fact , Abdulmutallab is the fourth president of a London student Islamic society to face terrorist charges in three years .
One is facing a re-trial on charges that he was involved in the 2006 liquid bomb plot to blow up airliners .
Two others were convicted of terrorist offences since 2007 .
Abdulmutallab , who left UCL last year , also attempted to renew his student visa in May this year on basis of an application to study " life coaching " at a non-existent college , the newspaper said .
" That visa refusal may have saved Britain from an attack .
His terrorist training took a new turn in August when he moved to Yemen , to study Arabic , and was schooled by al Qaeda there .
Abdulmutallab featured on the periphery of one counterterrorism intelligence operation in Britain , " it said .
Abdulmutallab , the son of a wealthy Nigerian banker , is alleged to have set off an explosive device as the flight approached Detroit airport on Christmas Day .
The device caused a fire which burned his legs .
Al Qaeda , which has claimed the attack , said it failed due to a " faulty detonator " .

The nation lost only 11,000 jobs in November , the smallest number since the recession began in December 2007 .
Unemployment dipped to 10 percent last month , according to the Department of Labor , as job losses in the construction , manufacturing and information industries were offset by job gains in temporary help services and healthcare .
Labor said the 11,000 job losses meant payroll employment was " essentially unchanged " for the month .

The number of jobs lost was a huge surprise , as some economists had been bracing for a number between 100,000 and 150,000 .
In October , the nation lost 190,000 jobs , and in the previous three months , payroll job losses had averaged 135,000 a month .
Earlier this year , at the height of the economic downturn , monthly job losses were more than three times that rate .
Stocks rose on the news , with the S&P gaining more than 1 percent in morning trading .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs credited the $ 787 billion stimulus plan with kick - starting the economic recovery , but also warned there would be " bumps along the way " even as the recession eases .
" The president is pleased we continue to move in the right direction , " Gibbs said .
Republicans issuing statements also acknowledged the report is goods news , but said unemployment remains too high .
They also said the stimulus has not done as much to create jobs as promised by Democrats .
The biggest gains reported by Labor were in professional and business services , where employment grew by 86,000 in November .
Temporary help services accounted for the majority of the increase , adding 52,000 .
Temporary workers are often the first to lose jobs and to gain them back in a recession .
Since July , temporary help services employment has risen by 117,000 .
The average hourly workweek also rose by 0.2 hours to 33.2 hours .
This is significant , as employers will add hours for existing workers before hiring new workers .
Retailers are expecting a 1 percent drop in sales this Christmas season given high unemployment , and Labor reported that there was little change in wholesale and retail trade employment .
However , department stores did add 8,000 jobs over the month , the report said .
Economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute said the number of job losses was a surprise and the increase in the hourly workweek is good news .
But she said the economy will have to grow more than it did last month for the unemployment rate to begin falling more significantly .
Both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have been consumed with bringing down the unemployment rate , which had jumped from 9.8 percent to 10.2 in October .
The 10.2 percent rate was the highest in 26 years .
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaIt 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE on Thursday held a jobs summit attended by corporate CEOs and union leaders calling for the government to take action .
Obama left the White House Friday morning to travel to Allentown , Pa. to trumpet the new number and address Americans ' economic concerns as he kicks off his Main Street tour .
Democrats in the Senate and House are both preparing jobs bills after criticism that the $ 787 billion stimulus earlier this year did not do enough to stem job losses .
A high unemployment rate could be a disaster for Democrats in the 2010 midterm election if voters lose confidence in the party 's ability to handle the economy .
Before Friday 's report , many economists were projecting unemployment to remain in double digits into next year .
The White House 's own economic team expects the rate to average more than 9 percent in 2010 and more than 8 percent in 2011 .
It is unclear whether the latest data will change those projections .
Shierholz noted that the number of long - term unemployed people has continued to rise and now stands at 38 percent of those without jobs .
Those workers have been jobless for at least six months .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) underlined the peril to his party on Thursday .
“ If jobs do n't get into positive numbers , I think the people are going to continue to be concerned , ” he said .
“ And when they 're concerned , they look for somebody new , whether you 're a Republican or a Democrat . ”
The other problem for Democrats is the record budget deficit , which is exacerbated by high unemployment .
Benefits to the jobless have expanded as more have joined the unemployed , and the government is also taking in less tax revenue .
That makes it difficult to pass a jobs bill if it adds to the deficit .
Obama on Thursday said lawmakers should be more focused on bringing down unemployment than the deficit .
" If we can't grow our economy , then it is going to be that much harder for us to reduce the deficit , " he said .
" The single most important thing we could do right now for deficit reduction is strong economic growth , which means that people who 've got jobs are paying taxes and businesses that are making profits . . . are paying taxes . "
Still , Obama also said some efforts to spark job creation would have to be set aside because of their cost .
Gibbs on Friday said a proposal to use unspent funds from the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial system is " certainly being looked at . "
He also hinted the president could offer support for a new jobs bill in a speech he is set to deliver Tuesday on the economy .
But Gibbs said a new jobs bill would be smaller than the earlier stimulus .
" Is there gong to be another $ 787 billion plan ?
The answer is no , " he said .

THE SOURCE OF THE DEFICIT MESS ….
Republican lawmakers and far - right activists have suddenly discovered , after eight years of dramatic fiscal irresponsibility , that they care deeply about deficit reduction again .
Worse , they ’re absolutely convinced that President Obama and those free - spending Democrats are responsible , putting a terrible burden on future generations .
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report today , analyzing the existing deficit in detail , and what factors created it .
Here ’s hoping Republicans and Teabaggers are paying attention .
Some critics charge that the new policies pursued by President Obama and the 111th Congress generated the huge federal budget deficits that the nation now faces .
In fact , the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush , the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and the economic downturn together explain virtually the entire deficit over the next ten years .
The deficit for fiscal 2009 was $ 1.4 trillion and , at an estimated 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , was the largest deficit relative to the size of the economy since the end of World War II .
Under current policies , deficits will likely exceed $ 1 trillion in 2010 and 2011 and remain near that figure thereafter .
The events and policies that have pushed deficits to astronomical levels in the near term , however , were largely outside the new Administration ’s control .
If not for the tax cuts enacted during the Presidency of George W. Bush that Congress did not pay for , the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that began during that period , and the effects of the worst economic slump since the Great Depression ( including the cost of steps necessary to combat it ) , we would not be facing these huge deficits in the near term .
This is n’t just about pointing fingers for self - satisfaction or partisan vanity .
It ’s important for the public to realize who ’s responsible , in large part because it ’s important for the public to weigh policymakers ’ credibility .
If GOP lawmakers embraced policies that are almost entirely responsible for the deficit those same lawmakers are now complaining about , it ’s a relevant detail .
And on a related note , for those who believe deficit reduction must be a top national priority — a group that ’s apparently pretty large — it ’s important to recognize which party ’s proposals are effective in improving , or not , the fiscal landscape .
President Obama will deserve plenty of blame over the course of his presidency , but holding him responsible for getting us into this budgetary mess does n’t make sense .
LOS ANGELES 
On many nights this fall , it has been possible to tune in to broadcast network television during prime time and hear a character call someone else a “ douche . ”
In just the last several weeks , it has happened on CBS ’s “ The New Adventures of Old Christine ” and the CW ’s “ The Vampire Diaries , ” which are broadcast at 8 p.m. , during what used to be known as the family hour .
It has been heard this fall on Fox ’s new series “ The Cleveland Show , ” which begins at 8:30 , and on ABC ’s “ Grey ’s Anatomy . ”
On NBC , its use has spanned the old and the new , blurted out on the freshman comedy “ Community ” and the seasoned drama “ Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . ”
In total , the word has surfaced at least 76 times already this year on 26 prime - time network series , according to research by the Parents Television Council , which compiled the statistics at the request of The New York Times .
That is up from 30 uses on 15 shows in all of 2007 and just six instances on four programs in 2005 .
Ever since George Carlin laid out the “ Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television ” in 1972 , television writers and broadcasters have been digging more deeply into the thesaurus , seizing on new ways to titillate , if not offend .
And while the word “ douche ” is neither obscene nor profane  although this usage is certainly offensive to many people  it seems to represent the latest of broadcast television ’s continuing efforts to expand the boundaries of taste , in part to stem the tide of defections by its audience to largely unregulated cable television .
Leucochloridium : The Zombie Snail Worm Written by Jonathan Wojcik 3/17/2013
Imagine the every day life of a garden snail .
Prone to drying out , you avoid the dessicating rays of the sun as you slither in the shadows beneath the dense foliage , eating anything chewable you find in your slimy path .
One day , you catch a whiff of fresh bird droppings ; to you , a delicious and nutritious meal , and slurp the gooey treat into your jawless throat .
Days pass , and you start to feel strange - at least as strange as your simple nervous system can muster - and against all logic , you ooze your way out into the hot , bright daylight your kind has spent millions of years hiding from .
You go about your snaily business as you always would , but this time , you 're completely exposed , both to the light and to the eyes of hungry birds .
Your foul tasting slime has taught most avians that snails are an unappetizing meal , but unfortunately for you , you no longer look like a normal snail ...
By Hanne Sundin - more gifs and invertebrates under link !
Those droppings you ate were swarming with the eggs of a parasitic flatworm in the genus Leucochloridium .
Invading your simple little gastropod brain , the parasites have impaired your normal behavior , and with their colorful , pulsing " brood sacs " crammed into your eye - stalks , your head now resembles a couple of fat , juicy insect larvae - every bird 's favorite .
You 'll likely survive your eyestalks being ripped off , and eventually , your entire face will grow back ... as will the parasites .
You 're lucky evolution never granted you the intellect to comprehend your new existence , enslaved by a worm in your brain to have your eyes chewed off again and again .
Genus Leucochloridium are Trematode flatworms in their own family , the Leucochloridiidae .
At least nine species have been described , from L. caryocatactis in 1800 to L. perturbatum discovered in 1969 .
Perhaps the most famous are L. paradoxum , found in several European countries , and L. variae , found in North America .
The first I ever learned of these incredible creatures was in a children 's book whose title escapes me .
Interestingly enough , the book was all about the possibility of life on other planets , and used the parasite as an example of of just how inhuman an organism can be - an excellent choice , though it did n't provide any photographs .
It would be many years before I could look them up on the internet , and they were only more magnificent than I had ever imagined .
Some particularly glamorous shots can also be seen here , here , and here .

Le Papillon Rouge : The Entomologist 's Dream
The Entomologist 's Dream is an illustration for the story , Le Papillon Rouge ( The Red Butterfly ) by Gerard D'Houville .
The story was published in the Christmas 1909 edition of L'Illustration , the French news and art magazine .
In the story , the entomologist is driven mad by his failure to find a blood red butterfly for the lady whose attentions he seeks .
One night , after many years of searching , he ransacks his entire butterfly collection .
As he frees the insects from their cases , they magically wake and fly off into the night .
The entomologist is heartbroken , and is discovered dead in the morning .
An adult was caught supplying liquor to a minor and 73 drivers were caught drink driving throughout Queensland during the nationwide Operation Unite on Friday night .
On the opening night of the blitz Queensland police attended 867 licensed establishments and detected 101 licensing breaches , handed out 156 liquor infringement notices and forced 135 people to move on .
Apart from the crackdown on alcohol - related violence , police also dealt with a number of juveniles during the operation .
A dozen juveniles were arrested , nine were cautioned and seven issued with Notices to Appear .
A police spokeswoman said the details relating to the adult supplying liquor to a minor were not available but the incident occured in Townsville .
Police Minister Neil Roberts said the police presence confirmed the government 's stance to eradicate alcohol - related violence .
" This type of behaviour is unacceptable and Operations Merit and Unite demonstrate that the Bligh government and Queensland Police Service are responding proactively to the issue , " he said .
Police performed more than 7,300 random breath tests with one per cent of those tested found to be over the limit .
SAN FRANCISCO – Google will become directly involved in deploying energy technologies , the company 's director of climate initiatives said Monday .
The company has long supported and invested in renewable energy but kept its participation to greening its campus and funding several solar , wind and geothermal companies .
In September , Google announced it was internally developing a new mirror for solar thermal plants .
Now , the company may wade even further into the energy sector .
" We 'll make a step soon into energy projects , " Dan Reicher , director of climate change and energy initiatives at Google , told a group of energy experts assembled in the cafeteria at the company 's swanky San Francisco office .
That could mean Google starts directly financing power plants .
Throughout the energy innovation event , which also featured energy leaders from Stanford , MIT and UC Berkeley , Reicher stressed the importance of going beyond just research and development to deploying innovative energy technologies .
" Energy innovation to me means a real pipeline that goes from basic research to applied research to demonstration projects to the scale up and from there to full commercial deployment , " Reicher said .
" It 's a long pipeline and to be honest we do n't do a very good job of moving technologies through this pipeline . "
Reicher said the Googlers have even coined a clever phrase to describe their vision of energy policy : " from light bulb to light bulb . "
They want to help move new technologies from the idea ( the first light bulb ) to the product ( the second light bulb ) .
He championed an idea bouncing around Congress to create a Clean Energy Deployment Administration , which would help green tech companies get large power plants built .
But with a ballooning federal deficit and rough economy , it 's hard to know where the money will come from .
Reicher and the other panelists agreed that energy R&D funding should be around $ 15 billion a year .
MIT physicist Ernie Moniz warned several times that the current increase in energy research came courtesy of the stimulus bill , which wo n't be around forever .
" We 're going to have to see what happens after these next two years because what we need is not a drop but a further increase in RD&D funding commensurate with the task at hand , " Moniz said .
One idea for raising funds is to shift it from other places within government through standard appropriations , but Moniz suggested a different kind of funding base .
A small charge could be added to electricity usage , which would add up to a very large sum – the Office Space funding model .
Charging about four - tenths of a cent per kilowatt on the 3,669,919 million kilowatt hours of electricity used in the United States would yield the $ 15 billion dollars the energy researchers want .
That would essentially be a 5 percent tax on the average cost of a kilowatt hour .
Moniz said the idea had worked before .
A successful program taxed natural gas transmission across state lines to fund the non-profit Gas Research Institute , beginning in 1976 .

Advertisement A shaken Pope Benedict has celebrated Christmas Eve Mass in St Peter 's Basilica shortly after being knocked over by a female spectator .
The woman , said to be mentally unstable , managed to grab him by his vestments near the neck as a security guard tried to overwhelm her .
The Vatican said she had also tried to jump at the Pope last year .
French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray , 87 , was standing a few metres away and fell and broke his hip during the incident .
Proceeding with the Mass , Benedict looked shaken and stumbled over some words .
The Vatican later said the Pope was unharmed and would give Mass on Christmas Day as planned .
" It was an assault , but it was n't dangerous because she was n't armed , " said Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi .
The Holy Father went down and all of a sudden all the security people were all on top of it
Marybeth Burns
Eyewitness
The BBC's David Willey , in Rome , says the woman is now undergoing checks at a medical facility in Rome .
Vatican officials named her as 25 - year - old Susanna Maiolo and said she held dual Swiss and Italian nationality .
The Christmas Eve service in the Vatican started two hours early because officials did not want the pontiff , 82 , to get tired .
Repeat incident Dressed in a red hooded sweatshirt , the attacker leaped over the barrier towards the Pope , prompting gasps from the crowd .
ANALYSIS David Willey , BBC News , Rome The Pope will next year celebrate his 83rd birthday .
He is in relatively good health for his age but he was clearly shaken by the incident and stumbled several times over words in his homily .
This was undoubtedly the most serious breach of security inside the Vatican in recent years .
Although the Pope was physically unharmed by this sudden attack , security arrangements at papal ceremonies will have to be urgently reviewed as there was apparently a similar , but unsuccessful , attempt to hurt the Pope last Christmas .
Eyewitness Marybeth Burns , a US tourist , told the Associated Press the woman " sort of flew over the barricade " .
" The Holy Father went down and all of a sudden all the security people were all on top of it , you know the whole pile there , getting her off and pulling him back up , " she said .
Security officials rushed down the main aisle to detain the woman , who was later arrested by police .
Vatican security staff said they recognised the woman as being the same person who had tried to jump a barricade to get close to the Pope at the same service last year .
The Pope had to be helped up by his master of ceremonies .
The pontiff had earlier appeared briefly at nightfall at the window of his studio to light a candle in a sign of peace .
Tourism boom Meanwhile in Bethlehem thousands of pilgrims saw Latin Patriarch Foud Twal , the most senior Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land , deliver his Christmas message .
" The wish that we most want , we most hope for , is not coming - we want peace , " he said after arriving in Bethlehem after the traditional holiday procession from nearby Jerusalem .
Festivities in Bethlehem began with a traditional boy scout band and ended with midnight Mass in St Catherine 's Church , next to the Church of the Nativity .

Arriving in Bethlehem , the Latin Patriarch said people in the region wanted freedom of movement .
" We do n't want walls , we do n't want separation fences . "
Addressing worshippers , he added : " [ This land 's ] inhabitants are brothers who see each other as enemies .
" This land will deserve to be called holy when she breathes freedom , justice , love , reconciliation , peace and security . "
The Mass was said next to a church built over the stall where Mary is believed to have given birth to Jesus .
Some 300 Christians over the age of 35 from the Gaza Strip were given permission by the Israeli military to leave the territory and come to Bethlehem for 24 hours to celebrate Christmas .
A total of 15,000 tourists are expected in the town during this period , in a year that has seen a record number of visitors - some 1.6 million .

THE FUTURE ...
With an emphasis on crew and vehicle survivability combined with a radically altered approach to fire suppression , the AMATOYA Fire Reconnaissance Vehicle is dramatically separated from any existing appliance in operation .
The use of contemporary technology , materials , finish and form , encourages desirable attributes of safety , mobility , efficiency and performance .
In an extreme fire event any measure of advantage is welcomed in a very real situation where seconds count .
The AMATOYA concept provides the monumental ability to sustain reconnaissance work without impairing mobility or compromising the safety of operating crew developing a revolutionary dimension to fire suppression which has yet been explored .
While idealistic in its execution , the project endeavours to question the adequacy of existing appliances and suppression strategies .
The goal is not to dismantle a system which has been utilised for over 70 years , but rather to modernise and homogenise , to ask the question and demonstrate just what may be possible in the future .

Comet Hyakutake Passes the Earth
Credit & Copyright : Doug Zubenel ( TWAN )
Explanation :
In 1996 , an unexpectedly bright comet passed by planet Earth .
Discovered less than two months before , Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake came within only 1/10th of the Earth - Sun distance from the Earth in late March .
At that time , Comet Hyakutake , dubbed the Great Comet of 1996 , became the brightest comet to grace the skies of Earth in 20 years .
During its previous visit , Comet Hyakutake may well have been seen by the stone age Magdalenian culture , who 17,000 years ago were possibly among the first humans to live in tents as well as caves .
Pictured above near closest approach as it appeared on 1996 March 26 , the long ion and dust tails of Comet Hyakutake are visible flowing off to the left in front of a distant star field that includes both the Big and Little Dippers .
On the far left , the blue ion tail appears to have recently undergone a magnetic disconnection event .
On the far right , the comet 's green - tinted coma obscures a dense nucleus of melting dirty ice estimated to be about 5 kilometers across .
A few months later , Comet Hyakutake began its long trek back to the outer Solar System .
Because of being gravitationally deflected by massive planets , Comet Hyakutake is not expected back for about 100,000 years .
The way that these mostly male creators and executives portray female sexuality include women who resemble Victoria ’s Secret models , voracious female libidos and routine pairings of older men with women 20 and 30 years younger .
The new film “ Crazy Heart , ” released this week , which matches Jeff Bridges , 60 , and Maggie Gyllenhaal , 32 , is just the latest example .

“ The Proposal , ” a hit over the summer that starred Sandra Bullock , 45 , and Ryan Reynolds , 33 , is among the few films that switch the age disparity .
Generally , in these sorts of films , Dr. Lauzen noted , “ the entire story has to revolve around explaining that relationship , because how can it be that a younger man would find an older woman attractive . ”
An older man - younger woman relationship , by contrast , is “ just accepted , no explanation needed . ”
Exceptions to the male view are “ startling because you almost never see them , ” Dr. Lauzen added , mentioning as an example the TNT cable series “ Saving Grace , ” which stars Holly Hunter and was created by a woman , Nancy Miller , who also serves as executive producer .
In scenes that depicted Grace ’s lover fulfilling her sexual desires without reciprocation , “ it was about her pleasure , not his pleasure , ” Dr. Lauzen said .
One twist in the new film “ Up In the Air ” is that a female character exhibits what is considered typical male behavior : sex without emotional attachment .
Ms. Ruhl , who spoke from her home in New York , said : “ We get a lot of the male gaze on female sexuality .
In the theater , a lot of woman have to be naked onstage . ”
In “ In the Next Room , ” Dr. Givings ( Michael Cerveris ) ends up standing in front of the audience , nude , while his wife ( Laura Benanti ) does not .
“ I do n’t take it lightly to ask an actor to take his clothes off onstage , ” Ms. Ruhl said , but added that she felt that it was important in this context .
“ It is about his character ’s vulnerability , but also about her looking at him .
I feel we see a lot of examples of men looking at women , and audiences ’ being asked to take the male point of view .
We ’re so unconscious of it . ”

( CNN ) --
A sign synonymous with the Nazi work camps of World War II was stolen overnight from the Auschwitz Concentration Camp memorial in Poland , police said Friday .
Police were " alerted at 5 a.m. local time on Friday by museum guards " that the infamous sign reading " Arbeit Macht Frei " -- " Work Sets You Free " in German -- was stolen , according to police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel .
The heavy iron sign " was removed by being unscrewed on one side and pulled off on the other , " Szczygiel said .
" It is also believed that this was a planned event and that several people were involved as the sign was at remarkable height . "
Police have launched an investigation .
The chairman of Yad Vashem , Israel 's Holocaust museum , called the theft shocking .
" While we do n't yet know exactly who stole the sign , the theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust , and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days , " said Avner Shalev .
" I call on all enlightened forces in the world -- who fight against anti-semitism , racism , xenophobia and the hatred of the other -- to join together to combat these trends , " he said .
More than 1 million people died in the Auschwitz - Birkenau concentration camp complex ; about 90 percent of the victims were Jews .
Rabbi Marvin Hier , founder and dean of the Los Angeles - based Simon Wiesenthal Center , called the sign " the defining symbol of the Holocaust " and urged authorities to intensify their investigation .
" Everyone knew that this was not a place where work makes you free , but it was the place where millions of men , women , and children were brought for one purpose only -- to be murdered , " Hier said .
" The audacity and boldness of this crime deserves the full attention of the Polish government . "
The center calls itself one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations .

BOSTON  When Massachusetts began offering virtually free treatments to help poor residents of the state stop smoking in 2006 , proponents hoped the new Medicaid program would someday reap benefits .
But state officials never expected it would happen so soon .
New state data show a steep drop in the smoking rate among poor people .
When the program started , about 38 percent of poor Massachusetts residents smoked .
By 2008 , the smoking rate for poor residents had dropped to about 28 percent , a decrease of about 30,000 people in two and a half years , or one in six smokers , said Lois Keithly , director of the state ’s Tobacco Cessation and Prevention Program .
There are also indications that the drop has lowered rates of hospitalization for heart attacks and emergency room visits for asthma attacks , she said .
The data has not yet been peer - reviewed .
But the numbers have already grabbed national attention , with several United States senators and antismoking advocates using the data to push for similar new Medicaid coverage for tobacco addiction in the national health care legislation .

In a world first , a Monash University - led international research team has developed an innovative way to boost the output of the next generation of solar cells .
Scientists at Monash University , in collaboration with colleagues from the universities of Wollongong and Ulm in Germany , have produced tandem dye - sensitised solar cells with a three - fold increase in energy conversion efficiency compared with previously reported tandem dye - sensitised solar cells .
Lead researcher Dr Udo Bach , from Monash University , said the breakthrough had the potential to increase the energy generation performance of the cells and make them a viable and competitive alternative to traditional silicon solar cells .
Dr Bach said the key was the discovery of a new , more efficient type of dye that made the operation of inverse dye - sensitised solar cells much more efficient .
When the research team combined two types of dye - sensitised solar cell - one inverse and the other classic - into a simple stack , they were able to produce for the first time a tandem solar cell that exceeded the efficiency of its individual components .
" The tandem approach - stacking many solar cells together - has been successfully used in conventional photovoltaic devices to maximise energy generation , but there have been obstacles in doing this with dye - sensitised cells because there has not been a method for creating an inverse system that would allow dye molecules to efficiently pass on positive charges to a semiconductor when illuminated with light , " Dr Bach said .
" Inverse dye - sensitised solar cells are the key to producing dye - sensitised tandem solar cells , but the challenge has been to find a way to make them perform more effectively .
By creating a way of making inverse dye - sensitised solar cells operate very efficiently we have opened the way for dye - sensitised tandem solar cells to become a commercial reality . "
Although dye - sensitised solar cells have been the focus of research for a number of years because they can be fabricated with relative simplicity and cost - efficiency , their effectiveness has not been on par with high - performance silicon solar cells .
Dr Bach said the breakthrough , which is detailed in a paper published in Nature Materials , was an important milestone in the ongoing development of viable and efficient solar cell technology .
" While this new tandem technology is still in its early infancy , it represents an important first step towards the development of the next generation of solar cells that can be produced at low cost and with energy efficient production methods , " he said .
" With this innovation we are one step closer to the creation of a cost - efficient and carbon - neutral energy source . "

Venture characters have a way of coming back again and again , even after their untimely deaths ( Colonel Gentleman , anyone ? ) .
Still , there are a couple of awesome characters that somehow fell between the seat cushions of the velvety sofa that is The Venture Bros .
Here are 10 of our favorites that only showed up once , but burned brightly for a brief moment .
10 . Dr. Dugong
Poor Dr. Dugong .
All he ever wanted was the secrets of love and caring .
But with a face like that , it ’s probably a secret he took to his grave .
9 . The Nozzle
You might argue that The Nozzle is not really a character .
And if you do , you might also argue that you really have a social life .
But we already know the truth now , Joykill .
8. The Cleaner
All of this with just a spray bottle .
You should really see what this guy can do with a Swiffer .
7. Scott Hall
Poor Scott proves the only truism of the Venture universe :
The more emotionally stable , the closer to death you are .
6. The Ghost of Abraham Lincoln
Abraham Lincoln , The Great Unifier , is back to end the conflict of brother versus brother in a purely disgusting ( and illegal ) way .
5. Klaus and Iggy
Actually , supervillainy might be the most plausible explanation for Klaus Nomi ’s career .
4. Groovy and the Gang
The real mystery is how bad that van must stink .
Wet dogs , stale cigarettes and old radicals do n’t sound like an appealing aroma combination .
3. King Gorilla
This might be the best monologue about love delivered to someone sitting in poop water .
2. Nancy and Drew
We never understood the whole fascination with twins thing .
Sure , you get two girls at once , but they ’re sisters and you have to carry that horrible incest-y awfulness with you for the rest of your life .
1. The Grand Galactic Inquisitor
You have to save number one for a being so powerful you can feel his voice in your chodeys .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - For months , Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid exhorted his fellow senators to vote yes on healthcare reform .
But when the big moment came on Thursday , he momentarily voted no -- by mistake .
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) listens to remarks after the U.S. Senate approved President Barack Obama 's healthcare overhaul on Capitol Hill in Washington , December 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
Reid , who has spent weeks in round - the - clock negotiations over the massive legislation , threw up his arms , bowed his head and quickly corrected his mistake , voting yes for the overhaul that is a top priority for President Barack Obama .
“ I spent a very restless night last night trying to figure out how I could show some bipartisanship .
And I think I was able to accomplish that for a few minutes today , ” Reid quipped at a news conference after majority Democrats passed the bill over solid Republican opposition .
The vote was 60 - 39 , along strict party lines .
No Republicans voted for the bill and all Democrats and independents supported the measure .
Republican Senator Jim Bunning missed the vote .
It was n’t the only moment of drama during the early morning Senate vote on Christmas Eve after four weeks of nonstop debate .
Senator Robert Byrd , the 92 - year - old Democrat from West Virginia , cast his vote in favor of the bill , invoking the name of the late Senator Edward Kennedy who championed healthcare coverage for every American during his nearly half century of service in Congress .
“ This is for my friend Ted Kennedy , ” Byrd said .
Kennedy died in August of brain cancer .
Although Kennedy did not live to witness Senate passage of healthcare reform , his memory was very much alive .
“ I wish Ted Kennedy were here with us today to enjoy this , ” Senator Christopher Dodd said following the vote .
Kennedy ’s widow , Vicki Kennedy , was present in the Senate chamber for the vote .
So was Representative John Dingell , a Michigan Democrat who has worked for decades for universal healthcare coverage , carrying on the legacy of his father who first introduced healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1943 .

Seven Turkish soldiers have been shot dead after gunmen opened fire on a military unit in northern Turkey , officials have said .
A further four soldiers were injured in the attack , which took place in the town of Resadiye in Tokat province .
There was no immediate indication of who was behind the attack .
However , both Kurdish and leftist militants have come under suspicion .
Attacks on military bases in the north of the country are , however , rare .
Rising tensions
According to one local television report , the soldiers were on patrol near a military outpost in a mountainous area and during foggy weather when they came under fire .
It was the worst attack since April when Kurdish militants killed 10 soldiers with a remote - controlled bomb in the country 's southeast .
The ambush came as Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was preparing to meet President Barack Obama in Washington .
Government moves to improve Kurdish rights are likely to be on the agenda .
There have been rising ethnic tensions over recent days ahead of a court hearing on whether the country 's largest pro-Kurdish political party , the Democratic Society Party , should be closed down .
On Sunday , one man died in clashes between police and protesters in the south - east of the country .
In the past , the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) has carried out attacks on military targets .
Extreme leftist groups active in northern Turkey are believed to have signed co-operation pacts with the PKK .
Those of you following the Smoking Gun at Darwin Zero post ( from Watts Up With That web site )
I made yesterday will have already noted that it is essential in order to scrutinise the data feeding into the IPCC and CRU climate models that we have access to the raw data , the adjustments to that raw data , and the reasons for the adjustments which I will assume have been documented in a professional and reproducible manner as all good scientists would do without question .
We hear climate alarmists saying that yes the Climategate scientists at the CRU destroyed emails , and hid from Freedom of information Acts , messed with proxies , and fought to keep other scientists ’ papers out of the journals … but that does n’t affect the data , the data is still good .
Well Willis Esenbach ’s research shown over on Watts Up With That casts serious doubt on that belief .
Just out of interest I decided to plot the raw temperature data for my home city of Brisbane , Australia from the GISS ( ie the raw GHCN data ) against the homogenized or adjusted GISS GHCN data .
The temperature sensor is located at the Brisbane Eagle Farm Airport which is now our busy main international airport .
The data used is the series available from 1950 to 2008 .
I have animated the result to highlight the difference .
As you can see the raw data shows a downward trend of about - 0.6 C per century .
The adjusted data however shows an opposite trend of +0.6 C per century .
Intuitively as the airport grew from a quiet strip to a busy international jet airport one would think the more recent data would be adjusted downwards for the heat island effect .
Instead we see that the data prior to 1978 is adjusted down and the data in recent times was adjusted up .
This is why it is essential that the relevant scientists disclose the reasons for each adjustment - the entire warming trend in the Brisbane data is due to the adjustments as the raw data clearly shows a cooling trend .
Without being able to check the veracity of the adjustments used the trend cannot be relied upon .
Our default position must be that until all data is made available to other scientists to scrutinize and test the data temperature data used to derive the graphs and models used by the IPCC is not to be relied upon for climate modeling or policy making .
Now that the cat is out of the bag failure by the data keepers to disclose this data is in direct contravention to UN scientific procedures and indicates that the data has not been dealt with either in a competent or an honest manner .

Communist Zealots : the Anabaptists
Sometimes Martin Luther must have felt that he had loosed the whirlwind , even opened the gates of Hell .
Shortly after Luther launched the Reformation , various Anabaptist sects appeared and spread throughout Germany .
The Anabaptists believed in predestination of the elect , but they also believed , in contrast to Luther , that they knew infallibly who the elect were : i.e. , themselves .
The sign of that election was in an emotional , mystical conversion process , that of being “ born again , ” baptized in the Holy Spirit .
Such baptism must be adult and not among infants ; more to the point , it meant that only the elect are to be sect members who obey the multifarious rules and creeds of the Church .
The idea of the sect , in contrast to Catholicism , Lutheranism , or Calvinism , was not comprehensive Church membership in the society .
The sect was to be distinctly separate , for the elect only .
Given that creed , there were two ways that Anabaptism could and did go .
Most Anabaptists , like the Mennonites or Amish , became virtual anarchists .
They tried to separate themselves as much as possible from a necessarily sinful state and society , and engaged in nonviolent resistance to the state ’s decrees .
The other route , taken by another wing of Anabaptists , was to try to seize power in the state and to shape up the majority by extreme coercion : in short , ultratheocracy .
As Monsignor Knox incisively points out , even when Calvin established a theocracy in Geneva , it had to pale beside one which might be established by a prophet enjoying continuous , new , mystical revelation .
As Knox points out , in his usual scintillating style :
… in Calvin ’s Geneva … and in the Puritan colonies of America , the left wing of the Reformation signalized its ascendancy by enforcing the rigorism of its morals with every available machinery of discipline ; by excommunication , or , if that failed , by secular punishment .
Under such discipline sin became a crime , to be punished by the elect with an intolerable self - righteousness …
I have called this rigorist attitude a pale shadow of the theocratic principle , because a full - blooded theocracy demands the presence of a divinely inspired leader or leaders , to whom government belongs by right of mystical illumination .
The great Reformers were not , it must be insisted , men of this calibre ; they were pundits , men of the new learning … [ 1 ]
And so one of the crucial differences between the Anabaptists and the more conservative reformers was that the former claimed continuing mystical revelation to themselves , forcing men such as Luther and Calvin to fall back on the Bible alone as the first as well as the last revelation .

The first leader of the ultratheocrat wing of the Anabaptists was Thomas Müntzer ( c. 1489 –1525 ) .
Born into comfort in Stolberg in Thuringia , Müntzer studied at the Universities of Leipzig and Frankfurt , and became highly learned in the scriptures , the classics , theology , and in the writings of the German mystics .
Becoming a follower almost as soon as Luther launched the Reformation in 1520 , Müntzer was recommended by Luther for the pastorate in the city of Zwickau .
Zwickau was near the Bohemian border , and there the restless Müntzer was converted by the weaver and adept Niklas Storch , who had been in Bohemia , to the old Taborite doctrine that had flourished in Bohemia a century earlier .
This doctrine consisted essentially of a continuing mystical revelation and the necessity for the elect to seize power and impose a society of theocratic communism by brutal force of arms .
Furthermore , marriage was to be prohibited , and each man was to be able to have any woman at his will .
The passive wing of Anabaptists were voluntary anarchocommunists , who wished to live peacefully by themselves ; but Müntzer adopted the Storch vision of blood and coercion .
Defecting very rapidly from Lutheranism , Müntzer felt himself to be the coming prophet , and his teachings now began to emphasize a war of blood and extermination to be waged by the elect against the sinners .
Müntzer claimed that the “ living Christ ” had permanently entered his own soul ; endowed thereby with perfect insight into the divine will , Müntzer asserted himself to be uniquely qualified to fulfil the divine mission .
He even spoke of himself as “ becoming God . ”
Abandoning the world of learning , Müntzer was now ready for action .
In 1521 , only a year after his arrival , the town council of Zwickau took fright at these increasingly popular ravings and ordered Müntzer ’s expulsion from the city .
In protest , a large number of the populace , in particular the weavers , led by Niklas Storch , rose in revolt , but the rising was put down .
At that point , Müntzer hied himself to Prague , searching for Taborite remnants in the capital of Bohemia .
Speaking in peasant metaphors , he declared that harvest time is here , “ so God himself has hired me for his harvest .
I have sharpened my scythe , for my thoughts are most strongly fixed on the truth , and my lips , hands , skin , hair , soul , body , life curse the unbelievers . ”
Müntzer , however , found no Taborite remnants ; it did not help the prophet ’s popularity that he knew no Czech , and had to preach with the aid of an interpreter .
And so he was duly expelled from Prague .
After wandering around central Germany in poverty for several years , signing himself “ Christ ’s messenger , ” Müntzer in 1523 gained a ministerial position in the small Thuringian town of Allstedt .
There he established a wide reputation as a preacher employing the vernacular , and began to attract a large following of uneducated miners , whom he formed into a revolutionary organization called “ The League of the Elect . ”
A turning point in Müntzer ’s stormy career came a year later , when Duke John , a prince of Saxony and a Lutheran , hearing alarming rumours about him , came to little Allstedt and asked Müntzer to preach him a sermon .
This was Müntzer ’s opportunity , and he seized it .
He laid it on the line : he called upon the Saxon princes to make their choice and take their stand , either as servants of God or of the Devil .
If the Saxon princes are to take their stand with God , then they “ must lay on with the sword . ”
“ Do n’t let them live any longer , ” counselled our prophet , “ the evil - doers who turn us away from God .
For a godless man has no right to live if he hinders the godly . ”
Müntzer ’s definition of the “ godless , ” of course , was all - inclusive .
“ The sword is necessary to exterminate ” priests , monks and godless rulers .
But , Müntzer warned , if the princes of Saxony fail in this task , if they falter , “ the sword shall be taken from them …
If they resist , let them be slaughtered without mercy … . ”
Müntzer then returned to his favorite harvest - time analogy : “ At the harvest - time , one must pluck the weeds out of God ’s vineyard …
For the ungodly have no right to live , save what the Elect chooses to allow them … . ”
In this way the millennium , the thousand - year Kingdom of God on earth , would be ushered in .
But one key requisite is necessary for the princes to perform that task successfully ; they must have at their elbow a priest / prophet ( guess who ! ) to inspire and guide their efforts .
Oddly enough for an era when no First Amendment restrained rulers from dealing sternly with heresy , Duke John seemed not to care about Müntzer ’s frenetic ultimatum .
Even after Müntzer proceeded to preach a sermon proclaiming the imminent overthrow of all tyrants and the beginning of the messianic kingdom , the duke did nothing .
Finally , under the insistent prodding of Luther that Müntzer was becoming dangerous , Duke John told the prophet to refrain from any provocative preaching until his case was decided by his brother , the elector .
This mild reaction by the Saxon princes , however , was enough to set Thomas Müntzer on his final revolutionary road .
The princes had proved themselves untrustworthy ; the mass of the poor were now to make the revolution .
The poor were the elect , and would establish a rule of compulsory egalitarian communism , a world where all things would be owned in common by all , where everyone would be equal in everything and each person would receive according to his need .
But not yet .
For even the poor must first be broken of worldly desires and frivolous enjoyments , and must recognize the leadership of a new “ servant of God ” who “ must stand forth in the spirit of Elijah … and set things in motion . ”
( Again , guess who ! )
Seeing Saxony as inhospitable , Müntzer climbed over the town wall of Allstedt and moved in 1524 to the Thuringian city of Muhlhausen .
An expert in fishing in troubled waters , Müntzer found a friendly home in Muhlhausen , which had been in a state of political turmoil for over a year .
Preaching the impending extermination of the ungodly , Müntzer paraded around the town at the head of an armed band , carrying in front of him a red crucifix and a naked sword .
Expelled from Muhlhausen after a revolt by his allies was suppressed , Müntzer went to Nuremberg , which in turn expelled him after he published some revolutionary pamphlets .
After wandering through southwestern Germany , Müntzer was invited back to Muhlhausen in February 1525 , where a revolutionary group had taken over .
Thomas Müntzer and his allies proceeded to impose a communist regime on the city of Muhlhausen .
The monasteries were seized , and all property was decreed to be in common , and the consequence , as a contemporary observer noted , was that “ he so affected the folk that no one wanted to work . ”
The result was that the theory of communism and love quickly became in practice an alibi for systemic theft :
… when anyone needed food or clothing he went to a rich man and demanded it of him in Christ ’s name , for Christ had commanded that all should share with the needy .
And what was not given freely was taken by force .
Many acted thus … Thomas [ Müntzer ] instituted this brigandage and multiplied it every day . [ 2 ]
At that point , the great Peasants ’
War erupted throughout Germany , a rebellion launched by the peasantry in favor of their local autonomy and in opposition to the new centralizing , high - tax , absolutist rule of the German princes .
Throughout Germany , the princes crushed the feebly armed peasantry with great brutality , massacring about 100,000 peasants in the process .
In Thuringia , the army of the princes confronted the peasants on May 15 with a great deal of artillery and 2,000 cavalry , luxuries denied to the peasantry .
The landgrave of Hesse , commander of the princes ’ army , offered amnesty to the peasants if they would hand over Müntzer and his immediate followers .
The peasants were strongly tempted , but Müntzer , holding aloft his naked sword , gave his last flaming speech , declaring that God had personally promised him victory ; that he would catch all the enemy cannon balls in the sleeves of his cloak ; that God would protect them all .
Just at the strategic moment of Müntzer ’s speech , a rainbow appeared in the heavens , and Müntzer had previously adopted the rainbow as the symbol of his movement .
To the credulous and confused peasantry , this seemed a veritable sign from Heaven .
Unfortunately , the sign did n’t work , and the princes ’ army crushed the peasants , killing 5,000 while losing only half a dozen men .
Müntzer himself fled and hid , but was captured a few days later , tortured into confession , and then executed .
Thomas Müntzer and his signs may have been defeated , and his body may have moldered in the grave , but his soul kept marching on .
Not only was his spirit kept alive by followers in his own day , but also by Marxist historians from Engels to the present day , who saw in this deluded mystic an epitome of social revolution and the class struggle , and a forerunner of the chiliastic prophesies of the “ communist stage ” of the supposedly inevitable Marxian future .
The Müntzerian cause was soon picked up by a former disciple , the bookbinder Hans Hut .
Hut claimed to be a prophet sent by God to announce that at Whitsuntide , 1528 , Christ would return to earth and give the power to enforce justice to Hut and his following of rebaptized saints .
The saints would then “ take up double - edged swords ” and wreak God ’s vengeance on priests , pastors , kings and nobles .
Hut and his followers would then “ establish the rule of Hans Hut on earth , ” with Muhlhausen as the favored capital .
Christ was then to establish a millennium marked by communism and free love .
Hut was captured in 1527 ( before Jesus had had a chance to return ) , imprisoned at Augsburg , and killed trying to escape .
For a year or two , Huttian followers kept emerging , at Augsburg , Nuremberg , and Esslingen , in southern Germany , threatening to set up their communist Kingdom of God by force of arms .
But by 1530 they were smashed and suppressed by the alarmed authorities .
Müntzerian - type Anabaptism was now to move to northwestern Germany .
Totalitarian Communism in Münster
Northwestern Germany in that era was dotted by a number of small ecclesiastical states , each run by a prince - bishop .
The state was run by aristocratic clerics , who elected one of their own as bishop .
Generally , these bishops were secular lords who were not ordained .
By bargaining over taxes , the capital city of each of these states had usually wrested for itself a degree of autonomy .
The clergy , which constituted the ruling elite of the state , exempted themselves from taxation while imposing very heavy taxes on the rest of the populace .
Generally , the capital cities came to be run by their own power elite , an oligarchy of guilds , which used government power to cartellize their various professions and occupations .
The largest of these ecclesiastical states in northwest Germany was the bishopric of Münster , and its capital city of Münster , a town of some 10,000 people , was run by the town guilds .
The Münster guilds were particularly exercised by the economic competition of the monks , who were not forced to obey guild restrictions and regulations .
During the Peasants ’
War , the capital cities of several of these states , including Münster , took the opportunity to rise in revolt , and the bishop of Münster was forced to make numerous concessions .
With the crushing of the rebellion , however , the bishop took back the concessions , and reestablished the old regime .
By 1532 , however , the guilds , supported by the people , were able to fight back and take over the town , soon forcing the bishop to recognize Münster officially as a Lutheran city .
It was not destined to remain so for long , however .
From all over the northwest , hordes of Anabaptist enthusiasts flooded into Münster , seeking the onset of the New Jerusalem .
From the northern Netherlands came hundreds of Melchiorites , followers of the itinerant visionary Melchior Hoffmann .
Hoffmann , an uneducated furrier ’s apprentice from Swabia in southern Germany , had for years wandered through Europe preaching the imminence of the Second Coming , which he had concluded from his researches would occur in 1533 , the fifteenth centenary of the death of Jesus .
Melchiorism had flourished in the northern Netherlands , and many adepts now poured into Münster , rapidly converting the poorer classes of the town .
Meanwhile , the Anabaptist cause in Münster received a shot in the arm , when the eloquent and popular young minister Bernt Rothmann , a highly educated son of a town blacksmith , converted to Anabaptism .
Originally a Catholic priest , Rothmann had become a friend of Luther and the head of the Lutheran movement in Münster .
Converted to Anabaptism , Rothmann lent his eloquent preaching to the cause of communism as it had supposedly existed in the primitive Christian Church , holding everything in common with no Mine and Thine and giving to each according to his “ need . ”
In response to Rothmann ’s reputation , thousands flocked to Münster , hundreds of the poor , the rootless , those hopelessly in debt , and “ people who , having run through the fortunes of their parents , were earning nothing by their own industry … . ”
People , in general , who were attracted by the idea of “ plundering and robbing the clergy and the richer burghers . ”
The horrified burghers tried to drive out Rothmann and the Anabaptist preachers , but to no avail .
In 1533 , Melchior Hoffmann , sure that the Second Coming would happen any day , returned to Strasbourg , where he had had great success , calling himself the Prophet Elias .
He was promptly clapped into jail , and remained there until his death a decade later .
Hoffmann , for all the similarities with the others , was a peaceful man who counselled nonviolence to his followers ; after all , if Jesus were imminently due to return , why commit against unbelievers ?
Hoffmann ’s imprisonment , and of course the fact that 1533 came and went without a Second Coming , discredited Melchior , and so his Münster followers turned to far more violent , post - millennialist prophets who believed that they would have to establish the Kingdom by fire and sword .
The new leader of the coercive Anabaptists was a Dutch baker from Haarlem , one Jan Matthys ( Matthyszoon ) .
Reviving the spirit of Thomas Müntzer , Matthys sent out missionaries or “ apostles ” from Haarlem to rebaptize everyone they could , and to appoint “ bishops ” with the power to baptize .
When the new apostles reached Münster in early 1534 , they were greeted , as we might expect , with enormous enthusiasm .
Caught up in the frenzy , even Rothmann was rebaptized once again , followed by many ex-nuns and a large part of the population .
Within a week the apostles had rebaptized 1,400 people .
Another apostle soon arrived , a young man of 25 who had been converted and baptized by Matthys only a couple of months earlier .
This was Jan Bockelson ( Bockelszoon , Beukelsz ) , who was soon to become known in song and story as Johann of Leyden .
Though handsome and eloquent , Bockelson was a troubled soul , having been born the illegitimate son of the mayor of a Dutch village by a woman serf from Westphalia .
Bockelson began life as an apprentice tailor , married a rich widow , but then went bankrupt when he set himself up as a self - employed merchant .
In February 1534 , Bockelson won the support of the wealthy cloth merchant Bernt Knipperdollinck , the powerful leader of the Münster guilds , and shrewdly married Knipperdollinck ’s daughter .
On February 8 , son - in - law and father - in - law ran wildly through the streets together , calling upon everyone to repent .
After much frenzy , mass writhing on the ground , and the seeing of apocalyptic visions , the Anabaptists rose up and seized the town hall , winning legal recognition for their movement .
In response to this successful uprising , many wealthy Lutherans left town , and the Anabaptists , feeling exuberant , sent messengers to surrounding areas summoning everyone to come to Münster .
The rest of the world , they proclaimed , would be destroyed in a month or two ; only Münster would be saved , to become the New Jerusalem .
Thousands poured in from as far away as Flanders and Frisia in the northern Netherlands .
As a result , the Anabaptists soon won a majority on the town council , and this success was followed three days later , on February 24 , by an orgy of looting of books , statues and paintings from the churches and throughout the town .
Soon Jan Matthys himself arrived , a tall , gaunt man with a long black beard .
Matthys , aided by Bockelson , quickly became the virtual dictator of the town .
The coercive Anabaptists had at last seized a city .
The Great Communist Experiment could now begin .
The first mighty program of this rigid theocracy was , of course , to purge the New Jerusalem of the unclean and the ungodly , as a prelude to their ultimate extermination throughout the world .
Matthys called therefore for the execution of all remaining Catholics and Lutherans , but Knipperdollinck ’s cooler head prevailed , since he warned Matthys that slaughtering all other Christians than themselves might cause the rest of the world to become edgy , and they might all come and crush the New Jerusalem in its cradle .
It was therefore decided to do the next best thing , and on February 27 the Catholic and Lutherans were driven out of the city , in the midst of a horrendous snowstorm .
In a deed prefiguring communist Cambodia , all non-Anabaptists , including old people , invalids , babies and pregnant women were driven into the snowstorm , and all were forced to leave behind all their money , property , food and clothing .
The remaining Lutherans and Catholics were compulsorily rebaptized , and all refusing this ministration were put to death .
The expulsion of all Lutherans and Catholics was enough for the bishop , who began a long military siege of the town the next day , on February 28 .
With every person drafted for siege work , Jan Matthys launched his totalitarian communist social revolution .
The first step was to confiscate the property of the expelled .
All their worldly goods were placed in central depots , and the poor were encouraged to take “ according to their needs , ” the “ needs ” to be interpreted by seven appointed “ deacons ” chosen by Matthys .
When a blacksmith protested at these measures imposed by Dutch foreigners , Matthys arrested the courageous smithy .
Summoning the entire population of the town , Matthys personally stabbed , shot , and killed the “ godless ” blacksmith , as well as throwing into prison several eminent citizens who had protested against his treatment .
The crowd was warned to profit by this public execution , and they obediently sang a hymn in honour of the killing .
A key part of the Anabaptist reign of terror in Münster was now unveiled .
Unerringly , just as in the case of the Cambodian communists four - and - a- half centuries later , the new ruling elite realized that the abolition of the private ownership of money would reduce the population to total slavish dependence on the men of power .
And so Matthys , Rothmann and others launched a propaganda campaign that it was unchristian to own money privately ; that all money should be held in “ common , ” which in practice meant that all money whatsoever must be handed over to Matthys and his ruling clique .
Several Anabaptists who kept or hid their money were arrested and then terrorized into crawling to Matthys on their knees , begging forgiveness and beseeching him to intercede with God on their behalf .
Matthys then graciously “ forgave ” the sinners .
After two months of severe and unrelenting pressure , a combination of propaganda about the Christianity of abolishing private money , and threats and terror against those who failed to surrender , the private ownership of money was effectively abolished in Münster .
The government seized all the money and used it to buy or hire goods from the outside world .
Wages were doled out in kind by the only remaining employer : the theocratic Anabaptist state .
Food was confiscated from private homes , and rationed according to the will of the government deacons .
Also , to accommodate the immigrants , all private homes were effectively communized , with everyone permitted to quarter themselves anywhere ; it was now illegal to close , let alone lock , doors .
Communal dining - halls were established , where people ate together to readings from the Old Testament .
This compulsory communism and reign of terror was carried out in the name of community and Christian “ love . ”
All this communization was considered the first giant steps toward total egalitarian communism , where , as Rothmann put it , “ all things were to be in common , there was to be no private property and nobody was to do any more work , but simply trust in God . ”
The workless part , of course , somehow never arrived .
A pamphlet sent in October 1534 to other Anabaptist communities hailed the new order of Christian love through terror :
For not only have we put all our belongings into a common pool under the care of deacons , and live from it according to our need ; we praise God through Christ with one heart and mind and are eager to help one another with every kind of service .
And accordingly , everything which has served the purposes of self - seeking and private property , such as buying and selling , working for money , taking interest and practicing usury … or eating and drinking the sweat of the poor … and indeed everything which offends against love — all such things are abolished amongst us by the power of love and community .
With high consistency , the Anabaptists of Münster made no pretence about preserving intellectual freedom while communizing all material property .
For the Anabaptists boasted of their lack of education , and claimed that it was the unlearned and the unwashed who would be the elect of the world .
The Anabaptist mob took particular delight in burning all the books and manuscripts in the cathedral library , and finally , in mid-March 1534 , Matthys outlawed all books except the Good Book — the Bible .
To symbolize a total break with the sinful past , all privately and publicly owned books were thrown upon a great communal bonfire .
All this ensured , of course , that the only theology or interpretation of the scriptures open to the Münsterites was that of Matthys and the other Anabaptist preachers .
At the end of March , however , Matthys ’s swollen hubris laid him low .
Convinced at Eastertime that God had ordered him and a few of the faithful to lift the bishop ’s siege and liberate the town , Matthys and a few others rushed out of the gates at the besieging army , and were literally hacked to pieces .
In an age when the idea of full religious liberty was virtually unknown , one can imagine that any Anabaptists whom the more orthodox Christians might get hold of would not earn a very kindly reward .
The death of Matthys left Münster in the hands of young Bockelson .
And if Matthys had chastised the people of Münster with whips , Bockelson would chastise them with scorpions .
Bockelson wasted little time in mourning his mentor .
He preached to the faithful : “ God will give you another Prophet who will be more powerful . ”
How could this young enthusiast top his master ?
Early in May , Bockelson caught the attention of the town by running naked through the streets in a frenzy , falling then into a silent three - day ecstasy .
When he rose again , he announced to the entire populace a new dispensation that God had revealed to him .
With God at his elbow , Bockelson abolished the old functioning town offices of council and burgomasters , and installed a new ruling council of 12 elders , with himself , of course , as the eldest of the elders .
The elders were now given total authority over the life and death , the property and the spirit , of every inhabitant of Münster .
A strict system of forced labour was imposed , with all artisans not drafted into the military now public employees , working for the community for no monetary reward .
This meant , of course , that the guilds were now abolished .
The totalitarianism in Münster was now complete .
Death was now the punishment for virtually every independent act , good or bad .
Capital punishment was decreed for the high crimes of murder , theft , lying , avarice , and quarreling !
Also death was decreed for every conceivable kind of insubordination : the young against their parents , wives against their husbands and , of course , anyone at all against the chosen representatives of God on earth , the totalitarian government of Münster .
Bernt Knipperdollinck was appointed high executioner to enforce the decrees .
The only aspect of life previously left untouched was sex , and this now came under the hammer of Bockelson ’s total despotism .
The only sexual relation permitted was marriage between two Anabaptists .
Sex in any other form , including marriage with one of the “ godless , ” was a capital crime .
But soon Bockelson went beyond this rather old - fashioned credo , and decided to establish compulsory polygamy in Münster .
Since many of the expellees had left their wives and daughters behind , Münster now had three times as many marriageable women as men , so that polygamy had become technologically feasible .
Bockelson converted the other rather startled preachers by citing polygamy among the patriarchs of Israel , as well as by threatening dissenters with death .
Compulsory polygamy was a bit too much for many of the Münsterites , who launched a rebellion in protest .
The rebellion , however , was quickly crushed and most of the rebels put to death .
Execution was also the fate of any further dissenters .
And so by August 1534 , polygamy was coercively established in Münster .
As one might expect , young Bockelson took an instant liking to the new regime , and before long he had a harem of 15 wives , including Divara , the beautiful young widow of Jan Matthys .
The rest of the male population also began to take to the new decree as ducks to water .
Many of the women did not take as kindly to the new dispensation , and so the elders passed a law ordering compulsory marriage for every woman under ( and presumably also over ) a certain age , which usually meant being a compulsory third or fourth wife .
Moreover , since marriage among the godless was not only invalid but also illegal , the wives of the expellees now became fair game , and were forced to “ marry ” good Anabaptists .
Refusal to comply with the new law was punishable , of course , by death , and a number of women were actually executed as a result .
Those “ old ” wives who resented the new wives coming into their household were also suppressed , and their quarreling was made a capital crime .
Many women were executed for quarreling .
But the long arm of the state could reach only just so far and , in their first internal setback , Bockelson and his men had to relent , and permit divorce .
Indeed , the ceremony of marriage was now outlawed totally , and divorce made very easy .
As a result , Münster now fell under a regime of what amounted to compulsory free love .
And so , within the space of only a few months , a rigid puritanism had been transmuted into a regime of compulsory promiscuity .
Meanwhile , Bockelson proved to be an excellent organizer of a besieged city .
Compulsory labour , military and civilian , was strictly enforced .
The bishop ’s army consisted of poorly and irregularly paid mercenaries , and Bockelson was able to induce many of them to desert by offering them regular pay ( pay for money , that is , in contrast to Bockelson ’s rigid internal moneyless communism ) .
Drunken ex-mercenaries were , however , shot immediately .
When the bishop fired pamphlets into the town offering a general amnesty in return for surrender , Bockelson made reading such pamphlets a crime punishable by — of course — death .
At the end of August 1534 , the bishop ’s armies were in disarray and the siege temporarily lifted .
Jan Bockelson seized this opportunity to carry his “ egalitarian ” communist revolution one step further : he had himself named king and Messiah of the Last Days .
Proclaiming himself king might have appeared tacky and perhaps even illegitimate .
And so Bockelson had one Dusentschur , a goldsmith from a nearby town and a self - proclaimed prophet , do the job for him .
At the beginning of September , Dusentschur announced to one and all a new revelation : Jan Bockelson was to be king of the whole world , the heir of King David , to keep that Throne until God himself reclaimed his Kingdom .
Unsurprisingly , Bockelson confirmed that he himself had had the very same revelation .
Dusentschur then presented a sword of justice to Bockelson , anointed him , and proclaimed him king of the world .
Bockelson , of course , was momentarily modest ; he prostrated himself and asked guidance from God .
But he made sure to get that guidance swiftly .
And it turned out , mirabile dictu , that Dusentschur was right .
Bockelson proclaimed to the crowd that God had now given him “ power over all nations of the earth " ; anyone who might dare to resist the will of God “ shall without delay be put to death with the sword . ”
And so , despite a few mumbled protests , Jan Bockelson was declared king of the world and Messiah , and the Anabaptist preachers of Münster explained to their bemused flock that Bockelson was indeed the Messiah as foretold in the Old Testament .
Bockelson was rightfully ruler of the entire world , both temporal and spiritual .
It often happens with “ egalitarians ” that a hole , a special escape hatch from the drab uniformity of life , is created — for themselves .
And so it was with King Bockelson .
It was , after all , important to emphasize in every way the importance of the Messiah ’s advent .
And so Bockelson wore the finest robes , metals and jewellery ; he appointed courtiers and gentlemen - at - arms , who also appeared in splendid finery .
King Bockelson ’s chief wife , Divara , was proclaimed queen of the world , and she too was dressed in great finery and had a suite of courtiers and followers .
This luxurious court of some two hundred people was housed in fine mansions requisitioned for the occasion .
A throne draped with a cloth of gold was established in the public square , and King Bockelson would hold court there , wearing a crown and carrying a sceptre .
A royal bodyguard protected the entire procession .
All Bockelson ’s loyal aides were suitably rewarded with high status and finery : Knipperdollinck was the chief minister , and Rothmann royal orator .
If communism is the perfect society , somebody must be able to enjoy its fruits ; and who better but the Messiah and his courtiers ?
Though private property in money was abolished , the confiscated gold and silver was now minted into ornamental coins for the glory of the new king .
All horses were confiscated to build up the king ’s armed squadron .
Also , names in Münster were transformed ; all the streets were renamed ; Sundays and feastdays were abolished ; and all new - born children were named personally by the king in accordance with a special pattern .
In a starving slave society such as communist Münster , not all citizens could live in the luxury enjoyed by the king and his court ; indeed , the new ruling class was now imposing a rigid class oligarchy seldom seen before .
So that the king and his nobles might live in high luxury , rigorous austerity was imposed on everyone else in Münster .
The subject population had already been robbed of their houses and much of their food ; now all superfluous luxury among the masses was outlawed .
Clothing and bedding were severely rationed , and all “ surplus ” turned over to King Bockelson under pain of death .
Every house was searched thoroughly and 83 wagonloads of “ surplus ” clothing collected .
It is not surprising that the deluded masses of Münster began to grumble at being forced to live in abject poverty while the king and his courtiers lived in extreme luxury on the proceeds of their confiscated belongings .
And so Bockelson had to beam them some propaganda to explain the new system .
The explanation was this : it was all right for Bockelson to live in pomp and luxury because he was already completely dead to the world and the flesh .
Since he was dead to the world , in a deep sense his luxury did n’t count .
In the style of every guru who has ever lived in luxury among his credulous followers , he explained that for him material objects had no value .
How such “ logic ” can ever fool anyone passes understanding .
More important , Bockelson assured his subjects that he and his court were only the advance guard of the new order ; soon , they too would be living in the same millennial luxury .
Under their new order , the people of Münster would forge outward , armed with God ’s will , and conquer the entire world , exterminating the unrighteous , after which Jesus would return and they would all live in luxury and perfection .
Equal communism with great luxury for all would then be achieved .
Greater dissent meant , of course , greater terror , and King Bockelson ’s reign of “ love ” intensified its intimidation and slaughter .
As soon as he proclaimed the monarchy , the prophet Dusentschur announced a new divine revelation : all who persisted in disagreeing with or disobeying King Bockelson would be put to death , and their very memory blotted out .
They would be extirpated forever .
Some of the main victims to be executed were women : women who were killed for denying their husbands their marital rights , for insulting a preacher , or for daring to practice bigamy — polygamy , of course , being solely a male privilege .
Despite his continual preaching about marching forth to conquer the world , King Bockelson was not crazy enough to attempt that feat , especially since the bishop ’s army was again besieging the town .
Instead , he shrewdly used much of the expropriated gold and silver to send out apostles and pamphlets to surrounding areas of Europe , attempting to rouse the masses for Anabaptist revolution .
The propaganda had considerable effect , and serious mass risings occurred throughout Holland and northwestern Germany during January 1535 .
A thousand armed Anabaptists gathered under the leadership of someone who called himself Christ , son of God ; and serious Anabaptist rebellions took place in west Frisia , in the town of Minden , and even in the great city of Amsterdam , where the rebels managed to capture the town hall .
All these risings were eventually suppressed , with the considerable help of betrayal to the various authorities of the names of the rebels and of the location of their munition dumps .
The princes of northwestern Europe by this time had had enough ; and all the states of the Holy Roman Empire agreed to supply troops to crush the monstrous and hellish regime at Münster .
For the first time , in January 1535 , Münster was totally and successfully blockaded and cut off from the outside world .
The Establishment then proceeded to starve the population of Münster into submission .
Food shortages appeared immediately , and the crisis was met with characteristic vigour : all remaining food was confiscated , and all horses killed , for the benefit of feeding the king , his royal court and his armed guards .
At all times the king and his court ate and drank well , while famine and devastation raged throughout the town of Münster , and the masses ate literally everything , even inedible , they could lay their hands on .
King Bockelson kept his rule by beaming continual propaganda and promises to the starving masses .
God would definitely save them by Easter , or else he would have himself burnt in the public square .
When Easter came and went , Bockelson craftily explained that he had meant only “ spiritual ” salvation .
He promised that God would change cobblestones to bread , and of course that did not come to pass either .
Finally , Bockelson , long fascinated with the theatre , ordered his starving subjects to engage in three days of dancing and athletics .
Dramatic performances were held , as well as a Black Mass .
Starvation , however , was now becoming all - pervasive .
The poor hapless people of Münster were now doomed totally .
The bishop kept firing leaflets into the town promising a general amnesty if the people would only revolt and depose King Bockelson and his court and hand them over .
To guard against such a threat , Bockelson stepped up his reign of terror still further .
In early May , he divided the town into 12 sections , and placed a “ duke ” over each one with an armed force of 24 men .
The dukes were foreigners like himself ; as Dutch immigrants they were likely to be loyal to Bockelson .
Each duke was strictly forbidden to leave his section , and the dukes , in turn , prohibited any meetings whatsoever of even a few people .
No one was allowed to leave town , and any caught plotting to leave , helping anyone else to leave , or criticizing the king , was instantly beheaded , usually by King Bockelson himself .
By mid-June such deeds were occurring daily , with the body often quartered and nailed up as a warning to the masses .
Bockelson would undoubtedly have let the entire population starve to death rather than surrender ; but two escapees betrayed weak spots in the town ’s defence , and on the night of June 24 , 1535 , the nightmare New Jerusalem at last came to a bloody end .
The last several hundred Anabaptist fighters surrendered under an amnesty and were promptly massacred , and Queen Divara was beheaded .
As for ex-King Bockelson , he was led about on a chain , and the following January , along with Knipperdollinck , was publicly tortured to death , and their bodies suspended in cages from a church tower .
The old Establishment of Münster was duly restored and the city became Catholic once more .
The stars were once again in their courses , and the events of 1534 –35 understandably led to an abiding distrust of mysticism and enthusiast movements throughout Protestant Europe .

As of 2:06 PM EST , Republican Dede Scozzafava has endorsed Democrat Bill Owens for Representative of New York 's 23rd Congressional district .
Scozzafava 's statement stayed on the positive side of things , praising her fellow NY - 23er Bill Owens for his character and stances .
Scozzafava did not mention Doug Hoffman or the conservative movement at all in her cross-party endorsement of the Democratic - nominee for Congress in northern New York .
Signaling how out of touch the national conservative movement is from New York 's 23rd , Sarah Palin wrote this after Scozzafava 's decision to drop out of the race yesterday before this breaking - endorsement of Bill Owens over Doug Hoffman ;
I want to personally thank Republican Dede Scozzafava for acting so selflessly today in the NY District 23 race .
Now it 's time to cross the finish line with Doug Hoffman so that he can get to work for District 23 and the rest of America .
Might I add my thoughts about Dede 's courageous endorsement of the Democrat ?
I want to personally thank Republican Dede Scozzafava for acting so selflessly today in the NY District 23 race .
Now it 's time to cross the finish line with Bill Owens so that he can get to work for District 23 and the rest of America .
Update :
Staying classy , conservative candidate for NY - 23 CD Doug Hoffman responds to Scozzafava 's endorsement of Democrat Bill Owens by calling her " a turncoat " .
How dare she not support her fellow Republican !
Doug Hoffman would never work against a fellow member of the Republican Party !(/ snark )
RedState throws one right at the NRCC for their role in supporting Dede with nearly a million bucks against the conservative before proceeding to set their sights on Charlie Crist and his primary challenge by ultra-conservative Marco Rubio .
Being Charle Crist is becoming a real pain , as depicted by these brand new poll numbers .
The GOP leadership chose to play with fiery tea - baggers and now they 're getting burnt .
Fox News personality Glenn Beck has lost a battle for a Web domain which jokingly asked whether he raped and murdered a young girl in 1990 .
Isaac Eiland - Hall , the satirist behind glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com , thanked the pundit for his “ assistance ” in helping spread the rhetorical meme .
Beck had filed a dispute with the World Intellectual Property Organization to gain control of the domain .
ADVERTISEMENT
Following his victory , the Web site ’s creator voluntarily turned the domain over to Beck and published an open letter publicly shaming the host for assaulting the First Amendment .
The Web site , which has now been taken offline , was a mockery of the right - wing entertainer ’s now - famous rhetorical style , asking questions and making hazy connections between many times unrelated people or events , then wondering why he has not gotten a denial of his often loosely - defined allegations .
A copy of the Web site now resides on GB1990.com .
In addition to garnering widespread media coverage due to Beck ’s complaint , the site has also spawned a chain of copycat parodies .
Beck ’s lawyers had argued their client ’s name was in fact a trademark , leaving Eiland - Hall in breach of intellectual property laws by using it in a domain .
They also argued that the site , which is clearly labeled as satire , somehow led users to believe its information was factual .
The WIPO ruled against Beck on Friday .
ADVERTISEMENT
National Public Radio added : “ ‘ Even a ‘ moron in a hurry , ’ read the decision , quoting Eiland - Hall ’s attorney , ‘ would not likely conclude that Complainant sponsored , endorsed or was affiliated with the website addressed by the disputed domain name . ' ”
In a letter to Beck that concluded with the username and password to access the domain , Eiland - Hall said :
It bears observing that by bringing the WIPO complaint , you took what was merely one small critique meme , in a sea of internet memes , and turned it into a super - meme .
Then , in pressing forward ( by not withdrawing the complaint and instead filing additional briefs ) , you turned the super - meme into an object lesson in First Amendment principles .
It also bears noting , in this matter and for the future , that you are entirely in control of whether or not you are the subject of this kind of criticism .
I chose to criticize you using the well - tested method of satire because of its effectiveness .
But , humor aside , your rhetorical style is no laughing matter .
In this context of the WIPO case , you denigrated the letter of First Amendment law .
In the context of your television show and your notoriety , you routinely and shamelessly denigrate the spirit of the First Amendment .
The purpose of the expressive freedoms embodied in the First Amendment is not to simply permit the greatest possible scope of expression , but also , in doing so , to also strive for excellence in the conveyance of ideas .
Rather than choosing to strive for excellence and civic contribution , you simply pander to the fears and insecurities of your audience .
And in the process , you do them , and all of us , a great deal of harm .
Shame on you Mr. Beck .
ADVERTISEMENT
The WIPO clearly agreed in its ruling , calling the site a “ satirical critique ” of the public figure and “ strongly protected ” under long standing law safeguarding free speech .
“ The panel [ also ] found that the URL is , in fact , confusingly similar to Beck ’s trademark and that people searching for legitimate information on Beck might stumble upon this site , ” PC Magazine noted .
ADVERTISEMENT
Tech reporter Chloe Albanesius continued : “ On the second point , however , the panel found that Eiland - Hall had an interest in the URL for political purposes , and that he did not benefit financially from Beck ’s name . ”
“ Why wo n’t Glenn Beck deny these allegations ? ” the site reads .
“ We ’re not accusing Glenn Beck of raping and murdering a young girl in 1990 – in fact , we think he did n’t !
But we ca n’t help but wonder , since he has failed to deny these horrible allegations . ”
The joke was originally created by comedian Gilbert Gottfried , who once performed a bit about fellow comedian Bob Saget raping and murdering a young girl .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The idea is to force someone to explain away completely baseless charges made by insinuation alone ; since Beck already has a reputation for doing this , the joke was supposed to give Beck a taste of his own medicine , ” explained Nate Anderson at Ars Technica .
“ I imagine [ the ruling ] may further open a floodgate for the creation of similarly extreme sites should Beck remain as zeitgeisty and controversial as he has been these last few months , ” Mediaite writer Glynnis MacNicol suggested .
Glenn Beck did not actually rape or murder a young girl in 1990 .

Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem A " double - headed " antibiotic could lead to powerful new drugs to beat resistance , say UK researchers .
It sticks to bacteria in two places making it more potent and reducing the chance that bacteria will adapt to resist it , the journal Science reports .
Although not itself suitable for use in patients , it is hoped drugs can be created based on the same principle .
But the news comes as experts warn that excessive regulation is preventing new antibiotics being developed .
An editorial in The Lancet medical journal has called for greater efforts to develop new antibiotics .
A recent EU report found that only 15 antibacterial drugs that offer a potential benefit over existing drugs are in development , and only five have reached the final stage of the trials process .
And the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy has set up a working group to try and address some of the barriers .
Natural compound
In the latest study , researchers looked at a naturally occurring molecule made by soil bacteria called simocyclinone .
It attacks an enzyme in bacteria called DNA gyrase , stopping them from growing .
This enzyme is also targeted by a commonly used group of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones , but resistance to these drugs is growing .
The team showed that simocyclinone binds to a completely different , previously unexploited part of the enzyme and also latches on in two places or " pockets " .
The " double - headed " nature of the antibiotic makes it 100 times more powerful than if each " head " attached to the bacteria individually .
You could say that this is a case of two heads being better than one
Professor Tony Maxwell , study leader
And because bacteria would have to mutate in both binding sites , it cuts the potential for resistance .
Simocyclinone is a fairly large molecule and can not easily get into bacterial cells .
By designing molecules which bind to the enzyme in the same way , researchers say more effective antibiotics could be developed .
Drug design Study leader Professor Tony Maxwell from the John Innes Centre in Norwich , said : " If you can knock out this enzyme , you have a potential new drug , " said Professor Maxwell .
" The fact that there are two pockets means that it might require simultaneous mutations in both pockets for the bacteria to acquire full resistance to the drug , which is much less likely .
" You could say that this is a case of two heads being better than one . "
Professor Laura Piddock from the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy , said there are huge hurdles to developing antibiotics .
" Antibiotic drug development worldwide is in the doldrums because it's very expensive to get drugs through the regulatory process .
" These results are exciting because having a single molecule that targets two separate parts of the enzyme is new and novel .
" But clearly if someone comes up with a useable version of this molecule they 're going to have to overcome some hurdles , which are so profound it makes you very pessimistic . "

Jailhouse docs choose inmates over insurance
Dr. Michelle Staples - Horne says that more students and doctors are considering a career in correctional health care .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
More doctors are dropping their private practices , choosing to go to work behind bars treating murderers , rapists and other hardened criminals .
Better pay , better hours , retirement benefits and free malpractice insurance are just a few of the reasons why physicians are picking prisoners over civilian patients .
In 2009 , private contractor Prison Health Services ( PHS ) saw a 77 % increase over 2008 in the number of respondents applying for job opportunities .
At the University of Massachusetts Medical School , this year 22 of 150 new students chose the correctional health care clerkship as their first choice , more than double the typical response .
" Students are looking for an employer who offers flexible work hours and a steady paycheck .
Correctional health care offers both , " said Dr. Michelle Staples - Horne , medical director for the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice , adding that doctors who have stayed with a government agency long enough also benefit from pension plans .
Typically a salaried job with steady work hours , correctional physicians can earn starting salaries of around $ 140,000 , according to Staples - Horne , roughly the same as the average school loan for graduating med students .
A dangerous job ?
Dr. Kurt Johnson dumped his practice and became a jailhouse doctor in November .
Johnson operated a solo practice in Laramie , Wyo. , for six years .
Two years ago he started working part time for Brentwood , Tenn . - based PHS , a division of America Service Group ( ASGR ) , which provides doctors , nurses and other health care professionals to detention centers around the country .
" I never thought of correctional health care as a career .
It was n't even on my radar in [ medical school ] training , " said Johnson , now a regional medical director for PHS .
At his private practice he had to cram in dozens of patients daily , sometimes for only five minutes , just to earn enough to cover his overhead expenses .
He was constantly filing insurance paperwork , and malpractice insurance was eating into his income .
With correctional health care , Johnson has a steady paycheck of about $ 175,000 -- roughly 20 % more than he made in private practice .
" Since I was a PHS employee , my malpractice insurance was covered through them .
I felt like they had my back , " he said .
But he 's still getting used to the sound of the prison doors slamming shut .
" It 's an impressive sound .
It gives me goose bumps at times . "
He has treated death row inmates .
" It 's intimidating , " he admits , but says he 's never felt physically threatened by his patients .
Staples - Horne agrees that doctors typically did n't consider prison to be an ideal or safe setting to practice medicine .
She admits that there is risk , but points out that most doctors do n't have the benefit of high security that prisons provide .
" Doctors are often safer in this setting than in an emergency room when you do n't know any thing about the person coming in , " she said .
" You do n't know if they have a weapon , if they are violent or aggressive . "
Doctors say the medical problems affecting inmates can range from simple ailments to serious , chronic problems such as drug and alcohol addiction , heart disease , cancer and AIDS .
Health care on the inside
Dr. Ryan Herrington is a regional medical director with Correctional Medical Services , a St. Louis - based contracted health care provider .
Herrington , a general physician , closed his private practice in Ohio and started working full time in the prison system in April .
Anecdotally , Herrington said there is growing interest among doctors seeking opportunity in the corrections environment .
He feels he now has " the financial stability that was harder to attain in private practice . "
But Herrington said his own interest in public health also influenced his decision .
" These patients have problems that are complex , " Herrington said .
" They have gone through a tremendous period of time with no health care prior to incarceration . "
PHS's Dr. Johnson is mostly happy with his decision .
His prison work allows him to spend more time with his wife and three children .
In fact , he credits his patients for making him a better doctor .
" I 'm trying to make this a career , " said Johnson .
" So I 've also honed my BS detector quite a bit .
Now I know when they 're trying to get one over me . "

1 . What made you want to be a chemist ?
I remember when my dad came to my grade two class and demonstrated how to grow copper sulfate crystals .
The class were in awe … not so much of the science , but because dad is tall and he had to duck his head to get in the door !
My career prospects waivered from scientist to computer programmer to synthetic chemist , then finally physical chemist .
2 . If you were n’t a chemist and could do any other job , what would it be — and why ?
I assume a reality check is needed , so I ca n’t choose NBA star !
I would then have to decide between marine biologist and graphic designer .
3 . What are you working on now , and where do you hope it will lead ?
In some of our latest work we ’ve found surprising quantum phenomena in the photosynthetic proteins of algae .
In addition to elucidating this further , I ’m interested in working out what factors decide the evolutionary development and diversification of photosynthetic light - harvesting proteins in these algae and their relatives .
4 . Which historical figure would you most like to have dinner with – and why ?
I would have dinner with Sir Donald Bradman , the greatest Australian cricket player of all time .
5 . When was the last time you did an experiment in the lab — and what was it ?
The last experiment I did in the lab was about 7 years ago when I synthesized CdSe nanocrystals and shelled them with ZnS under the tutelage of my postdoc at the time , Peggy Hines .
I was pretty pleased with myself even though the sample was a far cry from those Peggy made routinely !
6 . If exiled on a desert island , what one book and one music album would you take with you ?
I can imagine lazing on the island wearing Prada shades and reading the book I ’m about to start : The Crossroads by Niccolò Ammaniti .
However , I think I would have to take Herman Weyl ’s The Classical Groups : Their Invariants and Representations because at the rate I ’m currently progressing I will need a few years on a desert island to get through it !
A desert island would be a good chance to play one of the Deep Purple albums banned from my home , though I might have to take the classic Head Hunters by Herbie Hancock .
7 . Which chemist would you like to see interviewed on Reactions – and why ?
There are so many great choices !
Paul Barbara at University of Texas , Austin would have interesting responses .
He is someone I admire as a great scientist .

Happy Festivus ... for the Rest of Us !
Festivus is a secular holiday , normally celebrated on December 23rd .
It is mainly meant as an alternative to the pressures and commercializtion of the Christmas season .
However , it has also become a day to celebrate the ever - lasting comedy of the 1990s television show Seinfeld .
Festivus was a holiday featured in the Season 9 Seinfeld episode " The Strike " , which first aired on December 18 , 1997 .
Since then , many people have been inspired by this zany , offbeat Seinfeld holiday and now celebrate Festivus as any other holiday .
According to the Seinfeld model , Festivus is celebrated on December 23rd .
However many people celebrate it other times in December and even at other times throughout the year .
The usual holiday tradition of a tree is manifested in an unadorned aluminum pole , which is in direct contrast to normal holiday materialism .
Those attending Festivus may also participate in the " Airing of Grievances " which is an opportunity to tell others how they have disappointed you in the past year , followed by a Festivus dinner , and then completed by the " Feats of Strength " where the head of the household must be pinned .
All of these traditions are based upon the events in the Seinfeld episode , Strangely enough , our Festivus traditions also have roots that pre-date Seinfeld , as it began in the household of Dan O'Keefe , a television writer who is credited for writing the Seinfeld episode .
The traditional greeting of Festivus is " Happy Festivus . "
The slogan of Festivus is " A Festivus for the rest of us ! "

Seinfeld Episode : " The Strike "
The Seinfeldian origins of the Festivus traditions can be dated back to the 9th season episode titled " The Strike " .
In this episode Frank Costanza expresses a concern over the increased commercialism and consumerism that tends to saturate the December holiday season .
Script of " The Strike " Episode
In this episode , Frank Costanza tells the story of a routine outing to secure a Christmas gift for his son George where he came to the realization that there should be a new holiday :
Frank Costanza : Many Christmases ago , I went to buy a doll for my son .
I reached for the last one they had , but so did another man .
As I rained blows upon him , I realized there had to be another way .
Cosmo Kramer :
What happened to the doll ?
Frank Costanza :
It was destroyed .
But out of that a new holiday was born ... a Festivus for the rest of us !
Cosmo Kramer :
That must have been some kind of doll .
Frank Costanza :
She was .
(... more quotes )
In the episode , Kramer becomes interested in resurrecting the holiday after hearing about the plight of his friend — Frank Costanza 's son — George ( played by Jason Alexander ) .
Meanwhile George uses Festivus , a holiday he once hated in his youth , as a excuse to his boss Mr. Kruger after he had been confronted for handing out cards suggesting a donation had been made to a fake charity called The Human Fund ( with the slogan " Money For People " ) .
George defended himself saying that he feared persecution for his beliefs .
Attempting to call his bluff , Kruger insisted that he accompany George to his home and see Festivus in action .
Kramer , who was also invited to the celebration , goes on strike from his bagel vendor job , when his manager tells him he can't get time off for " Festivus . "
Kramer is then seen on the street with a sign which reads " Festivus yes !
Bagels no ! "
Main Elements of a Seinfeld Festivus
A Festivus for the rest of us !
The Festivus episode of Seinfeld ( " The Strike " ) reveals how the Festivus celebration includes four main components :
1
The Festivus Pole : The Costanzas ' tradition begins with an unadorned aluminum pole , which Frank praises for its " very high strength - to - weight ratio . "
The pole was chosen in opposition to the of highly decorated , commercialized Christmas trees , because it is very low - maintenance , and most impotantly because the holiday 's patron , Frank Costanza , finds " tinsel distracting . " ( Read More )

The Airing of Grievances :
At the beginning of the Festivus dinner , each participant tells friends and family all the times they have disappointed him or her the past year .
As quoted by Frank Costanza : " I 've got a lot of problems with you people , and now you 're going to hear about it ! " ( Read More )

Festivus dinner : In " The Strike , " a celebratory dinner is shown on the evening of Festivus prior to the Feats of Strength .
In the episode the meal appeared to be meat loaf on a bed of lettuce .
No alcohol was served , but George Costanza 's boss , Mr. Kruger , drank from a flask .

The Feats of Strength : After the dinner , the head of the household tests his or her strength against one participant of the head 's choosing .
Festivus is not considered over until the head of the family has been pinned .
However , a participant may be allowed to decline to attempt to pin the head of the household only if they have something better to do instead .

The Festivus Miracle
Although it is not an official element of the holiday or its celebration , the phenomenon of the Festivus Miracle is mentioned twice in the original episode .
An obvious send - up to the phrase " Christmas Miracle " , both manifestations of Seinfeld 's " Festivus Miracle " were caused by Kramer .
In today 's society the use of the term " Festivus Miracle " has become far more mainstream .

The Real Festivus
The idea of Festivus originally came to Seinfeld writer Dan O'Keefe from a tradition started by his own father , Daniel O'Keefe .
The elder O'Keefe had unilaterally invented Festivus , which had a vague origin in 1966 on the occasion of Daniel 's first date with his soon to be fiancée Deborah .
As the years went by , he shared the weird facets of his unique holiday with his three sons .
Later , his eldest son Dan , a television script - writer , shared it with the world by including " Festivus " in a 1997 episode of Seinfeld .

The Human Fund
" The Human Fund " is a fake charity used used by George Costanza .
Instead of buying Christmas gifts for his coworkers , he gave a card that stated that a donation had been made to a charity called " The Human Fund " .
The slogan of the Human Fund was " Money For People " .
It was such a good scam that George 's boss , Mr. Kruger gave George a company check for $ 20,000 to " The Human Fund " .
Later , the accounting department informs Kruger the charity does n't exist , causing a chain of events that sees George inviting Kruger to his father 's Festivus celebration .

Dell officially announced its entry into the smartphone business on Friday , although its initial phone , the Mini 3 , will be sold into China and Brazil for now .
Dell officially announced its entry into the smartphone business on Friday , although its initial phone , the Mini 3 , will be sold into China and Brazil for now .
The smartphone will run on Android , as expected , and be sold both by China Mobile , and by Claro in Brazil .
Dell noted that Claro is owned by America Movil , the largest network in the Americas .
So far , the only picture of the phone that Dell has released shows it as a flat slab of a phone , with no real sense of its size .
Dell did not say whether the Mini 3 would ship into the United States , although , at this point , it seems like a certainty : Dell has already submitted the Dell Mini 3iX to the FCC for approval with AT&T , and Dell has already leaked plans both to The Wall Street Journal and to TechPulse 360 .
Ron Garriques , who runs Dell Consumer Products Group , also headed Motorola 's mobile - phone business .
" Our entry into the smart phone category is a logical extension of Dell 's consumer product evolution over the past two years , " Garriques said in a statement .
" We are developing smaller and smarter mobile products that enable our customers to take their internet experience out of the home and do the things they want to do whenever and wherever they want . "
The fact that Dell has already shipped the Mini 3 into Brazil and China would imply that the phone may be designed for the fast - growing economies of the so - called BRIC region , which also includes Russia and India .
Dell also said that it has relationships with Vodafone in Europe , Australia and New Zealand ; AT&T and Verizon in the U.S. ; M1 and Starhub in Singapore ; and Maxis in Malaysia .
Dell has not disclosed the feature set of the Mini 3 , although the phone reportedly lacks Wi - Fi , at least in China .
The details of the individual phone models will be disclosed when the devices are available in stores , Dell said : for China Mobile , that will be late November ; for Claro , the end of the year .
The U.S. FCC application shows that Wi -Fi was included .
Dell officials did not immediately reply to requests for commment .
( CNN ) -- Authorities in Malaysia have seized more than 20,000 Bibles in recent months because they refer to God as " Allah , " Christian leaders said Thursday .
The seizures have fed fears among minority groups , which see signs of encroaching Islamic fundamentalism in the predominantly Muslim but multi-racial country .
" There is a growing sense of Islamic assertion , yes , " said the Rev. Hermen Shastri , general - secretary of the Council of Churches of Malaysia .
" There is some concern . "
The Bibles were written in the country 's official language , Malay -- in which the word for God is " Allah , " as it is in Arabic .
However , Malaysia 's government says the word is exclusive to Islam .
Its use in Christian publications is likely to confuse Muslims and draw them to Christianity , the government says .
So it has banned use of the word in Christian literature .
" Malay has borrowed from Arabic , just as it has from Sanskrit and Portuguese , " Shastri said .
" We have maintained the community has the right to use the word .
" But I think this has ignited a cause in the Muslim communities , who are interpreting it as a siege on Islamic beliefs . "
A Home Ministry official directed requests for comment to the ministry 's Publications and Quran Text Control Department , which enforces the ban .
An employee there redirected calls to a spokeswoman , who in turn asked CNN to call the Home Ministry back .
Calls to other departments were similarly redirected .
A Roman Catholic weekly newspaper , The Herald , is challenging the ban in court after the government threatened to revoke its license for using the word in its Malay edition .
Hearings on the case have gone on for two years .
" We quote it as it is .
We cannot change the text of the Scripture , " Herald editor Father Lawrence Andrew told CNN last year .
" I can not be the editor of the Bible . "
Among the Bibles confiscated were Malay - language ones that the Bible Society of Malaysia said it had imported from Indonesia .
About 10,000 others also were confiscated from Gideons International , which places free copies in hotel rooms and other places .
The Malaysian constitution provides for freedom of religion .
The country has a dual - track justice system , in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil ones .
Rulings by the Islamic , or sharia , courts are directed toward the country 's Muslim , who make up 60 percent of the population .
But they worry non-Muslims who see them as Islamism seeping into the moderate nation 's fabric .
In November , the National Fatwa Council -- the country 's top Islamic body -- banned Muslims from practicing yoga .
It said elements of Hinduism in yoga can corrupt Muslims .
The council also bans short hair and boyish behavior for girls , saying they encourage homosexuality .
In northern Malaysia 's Kelantan state , authorities have forbidden bright lipstick and high - heeled shoes , saying the bans will safeguard Muslim women 's morals and dignity , as well as thwart rape .
And last month , an Islamic court judge in the eastern state of Pahang upheld a verdict to cane a Muslim woman for drinking beer in public .
The country has been mired in inter - faith disputes as well in recent months .
In those cases , many non-Muslims complain that the civil courts generally cede control to Islamic courts .
Muslims cannot convert to other religions without the permission of the Islamic courts , which rarely approve such requests .
In relationships in which a Muslim parent has converted children to Islam over the objection of a non-Muslim parent , the sharia courts usually have upheld the conversions .
And earlier this year , a Sikh family lost a court battle to cremate a relative after officials said the man had converted to Islam years before his death , though the family said he had n't .
Have you lost your cam­era recently ?
Mis­laid it some­where in a national park ?
Left it in a taxi ?

Any­one can be a vic­tim of the thought­less­ness and / or sleepi­ness that can lead to Cam­era Loss .
‘ How can I pre­vent Cam­era Loss ? ’
I hear you ask , wish­ing I ’d get to the point .
Well , you ca n’t pre­vent cam­eras from get­ting lost , but you can do some­thing so your cam­era can be found very soon after it has vanished .
All you have to do is take some pho­tos – which you never delete from your cam­era – so when some­one finds your cam­era at the bot­tom of the gorilla pit they are able to locate you and return the lost prop­erty to its right­ful owner .
To illus­trate just how you can safe­guard your cam­era from the crip­pling effects of Cam­era Loss , here are the pics that I always keep on my camera .
Plague : A New Thriller of the Coming Pandemic
Sometimes fiction can do more to change public opinion than nonfiction .
It took Upton Sinclair ’s 1906 novel , The Jungle , to awaken the public to the dangers of sausage and the meat - packing industry in general .
Another example , if I can be so presumptuous , is my 1977 novel Coma , which opened readers ’ eyes to the dubious side of the medical profession after years of misleadingly warm and fuzzy treatment of doctors and hospitals in novels , movies , and TV series .
Today , there is a crying need for a new such socially conscious novel to shake up the complacent public about the high risk of an imminent , serious pandemic .
And I do n’t mean the much - publicized swine flu .
While the world media has obsessed , and rightfully so , about this fast - spreading illness , I ’m worried about the next crisis , something much deadlier and much more catastrophic , indeed the kind of crisis most people wrongly believe could not happen in this day and age .
If I were the author , this urgently needed novel would have to be called Plague .
Everyone has heard of plague and knows it means a sudden outbreak of a virulent disease .
But it also has a very common , very specific association in the public mind :
It ’s synonymous with the Black Death , the scourge caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis that swept through Europe ( as well as much of the rest of the world ) from 1348 to 1350 .
Viewing this monumental and even Malthusian event from the vantage point of nearly seven centuries later , one cringes at having to contemplate the horror , the excruciating pain , and the terror its victims had to suffer .
Knowing the pain involved with a tiny boil , it is almost impossible to imagine what it was like being deathly ill with most of one ’s lymph nodes swelling to the point of becoming visible , blackened lumps with their interiors necrotizing and liquefying — and all of that happening without analgesics and certainly without antibiotics .
If David Letterman presented a top - 10 list of the worst possible ways to leave this world , dying of the plague in the 14th century would have to be at the top .
And the horror of the Black Death went far beyond individual physical pain .
Given the speed with which the illness spread through cities , it must have caused ultimate anxiety and panic as the wildfire disease left rotting , infective corpses , oozing putrefaction , piled in the streets .
Urban society was unable to cope and , in many places , essentially collapsed due to the number of victims ( some cities lost 90 percent of their residents ) .
Adding to the chaos , war between two of the era ’s more significant powers — England and France — raged fitfully on and off after 1337 .
Commerce stagnated , especially in regard to food , causing famine .
And perhaps cruelest of all , paroxysms of gruesome mass murders erupted as minorities were scapegoated .
All in all , the Black Death had to have been hell on Earth , especially because no one — not the doctors , not the priests , and not the scientists of the age — had even the slightest idea of what was causing the calamity , how it was spread , or how it could be treated .
With such associations , a medical thriller titled Plague would certainly get people ’s attention , especially because it would n’t be a historical novel that could be dismissed as “ that was then ; this is now . ”
Instead , it would be a novel of a horrendous contemporary event : a new Black Death .
Of course , this plague wo n’t be a revisit of Y. pestis ; we wo n’t see black buboes and excruciatingly painful suffering .
But death is death , and in the plague I speak of there will be a lot of it , possibly equal in scale to the Black Death , but unfolding even faster .
If that is the case , there will be a degree of worldwide societal chaos that taxes the imagination .
And this is no far - fetched fiction .
Despite all we know about biological science and despite all the wizardly powers of modern medicine , with its vast pharmacopeia and its array of sophisticated devices , this new plague might well happen .
I say this not just as an author of medical thrillers , but as a medical doctor with four decades of experience in surgery , infectious disease , and emergency medicine .
Before I reveal the infectious agent of this putative coming plague , I would like to refer the reader to my 17th book , Contagion , published in 1995 .
A cautionary tale about the hazards of bioterrorism , the story involves a microbiology technician who is bent on starting an epidemic but who has to learn on the job , so to speak , about the critical importance of both virulence and transmissibility .
He starts with Y. pestis , but his intended plague quickly fizzles with only a few victims because the necessary perpetrators of the scourge , rats and their disease - transmitting fleas , are not available .
Undeterred , he finally comes to recognize that for a really scary epidemic to occur , it needs three things : the availability of a self - sustaining reservoir ( usually an animal as an asymptomatic carrier ) , easy human - to - human transmissibility , and impressive virulence .
By the end of the book he finds his agent : the influenza A subspecies H1N1 that caused the 1918 - 1919 Spanish flu , which he obtains from digging up in Alaska the frozen corpse of a victim of that dreadful pandemic .
Influenza A is perfect not only for my villain in Contagion but also as the infectious agent in Plague .
It has a normal reservoir in the guts of birds , spreads via aerosols ( the easiest and most efficient method of disease transmission ) , and can be amazingly virulent .
By some estimates , as many people died from the Spanish flu as from the Black Death .
Contemporary anecdotes of the Spanish flu describe asymptomatic people boarding the subway in Brooklyn and being dead by Manhattan .
Such a death is hardly the torture of bubonic plague , but singularly impressive for its rapidity nonetheless .
With today ’s medical knowledge , such an event would be explained as a “ cytokine storm , ” in which the stricken individual ’s immune system reacts against the invading virus with such ferocity and such inflammation in the victim ’s lungs that death results from drowning in one ’s own secretions .
I personally developed great respect for influenza as a 17 - year - old when I contracted the avian H2N2 subspecies during the 1957 Asian flu pandemic — along with most everyone else at my high school .
I suffered through an unpleasant illness that forever gave me a keen appreciation of the benign - sounding term “ general malaise . ”
My respect for influenza was further reinforced by the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic , caused by H3N2 .
At the time , I was a surgical resident , confronting seriously ill patients in the intensive care unit struggling to breathe .
So when a new and highly virulent subspecies of influenza , designated avian H5N1 flu , appeared in Southeast Asia in 2006 and quickly began to spread globally , I felt compelled to do something for myself and my family .
Despite this new subspecies ’s low human - to - human transmissibility , I stocked my isolated ski cottage with Tamiflu , antibiotics , ibuprofen , and N95 face masks .
In the back of my mind was Isaac Newton ’s flight to the countryside from plague - infested London in 1665 .
All this begs the question : Could an influenza pandemic as bad as the one that struck in 1918 occur again ?
In our current state of world complacency and unpreparedness , I ’d have to say absolutely yes , which is why my supplies are still in my ski cottage .
In fact , such an outbreak could be worse than the Spanish flu , even with the antiviral drugs we now have , the antibiotics that are today available for secondary infections , and the modern equipment in our intensive care units .
For though medical science has learned a lot about viruses in general and influenza in particular since the World War I era , there is a long way to go .
What we do know is that viruses are highly evolutionarily developed , quintessential parasites .
To reproduce , they end up stealthily slipping inside and then hijacking the biomolecular machinery of other life forms , such as bacteria or mammalian cells , as they do n’t have this machinery themselves .
The problem , of course , is that the invaded entity is often killed in the process ; for us humans , an attack from the influenza virus means that the cells lining our respiratory tract begin to die , as it is these cells that are selectively chosen .
The flu is primarily a respiratory disease .
The fact that viruses such as influenza do their dirty work within cells is what makes treating them so much more difficult than treating bacterial diseases such as bubonic plague , which , in contrast , does most of its dirty work outside cells .
In some respects the situation is akin to the difficulties of dealing with cancer in that killing infected cells can put normal cells in jeopardy , too .
Modern medicine does have some antivirals in its armamentarium , but the highly evolved , wily viruses are quick to mount resistance .
What it comes down to is that the best way to deal with influenza is to prevent it .

All of which brings us back to Plague , the book .
And when it comes to the story line , current events are certainly lending a hand .
With the Northern Hemisphere flu season beginning , today ’s pandemic of H1N1 swine flu has justifiably received a lot of coverage because the organism has spread around the globe in a matter of months .
But no matter how impressive its human - to - human transmissibility , this strain simply cannot be the influenza A subspecies for our novel .
It ’s just not hold - on - to - your - hat virulent enough .
Although this disease has killed a few people , even a few seemingly healthy people , for the most part it causes a relatively mild illness , perhaps even milder than the normal yearly flu , which also kills its share of people .
But that is not the case with another flu subspecies that originally appeared in 2006 and which is now slowly spreading from Southeast Asia , particularly in its normal reservoir of aquatic birds .
This is the subspecies designated HPAI A( H5N1 ) , standing for “ highly pathogenic avian influenza A of subtype H5N1 , ” or avian flu for short .
Luckily it has very low transmissibility — which it makes up for with knock - your - socks - off lethality .
A truly scary percentage , about 60 percent , of those humans unlucky enough to have contracted the illness over the last three years have quickly died .
You do n’t have to be a rocket scientist to see the problem .
Is there a chance these two subspecies could hook up and help each other ?
The answer is definitely yes , and that is the worry because one of influenza A’s most disturbing characteristics is its ability to indulge in recombination of its 11 genes , which are arranged on its eight pieces of RNA .
This produces what is called genetic shift — in other words , transfer of entire genes or gene combinations , and hence traits .
It will become key to our plot .
The actual Plague story might start with a farmer in China ’s Guangdong province — call him Wang Lung — who takes some produce to Hong Kong in early September 2009 , where we know H1N1 is already having a field day ( the city reported 514 new cases of the disease in one 24 - hour period this September ) .
Let ’s have Wang indulge in some social activity after he is finished with his business .
During this activity he inhales aerosolized H1N1 and contracts the illness .
Back home , still mostly asymptomatic yet massively contagious , he hand - feeds his pet duck , which is already harboring H5N1 .
The duck adds the H1N1 to its gut , and then the bird is returned to its cage , which is suspended over Wang ’s bevy of pigs .
Such an arrangement is frequent in Asia not only to save space but also to wrest as much caloric value out of the duck ’s feed as possible by making the bird ’s poop mix with the pigs ’ slop .
For the influenza A virus , things could n’t be better ; pigs are its favorite brewing cauldrons .
The avian H5N1 and the human - adapted swine H1N1 can enter pig cells simultaneously by the availability of separate pig epithelial cell receptors .
And of course , this is what happens in Plague , giving the two viruses the opportunity to recombine with each other .
During the millions or billions of replications of the virus inside the pigs , either the H5N1 gives its virulence to H1N1 , or H1N1 gives its transmissibility to H5N1 .
Either way , a genetically shifted subspecies emerges , and the entire world faces something similar to what Europe faced in 1346 when the first Y. pestis - infected rat jumped ship in Crimea .
At that point , the story moves quickly as the deadly new agent races around the planet , thumbing its nose at all vain attempts to stop or contain it .
Governments and individuals will do desperate things , some rational and others not so , like deploying the military to try to close borders or using firearms to keep possibly infected strangers at bay .
Hospitals will be overwhelmed at first and later forced to lock their doors .
To avoid interpersonal contact , people will hole up in their homes , causing government offices , schools , and businesses to close .
Many public officials will be forced to quarantine themselves from a diseased population and retreat to undisclosed locations , which will only fuel the public panic .
Riot police in biohazard suits ( if there are even enough to go around ) will increasingly be called upon to beat back waves of sick , scared , and helpless civilians , desperate for food , water , and medicine .
This wo n’t just be the case in failing states like Somalia and Yemen , but also in successful ones like France and the United States .
But it will all be useless , and the fallout wo n’t be pretty .
Normal travel and commerce will slow to a crawl or , in some areas , stop altogether .
Some island countries will fare better than continents , but it will be temporary at best .
Food distribution will be interrupted , and something akin to famine will ensue in certain parts of the world .
Services of all sorts will fall off , including police protection , and marauding gangs and black - marketeers will materialize in a kind of hopeless , Darfurian Wild West .
This will bring out the worst in humanity .
Neighbor will turn against neighbor , fighting over newly scarce resources or simply out of fear and resentment .
Old prejudices will rise to the surface , as minority groups — be they Jews , black Africans , Shiites , Hispanics , gays , or others — are blamed for bringing the plague into healthy communities .
Long - simmering tensions between old rivals — Pakistanis and Indians , for example , or Iraqis and Iranians — will break out into new wars .
Fanaticism , especially apocalyptic strains of the major religions , will reign .
Plague will be a worldwide infectious holocaust .
The astute reader , however , will by now recognize that there is a slight problem with this story : the ending .
A good cautionary novel , like any novel , only needs three things : a good beginning to pull in the reader , a good middle to keep the reader interested , and finally a good ending .
And for a cautionary novel , a good ending is one that , after the readers have been scared to death by the beginning and middle , reassures them that they are not about to be victimized by a similar calamity — provided , of course , that certain appropriate steps are taken .
Unfortunately , in the very likely coming plague of influenza A , I do n’t see the possibility of any particularly reassuring ending .
There is certainly not going to be a Hollywood - style conclusion like the sudden appearance of a handsome couple that had been secretly toiling away in an isolated laboratory studying viruses and developing a cure while the rest of the world partied on in a false sense of security .
There will be no Dustin Hoffman swooping in to save the day , as he did in the movie adaptation of my novel Outbreak .
What I actually see is this modern Black Death , which could very well be 2009 H5N1 / H1N1 , obliviously raging around the world , acting as the Grim Reaper for countless folks , and then petering out on its own accord like the real Black Death and the real Spanish flu .
Perhaps the answer is to make Plague as long as War and Peace so that the reader will welcome any ending .
But , kidding aside , I ’d hope that Plague would be a super - best - seller , outselling even Dan Brown , James Patterson , and novels about vampires , for it might only be this novel ’s success and , worse , its plausibility that would terrify and hence shock people out of their complacency about influenza A , a complacency made worse by false alarms such as the 1976 Fort Dix swine flu episode and the 2006 avian flu scare .
Both fizzled without becoming pandemics , but journalists did not follow up their “ sky is falling ” blitz with explanations of why the pandemics failed to materialize yet had been very real threats .
Such complacency can be dangerous , and that is the case with influenza A .
What the world needs — and considering the current swine H1N1 pandemic , it needed it yesterday — is a real plan for rapid expansion of its ability to produce vaccines against influenza A , so that output at any given time can be quickly ramped up to meet the sudden need associated with the appearance of a truly dangerous , new subspecies like our might - be novelistic killer H5N1 / H1N1 .
Governments in both the developed and developing world must take on the job , as this is a worldwide threat .
Although vaccines are a 20th - century technology , they remain the most powerful weapons we have for the very real 21st - century threat of influenza A .
That is not to say that basic viral research should not also be encouraged and strongly subsidized .
The more we know about these mysterious entities the better , as there surely will be far more efficacious small - molecule antivirals in the future as well as antiviral biologics , which might even have more promise in the long run .
Now that I have written this article and gotten myself terrified all over again , I ’d better do two things .
One is to head up to my ski cottage and make sure all the supplies are in order as they might be needed soon , and second , I ’d better get working on Plague .
Time is short .
Like everyone else in the world , my family and I are going to be in dire need of a rapidly produced , effective vaccine when influenza A gets its ducks in a row , so to speak , and combines transmissibility with virulence .
From Meet the Press , Joe Scarborough and Dan Senor think it 's just fantastic that the GOP is running their " moderates " out of the party .
Great game plan guys .
Keep this up and maybe the GOP can get down to 15 % instead of 20 % of Americans that want to identify themselves as Republicans .
GREGORY : All right .
Let -- I 've got about a minute left here .
I want to talk politics here .
Joe Scarborough , there seems to be , within the Republican Party , a litmus test going on .
You had Sarah Palin on Facebook endorsing the conservative independent candidate in New York for that congressional seat in the 23rd district .
SCARBOROUGH : Mm-hmm .
GREGORY : Is this what 's going on inside the Republican Party , this sort of run to see who can be the most conservative as a means of retaking power in 2010 ?
SCARBOROUGH : Well , it , it depends .
How could any Republican , how could -- let me strike that .
How could any conservative be against the person that the Republican establishment in D.C. is for if they 're conservatives ?
This woman , this Republican candidate , is for card check .
She was for the Obama stimulus package .
She has voted for taxes .
I mean , she 's been one of David Paterson 's best allies .
Why would a conservative support that Republican ?
This is , this is just one more example of how the Republican Party in Washington , D.C. , is so disconnected from conservatives .
SENOR : You 're seeing a revolt all over the place .
In Joe 's state , in Florida ...
SCARBOROUGH : And , and I 'm saying ...
SENOR : ... Marco Rubio , who 's running against Charlie Crist for the U.S. Senate ...
SCARBOROUGH : Yeah .
GREGORY : Right .
SENOR : ... the Republican establishment in Washington rallied behind Charlie Crist because he was supposed to deliver the general election .
Suddenly the polls in the Republican primary are closing , all the Republican primary conservative support is getting behind Marco Rubio , who 's the start - up candidate .
SCARBOROUGH :
And by the way , people love ...
MAYER : This can't be good for the Republicans that have their own base being fractured , is it ?
SCARBOROUGH : No .
It 's great for the Republican Party because ...
SENOR : It 's fantastic for the Republican Party .
SCARBOROUGH : ... when I , when I ran in 1994 , the Republican Party on the state , national and local level tried to run against me a moderate Republican .
And I 'm not talking , I 'm not talking abortion or gay marriage , I 'm talking taxes and spending , small government .
That 's great to reinvigorate the base .
GREGORY : All right .
And the president 's out there for two big governor 's races in New Jersey and Virginia this week , which a lot of people will see as some kind of referendum .
We 're going to leave it there .
Liu Xiaobo ( left ) met his wife for the first time in months at his sentencing
There has been widespread condemnation of the jailing by China of leading dissident , Liu Xiaobo , for subversion .
The US , UN and EU were joined by human rights groups in a chorus of anger over Mr Liu's 11 - year sentence .
The UN human rights commissioner said it was " extremely harsh " , and cast an ominous shadow over China 's commitments to protect human rights .
Mr Liu , 53 , helped draft Charter 08 , a petition urging political change in China .
His wife said he would appeal .
Liu Xia was allowed to see her husband for the first time since March at Friday 's sentencing in the Chinese capital , Beijing .
' Major criminal '
" We were able to meet for 10 minutes and we were all smiles when we spoke .
I smiled so that he could be calm , " she told AFP news agency .
ANALYSIS Micky Bristow , BBC News , Beijing Liu Xiaobo's sentence could have been worse - he could have been given a maximum of 15 years in prison but no - one is yet suggesting that the activist got off lightly .
Human rights groups and others with knowledge of China 's legal system say this is a harsh sentence .
Amnesty International said that according to their records this is the longest sentence handed down for this charge since 2003 , perhaps longer .
China 's Communist Party leaders appear to be sending a message to anyone else who might want to challenge their total grip on power : do n't .
Chinese people have been given many freedoms since reforms were first begun 30 years ago , but this sentence shows that they have only very limited political rights .
Mr Liu 's lawyer said he had pleaded not guilty to charges of " inciting subversion of state power " .
The verdict said Mr Liu " had the goal of subverting our country 's people 's democratic dictatorship and socialist system .
The effects were malign and he is a major criminal , " Reuters news agency reported .
Mr Liu has been in jail since 2008 , after being arrested for writing a petition known as Charter 08 .
It called for greater freedoms and democratic reforms in China , including an end to one - party rule .
The former university professor is a veteran of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests .
More than 300 international writers , including Salman Rushdie , Umberto Eco and Margaret Atwood , have called for his release .
Western diplomats and journalists were barred from attending the trial and sentencing .
' Gross interference '
But outside the Number One Intermediate People 's Court , US embassy official Gregory May urged China to free Mr Liu immediately .
" Persecution of individuals for the peaceful expression of political views is inconsistent with internationally recognised norms of human rights , " Mr May said .
Liu Xiaobo is a veteran of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests
In Brussels , the EU presidency , currently held by Sweden , said it was " deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence " .
UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay , in Geneva , said the case represented " a further severe restriction on the scope of freedom of expression in China " .
Beijing has accused Washington and the EU of meddling .
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu told reporters this week that statements from embassies calling for Mr Liu 's release were " a gross interference of China 's internal affairs " .
' Disgrace ' Human rights organisations joined the outcry from diplomats ; Reporters Without Borders branded the sentence " a disgrace " .
US - based Human Rights Group and UK - based Amnesty International said the case was a warning to China 's intellectuals and activists .
This verdict is also an explicit warning ... the state will severely punish those who the government perceives as a threat to its monopoly on power
Human Rights Watch In Hong Kong , a group of around 50 people protested against the sentence .
Photos taken outside China 's Liaison Office in Hong Kong showed three people being treated for injuries .
A security guard , a protester and a police officer were hurt during the demonstration , said the Associated Press news agency .
Mr Liu is the only person to have been arrested for organising the Charter 08 appeal , but others who signed it have reportedly being harassed .
In earlier interviews with the BBC , co-signatories of the petition said they were ready to be punished alongside Mr Liu , to stand up for their ideas .
Abolishing the law on inciting to subvert state power is among the reforms advocated in Charter 08 .
The petition says the " practice of viewing words as crimes " should be stopped .

Backporting new code to Debian packages
I like Linux distros packaging systems , especially Debian’s .
It makes it trivial to install , remove and change to different versions of programs .
The only problem is that sometimes there is a delay in packaging the latest version of an app .
Never fear though , if you are willing to do a little bit of work you can shoehorn the latest code into a package yourself without needing any special knowledge of how to create packages .
Note this will only work with programs that already have been packaged since it re-uses the old packaging info with the new code .
I refer to Debian , but the exact same procedure will work on any deb based distro , such as Ubuntu .
Before starting make sure you have the devscripts and build - essential packages installed .
These will install all the tools needed to build debian packages .
First download the source package of the old version .
apt - get source $ NAME
Then , as a sanity check cd into the created directory and run
debuild - i -us -uc
This will probably complain about missing packages needed for building , so go ahead and install them with apt - get or aptitude or whatever .
Then re-run the build command .
Assuming that works you should end up with some . deb files in the parent dir .
Now grab the code for the latest version from its website .
If it is not already in a tarball you ’ll want to make one from it with
tar czf application_version-1.orig.tar.gz applicationdir
If it is a tarball already then just rename it to match the formatting application_version -1.orig.tar.gz .
For example when backporting mesa I name the tarball mesa_7.7.0-1.orig.tar.gz .
Next copy the debian dir from the old application directory to the new one .
cp - a application - debianversion / debian application - newversion /
Then cd into the new directory and run
debchange -v version - 1 " Updated code to latest version "
It is vital that the version number used in this command matches the naming of the .orig. tar. gz file you created earlier .
For example for mesa I use 7.7.0 - 1 .
This is the magic that will make everything work .
The final step is to build the new package .
debuild - i -us -uc
and tada !
With a bit of luck your shiny new version should be packaged up and ready to be installed .
Applying the Lessons of ' Beyond Vietnam ' ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon

Guest essay by Ernest A. Canning
" Somehow this madness must cease . "
- Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , " Beyond Vietnam " April 4 , 1967 .
On Jan. 18 , 2010 our nation will observe Martin Luther King , Jr. Day , commemorating the extraordinary life of an intellectual and moral giant .
The corporate media will fill the airwaves with excerpts of his uplifting August 28 , 1963 " I Have a Dream " speech in which Dr. King called upon us to judge one another by the content of our character and not by the color of our skin .
And , during that same holiday , the corporate media can be counted upon to ignore his April 4 , 1967 " Beyond Vietnam " speech just as they have every year since the first Martin Luther King , Jr. Day in 1986 .
Why ?
Because the egalitarian principles enunciated in " I Have a Dream " challenged only the now ( largely ) defunct Jim Crow regime .
While de facto , race - based economic inequality stubbornly remains as a vestige of slavery and Jim Crow , the elimination of de jure segregation posed no threat to the stark economic inequality created by an increasingly brutal form of U.S. capitalism and imperialism .
It was the brutal reality of corporate Empire which led Dr. King , in " Beyond Vietnam , " to describe his own government as " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today " --- a point which exposes the hypocrisy in that same government 's celebration of the life of a man singularly devoted to non-violence .
If you have not read " Beyond Vietnam " in its entirety , you should .
If you have , you should read it again , for Dr. King 's message is as applicable today as it was then .
Particularly , as we deconstruct the empty words used by our Harvard - educated President to justify an escalation of what Robert Scheer aptly describes as a " War of Absurdity , " and as we look " Beyond Afghanistan " ...
We have met the enemy , and he is us .
Clarity on the U.S. roles in both the Vietnam and Afghanistan debacles requires self - reflection .
King understood this , explaining in " Beyond Vietnam " that " the war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit , " a malady , which if not confronted , would find concerned citizens organizing and marching against wars in dozens of conflicts for generations to come .
As he observed :
I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution , we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values .
We must rapidly begin the shift from a " thing - oriented " society to a " person - oriented " society .
When machines and computers , profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people , the giant triplets of racism , materialism , and militarism are incapable of being conquered .
He added :
A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth .
With righteous indignation , it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia , Africa and South America , only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries , and say : " This is not just " .... The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just .
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war : " This way of settling differences is not just . "
The Truth about Empire and the Military - Industrial Complex
It is ironic that President Obama 's Dec. 1 Afghan escalation speech would be delivered in a hall named after the President ( Eisenhower ) who , in his 1961 Farewell Address warned us of the need to guard against a " military - industrial complex " whose " influence --- economic , political , even spiritual --- is felt in every city , every Statehouse , every office of the Federal government . "
President Eisenhower 's perception of the military - industrial complex's " grave implications " to the " very structure of our society " echoed the warnings provided in President George Washington 's 1796 Farewell Address about the dangers to liberty posed by " overgrown military establishments " and by sociologist C. Wright Mills ' seminal work , The Power Elite ( 1956 ) , which ominously foretold , " American militarism , in fully developed form , would mean the triumph in all areas of life of the military metaphysics , and hence the subordination to it of all other ways of life . "
During his Dec. 1 speech , President Obama said :
Unlike the great powers of old , we have not sought world domination ....
We do not seek to occupy other nations .
We will not claim another nation 's resources ....
The President 's words are at odds with a reality of a brutal corporate Empire , which , as confirmed by John Perkins in Confessions of an Economic Hit Man has been erected over the past 60 years through fraudulent manipulation , corruption , covert subversion , assassinations , torture and military conquest --- an Empire which is maintained by a global military presence .
Perkins ' analysis pertained to his own role as an Economic Hit Man ( EHM ) .
The EHM 's role is to convince corruptible leaders in developing nations to accept loans for massive construction projects , such as airports , hydroelectric dams , ports or industrial parks --- all of which would benefit only a small , wealthy local elite .
Most of the monies from these loans , which are funneled through such agencies as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , never make their way to the debtor nation .
Instead they are simply transferred to the accounts of major construction firms such as Bechtel , Halliburton and its former subsidiary , KBR .
The loans come , bearing an Orwellian label --- " foreign aid . "
Perkins adds :
If an EHM is completely successful , the loans are so large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a few years .
When this happens , then like the Mafia we demand our pound of flesh .
This often includes one or more of the following : control over United Nations votes , the installation of military bases , or access to precious resources such as oil …
Of course , the debtor still owes us the money and another country is added to our global empire .
Set against President Obama 's denial that we " seek to occupy other nations " is the reality delineated by Chalmers Johnson in Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic ( 2006 ) in which he noted that a 2005 Pentagon Base Structures report on some 737 overseas U.S. military bases did " not begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally . "
The [ report ] fails to mention any garrisons in Kosovo…even though it is the site of the huge camp Bonsteel built in 1999 and maintained ever since by KBR … .
The report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan , Iraq ( 106 garrisons as of May 2005 ) , Israel , Kyrgyzstan , Qatar , and Uzbekistan … .
The report does not include twenty sites in Turkey , all owned by the Turkish government and used jointly with the Americans … [ or ] most of the $ 5 billion worth of military and espionage installations in Britain .
As Johnson observed in The Sorrows of Empire , the task of this far - flung military establishment is not to protect the security of our nation but to maintain an " absolute military preponderance over the rest of the world , a task that includes imperial policing to ensure that no part of the empire slips the leash … "
In Imperial Delusions : American Militarism and Endless War ( 2005 ) Carl Boggs demonstrates how Mills ' depiction of American militarism has achieved its " fully developed form " :
The more omnipresent [ U.S. ] military power has become , the more it permeates every corner of international and domestic life , the more it seems to be ignored or deflected , suppressed or forgotten , kept safely outside the public sphere .
The notion of U.S. militarism [ conflicts ] … with two prevailing myths : the idea that all societal institutions are open and democratic , and the belief that U.S. foreign policy is shaped by benign , even noble motives and interests .
During the Truman administration , the U.S. began deflecting our focus away from the " offensive " nature of history 's most awesome military arsenal with a simple change in nomenclature .
The War Department became the Department of Defense .
An ever - expanding percentage of the federal budget in furtherance of Empire is always justified as necessary for our " security . "
The reality was far better captured by the populist Jim Hightower in Thieves in High Places :
The military budget is a massive wealth transfer program from ordinary taxpayers to major corporations , and it has proven easy over the years to wrap this transfer in the red , white and blue and have a portion of the American people burst out in a rousing chorus of the national anthem and applaud their own mugging .
' Strange liberators '
In the official version , set forth by Wikipedia , U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war began in 1959 " to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of [ a ] wider [ U.S. ] strategy of containment . "
The reality was better recounted by King in " Beyond Vietnam . "
The seeds of the Vietnam war were planted in 1945 when the Truman administration decided that the Vietnamese were " not ready " for independence .
Covertly , we supported France 's efforts at re-colonization .
By the end of the French occupation , U.S. taxpayers were funding 80 % of France 's war cost , according to King .
The Vietnamese , King observed , must have seen us as " strange liberators . "
What was to have been a temporary division between North and South Vietnam following the French defeat at Diem Ben Phu calcified as the U.S. supported a corrupt dictator Ngo Dinh Diem , who , King notes , " ruthlessly routed out all opposition , supported their extortionist landlords and refused even to discuss reunification with the north .
The peasants watched as all this was presided over by U.S. influence and then by increasing numbers of U.S. troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem 's methods had aroused . "
As we previously detailed , covert CIA operations in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War were funded by narcotics and aided by torture under the infamous Phoenix program in which as many as 46,000 Vietnamese lost their lives :
In 1966 the CIA 's station chief in Laos decided to ship heroin home as " a means of financing operations without having to depend upon Congressional approval and funding . "
By 1967 Dover Air Force base became a transit for CIA heroin shipped inside the body bags of members of the US armed forces killed in Vietnam .
According to Joseph Trento's , Prelude to Terror , President Diem and his brother were directly involved in the drug trade .
Covert CIA intervention in Afghanistan began in 1979 in response to the Soviet invasion when , per Trento , President Carter struck a Faustian bargain .
Carter reversed an earlier decision to cut off aid to Pakistan in response to that nation 's refusal to abandon efforts to acquire nuclear weapons .
The CIA not only intervened on behalf of the Afghan mujahideen , but began pouring money into Pakistan 's intelligence service , the ISI , which diverted much of these U.S. taxpayer funds into the development of " the Islamic bomb . "
Osama bin Laden and his band of merry terrorists arrived in Afghanistan courtesy of the CIA .
President Reagan dubbed them " freedom fighters . "
As we previously reported :
By the mid-80's , Reagan 's Afghan " freedom fighters " ... with the aid of Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency , turned Afghanistan into the world 's single largest exporter of opium and the source of half the heroin consumed in the US .
According to P. Scott & J. Marshall 's Cocaine Politics ( 1991 ) , the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) would " go out of its way to attract [ Afghan ] drug money , facilitate arms transactions , and cater to the CIA , all the while enjoying an extraordinary , if still unexplained , degree of immunity from prosecution . "
In Prelude to Terror ( 2005 ) , Trento revealed that BCCI 's immunity derived from the relationship between George H.W. Bush and Sheik Kamal Adham , the former Director of Saudi Intelligence .
" With the official blessing of George Bush as the head of the CIA , Adham transformed [ BCCI ] into a worldwide money - laundering machine , buying banks around the world in order to create the biggest clandestine money network in history . "
Opium production would drop off dramatically under the Taliban only to return with a vengeance following the late 2001 U.S. invasion .
By October 2006 Afghanistan produced 87 % of the world 's opium .
Ahmed Wali Karzai has been on the CIA payroll for the past eight years .
He is linked to the Afghan heroin trade .
Ahmed is the brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
A nation concerned with the welfare of its own citizens does not facilitate the poisoning of its youth in order to finance foreign operations with drug monies .
A corporate security state , bent only on the maintenance of Empire for the benefit of the privileged few , will do so at every chance .
As I noted in my five - part series earlier this year on the " History of CIA Torture , " ( Part I , II , III , IV & V ) , quoting Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine , " The widespread abuse of prisoners is a virtually foolproof indication that politicians are trying to impose a system --- whether political , religious or economic --- that is rejected by large numbers of people they are ruling .... torture is an indicator species of a regime that is engaged in a deeply anti-democratic project ... "
Either directly , or indirectly through surrogates or extraordinary rendition , torture , as well as gun and drug smuggling , were a consistent theme in Vietnam as they are now in Afghanistan , and throughout the history of the U.S. - led , corporate global project .
War is not the answer
The President 's Dec. 1 address was nothing short of deceptive .
He invoked 9/11 , noting that we were " attacked from Afghanistan " ; that we were " compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place " ; that the invasion of Afghanistan was authorized by a near unanimous vote in Congress ( Rep. Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) being the lone dissenter ) , and that Afghanistan could be distinguished from Vietnam because the invasion was supported by 43 nations .
As we fully accept , for the purpose of this essay , the official version of 9/11 , each of these points warrants deconstruction .
First , the President deliberately conflated al Qaeda with the Taliban , which did not " attack " us on 9/11 .
At most , the Taliban leadership , which General Stanley McCrystal suggests are not " ideologically driven , " became an accessory after - the - fact when they harbored al Qaeda after the attack .
As revealed by Malalai Joya , a former member of the Afghan parliament who was expelled after she denounced the corrupt drug lords inside the Afghan government , and by Capt .
Matthew Hoh , an Iraq war veteran who recently resigned his U.S. foreign service position in Afghanistan in protest of continued occupation , many Afghans have since joined the Taliban in response the brutal U.S. occupation and U.S. support for the corrupt Karzai regime .
Obama 's assertion that we were " compelled " to invade reflects the extent to which militarism has thoroughly permeated American society .
Instead of seeing what General Douglas MacArthur described as a " malignant scourge " as the option of last resort , war is seen as the only option .
Thus , we have an endless war on drugs , President Johnson 's long since abandoned war on poverty and a thoroughly irrational war on terror .
The nearly - unanimous Congressional authorization to use force and widespread international support for the invasion came at a time when most were reeling from the shock of 9/11 .
But as Naomi Klein so astutely notes in The Shock Doctrine , " shock wears off . "
With time comes the ability to reflect .
We were not " compelled " to wage a war on terror .
Indeed , a war on terror was not even a logical response to what amounted , not to an act of war inflicted by another nation - state , but an exceptionally heinous crime committed by a stateless organization .
The alternative response would have been the application of the international law ; an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice before an international court and universal sanctions applied by a world body against any nation - state which would harbor the fugitives .
In War Made Easy , Norman Solomon quoted the poignant remarks of General William Odom :
Terrorism is not an enemy .
It can not be defeated .
It 's a tactic .
It 's about as sensible to say we declare war on night attacks and expect to win that war .
Our presence in Afghanistan reflects the height of absurdity .
Where the President claimed during his Dec. 1 address that Afghanistan and Pakistan are vital to our security as the " epicenter of the violent extremism practiced by al Qaeda , " Scheer says there are less than 100 members of al Qaeda still inside Afghanistan , who , per General James Jones , do not retain the " ability to launch attacks on either us or our allies . "
To defeat the ignoble 100 , the U.S. is rapidly building toward an in-country presence of 100,000 American troops at a cost of $ 100 billion per year .
NATO will also add 7,000 more troops , bringing a combined total to 140,000 foreign occupiers to that impoverished nation .
To this , add some 104,000 " private contractors " aka armed mercenaries , who are paid more than three times the amount received by American troops .
The U.S. response to the cross - border Pakistani presence of al Qaeda looks like a replay of Nixon 's secret air war on Cambodia .
It has included an increase in predator drone strikes , covert funding of 1/3 of the budget of Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the ISI --- this despite the still unresolved questions as to whether the ISI not only funded the Taliban but whether the ISI sent funds to one of the alleged 9/11 hijackers --- and an alleged covert presence of the infamous Blackwater / Xe in Islamabad .
Meanwhile , U.S. taxpayers fund the Taliban as well , as 20 % of construction monies are used to fund a Taliban protection racket .
That might seem irrational , but from the perspective of those who make a killing off the killing it makes perfect sense .
Military spending , which now includes massive expenditures to companies like KBR and Blackwater , who fulfill the formally public support and combat functions , is contingent upon the existence of a viable , armed opposition .
As with the North Vietnamese presence in Cambodia , the cross - border presence of al Qaeda will increase the pressure for Obama to launch a cross - border military incursion --- a tactic already urged in a Seth Jones New York Times editorial .
Looking at escalation , many have compared Obama 's folly in Afghanistan to President 's Johnson 's in Vietnam .
But Obama repeats the mistakes of both Presidents Johnson and Nixon .
His suggestion that we must confront al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is but an echo of the policy of containment and the domino theory used to justify our presence in Vietnam .
Obama 's assertion that the escalation will be used to train Afghan security forces to stand on their own and bring the war to a " responsible end " are but a repetition of Nixon 's " peace with honor " strategy entailing the Vietnamization of the War in Vietnam --- a strategy initiated in 1969 by an expansion of the air war as U.S. ground troops were slowly pulled out .
Six years later , on April 30 , 1975 , Nixon 's " peace with honor " ended with the Fall of Saigon in which the U.S. staged an eleventh hour evacuation of the U.S. embassy that was so abrupt that the helicopters used in the evacuation had to be dumped over the side of an aircraft carrier because of insufficient space aboard the ship .
There is no evidence that Obama 's " peace with honor " strategy would prove any more effective than Nixon's .
To the contrary , where Obama provides an optimistic 18 month window before we can begin to withdraw , General Stanley McCrystal conceded that if the Karzai government does not appear " legitimate " in the eyes of the Afghan people , we might have to stay " for years . "
Moreover , Nixon at least had the good sense to negotiate directly with the North Vietnamese .
So far , Obama 's approach is to offer the Taliban the opportunity to lay down their arms and join the government --- an unlikely event given the enmity between the Pashtuns who make up the bulk of the Taliban and the Tajiks of the former " Northern Alliance " who make up the bulk of the Karzai government forces .
If the U.S. could not adequately train the Army of the Republic of Vietnam over a span of 19 years so as to withstand the 1975 assault , what makes the President think he could create an effective Afghan fighting force in the span of 18 months ?
Obama 's description of al Qaeda as a " cancer " underscores the futility of the effort .
If al Qaeda is a cancer , it long ago metastasized .
As revealed by the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations , al Qaeda has " no single headquarters ... has autonomous underground cells in some 100 countries . "
On June 12 , 2009 , CNN reported " Al Qaeda operatives are leaving the battle zones along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border and heading for Somalia and Yemen , where they have set up training camps . "
No matter how many troops we pour into Afghanistan , irrespective of whether U.S. troops spill - over into Pakistan , the U.S. cannot defeat such an amorphous organization by way of military invasion and occupation .
Even if it could , even if we could somehow capture and kill every last member of al Qaeda , we will not eliminate the potential for a future terrorist attack .
At best , under the official theory , al Qaeda and 9/11 entail a case of " blowback " which Chalmers Johnson describes in Sorrows of Empire as " the CIA 's term for the unanticipated consequences of unacknowledged actions in other people 's countries , " or more simply , that " a nation reaps what it sows . "
9/11 could well be the unanticipated consequence of our earlier covert intervention in Afghanistan as part of a deadly , global geopolitical game with the now defunct U.S.S.R. , and the coupling of that geopolitical strategy with our oil resource - inspired imperial presence throughout the Middle East .
But who knows what deadly future consequence will arise from the obscene brutality our nation unleashed across the globe in the aftermath of 9/11 .
End Stage of Empire ?
By way of a comparison between the U.S. and Empires past ( Spanish , Dutch and British ) in Wealth and Democracy , Kevin Phillips develops a solid thesis to the effect that the end stage of Empire is marked by an outsourcing of a nation 's manufacturing base in search of cheap foreign labor along with an increasing reliance " on finance capitalism at the expense the more mundane production , a tendency to acquire a build - up of debt and increasing transnational loyalties . "
Certainly , recent events bolster Phillips ' conclusions .
But there is also the issue of the financial drain directly inflicted not just by Empire but by the military - industrial complex ; what Seymour Melman described in Pentagon Capitalism as " parasitic growth " which not only depletes the money that would otherwise be available to the civilian sector of society but siphons off the best and brightest minds to military research .
During his Dec. 1 address , President Obama acknowledged that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have already cost $ 1 trillion --- a questionably low number which comes more than one year after Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel prize - winning economist , estimated that the cost had already reached $ 3 trillion just for the Iraq war .
Context is required to comprehend the enormity of these numbers .
Jim Hightower provided that context in Thieves in High Places when he converted dollars into seconds :
Western civilization has not been around for a trillion seconds .
One trillion seconds is 31,688 years .
A trillion seconds ago , Neanderthals stalked the earth .
The monies spent in Afghanistan and Iraq are but a fraction of what we 've spent on the military component of Empire over the past 60 years .
A 2006 study released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute revealed that global military spending has topped $ 1.1 trillion and that the " United States account [s ] for nearly half of the world 's spending . "
The U.S. spends $ 1,600 for every American ; China , just $ 31 / person .
Last year , the U.S. " spent about 44 percent more on defense than all other NATO members combined . "
At the end of a similar period in Afghanistan , the Soviet Union , economically depleted by its attempt to keep up with an increasingly deadly arms race , experienced a total economic collapse that was both sudden and precipitous .
Unless we change course , and right soon , there is no reason to believe that our willingness to sink into an Afghan quagmire will not portend to the same fate .

Dear Glenn Beck :
How About One Week for Nullification and Secession ?
I enjoy watching your show on Fox News .
You deliver astounding facts in an entertaining manner .
And I am aware that you are FIRST an entertainer .
You have been awarded a prime afternoon time slot because you are adept at entertaining and holding an audience so advertisers can charge confiscatory ad rates , thereby making a profit for Rupert Murdock .
I watch your hour - long program regularly , in which you provide unassailable proof of the widespread criminal behavior in Washington .
I hear a never - ending merry - go - round of subjects like :
ACORN
Van Jones
The Cloward - Piven strategy
The Federal Reserve
Democrats
Republicans
President Obama
Bailouts
Stimulus money
Economic meltdown
Cap and Trade
Global warming and " Climate - gate "
One world government
Health care legislation
Tea Parties and Freedom Rallies
War
But lately , watching has become tiresome .
You must be experiencing a level of frustration seldom known in human history .
You are the watchman on the wall … a lone voice crying out in the wilderness … shouting against a howl of info - noise to the assembled citizens to warn them of the fast - approaching dangers .
Few even hear you as you explain why Americans , many the victims of government chicanery , are losing their jobs and losing their homes .
And what about that audience ?
There is such a thing as " fear fatigue . "
You already know your audience is experiencing it .
You say that many people call or write to you , and are afraid and ready to give up .
What you do n't tell them is that things are going to get much worse , and soon .
Glenn , the one glaring deficiency I see in your program is LACK OF A SOLUTION .
I believe that the American Federal Government has gone past the point of no return .
Phoning , writing and emailing Congress will absolutely not change the direction of Washington .
Tea Parties , Freedom Rallies and Tenth Amendment resolutions will have no effect on Washington .
Yet , that is what you recommend to your audience .
It only reinforces their feelings of helplessness .
But there is a legal , moral and ethical solution to Washington 's criminal ways :
State Sovereignty .
Specifically , State Nullification and finally , State Secession .
Over the last 150 years , the American states have been relegated to the status of large counties .
They have voluntarily given up their sovereignty , abandoned their militias , and become sucklings to the Federal sow .
Americans must focus locally once again , and each state must become the final arbiter of its own destiny …even if that means that it secedes from the Union .
Want to affect Washington ?
Leave them to their own devices .
State secession pulls the plug on Washington 's life support system … which is inevitably money .
How about a few shows dealing with the only truly viable solution to end Washington tyranny ?
Nullification and Secession .
There are a good number of Nullification and Secession experts you can interview , many of whom have been guests on your show in the past .
Brilliant minds like :
Lew Rockwell , Chairman of the Mises Institute and Editor of LewRockwell.com
Thomas Naylor , Professor Emeritus , Duke , founder of 2nd Vermont Republic
Daniel Miller , President of Texas Nationalist Movement
Kirkpatrick Sale , Director of The Middlebury Institute for Secession Studies
WA State Rep. Matthew Shea , author of a recent white paper on Nullification
Judge Andrew Napolitano , Constitutional scholar
Thomas DiLorenzo , College professor and Expert on Abraham Lincoln
Dr. Thomas Woods , Author and Senior Fellow at The Mises Institute
Would this be a bridge too far for you , Glenn ?
Would Fox News even allow you to air such broadcasts ?
Would there be a firestorm of invective coming back at you from the Main Stream Media if you began to recommend Nullification and Secession as the Final Solution ?
Could you withstand the weight of the criticism you know would result from this kind of stand ?
I leave it to you , Glenn .
Want to vastly increase your audience ?
Want to be the subject of hot conversation around the world ?
But most of all … do you want to offer REAL SOLUTIONS to hurting Americans to take back liberty in their own lifetimes ?
Run a week of shows in which you explore Nullification and Secession .
What have you got to lose ?
Sincerely , Russell D. Longcore Marietta , Georgia www.DumpDC.com
Six Letters That Can Change History Following the growing Secessionist Movement in America
PS : Speaking of advertisers , you have some national advertisers selling gold and gold stocks during your show .

Our first - grader astonished her father at the end of the past school year as he dropped her off at our local Washington DC public school , Horace Mann Elementary , where he had attended school in the early 60s .
She relayed to him that her teacher announced her impending marriage — - to another woman — - to the class .
Following her revelation , this teacher encouraged questions from the children .
Our daughter also mentioned a book the teacher read aloud , “ Uncle Bobby ’s Wedding , ” about two male “ gay ” guinea pigs , promoted by the Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual Transgender Lobby for children .
Since homosexual activists cannot reproduce their own children , recruitment to their cause ( especially at a young age , before parents have raised such sensitive and controversial topics with their children ) is essential to the political agenda of promoting homosexuality and “ gay ” marriage .
Nowadays , most parents are resigned to the fact that a gay guinea pig will inevitably steal their daughter ’s sense of innocence , and there ’s nothing they can do about it .
Not Hemenway .
Hemenway began the slow bureaucratic process of getting innocence restored :
Most parents would not consider a Q&A session with first - graders about homosexual marriage as an “ age - appropriate ” discussion .
After our daughter ’s revelation , we lodged a complaint with Chancellor Rhee ’s office , requesting an investigation , and asking what department in the DC Government we can appeal to for restoration of our child ’s sense of innocence ?
We are still awaiting feedback from the school on whether there is a Teacher ’s “ Code of Conduct ” and what D.C. policy is on “ age appropriate ” sexuality education .
By the way , when does “ sexuality education ” finally become “ age appropriate ” for D.C. schoolkids ?
According to Hemenway , “ There are sound reasons that sexuality topics are not generally introduced in school until fifth grade , at an age when some children begin to ask how babies are made . ”

Who Do You Believe , Randall Stross or Your Own Lying Eyes ?
Randall Stross is getting a lot of attention for his piece in The New York Times this weekend , titled “ AT&T Takes the Blame , Even for the iPhone ’s Faults ” .
( In the original headline , still visible in the < title > element , “ faults ” was “ glitches ” . )
The gist of Stross ’s piece , as you might surmise , is that AT&T ’s network is not only not the worst in the U.S. , but in fact is the best .
Chronic iPhone problems in New York and San Francisco ?
Faulty iPhone hardware , which AT&T is either too polite or too afraid of Apple to state publicly .
I do n’t buy it .
Is the iPhone the best phone on the market , in terms of things like signal strength and voice quality ?
I truly doubt it .
But is it downright terrible ?
So bad as to explain the horrendous service iPhone customers on AT&T are seeing ?
Nothing in Stross ’s article makes me think so :
Stross ’s primary source is Paul Carter , the president of Global Wireless Solutions , a network testing firm .
Carter acknowledges that AT&T is one of his company ’s clients , and Verizon is not .
I mean , come on .
Stross ’s second source is Root Wireless , a company whose data comes from some sort of software that runs in the background on unnamed smartphones , which of course ( since the software runs in the background ) means the iPhone is not included .
Consumer Reports ’s rankings , which put AT&T last and Verizon first , were based on actual customer surveys .
Actual customers reporting their actual experiences .
If it ’s the iPhone ’s fault , not AT&T’s , why are n’t iPhone users around the world having the same problems as those here in the U.S. ?
How come iPhone carriers in Europe and Canada turned on tethering support as soon as iPhone OS 3.0 was released , and AT&T still , seven months later , has not ?
I ’ve brought this up before and readers have argued that the U.S. is a far bigger country than those in Europe , so of course U.S. carriers have a harder job than those in Europe .
But that argument does n’t make sense to me .
It ’s not like there ’s one single AT&T cell tower providing service for the whole country .
When it comes to providing coverage for a large city like New York or London or Paris , what difference does it make how big the rest of the country is ?
What ’s different about providing wireless service in the U.S. than Europe is n’t the densely - populated metro areas — it ’s the sparsely - populated rural areas .
But it ’s the metro areas where the iPhone is having the severe problems .
And what about Canada ?
Larger landmass than the U.S. , tethering is available , and service quality is good .
If it ’s crummy phone networking hardware in the iPhone , how come it ’s still a problem in the iPhone ’s third model year ?
If it ’s Apple ’s fault , would n’t they have addressed it by the time the 3GS hit ?
Stross ’s implication is that Apple is an incompetent hardware maker .
If it ’s the iPhone ’s fault , why have iPhone / AT&T reception problems gotten worse over time ?
Does n’t the correlation between the number of iPhones in use and the increase in complaints about AT&T strongly suggest the problem is network capacity ?
Lastly , if AT&T ’s network is just fine and it ’s the iPhone ’s fault , which are the phones that do get top - notch 3G data and voice service on AT&T in New York and San Francisco ?
So on the one hand we have the simple theory that AT&T ’s network stinks , especially in large metro areas , and extra-especially in New York City and San Francisco .
On the other hand , we have the theory that AT&T ’s network is just fine because two network consulting companies say so , even though a Consumer Reports customer survey says otherwise , and it is the iPhone that is flawed , but the flaws are for some reason worse on AT&T than other carriers around the world , and just happen to be worse still in some cities than others , and Apple has been unwilling and / or unable to address these flaws in three model years .
I know which theory I ’d put my money on .
My 3 Best Kept Travel Secrets
Here ’s the deal : Katie at Tripbase had the very clever idea to post her best 3 travel secrets , then ‘ tag ’ 5 others to post theirs .
Jodi at LegalNomads was kind enough to tag me , so I ’m gonna take my best stab at it .
I ’m arriving late to the party ( as usual ) , so I suspect most of the good ones are already taken .
“ Pack less ” , “ bring more money , ” and “ avoid Nigerian investment opportunities ” have probably been covered extensively .
But fear not , I will blindly stumble forth – forsaking fear , doubt , and common sense .
As usual .
A bare - bones camping setup can really enhance your journey and take some stress off your pocketbook .
Tip # 1 – Camping May Be an Option .
Now , this really depends on the length of your trip and the destinations you have in mind , but a bare - bones camping setup can really enhance your journey and take some stress off your pocketbook .
For my upcoming RTW trip , I ’m bringing a light 1 - man tent , an ultralight sleeping bag , and a slim Therm - a - Rest sleeping pad .
By lurking around eBay and such , I paid a total of $ 350 for the setup and it all weighs less than 7 pounds .
I will certainly be lugging all of this unused through many countries , but at other times I think it will come in quite handy .
During an earlier trip through Italy , I camped 1 kilometer from the heart of Sienna for $ 12 a night and then spent a week at the water ’s edge on the coast of Sicily , drinking red wine and skinny - dipping at night while Mt. Etna glowed and rumbled in the distance .
I spent 2 weeks camping 1 k from Centraal Station in Amsterdam for less than the price of a hostel .
All of these campsites had showers , laundry , and snack bars .
On my next trip , I hope to spend a week camping on the Lido near Venice for about $ 15 a night and taking the vaperetto into the city in the morning .
Other camping possibilities for this trip : Greece , trekking in Nepal , National Parks in any country , the Andes in South America , Central America , and the occasional “ oh shit , I ’m stuck in the middle of nowhere ” moment .
Tip # 2 – The Ultimate Travel Accessory , the Bandana .
This is a simple one .
Bring several of these bad boys — they can really save your butt at times .
I ’ve used them a coffee filter , as a doo - rag to protect my bald head from the sun ( or hold in heat when it ’s chilly ) , as a mask in dust storms , and as a tourniquet when my arm was bitten off by a shark .
True story — google it ( please do n’t ) .
Run out of toilet paper ?
You ’ll be glad you brought extras .
Tip # 3 – Camels Are Evil .
Ok , you were n’t expecting this one — I understand .
In many parts of the world , it is considered de rigeur to go on a camel trek into the desert or pose for a photo atop one of these disgusting beasts .
Do not fall for this .
Camels are foul , hateful , nasty creatures .
If embarking on a trek , you will sit in a ‘ saddle ’ that is essentially a couple of 2×4′s covered with a napkin for padding .
Within 30 minutes you will not be able to feel your legs .
This is actually a blessing , as the crazy riding angle and the constant see-saw , back - and - forth motion will be slowly grinding away at the skin and muscle of your inner thighs .
You are not going to walk right for a week .
An unhappy camel is not something to be trifled with .
When you ’ve had enough of this , your guide will pull hard on the reins ( attached to the camel ’s nostrils ) to stop your mount , thoroughly pissing him off .
An unhappy camel is not something to be trifled with .
We ’ve all heard the stories of camels spitting – this is not exactly accurate .
Like cows , camels have multiple stomachs ( approximately 34 of them – I ’m not exactly sure on the number ) and when they spit , they basically puke the partially - digested contents of their uppermost stomachs at you .
The smell is truly indescribable — imagine that you stuffed lawn clippings , goat cheese , and Satan ’s spleen into a Tupperware container and stored it in the direct sun for 3 months .
That would be almost as bad .
A camel can ‘ spit ’ that concoction about 50 feet in any direction with pinpoint accuracy .
Do n’t say I did n’t warn you .
As for who to send this to next …
I really have no clue .
The list of previously - contacted people is a mile long and I ’ve been blogging for a couple of weeks .
So let ’s just say , if you ’re interested in carrying the torch , send me an email or contact me on twitter .

The Los Angeles Times is reporting that the California Science Center , an organization affiliated with the Smithsonian , is facing a lawsuit from a group called the American Freedom Alliance .
The group planned to rent the Center 's IMAX theater in order to show a movie called " Darwin 's Dilemma , " which attacks the theory of evolution and promotes intelligent design .
When the anti-evolution , pro-ID Discovery Institute stepped in , the Center used a clause in the contract to cancel the showing , attracting suits from both groups .
The AFA 's vision statement says that it " aims to build a national alliance of people of faith , " and the group apparently decided to use the public controversy over evolution as a way to do that .
The film it chose features several Discovery Institute fellows , and was produced by a company that lists the DI as a " research link , " along with an organization , the Access Research Network , that has Discovery fellows on its board .
Discovery has a bit of a history of conflict with science museums .
In the past , it 's rented space for one of its films at the Smithsonian itself , presumably in order to lend itself a veneer of scientific reputability .
The Smithsonian , for its part , was widely criticized for its decision to play host to a group that promotes anti-science agitation .
History seemed to be repeating itself , as the DI issued a press release in which it proudly announced that an " intelligent design documentary " would be premiered at " the Smithsonian Institution 's west coast affiliate , " and that the event would feature one of its fellows .
Unfortunately , the contract to show the film was contingent on the California Science Center approving all promotional materials .
It had n't seen the press release in advance , so it cancelled the show .
The AFA is now seeking punitive damages and compensation for lost revenues , while the DI is trying to get all the documents involved with the decision to cancel .

At least 91 people have been killed after a huge car bomb ripped through a busy market in Peshawar , Pakistan .
The attack , which injured at least 200 others , was the deadliest to hit Pakistan this year .
Similar attacks have killed hundreds of people in recent weeks , as the army carries out an operation against Taliban militants in South Waziristan .
The blast came as US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton began a visit to the Pakistani capital , Islamabad .
Mrs Clinton told a news conference the US was " standing shoulder to shoulder " with Pakistan in its fight against " brutal extremist groups " .
AT THE SCENE Riffatullah Orazkai , BBC Urdu
The scenes inside the emergency ward of Lady Reading were both horrific and heart - rending .
So great were the number of casualties that there was a shortage of beds , with many people being treated on the floor .
One unattended four - year - old boy 's condition appeared to be particularly distressing .
His head and legs were covered with deep wounds .
Shah Faisal , the man who brought the boy to the hospital , said that when he arrived on the scene , flames were coming out of the shops in the market .
" I could see some people trapped inside ...
I saw this girl lying unconscious on the road outside and I brought her here .
" But no one has come to claim her so far , " he said .
Eyewitness in Peshawar
The Taliban have denied being behind this bombing , but the government blames them for a wave of attacks apparently launched in response to the army operation against their strongholds on the Afghan border .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad says that few people will take the Taliban 's denial seriously and they remain the major suspects for the bombing - if only because few other groups would have a motive for carrying out such a devastating attack .
The blast tore through buildings in Peshawar 's Peepal Mandi market street , destroying several - including a mosque - and leaving others on fire .
The market mostly sells products for women , and most of the dead were women and children .
" There was a huge blast .
There was smoke and dust everywhere .
I saw people dying and screaming on the road , " eyewitness Mohammad Siddique told AFP news agency .
Crowds dug through rubble to rescue people .
' We will not buckle '
Medical staff appealed for people in Peshawar to give blood .
Some complained that the authorities were not prepared to deal with the aftermath of such a large attack .
" There were a lot of wounded people .
We tried to help them but there were no ambulances so we took the victims on rickshaws and other vehicles , " Muzamil Hussain told the Associated Press .
" There were no police .
The police and government did n't help us , the police even opened fire on us . "
Security has been stepped up across Pakistan , but the government still appears to be unable to stop the attacks , the BBC's Mark Dummett in Islamabad says .
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmoud Qureshi promised that the country 's resolve would not be shaken by " such heinous crimes " .
At a news conference in Islamabad with Mrs Clinton , he told potential militants : " We will not buckle , we will fight you .
We will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan . "
' Brutal extremists '
Mrs Clinton is in Pakistan to discuss US concerns about the increasing numbers of militant attacks and the security of the country 's nuclear weapons .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
She condemned the " vicious and brutal " attack in Peshawar and said the fight against the Taliban was " not Pakistan 's alone " .
" Pakistan is in the midst of an ongoing struggle against tenacious and brutal extremist groups who kill innocent people and terrorise communities , " she said .
" We commit to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistani people in your fight for peace and security , we will give you the help that you need in order to achieve your goal . "
Last week , Pakistan launched an offensive in South Waziristan , which is considered to be the main sanctuary for Islamic militants outside Afghanistan .
Correspondents say the Peshawar blasts will come as a violent reminder for the US of the difficult task it is facing in the fight against the Taliban , both in Pakistan and across the border in Afghanistan .
Off - shore hedge - fund investors could be the next target of the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. lawmakers after last week 's landmark agreement between the U.S. and Swiss governments over secret Swiss bank accounts held by U.S. citizens .
The IRS 's agreement with the Swiss government and UBS AG will result in thousands of Americans who thought they had a secret Swiss bank account having their names and account details turned over to U.S. tax authorities .

Jerusalem ’s Train to Nowhere
Query Jerusalem residents about their new railway and the most common response is : Do n’t ask .
Then locals will proceed to tell you all about it anyway : a long litany of complaints over the snarled - up roads , broken promises , and urban disasters involved in the ongoing construction of a light railway track through the city .
Retailers fume over losses as shopping streets are carved up , shut down , or fenced off while rail tracks are laid at a snail ’s pace ; residents rage at drastically lengthened work commutes ; visitors despairingly shred maps as city roads are randomly closed or rerouted .
But the inconvenience is only the start of it :
The Israeli rail tracks cross West Jerusalem and go through Palestinian East Jerusalem , which the international community defines as occupied and which is supposed to be the capital of a future Palestinian state .
While Israeli officials maintain there ’s no political angle to the rail line , Palestinian critics see an attempt to unify Jerusalem by laying down infrastructure in occupied territory , against the Geneva Conventions .
The dispute over the railway has become a flashpoint for Jerusalem ’s broader troubles : the increasing house demolitions in Palestinian East Jerusalem , the recent riots in the Old City , and the constant , simmering tension over who rules the holy city , and how , and what gives them the right to , anyway .
Even if the construction does one day end , the train ’s woes may have only just begun .
The Jerusalem Light Rail project — a public - private initiative — got started in late 2006 .
Electric trams will run on a single cross-city route with right of way and traffic priority at all junctions .
Tracks are being set down across an 8.7 - mile line that runs from Mount Herzl to the west of the city , through the center , past the Old City , into Palestinian villages of East Jerusalem — Sheikh Jarrah , Shuafat , Beit Hanina — and ending at the Jewish settlement of Pisgat Ze ’ev to the north .
An expected 44 trains will make 250,000 yearly trips on the tracks , charging a subsidized fare .
There are an intended 24 stops on the line , but so far the only thing to stop has been work on the tracks — repeatedly .
The project has already failed to meet completion deadlines , and a battle focused on whose fault that is — council or company — is currently raging in the city courts .
Meanwhile , political pressure overseas is further gumming up the works .
The French company Veolia , which was supposed to run the trains and has a 5 percent stake in the light - rail consortium , has just pulled out after losing major contracts in Europe over its involvement in the Jerusalem train line .
A French Palestinian advocacy group got together with the Palestine Liberation Organization and is suing Veolia and another French investor , Alstom , claiming that involvement in the project is a violation of international law — the case started in late 2007 and is still in court .
To top it off , Veolia ’s planned divestment has sparked another row and is chewing up more court time :
The Israeli bus operator Dan , which has no experience with railways , was going to buy out Veolia ’s shares , but now Israel ’s other bus operator , Egged , is complaining because it too wants some of the action .
Embattled Israeli officials claim that the rail line has nothing to do with politics , that it ’s just a long overdue measure to improve public transport services to all Jerusalem residents , Palestinian and Israeli .
But Palestinian campaigners think this is disingenuous .
Omar Barghouti , a leading member of the Palestinian boycott - Israel movement , counters that the rail endeavor actually was conceived as a political project and points to the words of former Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon , who signed off on the train system with this blessing : " I believe that this should be done .
…
Anything that can be done to strengthen Jerusalem , construct it , expand it , and sustain it for eternity as the capital of the Jewish people and the united capital of the state of Israel , should be done . "
Walid Salem , director of the Centre for Democracy and Community Development in Jerusalem , agrees : " It is a unilateral decision , imposing sovereignty over Jerusalem , without any agreements and in a way that meets only your own [ Israeli ] interests , not those of your supposed - to - be partners . "
Salem views the trains as an Israeli attempt to take Jerusalem off the negotiating table .
Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem , while tentatively excited by the rail project , worry that they ’ll be excluded .
Light - rail spokesman Shmuel Elgrably says that service architects " do n’t differentiate between Arabs and Jews for public transport — in fact the Arab population is more important to us because they use public transport more . "
Around 35 percent of Jerusalem ’s population are regular bus-riders ; ultra-Orthodox Jews and Palestinians make up the largest component of users , though they do n’t share the same bus routes .
Elgrably maintains that , all being well , the bullet - and stone - resistant trains will run normally and carry everyone .
But Palestinians in Shuafat point out that the stops do n’t seem located for their convenience .
They think that just one incidence of violence could close down the line .
For these Jerusalem residents , the prospect that the train ’s security stipulations will stack against them , just as they do with other forms of public transport , seems to be a given : Palestinians are more often stopped and questioned by security officials at bus and railway stations .
And the trains could easily become targets in times of tension ; if there are future Arab - Jewish clashes like the ones seen recently in the Old City , violence could spill onto the nearby tramlines .
Residents wo n’t find out how it ’s all going to work until December 2010 , assuming the line meets the most recent deadline for completion .
Meanwhile , some of the store keepers on Jerusalem ’s Jaffa Road are taking bets as to whose grandchildren might actually get to ride on one of those shiny silver trains nestled at a nearby depot , awaiting their day on the tracks .
It ’s fitting that James Cameron ’s “ Avatar ” arrived in theaters at Christmastime .
Like the holiday season itself , the science fiction epic is a crass embodiment of capitalistic excess wrapped around a deeply felt religious message .
It ’s at once the blockbuster to end all blockbusters , and the Gospel According to James .
But not the Christian Gospel .
Instead , “ Avatar ” is Cameron ’s long apologia for pantheism  a faith that equates God with Nature , and calls humanity into religious communion with the natural world .
In Cameron ’s sci-fi universe , this communion is embodied by the blue - skinned , enviably slender Na’Vi , an alien race whose idyllic existence on the planet Pandora is threatened by rapacious human invaders .
The Na’Vi are saved by the movie ’s hero , a turncoat Marine , but they ’re also saved by their faith in Eywa , the “ All Mother , ” described variously as a network of energy and the sum total of every living thing .
If this narrative arc sounds familiar , that ’s because pantheism has been Hollywood ’s religion of choice for a generation now .
It ’s the truth that Kevin Costner discovered when he went dancing with wolves .
It ’s the metaphysic woven through Disney cartoons like “ The Lion King ” and “ Pocahontas . ”
And it ’s the dogma of George Lucas ’s Jedi , whose mystical Force “ surrounds us , penetrates us , and binds the galaxy together . ”
The first question : How would Google bring an unlocked phone to market ?
There are really only three ways to sell phones .
The first is to license spectrum from a carrier and become a mobile virtual network operator or MVNO -- a business model that time has proven to be a failure .
The second , of course , is to partner with carriers and offer phones at discounted prices through carrier subsidies , which is more or less the case with every successful device on the US market today .
The final model is to sell unlocked devices at full retail price that can be used by consumers on the network of the their choice .
This is allegedly the model Google will be using to sell the Nexus One .
Until someone can give me a ten - word answer to how Mountain View can manage to build an ecosystem while trying to compete with it , I will remain skeptical that the Google Phone ever comes to market .
Selling unlocked devices sans carrier is a lousy business model in the States , however .
There 's no mass market for unlocked phones in the US -- just ask Nokia how hard it is to sell a high end phone with no carrier subsidy or support .
Either Google would need to take a huge loss on every device to achieve a consumer - friendly price point , or hope to convince consumers to pay full price for an unsubsidized device -- even though Eric Schmidt in the past has argued phone prices need to trend to zero through full subsidies .
What 's more , an unlocked device will at least get you onto T - Mobile and AT&T 's EDGE networks , but Verizon and Sprint both require phones that are approved for network use and can easily be locked out .
There 's something even more fundamental that struck me as I listened to the " Google Phone " chatter , and that 's the basic challenge of licensing to competitors .
One reason Microsoft is successful in the PC industry is that it 's never built PCs .
Licensing to folks you compete with does n't work : either your licensees do better than you do , in which case why bother , or you do better than your licensees , in which case your licensees wise up and go elsewhere .
Apple 's tried this twice : first with the Newton , where Apple did better than the licensees , and second with Classic Mac OS , where licensees like Power Computing did better than Apple -- eventually driving Cupertino to give up on the licensing idea entirely .
Palm tried it , and it eventually had to split up into Palm and Palm Source .
Nokia tried it with S60 .
The whole point of the Open Handset Alliance is to create a partner ecosystem of handsets and other devices , and a " Google Phone " that undercuts both carriers and licenses might well be the death of Android in the marketplace .
There might be a strategy here that allows for this to happen -- I can even think of one or two -- but until someone can give me a ten - word answer to how Mountain View can manage to build an ecosystem while trying to compete with it , I will remain skeptical that the Google Phone ever comes to market .

Opinion Searching in Vain for the Obama Magic
Never before has a speech by President Barack Obama felt as false as his Tuesday address announcing America 's new strategy for Afghanistan .
It seemed like a campaign speech combined with Bush rhetoric -- and left both dreamers and realists feeling distraught .

At times I ’ve felt like KDE 4 is a little bit on the sluggish side on my desktop PCs .
On a netbook ’s Atom processor ?
I would n’t even have considered switching from Gnome if I had n’t seen this video on YouTube .
We ’ve known the Plasma interface was coming for quite some time , and it finally made its debut in Kubuntu 9.10 .
After watching the 2 - minute demo on a real , live netbook ( the Asus Eee 1005 Ha )
I ca n’t wait to give Kubuntu another shot .
The transition effects and animations run very smoothly , and the interface looks right at home on the 1005 Ha ’s 1024×600 pixel display .
Check the video after the break !
If you ’re using ( or have tried ) Kubuntu 9.10 ’s Plasma interface on your netbook , share your experience in the comments !

If you make one side the base the opposite vertex is the apex , so there are three possible apices .
At the end of the Old Bailey 's longest terrorist trial , I watched Michael Mansfield QC address the jury on behalf of his client , Nabeel Hussain .
The speech was entitled " The Elephant in the Room " and it focused on the recording of a conversation between Nabeel and his cousin .
The two men had been talking at college and they were recorded by a bugging device placed in their room .
Mr Mansfield claimed that the recording provided such powerful evidence of his client 's innocence that it sat there like an oversized pachyderm .
The Crown could barely confront it , let alone answer it .
The jury listened to the recording carefully and Nabeel was – quite rightly – acquitted .
After a trial that had lasted well over a year , he returned to his life as a student .
Last week , the government confirmed it would maintain the rule prohibiting the use of telephone intercepts in court .
It made me think of that case .
If Nabeel 's fateful conversation had been caught by a telephone intercept and not a bugging device placed in the college room , the course of justice may have been very different .
The rule means that defence lawyers and their clients can never be informed about any telephone intercept .
Neither Mansfield , nor Nabeel , could have listened to the intercept or even been told of its existence .
The jury would never have considered it .
What would have happened to Nabeel Hussain ?
More than 1,700 phone intercept warrants were issued in the UK last year .
Intercept evidence is itself the " elephant in the room " in many cases .
It sits before prosecutors , almost impossible to ignore , sometimes providing the most compelling evidence of guilt .
But the Crown must present its case as though that material does not exist .
The UK , alone in the world , denies its prosecutors the use of evidence which could support convictions for murder , drug dealing or sex offences merely because it is obtained through a phone intercept .
Alternatively , the intercept material may reveal some potentially supportive evidence for the defendant , but it can not be disclosed to him .
So even if the prosecutors feel that they could answer that point , in order to ensure a fair trial the case may have to be discontinued .
Criminals who might be otherwise have been convicted walk free .
Other aspects of our legal system are also distorted .
In 2005 , Azelle Rodney was shot dead by police officers .
His inquest can not be completed .
The rule against disclosure of telephone intercepts also applies in the coroner 's court .
If information from an intercepted call was the reason for officers ' actions , the full circumstances of the death can never be made public .
No one benefits from this : Azelle Rodney 's family still do not know why the police felt it necessary to use deadly force and the officers are prevented from explaining themselves fully in an open hearing .
Everyone remains in the dark .
Against that background , prosecutors , civil liberties groups and even defence lawyers have consistently called for the rule to be changed .
But it is those who actually carry out telephone interceptions , such as GCHQ , who take a different view .
For them , the real value of intercepting calls is for intelligence - gathering , not collecting evidence .
They want to protect their work from the public scrutiny of court proceedings .
Once again , their view has prevailed .
However , the reasoning in last week 's report – " Intercept as Evidence " – raises serious concerns .
Surprisingly , the security services ' traditional fears were not the highest concern .
For example , the report concluded that intercepts could be used in court without intelligence techniques being exposed .
Instead , the primary reason was that the retention and examination of intercept material would be too difficult .
For any experienced criminal lawyer , this conclusion is not easy to understand .
Many complex cases already involve the assessment and storage of hundreds of hours of recorded conversations , similar amounts of video surveillance and tens of thousands of texts and emails .
The system copes .
Some reports suggested last week that it would be too arduous to prepare such material for service on the defence .
But the CPS already tackles other types of material effectively .
It is difficult to see why telephone recordings would create a unique problem .
The key to understanding the main concern requires slightly closer reading .
In a critical passage , the report accepts that " the interception agencies should have continued discretion over retention , examination and transcription of intercept material " .
What does this mean ?
In simple terms , it seems that the security services wish to be able to choose how they handle intercept material as part of their operational discretion .
Other considerations come second .
GCHQ spies do not want to be bound by a prosecuting lawyer 's judgment as to what is necessary for the purposes of a fair trial of a suspect .
This is a troubling reason for keeping such a flawed rule , and it is also a recipe for potential miscarriages of justice .
Which brings us back to an earlier question : what would have happened to Nabeel Hussain if that crucial conversation had been recorded by a telephone intercept ?
If the prosecutors had spotted it , knowing that they could not disclose it , they may have been forced to drop the case against him and others .
But something else may have happened .
If , for " operational reasons " , the intercept recording had inadvertently not been properly transcribed and logged , that lifesaving evidence may have been destroyed or never properly assessed .
If so , it would have remained unknown even to the prosecutors themselves .
And an entirely innocent young man would now be serving a life sentence for a crime he did not commit .
It is a chilling thought .
Despite its conclusion , the report seems to be a genuine attempt to examine the problem .
It acknowledges that efforts to find a solution should continue .
I hope there will not be a long wait .
The sooner we recognise just how dangerous this elephant in the room is the better .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States has frozen the U.S. - based assets of 22 individuals and 10 companies linked to one of Mexico ’s most ruthless drug gangs , the U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday .
“ The Beltran Leyva Organization is responsible for acts of terrible violence in the pursuit of money , ” Adam Szubin , director of Treasury ’s Office of Foreign Asset Control , said in a statement .
“ Today ’s action aims to disrupt their ill - gotten gains , targeting a wide network of commercial entities used to move , launder and conceal proceeds of their crimes , ” Szubin said .
U.S. authorities accuse the gang of smuggling cocaine from Central and South America and heroin from Mexico into the United States and say it is responsible for countless murders of Mexican counternarcotics forces .
Former U.S. President George W. Bush formally designated Marcos Arturo Beltran Leyva and his organization as “ kingpins ” in 2008 under U.S. narcotics law .
Treasury ’s Office of Foreign Asset Control did not identify the 22 individuals and 10 companies it designated on Thursday .
But it said the Beltran Leyva Organization and its associates controlled companies involved in air and vehicle shipping , electronics retailing , health products trade , business consulting and hospitality services .
The companies are located throughout Mexico in the states of Chihuahua , Sinaloa , Chiapas , Sonora , Jalisco , Estado de Mexico , Baja California Norte and the Distrito Federal .
The action also bars U.S. persons from doing business with the designated people and companies .

Notes to editors
About SNP Dr
The SNP Dr works by analysing genetic variations found in DNA called Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) .
SNPs are the parts of human DNA that make us all respond differently to disease , bacteria , viruses , toxins or medication .
Each year , the NHS spends £ 460 million to treat 250,000 patients who are admitted to hospital suffering adverse reactions to prescribed medication .
The SNP Dr works by analysing the DNA in saliva or cheek swab samples , which are placed in a cartridge and exposed to the silicon chip sensors inside the device .
A copy of the fast or slow metabolic SNPs is contained in the chip .
If they detect a match , a message is displayed on the SNP Dr ’s console .
The doctor can then assess their patient in the GP surgery , without a lengthy and costly laboratory analysis , and prescribe dosages and treatments accordingly .
About DNA Electronics ( http://www.dnae.co.uk)
DNA Electronics is a consumer - focused company with a scaleable technology .
DNA Electronics ( DNAe ) is developing disposable silicon chip - based solutions for real - time gene sequence detection at point - of - care .
All living things are defined by their genetic code – from the unique identity of a bacteria or virus to the physical and biological traits of humans .
Gene tests can be used to determine how a patient will respond to certain drug treatments ; the cause of an illness ; a person ’s genetic predisposition to disease ; and environmental or food contamination .
Traditionally however , gene tests can only be carried out in a laboratory by skilled personnel .
DNAe ’s silicon - based platform technology delivers fast and accurate handheld gene test solutions with all the appeal of consumer electronics : anytime anywhere .
This presents disruptive new opportunities in diagnostics , data capture and therapy .

Predatory women are destroying the sexual confidence of young men in Ireland - with some men as young as 20 now turning to Viagra to prop up their flagging libido .
A growing ' ladette ' culture of women who prefer instant action is proving so intimidating that more and more young men are taking the blue pill to cope .
The claim comes from Ireland 's leading psychosexual therapist , who says that in the past year she has met a growing number of anxious young males who complain they are expected to " perform at will " .
Mary O'Conor says the rising number of women who want instant gratification within hours of meeting a man is leading to immense pressure to perform between the sheets .
" There is a certain group of women who are ladettes and they are just out to have a good time , " says Ms O'Conor .
" They want to have sex and they do n't want any strings attached .
" They say that they give guys the wrong number or that they do n't give them a number at all .
It 's a bit like what would have been traditionally viewed as ' the stereotypical lad ' . "
The Dublin - based sex therapist says women are now more vocal than ever about their demands and that this pressure is forcing some young men to turn to the erection - enhancing drug for help .
" For guys who are not very confident , they find it difficult when they are expected to perform at will on the first night , which can lead to problems .
" They can become very anxious and this in turn can lead to a situation where they are again apprehensive the next time they 're with a girl .
So it 's a whole other aspect of erectile dysfunction that we 're seeing now . "
However , men as young as their late teens are now plucking up the courage to seek professional help .
" I am seeing men who are as young as 19 , " says Ms O'Conor .
" Certainly 20 and 21 - year - old guys [ who are coming to see me ] would be taking Viagra or Cialis .
" These guys sometimes feel that they should be able to perform at will and I 'm trying to reassure them that they should n't .
" There should be some element of the chase and there certainly should be some element that they fancy the girl and they should certainly know her .
But unfortunately the natural order of things is being side - tracked . "
A recent survey carried out by the Erectile Dysfunction Information Bureau revealed that men consider impotence to be the most embarrassing medical problem to discuss with a doctor .
The study found that only 10 per cent of men who experience impotence ever seek medical help .
Leading scientists , including a Nobel Prize - winner , have rounded on studies used by climate sceptics to show that global warming is a natural phenomenon connected with sunspots , rather than the result of the man -made emissions of carbon dioxide .
The researchers – all experts in climate or solar science – have told The Independent that the scientific evidence continually cited by sceptics to promote the idea of sunspots being the cause of global warming is deeply flawed .
Studies published in 1991 and 1998 claimed to establish a link between global temperatures and solar activity – sunspots – and continue to be cited by climate sceptics , including those who attended an " alternative " climate conference in Copenhagen last week .

However , problems with the data used to establish the correlation have been identified by other experts and the flaws are now widely accepted by the scientific community , even though the studies continue to be used to support the idea that global warming is " natural " .
The issue has gained new importance in the light of opinion polls showing that nearly one in two people now believe global warming is a natural phenomenon unconnected with CO2 emissions .
Public distrust of the accepted explanation of global warming has been exacerbated by emails leaked from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , which appeared to suggest that scientists were engaged in a conspiracy to suppress contrarian views .
Many sceptics who accept that global temperatures have risen in recent decades suggest it is part of the climate 's natural variability and could be accounted for by normal variations in the activity of the Sun .
Powerful support for this idea came in 1991 when Eigil Friis - Christensen , director of the Danish National Space Centre , published a study showing a remarkable correlation between global warming and the length of sunspot cycles .
A further study published in 1998 by Mr Friis - Christensen and his colleague Henrik Svensmark suggested a possible explanation for the warming trend with a link between solar activity , cosmic rays and the formation of clouds .
However , many scientists now believe both of these studies are seriously flawed , and that when errors introduced into the analysis are removed , the correlations disappear , with no link between sunspots and global warming .
Peter Laut , a former adviser to the Danish Energy Agency who first identified the flaws , said there were practically no observations to support the idea that variations in sunspots played more than a minor role in global warming .
Mr Laut 's analysis of the flaws is accepted by most scientists familiar with the research , including Paul Crutzen , an atmospheric chemist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany , who won a Nobel Prize for his work on understanding the hole in the ozone layer .
" There is definitely a problem [ with these studies ] .
Laut has really pinned it down but the [ sunspot ] argument keeps reappearing and its quite irritating , " Professor Crutzen said .
Professor Stefan Rahsmstorf , of Potsdam University , agreed : " I 've looked into this quite closely and I 'm on Laut 's side in terms of his analysis of the data . "
Some scientists believe the flaws are so serious that the papers should be retracted or at least the authors should acknowledge that their work contains problems that question the correlations they have apparently established .
" Their controversial papers must be retracted or at least that there will be an official statement by them acknowledging their mistake , " said Andre Berger , honorary president of the European Geosciences Union .
Messrs Svensmark and Friis - Christensen stand by their studies and continue to believe there is evidence to support their sunspot theory of global warming , despite the doubts first raised by Laut .
" It 's not a critique of the science or the correlations , it 's a critique of person , " Mr Friis - Christensen said .
" It 's a character assassination .
[ Laut ] is not interested in the science , he 's interested in promoting the idea Henrik did something unethical . "
What are sunspots and cosmic rays ?
* Sunspots
Differences in the rotation between the Sun 's equator and poles amplify the solar magnetic field until it bursts through to the surface as " sunspots " .
The activity follows an 11 - year cycle , which may vary by a few years .
High sunspot activity is associated with a strong solar winds and slightly higher radiation intensity – about 0.1 per cent higher than a sunspot minimum .
* Cosmic rays
Stellar explosions in deep space give off cosmic radiation that continually bombards Earth .
The energy , however , is very weak ( equivalent to starlight ) .
Some scientists believe that cosmic rays may influence cloud formation by aerosol " seeding " .

Google Goggles , in the Google Labs , is part of an initiative that Google calls a nascent technology that aims to apply search to the most complex of the human senses – sight .
It will allow the user to take a photo of anything and use that as the search criteria .
Billions of images exist in an index but Google opted not to incorporate facial recognition to safeguard user privacy despite the fact that they do have the technology fully working .
“ Unsupervised learning ” are algorithms that will actually go “ out ” and work on image recognition on its own , parsing comparative data to determine what an image is .
Imagine , for example taking a photo of the Empire State Building – a photo that you have taken , not a generic published photo , and like Shazam does with music , Goggles will parse and return search results about the Empire State Building .
Google MyLocation , Mobile Maps , Near Me
Now builds on the fact that wherever a user is , so is their cell phone .
By always knowing where the cell phone owner is located it can shave off seconds from search result replies .
Near Me Now is an awesome Android app : imagine , for example you arrive at an outdoor event early and are n’t sure what to do in order to kill ten minutes .
Using Google mobile geo-location search feature , you can get realtime search results about not only what coffee shops but the most popular or best liked are within a walking distance .
The tech will use radio , cell and satellite to get latitude and longitude as quickly as possible .
Today Google announces Realtime search
Forever gone are the days up updating indexes once a month or week or day or even minute .
“ Relevance is the foundation of this product – relevance , relevance , relevance . ”
Looking at the Google results page is unlike anything you have seen before – scrolling updating data as it happens on the web . ” says Amit Singhal ( master of Google ’s ranking algorithm ) giddily who also underlined that in twenty years of working on search engines this is one of the most exciting announcements of which he has ever been a part .
Now it makes sense that Google sucked Twitter into its search engine result .
I hope this finally underscores for the doubters my evangelizing about Twitter .
This will literally change everything .
If we believed that Google Wave , the realtime collaborative tool , was groundbreaking , then true , realtime search will deeply affect how everything we exchange will unfold from this point forward .
The realtime search results can be accessed by clicking “ Latest ” as opposed to Past Hour , Past 24 hours and so on .
The user will be shown the updates as they hit Google ’s servers themselves in realtime .
“ It shows you exactly what you need as it happens , including tweets . ”
Dozens of new technologies to build realtime search like query fluctuation models , realtime content generation fluctuation model that has to recognize that an event took place and spiked .
Within seconds
Google realtime is analyzing , filtering for relevance and posting billions of documents created daily , on the fly .
“ The importance of relevance has gone through the roof – and everything has become relevant and at the pace at which it is growing , relevance has become the critical factor in building products like this . ”
Like when Google announced Gmail with unlimited storage and Yahoo watched in horror , I can only imagine what Bing must feel like right now .
Google realtime search is already available in Google mobile .
Google Trends
Working from there , Google Trends is graduating from GLabs to Google proper .
The concept of trending that grew up on twitter is now going to figure as a key search method .
Combining realtime web with trending is a little mind - blowing .
Check it out at http://www.google.com/trends
What this will potentially do for the stock market is frightening .
How about the idea put forth at the talk about realtime inventory reporting – ie .
how many copies of a new book are still in stock , or signed special edition copies of that guitar ?
Turn Google ( or perhaps Froogle ) into a realtime QVC !
Facebook pages – the public profiles for specific entities , and MySpace pages designated as public will also be appearing in Google realtime search ( as will identi.ca , Friendfeed and others ) – this means that everyone is essentially a live content creator whose output is being cataloged .
Users will be able to decide what is or is not broadcast via their privacy controls .
Again , the implications are staggering .
What Will Realtime Search Mean for Pagerank ?
As far as pagerank , Mr. Singhal acknowledges the importance of pagerank and reassures the journalists that it is still a factor in realtime search but that additionally dozens of technologies were created not replacing it .
Pagerank is what gives weight to the reliability of a source .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Dashing the hopes of Democratic lawmakers Sunday , Sen. Joseph Lieberman signaled he would oppose a health care bill that includes a proposal to expand Medicare to people as young as 55 .
The independent Connecticut senator has told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , that he would vote against the Medicare at 55 proposal .
He also said he would oppose cloture and work with the GOP if it ends up in the final version of the bill , two Democratic sources told CNN Sunday .
Unanimous Republican opposition so far means Senate Democrats need all 60 votes in their caucus , which includes Lieberman , to pass the sweeping bill .
Earlier , on the CBS program " Face the Nation , " Lieberman and moderate Democratic Sen .
Ben Nelson of Nebraska cited necessary changes to the bill before they would vote for it .
Lieberman outlined steps that he said would ensure the bill passes the Senate with support from Democrats and some Republicans .
Forget about the government - run public health insurance option , Lieberman said , as well as the Medicare measure that was proposed last week as part of a package of alternatives to the public option .
Lieberman 's other conditions were eliminating a government insurance program focused on home health care for the disabled and strengthening cost - containment provisions .
" We do n't need to keep adding on to the back of this horse until the horse breaks down and we get nothing done , " Lieberman said .
A senior Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that the " Democratic leadership was shocked about how strident Lieberman was in his opposition to the Medicare proposal when he went on the Sunday shows . "
However , Lieberman spokesman Marshall Whitmann said the senator first informed Reid on Friday that he had concerns about the Medicare 55 buy - in and " reaffirmed it today . "
Reid spend the afternoon trying to get the 60 votes , according to the aide , who said Democrats still believe the Senate can produce a bill by Christmas but acknowledged that they might have to look elsewhere for the 60 votes .
Nelson said he cannot support the Senate bill without tighter restrictions on federal funding for abortion .
The Senate last week defeated an amendment proposed by Nelson and two other senators that would adopt the tougher language contained in the House health care bill .
A compromise on the abortion language is possible , said Nelson , one of 10 Senate Democrats who negotiated in private last week to seek a compromise to the equally controversial public option .
The negotiators reached a tentative agreement on alternatives , including the Medicare expansion to people 55 and older who lack health insurance , as well as allowing private insurers to offer nonprofit coverage under government supervision .
Their agreement , hailed by President Obama and Democratic leaders as an important step forward , still must be analyzed for its total cost by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
Several Democrats said Sunday they would decide on the compromise once they get the CBO analysis .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , also on " Face the Nation , " signaled continuing opposition to any health care bill even if Democrats settle their differences .
" We do not believe this bill , this nearly 2,100 - page monstrosity , is real health care reform , " McConnell said .
Most Democrats support the public option as a nonprofit competitor to private insurers that would expand coverage and bring down prices .
Republicans and some moderate Democrats , along with the health insurance industry , oppose the public option , saying it would be a first step toward a government takeover of the entire health care system .
The fate of the health care bill could hinge on the votes of as few as one senator from each party .
If Democrats can get 59 of their 60 caucus members to support the bill -- for example , by changing the abortion language to secure Nelson 's vote -- they can focus on gaining the vote of moderate Republican Sen.
Olympia Snowe of Maine , who has signaled an openness to compromise .
If the Senate eventually passes a health care bill , its version will have to be merged by a conference committee with the House version passed last month .
The final bill would then need approval from both chambers before going to Obama to be signed into law .
The president and Democratic leaders have said they want the bill completed this year .
The Senate would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule .

The government is " urgently " looking into reforming the law after a UK court issued an arrest warrant for former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni .
The warrant was granted by a London court at the request of Palestinian plaintiffs , provoking Israeli anger .
It was revoked on Monday when it was found Ms Livni was not visiting the UK .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Israel was a " close friend " of the UK's and stressed he was keen to " avoid this sort of situation arising again " .
Pro-Palestinian campaigners have tried several times to have Israeli officials arrested under the principle of universal jurisdiction , which holds that some alleged crimes are so grave that they can be tried anywhere , regardless of where the offences were committed .
Ms Livni was foreign minister during Israel 's Gaza assault last winter .
The Government is looking urgently at ways in which the UK system might be changed in order to avoid this sort of situation arising again
David Miliband , UK Foreign Secretary
She said the court had been " abused " by the Palestinian plaintiffs who requested the warrant at Westminster Magistrates ' Court .
In a statement on Tuesday evening Mr Miliband said : " Israel is a strategic partner and a close friend of the UK . "
" We are determined to protect and develop these ties .
Israeli leaders - like leaders from other countries - must be able to visit and have a proper dialogue with the British government .

" The procedure by which arrest warrants can be sought and issued without any prior knowledge or advice by a prosecutor is an unusual feature of the system in England and Wales .
" The Government is looking urgently at ways in which the UK system might be changed in order to avoid this sort of situation arising again . "
UK ambassador rebuked
It was the first time a UK court had issued a warrant for the arrest of a former Israeli minister .
" What needs to be put on trial here is the abuse of the British legal system , " Ms Livni told the BBC .
" This is not a suit against Tzipi Livni , this is not a lawsuit against Israel .
This is a lawsuit against any democracy that fights terror . "
She stood by her decisions during the three - week Gaza offensive which began in December last year , she said .
Israel 's foreign ministry summoned the UK's ambassador to Israel to deliver a rebuke over the warrant .
UN backs Gaza war crimes report Legal row over Gaza report Israel debates response to report Full UN report on Gaza war Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the situation was " an absurdity " .
" We will not accept a situation in which [ former Israeli Prime Minister ] Ehud Olmert , [ Defence Minister ] Ehud Barak and Tzipi Livni will be summoned to the defendants ' chair , " Mr Netanyahu said in a statement .
" We will not agree to have Israel Defence Force soldiers , who defended the citizens of Israel bravely and ethically against a cruel and criminal enemy , be recognised as war criminals .
We completely reject this absurdity taking place in Britain , " he said .
Israel denies claims by human rights groups and the UN investigator Richard Goldstone that its forces committed war crimes during the operation , which it said was aimed at ending Palestinian rocket fire at its southern towns .
The Palestinian militant group Hamas has also been accused of committing war crimes during the conflict .
Israel says it fully complies with international law , which it says it interprets in line with other Western countries such as the US and UK .
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO ARREST ISRAELI OFFICIALS
Oct 2009 : Former military chief Moshe Yaalon cancelled a UK visit because of fears of arrest for alleged war crimes Oct 2009 : Filed attempt to raise warrant against Defence Minister Ehud Barak .
Court ruled he had diplomatic immunity Sept 2005 : Arrest warrant issued for a former head of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip Gen Doron Almog .
He received warning before disembarking from an aircraft at Heathrow Airport , and flew back to Israel On Monday Ms Livni 's office had denied the reports that a warrant had been issued and that she had cancelled plans to visit the UK because of fears of arrest .
It said a planned trip had been cancelled two weeks earlier because of scheduling problems .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 people were killed during Israel 's Cast Lead operation between 27 December 2008 and 16 January 2009 , more than half of them civilians .
Israel puts the number of deaths at 1,166 - fewer than 300 of them civilians .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .

( I am working at an office supply store .
My job is very simple : stand in the front of the store where all the printer ink is , sell it , and show customers where other items are .
The ink we sell is made using recycled cartridges .
Otherwise , it ’s the exact same thing as new printer ink ; just we refilled it , instead , and put our logo on it .
A man walks in who looks like he might be a Nordic giant . )
Me : “ Hello , sir .
How can I help you ? ”
Customer : “ I need ink for my printer . ”
( I show him the ink cartridges . )
Me : “ Here we have the new cartridges , but over here we have our brand of ink .
It ’s the exact same thing as the new cartridges , just a lot cheaper . ”
( The customer takes the ink and looks at it , a little confused .
His expression never changes from a blank stare this entire time . )
Customer : “ All right , I ’ll take it .
But if it breaks my printer , I will come back and break your face . ”
( The customer left with the product and I immediately told my manager .
He never came back , so I ’m guessing it worked fine .
Thank goodness . )
According to the government 's broadest measure of unemployment , some 17.5 percent are either without a job entirely or underemployed .
The so - called U - 6 number is at the highest rate since becoming an official labor statistic in 1994 .
The number dwarfs the statistic most people pay attention to — the U - 3 rate — which most recently showed unemployment at 10.2 percent for October , the highest it has been since June 1983 .
The difference is that what is traditionally referred to as the " unemployment rate " only measures those out of work who are still looking for jobs .
Discouraged workers who have quit trying to find a job , as well as those working part - time but looking for full - time work or who are otherwise underemployed , count in the U - 6 rate .
With such a large portion of Americans experiencing employment struggles , economists worry that an extended period of slow or flat growth lies ahead .
" To me there 's no easy solution here , " says Michael Pento , chief economist at Delta Global Advisors .
" Unless you create another bubble in which the economy can create jobs , then you 're not going to have growth .
That 's the sad truth . "
Pento warns that forecasts of a double - dip ( " W " ) or a straight up ( " V " ) recovery both could be too optimistic given the jobs situation .
Instead , he believes the economy could flatline ( or " L " ) for an extended period as small businesses struggle to grow and consequently rehire the workers that have been furloughed as the U - 3 unemployment rate has doubled since March 2008 .
As that trend has happened , the U - 6 rate has expanded at an even more dramatic pace .
Economists cite several reasons for the phenomenon .
For one , more workers are becoming discouraged as real estate — the focal point for the expansion in the earlier part of the decade — has collapsed and taken millions of directly related and ancillary jobs with it .
Leafy greens were rated the riskiest food by the Center for Science in the Public Interest .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Leafy greens -- including lettuce and spinach -- top the list of the 10 riskiest foods , according to a study from a nutrition advocacy group released Tuesday .
The Center for Science in the Public Interest listed the following foods , in descending order , as the most risky in terms of outbreaks : leafy greens , eggs , tuna , oysters , potatoes , cheese , ice cream , tomatoes , sprouts and berries .
The scientists rated these foods , all of them regulated by the Food and Drug Administration , by the number of outbreaks associated with them since 1990 , and also provided the number of recorded illnesses .
The severity of the illnesses ranged from minor stomach aches to death , the center said .
With leafy greens such as lettuce , the top cause of illness were pathogens like E. coli , Norovirus and Salmonella in foods that were not properly washed .
Over the past 20 years , leafy greens caused 363 outbreaks , resulting in 13,568 reported illnesses , the center said .
That 's compared to berries , No. 10 on the list , which were associated with 25 outbreaks totaling 3,397 reported illnesses .
" Leafy greens are a healthy home run , but unfortunately they 're associated with food - borne illness , " said Sarah Klein , a staff lawyer with the center who helped prepared the study .
In all , the Top 10 resulted in more than 1,500 outbreaks , totaling nearly 50,000 reported illnesses , according to the center , which added that most food - related illnesses do n't get treated or reported , so the real total is likely much larger .
" Millions of consumers are being made ill , hundreds of thousands hospitalized and thousands are dying each year from preventable foodborne illnesses , " the study said .
" Unfortunately , the FDA is saddled with outdated laws , and lacks the authority , tools and resources to fight unsafe food . "
Food producers , including the Western Growers Association , released statements criticizing the report .
" Farmers are consumers , too , " the association said , in a release from spokesman Paul Simonds .
" They eat the fresh produce they grow as do the members of their families , and have invested millions of dollars enhancing food safety practices in the last few years .
Scaring people away from eating some of the healthiest foods on the planet , like fresh produce , does not serve consumers . "
Salmonella was also a chief culprit in egg , cheese and tomato - related illnesses , the study said , in cases when eggs are undercooked and when cheese is not processed properly .
Salmonella can be difficult to remove from raw tomatoes without cooking , according to the study .
The study also associated Salmonella and E. coli with potatoes .
Klein said this generally happens when cold - prepared potato items , such as potato salad , are mixed with other contaminated ingredients .
Unrefrigerated fresh tuna deteriorates quickly , the study said , releasing harmful toxins , and canned tuna gets dragged into the picture because of mixed - in ingredients such as mayonnaise .
Improperly washed oysters are at risk of Norovirus .
Rich Ruais , executive director of the Blue Water Fisherman Association and the American Blue Fin Tuna Association in Salem , N.H. , disagreed with the study 's " bad rap " on tuna .
" Tuna ?
I beg to differ , " he said .
" Tuna is one of the healthiest foods on the Earth .
It 's life sustaining ; it 's life prolonging . "
Ruais said the tuna - based diet of Japanese citizens plays a big part in their high average longevity .
He also said the FDA strictly mandates that tuna is gutted and stuffed with ice immediately after it's caught by commercial fisherman , and submerged in slush once it gets to shore , to prevent risk of pathogens .
More surprisingly , bacteria can also survive in ice cream , primarily from the Salmonella contamination of eggs , an important ingredient that is sometimes undercooked , the study said .
Much of the study 's blame goes to a 1994 outbreak that sickened thousands of ice cream lovers in 41 states .
The National Milk Producers Federation released a statement criticizing the report as " based on outdated information . "
" Cheese and ice cream products are among the safest , most stringently regulated foods in this country , " said the federation , in its release .
" The cheese examples in this report mostly concern consumption of raw milk products , which neither [ the ] FDA nor the dairy industry recommends .
The ice cream example is 15 years old and was an isolated incident . "
When President Barack Obama denounced " fat cats " during his performance on " 60 Minutes , " and made weak comments after his meeting with bank CEOs , I was reminded why so many Americans are angry with everyone in Washington .
The president says Wall Street does n't get it .
He has it backward .
Wall Street gets it .
He still does n't .
Wall Street knows that " sticks and stones can break my bones , but faux anger cannot hurt me . "
Wall Street believes the president can be rolled , Congress can be bought , consumers can be screwed , jobs can be destroyed , the nation can be harmed , the public can be enraged -- and it can continue these practices without limit and without shame and pay itself gigantic bonuses for it , and nobody will fight to change this .
The president famously told bankers he stood between them and pitchforks .
Presumably he meant the pitchforks are country rubes like myself and 250 million Americans who think that when troops give their lives to serve our nation , bankers who get huge bailouts might ask what they can do for our country , instead of enriching themselves to levels that historians will discuss for a hundred years .
It is not the job of the president to protect the fat cats from the proper wrath of the people .
It is the job of the president to protect the people from the improper abuse of the fat cats .
And now : Congress may pass a healthcare bill that would help insurance CEOs making $ 10 million a year spend a generation raising premiums even further , while certain senators who take their money work to defeat a public option that would serve the nation and lower the deficit and that is supported by a majority of the people .
And now : Drug companies that concluded a secret deal with the White House to raise drug prices by almost 10 percent work to defeat proposals to allow import of lower - priced drugs that would serve the consumer and lower the deficit , and that are supported by a majority of the people .
And now : The House , in the service of fat - cat bankers , with the support of many Democrats and Republicans , defeated an amendment that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to save homeowners .
And now , after the passage of a credit card bill that I stood virtually alone among Democrats in opposing , credit card companies raise rates to the skies .
They gouge customers into the ground .
They decimate small businesses .
They destroy American jobs .
And now :
The Treasury secretary , who treats his office like Wall Street on the Potomac , schemes to give the bailout money back to the banks , without conditions , so they can loan it to small businesses !
I view my job as a columnist and someone who may appear in the media and advise elected officials not to be an apologist for those who are elected , but to give voice , as honorably as I can , to those who elected them .
I have been warning about the sins of our modern Gilded Age for years .
Whether other insiders like it or not , I am giving voice to voters who are madder than hell and not going to take it anymore .
This town is run by the fat cats .
I plant my flag with the pitchforks , for change we can believe in .

October 24 , 2009
By Tom Burghardt ( Global Research ) [ 1 ]
That social networking sites and applications such as Facebook , Twitter and their competitors can facilitate communication and information sharing amongst diverse groups and individuals is by now a cliché .
It should come as no surprise then , that the secret state and the capitalist grifters whom they serve , have zeroed - in on the explosive growth of these technologies .
One can be certain however , securocrats are n't tweeting their restaurant preferences or finalizing plans for after work drinks .
No , researchers on both sides of the Atlantic are busy as proverbial bees building a " total information " surveillance system , one that will , so they hope , provide police and security agencies with what they euphemistically call " actionable intelligence . "
Build the Perfect Panopticon , Win Fabulous Prizes !
In this context , the whistleblowing web site Wikileaks published a remarkable document October 4 by the INDECT Consortium , the Intelligence Information System Supporting Observation , Searching and Detection for Security of Citizens in Urban Environment .
Hardly a catchy acronym , but simply put INDECT is working to put a human face on the billions of emails , text messages , tweets and blog posts that transit cyberspace every day ; perhaps your face .
According to Wikileaks , INDECT 's " Work package 4 " is designed " to comb web blogs , chat sites , news reports , and social - networking sites in order to build up automatic dossiers on individuals , organizations and their relationships . "
Ponder that phrase again : " automatic dossiers . "
This is n't the first time that European academics have applied their " knowledge skill sets " to keep the public " safe " -- from a meaningful exercise of free speech and the right to assemble , that is .
Last year The Guardian reported that Bath University researchers ' Cityware project covertly tracked " tens of thousands of Britons " through the installation of Bluetooth scanners that capture " radio signals transmitted from devices such as mobile phones , laptops and digital cameras , and using the data to follow unwitting targets without their permission . "
One privacy advocate , Simon Davies , the director of Privacy International , told The Guardian : " This technology could well become the CCTV of the mobile industry .
It would not take much adjustment to make this system a ubiquitous surveillance infrastructure over which we have no control . "
Which of course , is precisely the point .
As researchers scramble for a windfall of cash from governments eager to fund these dubious projects , European police and security agencies are n't far behind their FBI and NSA colleagues in the spy game .
The online privacy advocates , Quintessenz , published a series of leaked documents in 2008 that described the network monitoring and data mining suites designed by Nokia Siemens , Ericsson and Verint .
The Nokia Siemens Intelligence Platform dubbed " intelligence in a box , " integrate tasks generally done by separate security teams and pools the data from sources such as telephone or mobile calls , email and internet activity , bank transactions , insurance records and the like .
Call it data mining on steroids .
Ironically enough however , Siemens , the giant German electronics firm was caught up in a global bribery scandal that cost the company some $ 1.6 billion in fines .
Last year ,
The New York Times described " a web of secret bank accounts and shadowy consultants , " and a culture of " entrenched corruption ... at a sprawling , sophisticated corporation that externally embraced the nostrums of a transparent global marketplace built on legitimate transactions . "
According to the Times , " at Siemens , bribery was just a line item . "
Which just goes to show , powering the secret state means never having to say you 're sorry !
Social Network Spying , a Growth Industry Fueled by Capitalist Grifters
The trend by security agencies and their corporate partners to spy on their citizens has accelerated greatly in the West since the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
This multi-billion industry in general , has been a boon for the largest American and European defense corporations .
Among the top ten companies listed by Washington Technology in their annual ranking of the " Top 100 " prime government contractors , all ten -- from Lockheed Martin to Booz Allen Hamilton -- earned a combined total of $ 68 billion in 2008 from defense and related homeland security work for the secret state .
And like Siemens , all ten corporations figure prominently on the Project on Government Oversight 's Federal Contractor Misconduct Database ( FCMD ) , which tracks " contract fraud , environmental , ethics , and labor violations . "
Talk about a rigged game !
Designing everything from nuclear missile components to eavesdropping equipment for various government agencies in the United States and abroad , including some of the most repressive regimes on the planet , these firms have moved into manufacturing the hardware and related computer software for social networking surveillance in a big way .
Wired revealed in April that the FBI is routinely monitoring cell phone calls and internet activity during criminal and counterterrorism investigations .
The publication posted a series of internal documents that described the Wi-Fi and computer hacking capabilities of the Bureau 's Cryptographic and Electronic Analysis Unit ( CEAU ) .
New Scientist reported back in 2006 that the National Security Agency " is funding research into the mass harvesting of the information that people post about themselves on social networks . "
And just this week in an exclusive report published by the British high - tech publication , The Register , it was revealed that " the government has outsourced parts of its biggest ever mass surveillance project to the disaster - prone IT services giant formerly known as EDS . "
That work is being conducted under the auspices of the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , the British state 's equivalent of America 's National Security Agency .
Investigative journalist Chris Williams disclosed that the American computer giant HP , which purchased EDS for some $ 13.9 billion last year , is " designing and installing the massive computing resources that will be needed to analyse details of who contacts whom , when where and how . "
Work at GCHQ in Cheltenham is being carried out under " a secret project called Mastering the Internet . "
In May , a Home Office document surfaced that " ostensibly sought views on whether ISPs should be forced to gather terabytes of data from their networks on the government 's behalf . "
The Register reported earlier this year that telecommunications behemoth Detica and U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin were providing GCHQ with data mining software " which searches bulk data , such as communications records , for patterns ... to identify suspects . "
( For further details see : Antifascist Calling , " Spying in the UK : GCHQ Awards Lockheed Martin £ 200 m Contract , Promises to ' Master the Internet ' , " May 7 , 2009 )
It seems however , that INDECT researchers like their GCHQ / NSA kissin ' cousins in Britain and the United States , are burrowing ever - deeper into the nuts - and - bolts of electronic social networking and may be on the verge of an Orwellian surveillance " breakthrough . "
As New Scientist sagely predicted , the secret state most certainly plans to " harness advances in internet technology -- specifically the forthcoming ' semantic web ' championed by the web standards organisation W3C - - to combine data from social networking websites with details such as banking , retail and property records , allowing the NSA to build extensive , all - embracing personal profiles of individuals . "
Profiling Internet Dissent
Pretty alarming , but the devil as they say is in the details and INDECT 's release of their " Work package 4 " file makes for a very interesting read .
And with a title , " XML Data Corpus : Report on methodology for collection , cleaning and unified representation of large textual data from various sources : news reports , weblogs , chat , " rest assured one must plow through much in the way of geeky gibberish and tech - speak to get to the heartless heart of the matter .
INDECT itself is a rather interesting amalgamation of spooks , cops and academics .
According to their web site , INDECT partners include : the University of Science and Technology , AGH , Poland ; Gdansk University of Technology ; InnoTech DATA GmbH & Co. , Germany ; IP Grenoble ( Ensimag ) , France ; MSWiA , the General Headquarters of Police , attached to the Ministry of the Interior , Poland ; Moviquity , Spain ; Products and Systems of Information Technology , PSI , Germany ; the Police Service of Northern Ireland , PSNI , United Kingdom ( hardly slouches when it comes to stitching - up Republicans and other leftist agitators ! ) ; Poznan University of Technology ; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid ; Technical University of Sofia , Bulgaria ; University of Wuppertal , Germany ; University of York , Great Britain ; Technical University of Ostrava , Czech Republic ; Technical University of Kosice , Slovakia ; X - Art Pro Division G.m.b.H , Austria ; and finally , the Fachhochschule Technikum , also in Austria .
I do n't know about you , but I find it rather ironic that the European Union , ostensible guardians of democracy and human rights , have turned for assistance in their surveillance projects to police and spy outfits from the former Soviet bloc , who after all know a thing or two when it comes to monitoring their citizens .
Right up front , York University 's Suresh Manadhar , Ionnis Klapaftis and Shailesh Pandey , the principle authors of the INDECT report , make their intentions clear .
Since " security " as the authors argue , " is becoming a weak point of energy and communications infrastructures , commercial stores , conference centers , airports and sites with high person traffic in general , " they aver that " access control and rapid response to potential dangers are properties that every security system for such environments should have . "
Does INDECT propose building a just and prosperous global society , thus lessening the potential that terrorist killers or other miscreants will exploit a " target rich environment " that may prove deadly for innocent workers who , after all , were the principle victims of the 2004 and 2007 terrorist outrages in Madrid and London ?
Hardly .
As with their colleagues across the pond , INDECT is hunting for the ever - elusive technological quick - fix , a high - tech magic bullet .
One , I might add , that will deliver neither safety nor security but rather , will constrict the democratic space where social justice movements flourish while furthering the reach of unaccountable security agencies .
The document " describes the first deliverable of the work package which gives an overview about the main methodology and description of the XML data corpus schema and describes the methodology for collection , cleaning and unified representation of large textual data from various sources : news reports , weblogs , chat , etc . "
The first order of business " is the study and critical review of the annotation schemes employed so far for the development and evaluation of methods for entity resolution , co-reference resolution and entity attributes identification . "
In other words , how do present technologic capabilities provide police , security agencies and capitalist grifters with the ability to identify who might be speaking to whom and for what purpose .
INDECT proposes to introduce " a new annotation scheme that builds upon the strengths of the current - state - of - the - art , " one that " should be extensible and modifiable to the requirements of the project . "
Asserting that " an XML data corpus [ can be ] extracted from forums and social networks related to specific threats ( e.g. hooliganism , terrorism , vandalism , etc. ) , " the authors claim they will provide " different entity types according to the requirements of the project .
The grouping of all references to an entity together .
The relationships between different entities " and finally , " the events in which entities participate . "
Why stop there ?
Why not list the ubiquitous " other " areas of concern to INDECT 's secret state partners ?
While " hooliganism , terrorism , vandalism , etc. , " may be the ostensible purpose of their " entity attributes identification " project , surely INDECT is well aware that such schemes are just as easily applicable to local citizen groups , socialist and anarchist organizations , or to the innumerable environmental , human rights or consumer campaigners who challenge the dominant free market paradigm of their corporate sponsors .
The authors however , could n't be bothered by the sinister applications that may be spawned by their research ; indeed , they seem quite proud of it .
" The main achievements of this work " they aver , " allows the identification of several types of entities , groups the same references into one class , while at the same time allows the identification of relationships and events . "
Indeed , the " inclusion of a multi- layered ontology ensures the consistency of the annotation " and will facilitate in the ( near ) future , " the use of inference mechanisms such as transitivity to allow the development of search engines that go beyond simple keyword search . "
Quite an accomplishment !
An enterprising security service or capitalist marketing specialist need only sift through veritable mountains of data available from commercial databases , or mobile calls , tweets , blog posts and internet searches to instantaneously identity " key agitators , " to borrow the FBI 's very 20th century description of political dissidents ; individuals who could be detained or " neutralized " should sterner methods be required .
Indeed , a surveillance scheme such as the one INDECT is building could greatly facilitate -- and simplify -- the already formidable U.S. " Main Core " database that " reportedly collects and stores -- without warrants or court orders -- the names and detailed data of Americans considered to be threats to national security , " as investigative journalists Tim Shorrock and Christopher Ketchum revealed in two disturbing reports last year .
The scale of " datasets / annotation schemes " exploited by INDECT is truly breathtaking and include : " Automatic Content Extraction " gleaned from " a variety of sources , such as news , broadcast conversations " that identify " relations between entities , and the events in which these participate . "
We next discover what is euphemistically called the " Knowledge Base Population ( KBP ) , " an annotation scheme that " focuses on the identification of entity types of Person ( PER ) , Organization ( ORG ) , and Geo-Political Entity ( GPE ) , Location ( LOC ) , Facility ( FAC ) , Geographical / Social / Political ( GPE ) , Vehicle ( VEH ) and Weapon ( WEA ) . "
How is this accomplished ?
Why through an exploitation of open source materials of course !
INDECT researchers readily aver that " a snapshot of Wikipedia infoboxes is used as the original knowledge source .
The document collection consists of newswire articles on the order of 1 million .
The reference knowledge base includes hundreds of thousands of entities based on articles from an October 2008 dump of English Wikipedia .
The annotation scheme in KBP focuses on the identification of entity types of Person ( PER ) , Organization ( ORG ) , and Geo-Political Entity ( GPE ) . "
For what purpose ?
Mum 's the word as far as INDECT is concerned .
Nothing escapes this panoptic eye .
Even popular culture and leisure activities fall under the glare of security agencies and their academic partners in the latest iteration of this truly monstrous privacy - killing scheme .
Using the movie rental firm Netflix as a model , INDECT cites the firm 's " 100 million ratings from 480 thousand randomly - chosen , anonymous Netflix customers " as " well - suited " to the INDECT surveillance model .
In conclusion , EU surveillance architects propose a " new annotation & knowledge representation scheme " that " is extensible , " one that " allows the addition of new entities , relations , and events , while at the same time avoids duplication and ensures integrity . "
Deploying an ontological methodology that exploits currently available data from open source , driftnet surveillance of news , broadcasts , blog entries and search results , and linkages obtained through a perusal of mobile phone records , credit card purchases , medical records , travel itineraries , etc. , INDECT claims that in the near future their research will allow " a search engine to go beyond simple keyword queries by exploiting the semantic information and relations within the ontology . "
And once the scheme is perfected , " the use of expressive logics ... becomes an enabler for detecting entity relations on the web . "
Or transform it into an " always - on " spy you carry in your pocket or whenever you switch on your computer .
This is how our minders propose to keep us " safe . "
CIA Gets
In on the Fun
Not to be outdone , the CIA has entered the lucrative market of social networking surveillance in a big way .
In an exclusive published by Wired , we learn that the CIA 's investment arm , In - Q - Tel , " want to read your blog posts , keep track of your Twitter updates -- even check out your book reviews on Amazon . "
Investigative journalist Noah Shachtman reveals that In - Q - Tel " is putting cash into Visible Technologies , a software firm that specializes in monitoring social media .
It 's part of a larger movement within the spy services to get better at using " open source intelligence " -- information that 's publicly available , but often hidden in the flood of TV shows , newspaper articles , blog posts , online videos and radio reports generated every day . "
Wired reported :
Visible crawls over half a million web 2.0 sites a day , scraping more than a million posts and conversations taking place on blogs , online forums , Flickr , YouTube , Twitter and Amazon .
( It does n't touch closed social networks , like Facebook , at the moment . )
Customers get customized , real - time feeds of what 's being said on these sites , based on a series of keywords .
( Noah Shachtman , Exclusive : U.S. Spies Buy Stake in Firm that Monitors Blogs , Tweets , " Wired , October 19 , 2009 )
Although In - Q - Tel spokesperson Donald Tighe told Wired that it wants Visible to monitor foreign social media and give American spooks an " early - warning detection on how issues are playing internationally , " Shachtman points out that " such a tool can also be pointed inward , at domestic bloggers or tweeters . "
According to Wired , the firm already keeps tabs on 2.0 web sites " for Dell , AT&T and Verizon . "
And as an added attraction , " Visible is tracking animal - right activists ' online campaigns " against meat processing giant Hormel .
Shachtman reports that " Visible has been trying for nearly a year to break into the government field . "
And why would n't they , considering that the heimat security and even spookier black world of the U.S. " intelligence community , " is a veritable cash - cow for enterprising corporations eager to do the state 's bidding .
In 2008 Wired reports , Visible " teamed - up " with the Washington , DC - based consulting firm " Concepts & Strategies , which has handled media monitoring and translation services for U.S. Strategic Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , among others . "
According to a blurb on the firm's web site they are in hot - pursuit of " social media engagement specialists " with Defense Department experience and " a high proficiency in Arabic , Farsi , French , Urdu or Russian . "
Wired reports that Concepts & Strategies " is also looking for an ' information system security engineer ' who already has a ' Top Secret SCI [ Sensitive Compartmentalized Information ] with NSA Full Scope Polygraph ' security clearance . "
In such an environment , nothing escapes the secret state 's lens .
Shachtman reveals that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) " maintains an Open Source Center , which combs publicly available information , including web 2.0 sites . "
In 2007 , the Center 's director , Doug Naquin , " told an audience of intelligence professionals " that " ' we 're looking now at YouTube , which carries some unique and honest - to - goodness intelligence ....
We have groups looking at what they call ' citizens media ' : people taking pictures with their cell phones and posting them on the internet .
Then there 's social media , phenomena like MySpace and blogs ' . "
But as Steven Aftergood , who maintains the Secrecy News web site for the Federation of American Scientists told Wired , " even if information is openly gathered by intelligence agencies it would still be problematic if it were used for unauthorized domestic investigations or operations .
Intelligence agencies or employees might be tempted to use the tools at their disposal to compile information on political figures , critics , journalists or others , and to exploit such information for political advantage .
That is not permissible even if all of the information in question is technically ' open source ' . "
But as we have seen across the decades , from COINTELPRO to Operation CHAOS , and from Pentagon media manipulation during the run-up to the Iraq war through driftnet warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' electronic communications , the secret state is a law unto itself , a self - perpetuating bureaucracy that thrives on duplicity , fear and cold , hard cash .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Mark Boal was crouched on the ground , preparing for impact .
A freelance journalist and screenwriter , Boal had gone to Iraq and was working with a bomb - defusal squad as research for a Playboy article that would later inspire the movie “ The Hurt Locker . ”
“ The very first day I was there , I went out with a bomb unit on a road that was a big source of ambushes and machine - gun attacks , ” he recalls .
“ The bomb tech went down and disarmed a bomb and then came back up and started walking toward us . ”
That ’s when he saw an almost - invisible wire protruding from the street .
“ He saw something out of the corner of his eye and dove on it , ” Boal says .
“ It turned out to be a secondary bomb planted there , in case he disarmed the first one . ”
The tech disarmed the bomb , narrowly avoiding a potential explosion that could have killed him , his crew and possibly Boal himself .
“ His face was flushed and red , ” Boal remembers .
“ He was really glad he saw that secondary -- he just noticed ( the ) little wire sticking out of the rubble pile .
That became the inspiration for the second scene ( in the movie ) , where Sgt. James is about to leave and pulls up this daisy chain of bombs . ”
For movies like Boal ’s , there is no substitute for real - life research .
With “ Hurt Locker , ” this led to an authenticity that has made it one of the most - praised war movies of recent years .
Surprisingly , writers working on very different movies stress that research is just as important to them as it was to Boal .
Pixar ’s Pete Docter and Bob Peterson spent weeks in a remote South American location in order to bring their fantasy “ Up ” to life .
The duo had originally imagined a South Pacific island as the setting for the story of an old man who travels to the ends of the earth to fulfill his dream , but after watching a documentary about the tupuis -- flat - topped mountain peaks in the remotest reaches of Venezuela -- they changed their minds .
After writing the new location into a draft of their work - in - progress , the animators - turned - writers embarked on a two - week trip to explore it first - hand .
The journey “ took three days , and smaller and smaller airplanes , and then a jeep , a helicopter and a hike , ” says Docter , who also directed the movie .
A crew of 10 , including artists and production designers , camped for two weeks in the locale , which was breathtaking , but also rainy , misty and isolated .
At one point , they traveled upriver to the world ’s tallest waterfall , which became Paradise Falls in the story .
“ We basically put ourselves through everything that Carl and Russell went through , ” says Docter , referring to the movie ’s main characters , an elderly man and a Boy Scout .
And the whole team drew pictures -- tons of them -- to capture the details of the rock formations , flora and fauna .
“ It seems pretty essential to visit a place before you can caricature it , ” says Docter , describing the process by which animators bring distinctive life and personality to their drawings .
“ It ’s one thing to see these plants in fuzzy background photographs , but it ’s another thing to be able to hold them up , or look at them from all different angles . ”
He adds that the writers also made use of the first - hand experience in their script .
At one point , Carl addresses the dog , Dug , only to discover as the mists part that he was talking to a rock .
“ That really happened , ” Docter says .
At one point , the crew climbed onto a scary tupui and then a storm blew up .
The helicopter that was supposed to get them off the peak could not fly through the storm .
They had no shelter and could not even lie down -- and night was falling .
It looked as if they would be standing in the rain , huddled against these rocks all night -- until the helicopter made its way through , after all .
This became the spark for a scene of misery in the movie .
The Internet was the spark for some of the scenes in Alessandro Camon and Oren Moverman ’s “ The Messenger , ” which focuses on the stateside aftermath of the Iraq War as experienced by a pair of casualty notification officers ( Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster ) .
Camon and Moverman were able to use resources on the Web , including military sites and the many soldier blogs that offer a more personal view than has previously been available .
A key document , the Army ’s official casualty notification manual , which contains protocol info that forms the basis of several early scenes , was also available online .
After they presented a draft of the script to the Army , though , the writers were granted a level of access that they say improved the movie immeasurably .
“ The Army opened the door for us to go to the Walter Reed Medical Center and hang out with the soldiers , and go to the Casualty Notification Center in Arlington , ” says Moverman , who also directed the movie .
“ They let us interact with the world and the people we were trying to present , and that was priceless in terms of sharpening the script . ”
The Army also assigned a technical adviser , Lt. Col .
Paul Sinor , who contributed colorful dialogue in addition to details of protocol and behavior .
But while the pair did many interviews , they avoided speaking to anyone who had been on the receiving end of the kind of emotionally devastating notifications depicted in their script .
“ We did n’t want to exploit any real stories , ” Moverman says .
“ And because the movie is from the point of view of the notifiers and not the families , it was a line we did n’t want to go over . ”
One incident in the movie did come directly from an account the writers say they read online .
It ’s when the officers enter a small - town grocery store and unexpectedly run into the parents they are about to notify .
On the spot , they decide to deliver the news , and the father is so shaken that he vomits .
“ In the real story the person behind the counter went for a mop and said to them , ‘ I would n’t do your job for a million dollars , ’ ” Moverman says .
“ We read about it online . ”
While Moverman gained military experience earlier in his life when he served in the Israeli army , he says he does n’t consider that critical .
“ Alessandro did n’t serve in the military , ” he notes of his collaborator .
“ And I thought he had a profound understanding of these characters . ”
Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns ( “ The Bourne Ultimatum ” ) had tons of information at his fingertips when he began work on “ The Informant ! ” based on the book by Kurt Eichenwald , but that did n’t deter him from embarking on his own research into the true story .
“ From a journalistic standpoint , the book laid the story out in incredible detail , ” Burns notes .
“ But none of the voice - over is in the book .
That was an invention that came out of a creative choice that ( director ) Steven Soderbergh and I made to not do a conventional adaptation . ”
The voice - over , a near - constant flow of commentary by Mark Whitacre ( Matt Damon ) , the biochemist - turned - whistleblower , is perhaps the movie ’s most inspired stroke , and opens a window into Whitacre ’s oddness and active fantasy life as well as his acute intelligence .
Says Burns :
“ It was based on a lot of research into the landscapes he frequented , and also into the medical and science backgrounds of the syndrome that he had . ”
Whitacre ’s key role in the sting operation became more interesting when federal investigators discovered he ’d been diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder .
“ Our ambition became to create an unreliable narrator , which he was , ” Burns explains .
“ I spent time talking to psychiatrists and trying to get an understanding of how his disorder connected to his crimes .
I was also going to Decatur , Ill. , and seeing the places he would have sat in , the road he drove to work , and the house he lived in , which was the house we actually shot the movie in . ”
Burns says it was his first sight of that house -- a modern mansion standing in the middle of a cornfield -- that helped guide the tone of the story in the direction of the absurd .
“ Whoever said ‘ God is in the details ’ understood that research is the way effective writing gets better , ” Burns says .
“ Whenever I get stuck as a writer , the answer for me is always do more research .
I was fortunate that Steven supports my need for that and was all in favor of it . ”
And yet , in the end , they both decided that the most potentially intriguing research of all -- actually talking to the incarcerated Whitacre -- was not going to be part of their approach .
“ I was contemplating going to visit him in jail , but Steven discouraged me from that , ” Burns says .
“ He ’s a guy who had an unusual relationship with the truth , ” Burns says , laughing .
“ So I do n’t know if you ’re going to get any closer to it by asking him . ”
The kicker is that when Whitacre actually saw the film , he sent word to the filmmakers that he thought it was very accurate , including the voice - over , which was entirely made up .
“ I ’m mystified and flattered by him saying that , ” Burns says .
“ And I ca n’t help but wonder if it ’s really true . ”
A departure from the factual truth can often be a critical tool in a screenwriter ’s arsenal , but when the subject is a historical figure , the territory can be tricky , as writer Julian Fellowes learned when he wrote about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert .
In “ The Young Victoria , ” a crucial turning - point in the relationship between the recently married couple occurs when Albert throws himself between Victoria and an assassin ’s bullet , and is gravely wounded in the process .
In the script , his sacrifice so moves Victoria that she opens her heart fully to the relationship .
“ That very week she brought his desk into her sitting room , so that from then on they worked together and governed jointly , ” Fellowes recounts .
“ One needs to know why she had that complete change of heart .
It was the realization that he was actually prepared to die for her . ”
And yet , while Victoria was shot at while riding in a carriage with Albert , the prince was not wounded .
Upon the movie ’s release in the U.K. , the press there took Fellowes to task for this and other discrepancies , but the writer defends his choice .
“ The prince behaved in life exactly as in the movie : he saw the gun , which she did not , and he pushed her down and covered her body with his own , ” he says .
“ In real life , the bullet missed him . ”
He adds , “ In the end , one is trying to fasten a movie out of the material .
You can shape things , but you mus n’t state things that are fundamentally untrue in that they alter the truth of the character ’s actions .
It ’s a matter of not changing the moral intent . ”

PRINCETON , NJ --
As 2009 draws down , Gallup reviews four of the key trends that reveal how Americans reacted to the twists and turns experienced in public affairs and the economy over the past decade .
Satisfaction With the Way Things Are Going
At the start of this decade , Americans ' satisfaction with the direction of the country stood at 69 % , near the record - high 71 % established in early 1999 that was fueled by a booming economy .
Satisfaction levels quickly descended in 2001 as economic concerns mounted , and fell below 50 % in mid-August of that year ( 48 % ) .
However , in the first few months after the 2001 terrorist attacks , public satisfaction quickly rebounded -- part of a broader " rally around the flag " effect triggered by 9/11 -- reaching 70 % in December .
The 9/11 effect on U.S. satisfaction dissipated in less than a year , with satisfaction returning to 49 % by July 2002 .
Americans ' satisfaction with the direction of the country generally remained between 40 % and 50 % in 2003 ( averaging 46 % ) , but fell to an average 43 % in 2004 , 38 % in 2005 , 31 % in 2006 , and 28 % in 2007 .
Satisfaction sank further -- along with a faltering U.S. stock market -- at the start of 2008 , dropping well below 20 % for the first time since 1992 .
U.S. satisfaction nearly collapsed in late 2008 , falling from 21 % in September to 8 % October in the midst of the emerging Wall Street financial crisis .
Satisfaction recovered only slightly over the next few months , then rose more sharply in April and May 2009 -- driven largely by increased satisfaction among Democrats under the new Obama administration .
Satisfaction in 2009 peaked at 36 % in August .
However in the last few months of the year , it settled back into the mid-20s , finishing the decade at 25 % in December -- still below the decade average .
Most Important Problem
As might be imagined , Americans have identified a wide variety of issues as being " the most important problem facing this country " when asked this question throughout the decade .
In Gallup 's last reading of the decade -- in December 2009 -- 29 different problems were mentioned by at least 1 % of Americans .
The accompanying graph tracks the decade - long trends in Americans ' mentions of four of these problems : 1 ) the economy ( a category that includes all mentions of economic issues ) ; 2 ) terrorism ; 3 ) wars ( a category including either general mentions of wars or mentions of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan specifically ) ; and 4 ) healthcare .
Two of these four issues -- terrorism and wars -- were basically not on Americans ' radar in the first year and a half of the decade .
That changed after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Mentions of terrorism as the nation 's most important problem went from zero in early September 2001 to 46 % in October of that year .
Concerns over terrorism began to decline from that point on , and by decade 's end , only 1 % to 2 % of Americans were mentioning terrorism as the country 's top problem .
" The lowest presidential job approval rating of the decade was 25 % , and Bush reached it three times in the fall of 2008 , including at the time of the 2008 election to choose his successor . "
Americans ' mentions of war as the nation 's most important problem ( including general mentions of war as well as specific mentions of the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan ) also increased after Sept. 11 , and began to rise substantially in the final months of 2002 and into 2003 as the Bush administration made it clear that the U.S. was going to become militarily involved in Iraq .
By May 2003 , after Bush 's " Mission Accomplished " speech on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln , mentions of war as the nation 's top problem fell and remained low through the summer of that year .
Then , as it became evident that the Iraq war was by no means over -- and as U.S. casualties mounted , hitting 1,000 in September 2004 -- mentions of Iraq as the nation 's top problem began to increase , and basically stayed relatively high through the summer of 2008 , before falling to the single digits as the decade ended .
Mentions of Afghanistan as the nation 's top problem were at a low 4 % at decade 's end .
Americans ' designation of economic - related issues as the nation 's top problems waxed and waned during the decade .
Over 20 % of Americans were mentioning some aspect of the economy as the nation 's top problem in early 2000 .
Those concerns rose to over 50 % by May 2003 , but fell into the teens by late 2006 and into 2007 .
Then , beginning in the late fall of 2007 , Americans increasingly began to mention aspects of the economy as the top problem , with a sharp rise in concerns by the winter and spring of 2008 .
By the summer of 2008 , 60 % or more of Americans were mentioning some aspect of the economy as the nation 's top problem .
Concern spiked even higher in the fall of 2008 and winter of 2009 , reaching the decade 's highest point in February of this year , when 86 % of Americans spontaneously mentioned economic issues as the nation 's top problem .
As the decade ended , economic concerns had abated somewhat , dropping to 55 % in December 2009 .
The perception that healthcare is the nation 's top problem was fairly scarce during most of the decade , reaching a low point of 1 % in October 2001 ( as terrorism overrode other concerns ) .
By the summer of 2009 , as President Obama and congressional leaders began to focus intently on new healthcare reform legislation , the public 's mentioning of healthcare as the country 's top problem began to rise again , reaching 26 % by late August / early September .
At decade 's end , concerns over healthcare had drifted back to 16 % .
Presidential Job Approval
The decade has spanned the administrations of three presidents : Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and Barack Obama .
Clinton 's final year in office was fairly uneventful .
Clinton had solid ratings in the high 50 % and low 60 % range for most of 2000 , finishing his presidency on a high note with a 66 % job approval rating .
Bush began his term in early 2001 with ratings also in the high 50 % and low 60 % range , but his job approval ratings began to settle down , and by Gallup 's Sept. 7 - 10 , 2001 , survey , Bush 's job approval was at 51 % .
Then , after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , Bush was the recipient of the largest rally effect in Gallup history , with his approval rating rising 39 percentage points to 90 % in the space of two weeks .
The 90 % rating is the highest in Gallup history .
Bush 's approval rating -- perhaps inevitably -- generally sloped downward after that , but remained well above average in 2002 and for most of 2003 .
By the time he sought re-election in 2004 , his approval rating hovered near 50 % .
Bush 's second term was characterized by below - average ratings , which sank to the 30 % range in his final two years in office -- including frequent drops into the 20s in his last year .
The lowest presidential job approval rating of the decade was 25 % , and Bush reached it three times in the fall of 2008 , including at the time of the 2008 election to choose his successor .
Bush 's last approval rating , just before he left office , was 34 % .
Obama took office with job approval ratings in the 60 % range , beginning the honeymoon phase of his presidency , which lasted well into the summer months .
By late summer , however , his approval ratings were in the low 50 % range ; they dipped below the majority approval level in November , and have been at or near 50 % in December .
Congressional Job Approval
The decade of the 2000s saw both a new high and a new low in congressional job approval .
The rally in support for government institutions after the 9/11 terror attacks extended to Congress , as 84 % of Americans in October 2001 said they approved of the job Congress was doing , shattering the previous high of 57 % from February 1998 .
But that era of goodwill did not last , as approval ratings of Congress gradually descended -- following the same general pattern seen for George W. Bush 's presidential job approval ratings .
By October 2005 , congressional job approval fell below 30 % ; it was 26 % in the fall of 2006 when Americans transferred party control of both houses of Congress to the Democrats in that year 's midterm elections .
The change in party control only had a very short - lived positive impact on Congress ' ratings , which improved 16 points from December 2006 ( 21 % ) to February 2007 ( 37 % ) after the transfer of power .
By August 2007 , approval had dipped to a record - tying low of 18 % , and the following year , Congress ' ratings established a new historical low of 14 % .
The new Obama administration helped to boost ratings of Congress again in 2009 ; congressional approval went from 19 % in January to 39 % in March .
But again , those higher ratings did not persist , and at the end of the decade , Congress ' job rating stands at 25 % .

The Finnish - owned vessel spurred headlines around the world when it was hijacked last summer carrying lumber en route from Pietarsaari on Finland 's west coast to Algeria .
The Arctic Sea , which is carrying a load of lime , is expected to remain in the south - eastern port through the weekend .
In August , the Russian Navy took over the ship near Cape Verde off the African coast , arresting eight people suspected of commandeering the ship .
The case is yet to be fully explained .
Finnish police are investigating it as a case of aggravated extortion .

Ryan Dawson 911 , Iraq , PNAC , All roads lead to Israel
When some people hear the word " conspiracy " they start thinking of a tinfoil hat crowd and invoke images of space aliens , paranoia , or a variety of cults and nonsense .
Well there are a lot of wacky conspiracies about many things but that does not mean that conspiracies do n't or can't happen .
For example , the Iran Contra Affair was a massive government conspiracy hidden from the press and public for years .
It happened in my life time and it involved billions of dollars and multiple countries .
It has since been admitted to but many of the people involved did not get into trouble .
They were given presidential pardons either by Bush Sr. or Bill Clinton .
Most of them still have jobs and are working in the government right now !
That is a fact .
The CIA and Mossad have gotten away with countless covert operations and false flags .
There are too many to name .
So for those who think a covert operation or conspiracy can't happen , you need to open a history book , or at the very least start doing some online research .
To just reject conspiracies as a whole just because there are some kooks who think the moon landing was fake or Elvis or Tu Pac are still alive etc is not a reason to just reject the concept all together .
I have had people tell me conspiracies never work and that they can't be done because someone always snitches .
Well that argument just does not float in reality .
There are way too many counter examples of successful conspiracies and Hoaxes .
See here CIA 's Secret Wars and that 's only a fraction .
What really happened on 911 ?
Poll after poll the majority of Americans believe that the official story of 911 is false and that the government is part of a cover up .
( Compare that to Fox News Viewers who staggeringly still believe in the lies of Saddam being linked to 911 even after the president and vice president admitted that there was no connection . )
There seem to be four main 911 theories , one from the main stream press and the 911 commission and others from researchers who bothered to look at things like physical evidence , the paper trail , and the money trail .
I have a fifth theory which unifies the war in Iraq with the cabal that planned 911 .
The 4 theories briefly go as follows .
1
Is the official story .
We got caught with our pants down and terrorists did 911 .
And the wars in the Middle East are part of the greater war on terrorism .
2 The incompetence excuse
There was information available about the coming attacks but because of our incompetence we failed to see it .
Terrorists attacked the US .
And the wars in the Middle East were based on mistakes ( more incompetence ) but now we got to stay .
3 They let it happen
They knew full well about the coming 911 attacks but allowed it to happen in order to use it as a pretext to go to war with Iraq and Afghanistan as it was in military and corporate interests ( particularly oil ) to do so .
4 They made it happen .
( They meaning just vaguely the Bush Admin ) - AKA 911 was in inside Job .
The Bush government either helped protect the terrorists or simply used them as patsies , and assisted the plane crashes effects with bombs placed inside the towers prior to 911 .
The wars in the Middle East were about oil .
( a problem with this theory is its vagueness .
People in this camp will call for an independent investigation .
That 's not going to happen and I think there are enough facts available for us to do our own research .
[ Which I have done ] )
Another problem with this group is their associations with other irrelevant cult like propositions that do nothing but discredit the rest of it .
This will be discussed at the end of this document .
The " 911 was an inside job camps " then say the evidence must land you somewhere between 3 and 4 with more research dropping you firmly on number 4 .
Let me now throw in a 5th scenario
5 The Neocons Made it happen with the assistance of a foreign government , the same government where PNAC 's papers were first written , and the same foreign nation who we have caught spies from who have been stealing secrets from the US about Iran , and who made up the shadow government of the OSP which is who cherry picked and fabricated the lies told about Iraq in order to start that war .
The Wars in the Middle East were for separate reasons , Afghanistan was about a few pipelines as noted but more so about controlling large quantities of un - tapped uranium ( a reason for both the Russian and US invasions ) and secondly for controlling opium as the CIA uses drug money to fund it's off the book black operations such as the now known massive secret prison systems , ( torture camps and human medical / scientific testing ) .
Location - wise Afghanistan is coupled with other color coded revolutions to circle China and Russia with US bases and puppets , ( add to that the lesser known negotiations with Japan to allow nuclear subs into the Japanese Sea [ pointed at China ] in exchange for moving troops from Okinawa to Guam ) .
The main goal however , which the PNAC think tank states , is to keep the eye on the pie : Iran , which Afghanistan and Iraq both boarder .
The invasion of Iraq was to solve Israel 's oil crisis and stop the threat of a secular Middle East which would become a true economic player and was a threat to the aggressive state of Israel .
The evidence if it was ALL being stated , especially pertaining to the war in Iraq , would land you in scenario 5 .
To better understand the Iraq War and why the US invaded go here .
<- I highly recommend seeing that link after you finish reading this .
This timeline may help beginners as well .
911 was the Mossad .
But that is not an Israeli intelligence agency per say it is a terrorist agency for the military industrial complex which feeds off of the hatred of the bigots and useful idiots concentrated in Israel .
The US and Israel are not really different countries in a way .
The US and Israeli agencies and their Neocon governments work for their own interests and those interests are guided by a racist , political ideology mixed up with a fascist version of a religion and Straussian philosophy .
There is a total disconnect between the people of America ( the sane ones ) and the government .
US foreign policy works for Likud Israeli interests first second and third .
This is because the Zionists and MIC have overlapping financial interests .
But most of all the press is Zionist .
There is no war greater right now than the information war .
Nothing would fix things faster than taking back the media or totally discrediting the corrupt lying fear mongering war cheerleaders we have now .
A lot of people have written about and shown the problems with official 911 story .
There is the demolition of building number 7 , there are the firemen 's reports that the fires were almost out , there are numerous reports of secondary explosions etc .
Because it has been said on radio and more so because people have made films about it , many people can recite the arguments for the inside job in their sleep .
Fire burns buildings ; it does not burn on the top of one for an hour or so and then blow it up in a matter of ten seconds , completely destroying everything including the foundations and leaving molten steal in the basements weeks after the event .
It is physically impossible .
But what has been hidden from you and the dots which have not been connected in any 911 films is the Israeli connection .
911 has been hit with heavy disinformation .
This tactic worked well for Area 51 a secretive base that was wasting trillions of dollars .
Because of disinformation and a lot of idiots , if anyone said a thing about area 51 it was unfairly linked to everything from space creatures to crop circles .
Currently in 911 " truth " there is disinfo spanning from Bavarian death cults , to a black pope , to lasers from outer space .
Do not associate any of that nonsense with what I am saying .
911 was an inside job which was part of a larger plan for perpetual war hatched in Israel .
Understand that Israel is not Jewish people OK please get that through your warped heads .
Israel is a violent nation that engages in false flag operations routinely and serves the interests of the MIC not any particular ethnicity .
For a long time during the Cold War , Israel was the medium the MIC used to bully the Middle East indirectly and increase arms sales across the board .
911 and the recent wars in the Middle East were carefully planned attacks carried out by a faction of Zionist Neocons and the Israeli Mossad .
The policy papers that acted as propaganda for the war were written by Dual Citizens with Israel .
The equity firms profiting from the Iraq War like Carlyle and Trireme and the law firms processing contracts like Feith and Zell , the Anthrax attack , and the anthrax attack speech , the PNAC documents , the DPG the lies from journalists about Iraq 's WMD are all connected back to the same Zionist cabal in the DOD and office of the vice president .
Just think back to the propaganda about Iraq before the war and then go read what PNAC was writing in the 90s .
On top of that the Niger forgeries , which are Clear concrete proof to show that these men were consciously lying , have still not been reported in the Main Stream media .
There is no surprise there , they can't even admit that Israel has Nukes , or any information about multiple spy-rings Spies ( Pollard , Art Students , AIPAC , ADL , too many to even name . )
The Niger - gate scandal as well as ( the mini- AIPAC ) the ATC 's dealings with the MIC were covered up by Lewis Libby leaking information about a BJA CIA agent to the press .
He leaked it to exactly the same warmongering trash journalists who had been lying about WMD in Iraq from the start .
Also it was the INC and Chalabi who served as " sources " for these yellow journalists who lied about WMDs .
The INC and Chalabi were suggested as replacements to Saddam as far back as the mid 90s by none other than Wolfowitz and Libby .
Further more AIPAC the largest Israeli lobby was caught red handed ( Rosen & Weissman ) spying on the US about Iraq and Iran through moles ( Larry Franklin , Gilon ) inside the very same offices that were meeting with Israeli generals .
( Feith and Perle ) .
Not only was the lobby caught spying but a Zionist lobbyist ( Jack Abramoff ) was busted bribing congress .
[ and possibly blackmailing them ] .
Then in a story that was pulled from FOX News , there was another separate massive Israeli spy ring that had agents living next door to the said hijackers of 911 .
( Israeli Art students ) and on top of that the Mossad with its front ( Urban Moving systems ) was busted filming 911 and cheering .
The 911 commission was comprised of John Lehman a PNAC member , Fred Feilding Bush 's current Lawyer who is also a lawyer for Blackwater , James R. Thompson a Hollinger BOD member with Perle and Kissinger , and other dubious characters .
They did not even address the collapse of Building 7 which the BBC reported fell before it had even fallen .
The DoD and the Military industrial complex are not separate they are one in the same .
The 911 investigation was a farce it was on a Scooby Doo level for a detective story .
Oh look we magically found a passport of a lead hijacker the same one who we will later lie about ( a week later ) and connect with Saddam by using a fabricated story claiming that he met an anonymous Iraqi in Prague .
Here the war party was lying about Iraq and lying about 911 .
Much of the 911 cover up which the MSM just repeated was done by Popular Mechanics a magazine whose editor was B. Chertoff , Michael Chertoff 's cousin .
Michael Chertoff of course was the author of the pre-written Patriot Act quickly who became the head of Joe Lieberman and Arlen Spector 's new creation the department of Homeland security .
Note that the Patriot Act was passed while congress was under the duress of anthrax attacks which turned out to be from a Jewish American Zionist and the speech that Colin Powell read to the UN was written by Lewis Libby .
Were it not for this attack the Act as well as the Department of Homeland Security may not have passed , at least not so quickly .
They already had these documents previously written before 911 just waiting for it to happen .
Also the US was already in place to invade Afghanistan before 911 happened .
Central banks with the MIC are controlling the show right now .
They 're the current cash cow to feed off of Zionism .
The Defense department is a corporation , one that was missing trillions of dollars and admitted this the day before 911 .
The secretary for Policy ( Richard Perle , Trireme inc , Hollinger , Boeing ) The Army Secretary ( Thomas White Enron ) The Navy Secretary ( Gordon England General Dynamics )
The Air force secretary ( James Roche Northrop Grumman ) all acted in their own personal interests .
The Office of Special Plans ' Douglas Feith and Paul Wolfowitz were also Northrop Grumman employees .
To better understand how the MIC works See this The USSA a quick look at how the US kills for commercial interests and does not practice the free market principles it pretends to profess .
<- very good write up , one of my better ones .
These same criminals were involved with Hoffman and Britannia aviation flight schools run by Christian Zionists , where there were hijackers who were seen in two places at once like Mohamed Atta who was also spotted on9 the now convicted Zionist lobbiest ) Jack Abramoff 's casino ships .
The hijackers just so happen to live next door to an uncovered Israeli spy ring .
The flight schools were a false trail easily gobbled up by the left to show incompotence while at the same time reinforcing the idea that there were Muslim hijackers .
The said hijackers myth falls apart when 20 % of them turn up to STILL BE ALIVE .
So if there were no hijackers then the official story is false and then that means the flight school information was also disinformation created to frame patsies and given that Israelis lived next door / with to these agents who were making as much noise as possible and went as far as leaving behind a list with their names on it to be found , means they were actually Mossad .
Then seperate Mossad agents get caught on 911 and the information connecting them is classified and the criminals simply deported back to Israel .
Obviously since many of the hijackers are still alive there is no way they could have crashed planes into building or have gone to these flight schools .
Israeli Mossad was setting them up with stolen passports , as we will go over .
This is not some illuminati , it is not the Catholic Church , there was no missile hitting the pentagon , it is not Jews in general or America in general , it is not just " THE government , " it is definitely not lasers from space or human morphing lizards .
That kind of outright crap is the same kind of discrediting disinfo that was leaked out to mask Area 51 a real formerly secret military base that spent trillions on new toys for the military but was covered up by nonsense about UFOs and aliens with big eyes that were featured on unsolved mysteries and now can be found on T - shirts .
911 was a classic false flag operation by the country which can do no wrong in the eyes of the media and would have nothing to fear from the press or an investigation because they have already been getting away with brutal murder for 38 years while sucking billions of dollars from the US the whole time .
[ even after attacking a US ship . ]
The greater story here is how the Israel can be busted murdering Americans in an attack that if you look at the details was irrefutably deliberate and planned , and yet the Main Stream Media made hardly any mention of it other than back pages on a few news papers .
And even after 40 years of the survivors telling their stories and making it painfully obvious what happened the Media has refused to report it and there are no investigations .
This is why they could lie about Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq without worry when they knew it would sooner or later be discovered false .
They have no need to worry or explain anything ( like the demolition of building 7 ) because they know the press will ignore it and even excuse it .
So the story here is not just that Israel can murder people in an attempted false flag , it is that the US media can , has , and will , cover it up .
This is because the false flag was set up jointly between a faction in the US ( that included LBJ ... long story see my All Roads JFK paper ) and Israel .
Only the Israelis failed to sink a sitting duck before a message got out to the seventh fleet and the operation was blown so they had to go to plan B..
Plan be was to just shamelessly lie and deny all evidence contrary to their claims like a religious zealot immune to all reason and factual evidence .
It worked then and it is working now .
However because of the web that barrier is starting to crack and we are pushing back in the info war .
Israel was behind 911 and the war in Iraq ( though that overlaps with oil interests and many other things ) the cabal made it happen .
The X - communist Trotskyite Neocon dual citizen Zionists are the driving force behind a war with Iran and Syria .
PNAC 's Rebuilding America 's Defenses ( RAD ) which mentioned the need for a new Pearl Harbor like attack , was based on the Israel Clean Break paper written by Richard Perle .
RAD although signed by partially composed by many Neocons was primarily written by Lewis Libby the lawyer for the Mossad Agent Marc Rich who was involved in Iran Contra and the " privatization " of Russia , a regular mafia thug who got a pardon from Bill Clinton .
Also in Iran Contra was Elliot Abrams who got a pardon from Bush 's father .
[ To know more about what really happend in Russia with Gaidar and the Oligarch go read my paper or listen to my audio file here Quick history of Russia school would n't teach you and to learn more about Marc Rich just click on his name and read / listen to my file on him .
The players behind what went down are not secret , they do everything openly .
It is almost like they want to be caught as if they are bragging about it .
If people can ignore the disinfo and focus on real people which we have plenty of actual documentation for being behind 911 and the following wars , then we can expose these crooks and let the consequences fall on them however they may .
So who did it ?
To answer this question one should first ask , " who had the power to cover it up ? "
Who would have the power to censor the media and have total confidence that they could censor the media given an event this size ?
One look at the non-coverage of Israel 's illegal occupation of Palestine should give you one answer .
Nowhere , in the US televised media , do they even mention that there is an occupation .
This massive conflict , which one would assume would be impossible to conceal , is totally shielded from the American public .
The Occupation is missing from the news and they purposely paint the distorted picture that Israel just defends itself from crazy suicide bombers .
This is not something they can hide , or even debate about , the occupation is visible , you can go visit it , and it is widely covered in media outside the US , but you will never ever hear Israel 's crimes even mentioned .
There is no news of the Jewish - Only racial colonies that the US calls " Settlements " and " Neighborhoods " reported on Fox , ABCNNBCBS which is really one net work that tells the same stories often in the same order .
I will explain why in the media section .
Also there has been no reporting on the second Israeli spy-ring , none , zero , and the first spy ring uncovered was yanked from Fox News .
Even though it is an open secret to the rest of the world , in the US there has been no mention of Israel 's secretly built nuclear weapons .
The list goes on ... the faction that has nothing to fear from the US media and who could cover up something as huge as 911 or larger are the Zionists of Israel and their allies in the US government and press who all profit through the MIC and investments from fringe element religious organizations who are rewarded with air - time .
One should also look at the list of congressmen on the AIPAC lobby's " payroll " and then look at the astonishing number who we know had connections the Zionist lobbyist and criminal Jack Abramoff .
( who is deeply connected to the Israeli Mossad and 911 as I will show you later ) .
The second question one should ask , is ' what did 911 serve ' ?
The answer to that is very simple .
The aftermath of 911 led to two different wars , and we all know how 911 was falsely attached to the justifications for America 's wars .
Almost 90 % of US troops in Iraq ( in 2006 ) think that Saddam had a role in 911 and that the war was revenge for it .
That level of total ignorance is mind - blowing .
War , of course , is good for select businesses and central banks because wars are debt generators .
Iraq was not a threat to the US .
They were a threat to Israel , and the same case can be said about Iran .
We know who really wants these wars .
There can be no doubt that the press consciously distorted information leading up to the wars , and that they never made any clear pronouncements about how they had been wrong about their lies , with the Weapons of Mass Destruction myth being a clear stinging example .
There are people in the US who still believe that Iraq had WMDs or that they moved them to Syria lol .
If you want to know who planned 911 then a good place to look would be who do we know planned and then lied about Iraq ?
( also who has been lying the most about Iran ) Who championed the disinformation ?
Where were the lies coming from ?
And when was this war really planned and where ?
The answered to all of those questions are sadly the same .
Israel and American Zionists .
And that is a fact we can prove .
If you want to know who the Neocons are that orchestrated 911 then you should look at some of their other messes .
We will start with PNAC ( Project for a New American Century ) and then work backwards from the War in Iraq to 911 .
It is always important to look at what happened both before an after an event when you are investigating it .
The myths told by the media prior to the war in Iraq had been written out in PNAC papers form the 1990s
Iraq War Planned Long Before 911
As soon as puppet Bush got into office , his handlers went to work actualizing their long pushed - for plans for Iraq .
I pointed out in my book that Bush and Blair bombed Baghdad 27 days after Bush was sworn into office .
This was well before 911 and had nothing to do with “ stopping terrorism . ”
Iraq had nothing to do with 911 .
Many of us already know who had been calling for war with Iraq - and who had written the rhetoric about WMD etc .
Every pre-war lie was a PNAC talking point .
All of it was written in PNAC papers in the 90s by the same authors who peddled their lies to the media during the run up to the war .
These same people made up the Israeli cabal that wrote a IASPS paper [ an Israeli group ] called the Afghan Vortex , which called for war in Afghanistan as well as the need for a “ new Pearl Harbor . “
I wrote about this earlier , here .
It is worth reposting .
Want to know why I drive the point home that the PNAC and the war in Iraq came from the same cabal ?
Let ’s just look back at some of their policy papers .
These quotes are in their own words , from their own website .
These authors , who wrote Israeli policy papers stating the same things , wrote exactly what became the pre-invasion script to Iraq .
1 ) The PNAC letter to President Clinton in 1998
“ The policy of “ containment ” of Saddam Hussein has been steadily eroding over the past several months .
As recent events have demonstrated , we can no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War coalition to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections .
Our ability to ensure that Saddam Hussein is not producing weapons of mass destruction , therefore , has substantially diminished .
Even if full inspections were eventually to resume , which now seems highly unlikely , experience has shown that it is difficult if not impossible to monitor Iraq ’s chemical and biological weapons production .
The lengthy period during which the inspectors will have been unable to enter many Iraqi facilities has made it even less likely that they will be able to uncover all of Saddam ’s secrets .
As a result , in the not - too - distant future we will be unable to determine with any reasonable level of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons . ”
“ Such uncertainty will , by itself , have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East .
It hardly needs to be added that if Saddam does acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction , as he is almost certain to do if we continue along the present course , the safety of American troops in the region , of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states , and a significant portion of the world ’s supply of oil will all be put at hazard .
As you have rightly declared , Mr. President , the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how we handle this threat . ” - 1998 Abrams and Perle .
Is that not verbatim what was used as propaganda in 2002 - 3 for the pretext to invade Iraq ?
They even used the same catch phrases : “ weapons of mass destruction ” and “ avoiding inspectors , ” which were lies .
However , the Israelis were unable to get their war until they could also attach the myth of Saddam ’s men meeting with Al Qaeda .
William Safire , who received a Guardian of Zion award , wrote this up and then Cheney and Rice ( etc ) repeated it on TV over and over again .
2 ) From the PNAC paper , “ How to attack Iraq ”
“ CIA director George Tenet said last January that Iraq already had the “ technological expertise ” to produce biological weapons “ in a matter of weeks . ” ( lie ) And according to former U. N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter , Saddam needs only six months without inspectors looking over his shoulder to build those weapons and deploy them on missiles capable of reaching Israel and other targets in the Middle East . ”
Yes , Saddam had missiles that could reach Israel .
Israel also had missiles that can reach Iraq .
The inspectors were removed after they were caught doubling as spies for the US and that is a fact that Scott Ritter pointed out on CNN crossfire back in 2003 .
3 ) Paul Wolfowitz made a Statement before the US House National Security Committee
It calls for war with Iraq .
He also wrote this letter ( 1999 ) claiming that the bloodlust for Iraq was not partisan because a couple of democrats ( you might recognize them ) Joe Lieberman and John Kerry also agreed with their position .
Wow that IS interesting a Vice presidential and a presidential hopeful just so happen to be those two Democrats .
Well Wolfowizt was right about something .
It was not partisan because both parties are one party on foreign affairs and both parties wanted war .
It is still that way .
4 ) Saddam's Impending Victory - 1998 - Robert Kagan
This one goes compared Saddam to Hitler and talks about weapons of mass destruction saying the lid is about to come off and calls Saddam 's palaces the " so - called presidential palaces --"
Does n't that sound familar ?
It is the same lie that we got later from Judith Miller ( Dec 20th 2001 NYT ) who said she learned of secret WMD labs hidden under the presidential palaces from " an Iraqi defector " later in the INC to be .
That is about as accurate of reporting as when Fox wants to insert their own rhetoric and quotes as a " source " their infamous line of " Some people say " .
" For Saddam , whose conventional military strength had been decimated in 1991 and could not be restored for many years , weapons of mass destruction provided the quickest , surest , and indeed , the only route back to strategic dominance in the Middle East .
As Rolf Ekeus , the former head of UNSCOM , the U.N. ’s weapons - monitoring operation , said last year , weapons of mass destruction “ make the difference between Iraq ’s being a regional power and a major international power . ”
Finding and destroying Saddam ’s ability to produce weapons of mass destruction , therefore , was an essential part of guaranteeing that Saddam could not again threaten neighboring states .
The U.N. effort to rid Iraq of such weapons capabilities was supposed to put the lid on Saddam ’s grand strategic ambitions .
Today the lid is about to come off .
Saddam Hussein , weak , isolated , and impoverished as he is , has decided to take his big gamble .
The crisis he set off last October when he blocked U.N. inspectors came to a head last week when Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz told UNSCOM chief Richard Butler that a number of sites in Iraq — the so - called presidential palaces — would remain off - limits for two more months at least .
Saddam Hussein also issued an ultimatum last week calling for the U.N. to wrap up its inspections by May and lift the sanctions .
5 ) Speaking of Iraq The Neocon Robert Kagan wrote an op -ed in the Washington Times .
You can read this on your own time .
It basically staes how certain they are of Saddam producing Weapons of Mass Destruction .
Bla bla bla same old song and dance that you heard in 2002 - 3 just before the war .
6 ) From the PNAC paper , “ Bombing Iraq Is n’t Enough . “
“ Saddam Hussein must go .
This imperative may seem too simple for some experts and too daunting for the Clinton Administration .
But if the United States is committed , as the President said in his State of the Union Message , to insuring that the Iraqi leader never again uses weapons of mass destruction , the only way to achieve that goal is to remove Mr. Hussein and his regime from power .
Any policy short of that will fail . ”
“ Mr. Hussein has obviously thought through this scenario , and he likes his chances .
That is why he provoked the present crisis , fully aware that it could lead to American bombing strikes .
He has survived them before , and he is confident he can survive them again .
They will not succeed in forcing him to abandon his efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction .
The only way to remove the threat of those weapons is to remove him , and that means using air power and ground forces , and finishing the task left undone in 1991 ?
Anyone who cannot see that the Iraq war was carried out and planned by this cabal of dual citizen Israelis must be a fool .
They wrote verbatim the pre-war hype five years before the war .
These same people later faked the evidence and used their moles in the media to repeat the garbage they ’d already been writing in the PNAC .
However , until born - again Zionist Christian Bush , no one was stupid enough to listen .
All these “ let ’s bomb Iraq ” papers came from as early as 1998 .
6 ) This one was written on July 30 of 2001 , just a month and 12 days before 9/11 .
It has a big fat picture of Usama Bin Laden on it ( they were propping up that patsy early ) .
“ For Bin Laden ’s “ sleepers ” — agents already outside of Afghanistan awaiting the right moment to strike an American target — the situation is probably little better . ”
The lies about Iraq and 911 are all inside PNAC papers .
The authors are the same people who created and covered up the Niger forgeries .
They were involved in an Israeli spy scandal ( which STILL has not seen a trial ) and at least two of them ( John Lehman and James Thompson ) were on the 911 commission !
This same lying Israeli cabal was behind the PNAC papers , as well as the lies about Iraq and 911 ( when the Mossad was caught filming the towers and living next door to said hijackers ) .
Over 200 Israeli spies were busted in the largest spy ring ever to be carried out on American soil .
After 911 , Israel was caught spying on the US again - through a Department of Defense ( DOD ) employee who worked out of an office that met with Israeli generals and was run by Douglas Feith .
Feith is a war profiteer whose company , Feith & Zell is partners with Israeli Settler Marc Zell .
This law firm got to delegate reconstruction projects in Iraq .
5 ) This one takes the cake though .
It came from Wolfowitz , the Kagans , Lewis Libby , who at that time was with Dechert Price & Rhoads .
( pgs 63 and 79 are especially relevant )
Update : Adam Pearlman ( ” Al Qaeda ” spokesman who faked Bin Laden Tapes ) is the grandson of Carl Pearlman , who is on the Board of Directors for the Anti Defamation League ( a Zionist organization with spies in the US who also support Apartheid states ) .
For those who need to SEE the lies about WMD that the mainstream media and Neocons repeated over and over ( which the PNAC wrote the script for ) , please watch this video :
These lies were told by embedded Zionist journalists who worked with the Administration 's PNAC members .
For example the lie that the lead hijacker in 911 Mohamed repeated by Willaim Safire of the New York Times ( May 9 , 2002 ) came from Gary Schmitt who wrote it in 2001 ( for PNAC in the Weekly Standard run by William Kristol the chairman of PNAC ) .
The story was leaked to Reuters on September 18 , 2001 just seven days after the attacks .
Wow they knew about the lead hijacker as well as a meeting that never took place all within seven days .
Reminds me of the BBC report on Iraq that was plegerized from a college student in Florida .
This Atta meet with Iraqi officilas lie was repeated by Dick Cheney on national television Dec 9th 2001 .
He later denied this despite being on tape saying it .
By the way he also calls the Czech Republic by the old name of Czechslovokia .
I can't believe he is the Vice President .
Anyway one would think if they had a report ( that they read ) out of a country that they would at least know the correct name of that country .
He did n't .
Bush is still more embarrassing though .
Schmitt wrote " S HORTLY BEFORE getting on aplane to fly to New Jersey from Europe in June 2000 , Mohamed Atta , the lead hijacker of the first jet airliner to slam into the World Trade Center and , apparently , the lead conspirator in the attacks of September 11 , met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official .
This was no chance encounter .
Rather than take a flight from Germany , where he had been living , Atta traveled to Prague , almost certainly for the purpose of meeting there with Iraqi intelligence operativeAhmed Samir Ahani . " - source
Essentially this was a complete lie designed to connect Iraq to Al Qaeda and the 911 attacks .
It was false , yet all the networks ABCNNBCBS FOX repeated it anyway because it had been in the NY Times .
The source for the Times " reporters " were members of the INC ( Iraqi Nation Congress ) such as Chalabi a man convicted of bank fruad and the person who Wolfowitz had suggested should lead the INC back in the 1990s when he wrote to then President Clinton about regime change .
William Safire who made the bogus report was awarded a Guardian of Zion award in 2005 for his defense of Zionism and Israel .
He also got a presidential medal of Freedom from Bush in 2006 .
It 's their way of saying good job .
What the Neocons were doing is planting stories from known false sources on willing journalists and then quoting them as sources for what was in reality their own lies to begin with .
The triangle was the OSP told INC what to say and then the journalist claimed them as sources and then the pentagon quoted the journalists .
Also working with William Safire at the New York Times was Judith Miller .
She made up the lies about aluminum tubes ( which physically would not even work anyway ) being used as centrafuses in Iraq 's alleged nuclear program .
She was also the journalist that spread the story about Saddam having weapons of mass destruction hidden under his palaces or in mobile trucks .
Lewis Libby who I will talk about in a bit , also promoted the mobile weapons labs myth as well as the myths about Iraq 's Anthrax .
It turns out they did n't have any .
Libby wrote the Anthrax speech that Collin Powel read like a sucker to the UN .
Every claim was false .
This was also an attempt to link 911 to Iraq by claiming that the anthrax attacks that followed 911 may have come from Iraq .
They did not .
They actually came from Dr. Philip Zack who the FBI has on tape stealing anthrax from a lab in Fort Detrick MD which he had been fired from for his racist antics to an Egyptian employee who he had tried to frame .
Judith Miller it would be revealed was also one of the journalists who Libby leaked the name of Valerie Plame to in order to blow the cover of the CIA agent as well as her entire team using the front company of Brewster Jennings & Associates .
The reason for that as I will get into later was to cover up more lies and fabrications about yellowcake uranium coming from Niger as well as massive profiteering by the ATC a MIC lobby involving all these same players .
PNAC'S co-founders are William Kristol and Robert Kagan . ( CFR ) Now Kagan is the most active writer in PNAC .
He and both his brothers were part of the team that compiled the modern Mein Kampf Rebuilding America 's defenses ...
Kagan writes for Kristol 's Weekly Standard and cranked out more propaganda than anyone .
The majority of the let 's Bomb Iraq rhetoric from PNAC which was identical to the pre-invasion excuses ( lies ) that Zionists in the media later used in it 's pre-invasion blitz , was written by Robert Kagan .
Here is a guy who wrote speeches for George P. Shultz the former Secretary of State who was part of the attempted cover up of Iran Contra .
Shultz also worked for LBJ .
He is the former President of Bechtel .
Bechtel is second only to Haliburton KBR in terms of war profiteering contracts .
Shultz is still currently a board member of both Bechtel and its subsidiarity Fremont ( formerly called Bechtel Investments ) .
And you know who has tens of millions invested in Fremont ?
The Bin Laden Family .
Back to Kagan .
Kagan is a member of the Aspen Institute .
( Something Libby wrote to jailed Judith Miller about in code .
Remember the leaves turning out West in Aspen bit )
Now the Aspen Institute was founded by Walter Paepcke and his nephew William Nitze is currently a Chair and on the Board of Trustees for the Aspen Institute .
William Nitze is the son of Paul Nitze who used to be the Secretary of the Navy from 63 - 67 and then Assistant Secretary of Defense .
He pushed for an infamous bit of foreign policy called Operation Northwoods !
This was a plan to crash drone airplanes supposedly full of Americans into buildings and blame it on Cuba .
So this nut 's son on the board of trustees and serves as a Chair for the Aspen Institute which his uncle founded and the co-founder of the Project for a New American Century , which also promoted false flags propaganda , and the principle writer of the lies that we know were regurgitated by the press to start a war with Iraq , is also a member .
And Kagan is not the only one at Aspen either .
Remember that it was Kagan , Libby , and Wolfowitz who compiled the PNAC paper which spoke of the need for a New Pearl Harbor and outlined a plan of Straussian imperialism where the ends justify the means .
Do you want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes ?
The Aspen Institute has something it calls the " Round Table " bastradizing the term from the fairytales , the Roundtable reads like a whose who of Neocons , Lynne Cheney , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle etc ... Perle ( the Prince of Darkness ) was the Defense Dapartment 's chairman of the DPB Defense Policy Board which obviously advocated war with Iraq .
Serving with Perle on the DPG was fellow PNAC member Christopher Williams who is also a member of the Aspen Institute with Kagan .
On the Board of Trustees with Nitze is Clinton 's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , as well as Michael Powell the former FCC director and son of former Secretary of state and mouth piece for Libby Colin Powell .
Most notably on the BOT is Billionaire Michael Eisner who at the time of the Iraq war was the CEO of Disney which owns ABC .
On Disney 's board of directors sits John E. Bryson who also happens to be on the board of directors of Boeing which invested $ 20 billion into Richard Perle 's equity firm .
Boeing then is offered a deal worth $ 30 billion ( May 2003 ) to supply the empire with 100 military tanker plane .
The deal was approved by Pete Aldrige Jr on his very last day in office as the Chief weapons buyer at the pentagon .
On top of that Perle 's Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee consisted an MIC check list with ultra Neocons like Herny Kissinger and Kagan 's and Betchel 's good buddy George P. Shultz as well as yet another Aspen Institute Strategy group member Eliot Cohen .
Cohen , a professor and director at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies ( SAIS ) at Johns Hopkins University .
Guess who they named that after ....
Paul Nitze , the Northwoods man .
Sick is n't .
Oh there is a lot more but it 's just over kill .
I can talk till I am blue in the face but it does n't matter .
We got people too interested in chasing down some Illuminati Jesuit masonic weather controlling German death cult to pay attention to facts we can prove and real people with names and positions we can deal with .
I know there are certain people that want to make money and sell Armageddons hype Orwellian videos but I just do n't see the point in the sensationalism , it is bad enough how it really is .
911 was an Israeli false flag and the Iraq war was a Zionist / MIC sell that used 911 as a launching pad .
I mean the same psychos who wrote about false flags in the past and each pre-war lies were the ones selling the war and who were on the 911 commission .
Some 911 films have even been misleading , mentioning PNAC without telling the origins and then dropping some big names like Cheney and Rumsfeld who actually did n't write one word of any of the PNAC papers .
But I will leave that for the disinformation section .
Do n't get me wrong , those two guys are the scum of the earth , but let 's be clear on who did what .
Cheney had a central role in abetting the Mossad by personally having the authority to command NORAD moved to his position prior to 911 , so that he could personally make NORAD stand down and assure that the planes hit their targets .
And yes a plane DID hit the pentagon .
I do n't want to argue here about that or get accused of dividing the movement , but you can see that here .
This really should not be where our focus is as we already have much stronger evidence about the WTC towers .
There is no motive to use a missile , why not just drop the plane ?
And before you say pilots could not make that kind of flight , let me remind you many of the said hijackers were found alive .
So that part of the argument is pointless .
They were never on those planes , they were flown by remote control via ultra Zionist Dov S. Zakheim .
( another PNAC founder )
A lot of people know about PNAC , but very few people have taken a hard look at its origins .
PNAC was a spin off from the American Enterprise Institute , and 100 % of the members are Zionists .
People have also gotten confused between the actual authors and people who just signed their letters .
Rumsfeld for example is not part of the special in - group as its chairman William Kristol revealed , ironically on the Colbert report .
PNAC was co-authored by the same people who have been caught lying about the Iraq War 's pre-invasion intelligence .
We are talking about only around 38 people who helped fabricate evidence and pass it off to the president and journalists ( and in some cases fake journalists like Gannon ) .
PNAC 's ideas and statements stem from Israeli policy papers .
And PNAC 's papers are comprised by Israeli citizens who are connected to every major Zionists group on earth .
Paul Craig Roberts : Agrees with me about Israel .
As do many others now .
http://www.rys2sense.com/mp3/clips_0003.wma
In fact , PNAC 's papers were written by the very same people who wrote Israeli policy papers and hold dual citizenship with Israel .
The war in Iraq and control over energy resources ect is all lined out in Israel 's A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm " which was written by Richard Perle and Douglas Feith .
That is just one of many papers this little blood for money cabal cranked out .
The IASPS ( Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Science ) also wrote a paper called the Afghan Vortex a year before the invasion .
Note also that the US had troops already in place set to invade Afghanistan before 911 .
One principle PNAC author was Paul Wolofawitz .
In 1992 Paul Wolfowitz wrote the Defense Planning Guidance , with his former Student Lewis Libby :
Quote :
The foreign strategy of the US must be " unapologetic , idealistic , assertive and well funded .
America must not only be the world 's policeman or its sheriff , it must be its beacon and guide
Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival .
This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would , under consolidated control , be sufficient to generate global power .
These regions include Western Europe , East Asia , the territory of the former Soviet Union , and Southwest Asia
There are three additional aspects to this objective :
First the U.S must show the leadership necessary to establish and protect a new order that holds the promise of convincing potential competitors that they need not aspire to a greater role or pursue a more aggressive posture to protect their legitimate interests .
Second , in the non-defense areas , we must account sufficiently for the interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the established political and economic order .
Finally , we must maintain the mechanisms for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role . "
Paul Wolfowitz ( a dual citizen with Israel who has a sister living there ) is now the retired head of the World Bank , ( appointed by Bush ) was formerly the Director of Policy Planning in the Defense Department .
Like Perle , he was also a " Scoop " Jackson Democrat and worked for Jackson in the 70s .
Paul is CFR , a Bilderberg member , part of the Trilateral Commission and the American Enterprise Institute ( the parent of PNAC ) Paul was a principle PNAC author and he openly admitted in Vanity Fair magazine that they settled on WMD as the excuse to use to get a war with Iraq .
Quote :
For bureaucratic reasons , we settled on one issue , weapons of mass destruction , because it was the one reason everyone could agree on
- May 2003 Vanity Fair
" we " Settled on WMDs .... who is " we " could it be the Zionist cabal that had been writing about the desire for a war with Iraq and who set up the OSP ?
he is also admitting that they were just inventing reasons for war to present to the public .
The Weapons of Mass Destruction claim is important because it was the legal reason for the invasion .
If they were complying with UN resolution 1441 then the US did not have grounds to invade .
please go here and listen to my Feb 10th radio interview which outlines more background on that as well as the sanctions which helped starve half a million people .
Allow that statistic to sink in .
500,000 people mostly children starved to death .
Can you comprehend the horror of that ?
It gets worse , but that is an extra tangent for now .
Paul Wolfowitz presented an open letter to Bill Clinton on January 26 , 1998 where the opening lines clearly state the desire to go to war with Iraq .
" Wolfowitz urged Clinton to recognize a provisional [ Iraqi ] government headed by the Iraqi National Congress under Chalabi . "
Wow sound familiar ?
This would is what would later become PNAC 's doctrine and US foreign policy .
Later in 2000 PNAC released what is normally referred to as the document more of you are familiar with which is commonly but mistakenly just called " PNAC " and that was PNAC 's magnum opus , the paper , " Rebuilding America 's Defenses : Strategies , Forces and Resources for a New Century "
This is the paper stating the infamous lines about the need for a New Pearl Harbor ... P63 or P51 depending on the pdf you have .
The bulk of the document however is about going to war with Iraq .
It reiterates what this same dirty cabal had written for Israel 's Prime Minister ( 1996 ) Benjamin Netanyahu .
When Israeli intelligence on Iraq had been rejected by the CIA Wolfowitz created his own " Team B " to go over it and work scientifically backwards , that is start with a conclusion and then set out to prove it by any means possible including just lying .
Now Wolfowitz did not do this on his own , Lewis Libby , Douglas Feith and Richard Perle and others who have recently resigned and or are or have been caught up in criminal activity in the past , all took part .
Please see the real list of PNAC 's authors
Interestingly , Ricahrd Perle and Wolfowitz both worked as aides to senator Henry " Scoop " Jackson .
In 1970 while working for Jackson ( A Democrat ! )
Perle was charged with two heinous acts , spying for the state of Israel and leaking information about the CIA in regards to its nuclear deterrent program , to Russia .
Now keep that in mind because it is very important .
It 's the very same things that have happening with AIPAC and the Plame Affair from under Perle and Feith 's offices .
Perle is even part of the tax - exempt Henry Jackson Society .
He is a trustee for the UACC ( U.S. - Azerbaijin Chamber of Commerce ) which worked with Blackwater to get troops in to Azerbaijan using the loop hole that they were not troops but " body gards . "
Boieng invested 20 Million in Trireme run by Richard Perle which was apporoved by Aldridge on his last day at the pentagon just before he took a job with Lockheed Martain .
Jermy Scahill wrote :
" The contract was approved by President Bush 's cheif weapons buyer at the Pentagon , Edward C. " Pete " Aldridge Jr. , who just happened to be the former president of McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems which later became part of Boeing .
Alderidge approved the deal on his last day at the Pentagon before taking a job with weapons manufacture Lockheed Martain .
The deal would go down " as the most significant defense procurement mismanagement in contemporary history , " in the words of Senate Armed Service Committee Chair John Warner , resulting in a cancellation of the contract , amid widespread allegations of cronyism .
Former Air Force procurement officer Darleen Druyun went to prison as did a Boeing repreisenative , while Air Force Secratary James Roche resigned . " - p317 BLackwater
The Rise of the World 's Most powerful Mercenary Army .
Perle is the nastiest of the nasty .
In my mind he is The worst Neocon of them all .
He has appropriately earned the nickname " The Prince of Darkness . "
Perle along with Douglas Feith and David Wurmser , ( all three of them got jobs in the US defense department , Perle and Fieth have had to resign ) authored the Israel 's " A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm . "
Quote : Israel can shape its strategic environment , in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan , by weakening , containing , and even rolling back Syria .
This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right as a means of foiling Syria 's regional ambitions .
- Israel 's A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm by Richard Perle and Douglas Feith .
( under the heading " Moving to a Traditional Balance of Power Strategy "
Now all of us that pay any attention to facts , know that Iraq had nothing to do with 911 , so just why were we invading them and who cooked up the intelligence to justify it ?
And who openly wrote about it before we did it ?
And who was in the US Department of Defense creating groups like the OSP ?
The Zionist Israeli Firsters that is who .
And we have plenty of irrefutable evidence to prove it .
But that 's not all , it goes even deeper and gets even more obvious .
While speaking to Wolf Blitzer from CNN , a former AIPAC employee , Perle said of Semour Hersh , the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who exposed the My Lai massacre of Vietnam and later with the help of Joe Darby , broke the story about the Abu Ghraib torture scandal , " Sy Hersh is the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist , frankly . "
And Perle is the author of at least 4 different IASPS papers .
Quote : On March 17 , 2003 , veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported in the New Yorker that Perle used his position as chairman of the DPB to solicit $ 100 million for his security - oriented investment firm , - Trireme , which was his own personal version of the Carlyle Group .
But unlike the principals at Carlyle , who at least had the decency to wait until they left government service to cash in on their connections , Perle was attempting to capitalize while still serving as an official adviser to Secretary of ; Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
- source , 5th paragraph .
although , I recommend reading all of it .
Perle helped create
The Trireme firm which has tens of millions dollars worth of investments from Boeing a smentioned above .
Boeing 's board of directors comprises people like John Biggs , John E. Bryson , Linda Z. Cook , and William M. Daley who also sit on the BOD of major banks and mass media conglomerates .
For more on that mess see this .
Perle was on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee from 1987 to 2004 and his advice was always the same , build and upgrade more weapons .
He served as an Advisor to Israel and of course advised them to " buy " ( AKA used their earmarked aid on ) from MIC companies that Perle profits from .
Trireme which collects from venture capitalist also set up by Perle 's partner at Hollinger Inc , Henry Kissinger .
Unsurprisingly , Holliger of which Kissinger and Perle sit on the board of directors invested in Trireme .
Who else was on the BOD of Hollinger Inc ?
None other than James Thompson III who served on the 911 commission .
Hollinger is a mass media conglomerate with paper such as the Jersalem Post .
It was the J Post that put out the myth of the 4,000 Jews not showing up for work on 911 .
This was a total strawman designed to be easliy debunked and take a focus off of Israel as well as ensnare critics with the lable of anti-Semitism .
I was at college when 911 happened and I heard this 4,000 Jews nonsense the very same day before it was even in the J - Post .
I was the head of a Palestinian Solidarity group and I had people reporting this to me .
I rejected it as nonsense because there was no proof .
But someone must have been working very hard to put that discrediting disinfo out there if I could hear about it within 24 hours in a college in Virginia .
In the run up to the war in Iraq , there was a lot of disinformation .
Once again most people know what the lies were concerning the WMDs , the Al Qaeda accusations , the mushroom cloud scare tactics , ( notice once again how the neocons chose to have Neo - Condi make that loaded fear mongering statement with Wolf Blitzer , from CNN , a former AIPAC employee . ) " liberating " the Kurds , ( now look at this Bush offers to bomb Kurds ) and lastly the joke of democracy building , which have all been shown to be falsehoods or failures .
I picked each of these reasons apart in my book , but I think by now they should be pretty self evident .
What people do not seem to know is who made these fabrications .
They assume it was just " Bush " and the vague term " the administration , " or worse yet the new world order / illuminati / criminal elements in the government .
Those vague kind of term really do n't say a thing and are left open enough to be interpreted to mean almost anything .
Well yes it was people in the administration , but who ?
Well let 's break it down .
AIPAC and the OSP were the two Zionist factions in the government who spoon fed the lies about Iraq which Bush was looking for to the administration to justify an invasion .
Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski explains how military officers ' opinions were dismissed or even punished by the civilian cabal brought in from the American Enterprise Institute , ( the Parent of PNAC ) .
Quote : ... But in fact , my outspokenness was probably never noticed because civilian professionals and military officers were largely invisible .
We were easily replaceable and dispensable , not part of the team brought in from the American Enterprise Institute , the Center for Security Policy , and the Washington Institute for Near East Affairs
The Israelis were visiting the DOD without having to sign in and going straight to Feith 's office where the secretive OSP was headed .
The same office Lawrence ( Larry ) Franklin worked for who was sentenced to 12 years in jail for spying for AIPAC the thug like Israeli lobby , who we have learned Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif . ) used AIPAC to help bribe her position as the highest ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee .
And whose aid has been suspended thus far for leaking the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq to the New York Times the same paper Libby leaked classified information to through Judith Miller .
Of course another Israeli firster Nancy Pelosi is set to replace Harman and she has already stated she would block attempts to impeach Bush .
Kwiatkowski continues .
In early winter , an incident occurred that was seared into my memory .
A coworker and I were suddenly directed to go down to the Mall entrance to pick up some Israeli generals .
Post - 9/11 rules required one escort for every three visitors , and there were six or seven of them waiting .
The Navy lieutenant commander and I hustled down .
Before we could apologize for the delay , the leader of the pack surged ahead , his colleagues in close formation , leaving us to double - time behind the group as they sped to Undersecretary Feith 's office on the fourth floor .
Two thoughts crossed our minds : are we following close enough to get credit for escorting them , and do they really know where they are going ?
We did get credit , and they did know .
Once in Feith 's waiting room , the leader continued at speed to Feith 's closed door .
An alert secretary saw this coming and had leapt from her desk to block the door .
Mr. Feith has a visitor .
It will only be a few more minutes .ï¿½
The leader craned his neck to look around the secretary 's head as he demanded , Who is in there with him ?
Why were Israeli generals visiting a secretive group in the DOD under the office of the Clean Break authors ( as well as PNAC ) Feith and Perle where a Spy for the Israeli lobby AIPAC was caught spying on the US ?
( and trial dates for the rest of it have been bumped up 7 times and growing daily . )
One of the most important scandals in the administration which is finally had its trial Jan 2007 , is the Plame outing and Niger forgeries .
The Plame Affair involves Lewis Libby , Wolfowitz former student and PNAC author .
Now Libby did not go on trial for the Niger forgeries that back story was left out but he did go to trial and got convicted for four of the five charges against him and Bush just commuted his sentence .
Libby we discovered got his orders from higher up .
Libby of course was part of the Office of Special Plans .
Libby 's scandal is complex , please see the above links and listen to my radio interviews 1 and 3 to get into it further .
In Libby 's trial the mask of the media and just how deep its relationships with government officials is was really exposed .
Of course there was Judith Miller who had to sit in jail for 85 days before Libby cracked and confessed .
She was from the New York Times writing lies about Iraq as explained above , there was also Tim Russert of NBC , Mathew Cooper of Time , and Robert Novak of CNN .
Interestingly CNN's head anchor Blitzer was an AIPAC employee the Israeli lobby who has officials on trial for spying on the US out of the office of Douglas Fieth through Larry Franklin who was at the SISMI meeting with Ledeen and his Iran Contra goons when the Niger forgery documents ( which Plame 's team could possibly reveal as false and even trace given that Plame 's husband Joe Wilson had already stated the claims were false ) were passed down via the British to Bush 's speeches .
Lewis " Scooter " Libby was Dick Cheney 's Chief of Staff ( now resigned after his indictment ( which I predicted long before it happened ) .
He was also a presidential adviser .
Libby was a lawyer for 15 years for the billionaire " commodities trader " Marc Rich , a fugitive that Bill Clinton gave a pardon to the last hour he was in Office as President .
Libby is also among the Republican perverts crowd writing fictional books about underage Japanese girls getting forcefully raped by a bear in a cage , among other disgusting things I see no point in repeating .
This kind of work actually fit perfectly with his client Marc Rich if you know about him .
That story is rather interesting and it's in my book , but that 's too big a tangent for now .
Seriously , there is something deeply wrong with these people .
Remember that Libby was a PNAC author of Rebuilding America 's Defenses , lies about anthrax , lies about WMDs , leaked information about the CIA , was a lawyer for the Mossad and a Iran Contra agent , was Cheney 's right hand man and after all that he just got his sentence commuted by Bush .
That decision was supported by all the Republican primary contenders other than Ron Paul .
It was as if the administration just gave him a green light to do whatever he needed to do to create a case for a war and whatever he needed to do to cover their tracks .
They told him you just break whatever laws you want and the President will protect you .
The case is we have yet another predominate PNAC author who was central in creating the war with Iraq by using the same lies that were undeniably written by this same group years prior to 911 .
Let 's pause from PNAC for a bit and analyse some different " funny business . "
Why was Jac k Abramoff , the Zionist criminal lobbist , paying for congressmen 's trips to visit the sex slavery market .
We know other high ranking Republicans knew about Mark Foley for months yet they did nothing .
I smell something Much deeper at work here .
Could Israel be blackmailing closet gay politicians ?
Yes .
After John David R. Atchison tried to have sex with a five year old on the heels of story of Senator Larry Craig trying to elicit homosexual sex in a men's airport bathroom , which followed the sicko Mark Foley sending sexually explicit e-mails to a 16 year old page boy , describing how the 16 year old cums , and of course let 's not forget Governor McGreevey sleeping with an Israeli national , I decided that it is time people take a look at the perverted sexual nature of Bush Administration Syndicate in general for they are one messed up sexually dysfunctional family .
Please see this for a better break down of the Evangelists , the flight schools used in 911 , the Bushs and Abramoff who arranged trips for congressmen to islands known from sex slavery .
When one understands how deep the Mossad was in 911 and the flight schools and how Atta was spotted on Abramoff casino ships things start to break down with the religious right and how easily blackmailed these men can be with Israel almost literally holding them by the short hairs .
Let 's start with Ted Haggard .
he was the Holy Roller caught using crystalmeth and sleeping with a male prostitute was George Bush 's spiritual adviser and according to a documentary by Richard Dawkins , claimed on tape that he talked to the president about once a week on the phone .
Now let 's add Karl Rove Karl ( mc ) Rove was Bush 's former Key adviser hired Jeff Gannon a male prostitute through a fake media front they created , Talon News .
Gannon referenced referenced internal government memos regarding the Plame affair before they were public .
Remember that one of the leakers in the Plame Affair aside from Libby was Karl Rove .
So Two Bush advisers are or cavort with male hookers and his brother Neil was caught with prostitutes in Asia and his brother Jeb Bush with drug smugglers and is the brother - in - law to family convicted of rape and the bizzar case of sexual molestation of a baby .
What is wrong with these people ?
Speaking of the other Plame - gate leaker , Lewis Libby , he wrote a book about underage Japanese girls not only being raped by men but also a bear .
These private mercenary groups like Blackwater ( which Feilding is a lawyer for and Joseph Schmitz is an executive ) and Dyncorp have been busted in the targeting of civilians and yes human trafficking .
Congress and the Senate continue to grant them money anyway but then again our congressmen and Senators are caught up in plenty of their own pervert sex scandals .
Just what do these men DO down at the Grove ?
Reminds me of the Franklin Credit Union affair .
Remember Mary Kay Letourneau you know the woman who got pregnant after raping her 13 year old student ?
She is the sister of Joseph E. Schmitz who is a conservative lawyer , former Inspector General of the Department of Defense and executive with Blackwater USA .
It was Joseph Schmitz who undoubtably just turned a blind eye to the various profiteering rings in the DoD and the countless abuses of Bremer 's butchering of Iraq and immunities granted to mercenary / terrorist groups engaged in war crimes there .
His other brother is John P. Schmitz who was George Bush 's White House counsel before being replaced by Fred Feilding ( now Bush 's personal lawyer ) who was on the 911 commission and is also a lawyer for Blackwater .
Feilding is helping blackewater cover up why 4 of their men were burned and hung on a bridge in Fallujah .
The families want to why it happened but Blackwater is not talking .
John P. Schmitz was also involved with Iran Contra back when he was an aid for Bush the first , and he refused to testify to the Walsh Commission .
What a messed up family .
So we have a rapist , a inspector general who is the executive of a secretive mercenary group and a the former White House counsel who was replaced by a Blackwater lawyer who just so happened to also be on the 911 and is George Bush 's personal lawyer as well .
The Schmitz 's family father another ' John ' John G. Schmitz was a Senator and congressman from California .
He was famous for his right - wing views and occasional racist and homophobic remarks .
His public career was ended when it was revealed that he had an affair and fathered two illegitimate children .
He got in trouble after his 13 month old son ( of his mistress ) was found with hair wrapped around his penis .
I think that explains why his other legitimate children are so messed up .
Just to get in this guys head , he bought the house of his hero Joseph McCarthy ( Who I call a modern version of witch trial like fear mentality for the insanely religious ) .
Brother of Geroge Bush , Jeb Bush married a woman named Columba .
Columba ’s sister is married to John P. Schmitz .
Jeb Bush and John P. Schmitz are brother in laws .
John and Joseph were both law clerks .
Joseph was a clerk for the Neocon James Buckley the brother of the famous neocn William F. Buckley founder of the Neocon magazine the National Review .
More connection to the media and the government .
So it is not really shocking given the sexually dysfunctional / criminal background of this hollyroller family that they would be involved with Abramoff and Jeb and Hoffman who are people involved with the drug trade , bizzar sex affairs and top Christian evangelist .
No one they run a private army that shoot civilians enjoys torture especially sexual torture and make a game out of running cars off the road in Iraq .
have a look at this source .
Abramoff was a Zionist lobbyist busted paying for trips for congressmen to visit the Mandarin Islands [ such as Delay ] .
I HAD a youtube video about that but it has been censored .
There are some sketchy things there involving child prostitution .
Quote : " Dick and Betsy DeVos donate huge sums of money to Republican candidates and causes .
In the 2004 cycle , the couple ranked fifth among the highest political donors with $ 981,846 to Republicans .
In fact , from 1990 through 2006 , the couple donated $ 2,491,270 to Republicans with only $ 1,000 going to Democrats back in 1992 . "

What you can see hear is that part of the financial base for these kooks are the very same people getting employed by the Department of Homeland Security of Lieberman and Spector which was created a long with the pre-written Patriot Act during the duress of anthrax attacks on the congress .
Why are the PNAC Neocons so tied to private militaries as well as defense contractors ?
Boeing and Blackwater to Perle , Northrop Grunman to Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith who is their attorney .
Feith is also the managing attorney for the law firm Feith and Zell based in Israel also served as a contracting firm dealing with the lucrative no -bids coming out of Iraq , naturally they hooked up their friends .
His partner Marc Zell is an Israeli Settler , so obviously a die hard Zionist with no love for Iraq .
I am not the only one talk about this Cabal .
Andreas von Bulow the former German Defense Minister said on the Alex Jones show April 21 , 2006 that this false flag operation [ 911 ] had to be carried out by a very small group of people .
Alex asked him 100 ? 40 ?
He said less than that .
Right after the second break ( which on the QuickTime bar would be right in line with Andreas von Bulow 's right ear )
Alex talks about the picture getting more clear as the truth about the wars come out .
He then talks about the 25 Neocons who wrote PNAC were in high positions in the DOD and white house , and Andreas von Bulow says " sure and part of them wrote the government program for Benjamin Netanyahu ... ( Former Prime Minister of Israel ) .
Alex goes on to say who could have done this ?
Bulow says it was not the CIA and Alex jumps in saying your talking about black ops .
Then Alex says we know only a MAJOR STATE could have carried this out .
Andreas says it must have been done from high up and it had to be done by a few people .
Alex says would you say 100 - 200 , AVB says less , Alex asks , " 50 people ? "
And AVB says less .
Maybe Alex can not say it was the Zionists on the air .
But he sure was hinting at it .
Well I have just been telling you who the Neocons who wrote PNAC and were embedded in the DOD were .
They are the Zionist cabal .
Their aim is to increase the wealth and power of the MIC and the flag ship of the MIC right now is Israel .
Bush and his merry band of sadistic Zionists would like to blame shift the responsibility of the WMDs myths to the CIA .
Well as evil and corrupt as the CIA is , it is not that sloppy .
Bush did not just get " mistaken intelligence " or make " miscalculations " he explicitly asked for fabrications .
Here is the concrete proof that they lied .
One of Bush 's claims about Iraq was that Saddam was trying to acquire yellow - cake uranium from Africa .
This rhetoric was further laced in fear by Neo-condelsleeza
Rice saying we could not let the smoking gun be a mushroom cloud .
What outrageous audacity , ( they are even re-using the same fear - mongering excuses to attack Iran ) they were dead wrong as George Tenet ( head of the CIA at the time of 911 ) would later have to admit .
Well the document that Bush based this claim on was a fake !
How do we know ?
Because the signature on it was forged !
How do we know ?
Because the forgers put down the wrong person 's name !
The Foreign minister from Niger , the country they were claiming Saddam was gathering uranium from , who supposedly signed it had been out of power since 1989 !
Allele Elhadj Habibou was not in power at the time of the supposed signature .
Look here I have the primary documents and a summary .
Think of it as the dilemma of 24 .
In the TV thriller , hero Jack Bauer has 24 hours to avert a catastrophe - say , to prevent terrorists detonating a nuclear bomb over Los Angeles .
Over the course of 24 hour - long episodes we urge Bauer , from the edge of our seats , to do whatever it takes to stop the killers .
As we watch , our nerves taut , there is no ethical corner we do n't want Bauer to cut , if that 's what he has to do to prevent murder and mayhem .
In one series , our man cuts off the head of a villain with a hacksaw - and we 're glad he 's done it .
That 's fiction , but it seems a version of Jack Bauer syndrome operates in real life too .
Almost three - quarters of us are happy to give up civil liberties in order to make us safer from terrorist attack , according to Monday 's Guardian / ICM poll .
Having seen the all - too - real threat of the July bombings , 73 % are ready to pay the price , ready to let our protectors do whatever has to be done .
That will bring cheer to Tony Blair , whose parting words before he left for his Barbados holiday were a declaration that " the rules of the game are changing " , accompanied by an aggressive 12 - step programme for combating terror .
Since then the government has been consulting on some of those steps and later this week , perhaps tomorrow , Charles Clarke will announce what action he plans .
If our poll is right , and Jack Bauer syndrome really does apply , he will face little public resistance .
But perhaps he should .
For the trouble with a 24 approach to policy - making is that it relies too heavily on the gut - and too little on the head .
Start with Blair 's first step , the deportation of the small number of foreign nationals deemed to be fostering hatred or advocating political violence .
Some of these " preachers of hate " - the men who praise the killers of 9/11 and 7/7 as " magnificent " - would be kicked out of the country , never to return .
Good riddance , says the 24 viewer in each of us .
Then we think practically for a moment .
Given that terrorism is a global business , are we that much safer if a hatemonger is moved abroad rather than here ?
Would n't it be better if he were out of circulation altogether and behind bars ?
Deportation simply relocates the problem ; it does not solve it .
The principled objection centres on the nature of the countries in which these extremists would be dumped : Jordan , Egypt , Algeria , Morocco and Tunisia , places where the newly arrived expellee from Britain could expect to be greeted by the torturers of the local secret police .
Who cares , says Bauer .
Maybe a little pressure on the bad guys will get them to talk .
But most of us , on reflection , do not really believe that .
We draw the line somewhere - and that somewhere is state - sanctioned torture .
Our own Human Rights
Act bars us from sending anyone to face such a fate .
The government has got round that by asking receiving countries to sign " memoranda of understanding " , promising to respect the human rights of any deportees .
Clarke says we can rely on those promises just as we trust the US when it says it wo n't execute people it extradites from Britain .
To see any difference between , say , Egypt and the US is , insists Clarke , " latter - day imperialism " .
But Liberty , the human rights advocacy group , points out a key difference .
The US admits it implements the death penalty ; its policy is entirely in the open .
None of the countries on Blair 's list admits it practises torture ; so what value is a commitment from a foreign government to refrain from doing something it denies in the first place ?
Blair also wants action on homegrown " preachers of hate " , those who can not be deported .
They will be put under control orders - facing curfews , wearing electronic tags , their use of telephones and the internet restricted and their right to meet others curbed .
Given what some of these hardliners believe , my heart will hardly bleed if they now find it a bit harder to log on to killallwesterners.com .
But whether I sympathise with such people is not the issue .
The trouble with control orders is that they are too harsh on the innocent and too soft on the guilty .
For the former , they count as a form of punishment without trial .
For the latter , a control order can only slow down a determined terrorist from doing his worst .
The solution is obvious .
If the authorities suspect someone is involved with terrorism , that person should be prosecuted and jailed .
Too tricky , says the government ; we can't get the evidence .
But if that 's the problem , then we need to change the rules on what counts as admissible evidence - allowing wiretap transcripts , for example , as most other countries already do .
If the suspect has not yet done anything wrong , but it 's feared he might , then stalk his every move .
Put him under 24 - hour surveillance until we know what he 's planning - and then charge him .
But that costs big money , says the government .
No problem , take the money out of the black hole that is identity cards .
The key point here , and it applies to almost all of Blair 's 12 - step programme , is that while these new plans might give us a brief , Bauer - style rush of blood , they are either misguided or unnecessary .
If they 're not wrong in principle , they 're wrong practically , or where they 're right , their objectives could be met just as well by laws we already have .
So Blair wants to crack down on those guilty of " justifying or glorifying terrorism " .
That will be tricky - unless he plans on prosecuting his wife for saying Palestinian suicide bombers had " no choice but " to kill Israeli civilians .
Or perhaps he fancies the prospect of a show trial starring George Galloway .
What Blair surely wants to get at is incitement to terrorist acts - and that 's already against the law .
Blair 's programme includes a ban on hardcore Islamist organisations such as Hizb - ut Tahrir and al - Muhajiroun .
I oppose everything that these groups stand for - but I feel the same way about the BNP , and no one is calling for it to be banned .
Democracy forces you to accept that even the most repulsive opinions have a right to be aired somewhere .
Besides , what quicker way to turn these fringe extremists into heroes than by declaring them off limits ?
Closing down mosques deemed hotbeds of extremism is similarly wrong - headed .
That will alienate the very Muslim community whose cooperation the police and intelligence agencies need so badly .
The sight of a dawn raid on a house of worship , police armed with padlocks , will confirm every lurid extremist claim about a state war on Islam .
Again , anyone guilty of incitement can be charged under existing law .
Almost all of the Blair proposals are like that - superficially appealing , but on closer inspection either flawed or unnecessary .
This is a minefield , one we all need to step through carefully .
This is not TV , this is real life - and it's much more dangerous .
